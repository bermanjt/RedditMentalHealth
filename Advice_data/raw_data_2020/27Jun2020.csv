0,"So uh, I never really knew what I am based on my sexual orientation and was never exepert at determining it either.
Basically, I like both man and woman but the act of sex doesn't turn me on.
What do I classify as?",27Jun2020,1
1,"Me and my mom are relatively close. We share a lot of stories between each other and I consider ourselves friends, almost best friends at times. She's of course my mom, and I pride myself with our relationship because I know some people aren't in good relationships with their mothers. After having spent many years of hearing her stories of abusive relationships and bad men she dated, even stories that tied into why or how she got with certain men I had grown rather cautious of her dating habits. 

As she is now separated from her current husband, she began to act differently around the house. You know the typical dating habits that most people have with people texting them. I didn't find it bad, instead I found it good. However, the only thing that bothered me was when she would tell me the stories of these men. She would gossip about how a lot of them were overtly sexual, how a lot of them have trauma, how they are odd or obsessive, even some who were clearly predators. She talked about them, and one in particular she discussed how she met at a store. Initially I didn't find the story wrong, in fact it was kind of funny/cringy. However, when she discussed with me how perverse the guy was, my problem started there. 

Despite all of her teachings of how bad it is to associate with overtly sexual people, she was maintaining conversation with this guy. I didn't tell her to not talk to him, nor advise such. She began to meet up with the guy, and hang out with him more and more over time. I grew concerned today when he and her unexpectedly came home together. Mind you I have other young siblings that are used to seeing her ex-husband home rather than some other guy(especially the youngest who is 4). When my mom announced to me that the perverted guy was here, I lost my shit. I was pissed off over the fact that she brought him to our house, because as far as I knew he was a creepy pervert. 

My mom tried to tell me that her other friend checked him out and that he was okay. I didn't buy it because like many of her grieving stories other friends misjudged this abusive person. So my trust is still not so high, let alone I even bothered to entertain the idea that he was a decent human being. He came into the house, and I pulled myself to the side. I spoke loud enough for him to hear that he was a pervert and that she shouldn't have brought some strange man in the house. 

I know,I'm her child. I dont have a right to try to get angry over these things. I tried to talk to her when she sent him home, but even then she gave me the ""I'm my own person and you can't advise me or tell me what I do is wrong because it's for what I decide."" Sort of talk afterwards. I just want to know what I can do to help myself in this situation, as I see that no word I say will get through to her.

2,"Quick story, I used to hang around with a few friends from high school who were very close to me. In the last 1-2 years I’ve not been hanging around with them often as I started to feel self conscious and anxious when going out so most of the time when they arranged to meet up I said I can’t. Fast forward to today and now they don’t even invite me anymore and when I look at their social media that they were hanging out it always makes me feel jealous. Self consciousness and anxiety has caused this but I don’t know what to do anymore. Any advice?",27Jun2020,1
3,"For some background info: my friend has a bad habit of buying animals as gifts without having a back up plan if the person doesn't want it. First of all she bought me a ferret- I in no way wanted one, and now I'm stuck with him for the next 8-10 years. I've bonded a lot with him though, and he suits me really well as he's a very unsually calm ferret and abnormally chilled out- he will happily sit in your arms all day without moving an inch. But then I had to get a pal for him for when I'm gone during the day, and his pal is more typically ferret-like (aka, a riot). But that's fine, I can deal with them and have friends who can babysit them when I'm travelling etc etc.

On to the cat- she got my a kitten (at the start of UK lockdown) and I really, really dislike it. Don't get me wrong, I'd kill anyone who hurt the little thing, but I just really don't gel with her personality. I'm a dog person, and really don't like cats to begin with, and this cat is especially cat-like in being aloof and antisocial. But the worst part is she loves to pounce on me and tear my hands and arms to shreds- people keep asking me if I'm self harming. I feel like I can't get rid of her because it would be unfair, she's settled into her new home and I don't want to disrupt that, but I really can't see myself being responsible for her for the rest of her life. And even if I did try rehome her, it's lockdown, I wouldnt know where to go. I won't give her to a rescue centre either, I'm not comfortable giving her away unless I know shes going to a secure home. I just feel like I'm stuck with her and I really don't like her- it'd be different if she was friendly and nice to be around, but she just isnt. I know hardly anything about cats and we just don't get along, I'm so lost for what to do. 

(I've spoken to my friend and theres to be no more animal gifts in future).",27Jun2020,1

10,"This is probably like 100000th post about making friends on this subreddit but here we go. I can't make friends no matter how hard I try. It really seems like people only contact me when they need something from me and I really don't expect anything in return from them. I always text first and I always make initial moves cause if I don't, no one would talk to me. The same thing happens at work too. No one is interested in talking to me and when they do, it's always work related. I always hear that people at work text and send snaps to each other. I'm just like why can't I be their friends? What am I doing wrong? I always try to stay positive, I always listen to people when they need to be heard and I don't smell. What on earth am I doing wrong? I sometimes lie about having friends so I wouldn't seem like a loser. This has been going on for many years and this literally has resulted in me dipping my toes in literally everything like I learned how to play musical instruments, play sports, dance, sing, taken art classes and many more. I only did those things so I would seem interesting to people. Even with all effort to be around people, no one takes me seriously. I just want one friend just one friend who would have my back. That's all I'm asking for. I'm so tired of being alone all the time. I just want what everyone has. I wanna go on trips with people, do secret Santa, throw surprise birthday parties, host movie nights, dinner parties, etc just simple things like that.

12,"I lost a bunch of my friends the past two years. I’m the kind of friend who’s chill, introvert, easy going but if there’s something on my mind, I’m not afraid to be straight up about it. As friends, wouldn’t you want someone to tell it how it is?

Anyway, this one girl in our group became bitter and angry (specifically towards me even though everyone else was involved) and threatened to kill me/want me dead/key my car, etc etc. Shes the type to hold a grudge even though she knows she’s wrong too. All my other friends in the group didn’t say anything about it. Didn’t defend me because it wasn’t their problem (but they were all part of it). She blocked all of us but then recently unlocked everyone but me. Now they’re planning another trip together after reminiscing on a trip we all did together 3 years ago. Why couldn’t my friends in the middle just be like “hey, make up already”? Easier said than done I guess. 

I know I’m not perfect but I try to be the best friend that I can be. I’m always a call away. I’m always going out of my way to bring them into my home for them to vent. For them to call me late nights if they need me to drive over and lend an ear. I was selfless. I did my part and apologized. Yet I ended up to be portrayed as the manipulative b*tch. 

So now they’re planning a trip, didn’t even include me. And I feel so dumb trying to reminisce about something that they’ve talked about without me. 

And now I have no one. Now I’m starting to think that maybe I was the bad person. But I never swore or wished death upon any of them at all.

13,"I’ll make it as short as I can. A friend of ours (meaning my husband and I) was redoing our kitchen and bathroom. Everything was going just fine. But then coronavirus happened...The combination of so much change and stress...Not to mention being laid off and having nowhere to go...It was just my husband and I and our friend working on our house day in and day out. 

One day I just lost it on him. I was frustrated and the job was taking too long and the lines between friendship and working relationship were becoming blurry. I honestly can’t remember what I said, but it resulted in me telling him that we’d finish the rest on our own. He gave us some money back because we have paid him for some work that he wasn’t going to end up doing and we parted ways. 

I was completely out of line. I took my stress and frustrations out on him. I fucked up. I went back and forth about reaching out and apologizing but at the end of the day I’m stubborn and I’m not proud of that, especially right now.

15,"Hey guys, I hope to have someone give me some advice here. 

So today my landlord called me to her office (apartment complex), and I thought it was for me to renew my lease. She took out some papers and showed me a mugshot of a man that is a sex offender in another state. I asked her what does this have to do with me? She said this person has the same name as you other than the middle names but the middle names start with the same letter. 

Again I asked her what does this have to do with me? She said that when running my social this came up. I told her that can’t be as this has never happened. She said yeah but it did. So she requested that I contact my local police department to “clear my name” so I can continue residency here. I became upset and hurt that I have to go and clear my name when I have nothing to do with that. I then contacted my local police department and they explained to me how a mishap from her end could happen. 

I told that officer I did not know other than the fact because my name is similar, I am now being asked to personally and go and procure a background check and then present this to my landlord as evidence I have no relation to said sex offender. I felt hurt and feel that because my name is similar my landlord has raised an assumption of me and my character. 

Now I called a lawyer but will not hear from them until next week. I feel like if I were to refuse, they may retaliate by terminating my lease and not renewing it. I’ve been sad all since this happened and would like to know if I am right in feeling the way I am, and would there be any reason for my to pursue charges?

17,"I work as a massage therapist in a physical therapy office. We have one room with a bunch of curtained off ""bays"". Often there are many conversations going at the same time and everyone can hear each other.

Today I had a patient who, out of nowhere, started bringing the conversation to uncomfortable and inappropriate subjects. 

First she starts with complaining about the coronavirus and all the laws put in place and how wearing a mask makes her anxious and the government is taking away our rights and blah blah blah. 

I was giving very short responses and tried to sound as uninterested as possible. The woman was talking incessantly and I could barely say anything as it was.

Then she, again out of nowhere, goes off about how shes tired of hearing about all this race crap and everyone is making a big deal out of nothing and how her kids (teenagers) didn't even know about race until all this and how she wished everyone would just shut up about it (ironic considering how she couldn't shut up about it!) At one point she goes, ""It wouldn't even be a problem if people didnt talk about it. It would just go away"" like what the fuck lady that not how it works at all! 

I was so frozen by the awkwardness of the situation that I couldn't really say anything. I WISH I could have brought myself to say ""I really dont want to talk about this"" or something that would have shut her down but I didnt I just froze and stammered and I feel so ashamed because of it! Luckily one of my coworkers asked me about my cat (something we do when we hear someone stuck in a bad conversation.) And that was the end of it.

Another coworker who was in the bay next to me who happens to be black heard the whole thing and got very upset. She had to go to the back and collect herself because she was so mad she was shaking. 

After that patient left and I had a free moment I sat down with her because I wanted to hear her perspective. I told her that I literally didn't know what to do and I hoped that it didnt sound like I was agreeing with of encouraging the womans behavior. She said she understood that I was in an awkward position and she wasnt mad at me but I still feel like shit..

My heart is filled with compassion and love for all living things. I practice bhakti yoga and try my best to serve all with a loving heart, but today I failed.

i live in a small condo that has no backyard, no garage, and no space for a large work bench.  i have a small patio, about 8 x 4 feet.  my desk is mostly used for computer/office use, so i dont want to drill holes / bolt a vise to it.  

the solutions i've come up with include:  

* buy a [sawhorse](https://www.harborfreight.com/two-piece-foldable-saw-horse-set-41577.html) and bolt a larger vise to it
* buy a [small(ish) work bench](https://www.harborfreight.com/60-in-4-drawer-hardwood-workbench-63395.html) that fits the patio  
* drill my desk and bolt the larger vise, then remove it later (unfortunately, this makes somewhat of a mess indoors and leaves large holes in my desk)

22,"I feel nauseous after eating. I did on tuesday when I ate leftover chinese (I puked a little after some struggle to keep it down), I felt nauseous yesterday, and I emptied the entire contents of my stomach this afternoon after eating thoroughly nuked homemade leftovers from the fridge followed by half a burger. That was really fun. I drank a lot of water afterwards and just ate the fries and I feel ok now.

I haven't been eating normally. Sometimes I get up and it's 2pm before I eat anything. I'm really low energy and I do nothing during the week so I feel okay. I just sleep or watch shows or text or worry about my life. Sometimes that's the only meal that I eat. I do get hungry, but the hunger kind of fades sometimes and I'm not really that interested in food. That's been the case for a while. I think it got worse after I stopped smoking weed 4 weeks ago. Maybe I just ate too much today (I ate the leftovers and the burger like 30 mins apart) but I felt nauseous when I started eating the leftovers today too. Idk.

What Do I Do? Why is this happening to me? I'm not having a good go of it today.

Maybe I just need to start eating small snacks and making small meals rather than eating a lot of leftovers and takeout in one sitting?",27Jun2020,1
23,"Hello! I'm going to preface this by stating this might be a long post, but I also feel the need to vent somewhere, as well as some potential advice :D There is a TL;DR at the bottom of this.

Ever since my conception, my mom has been a cigarette smoker. She has ""quit"" a few times in the past but she has never actually stopped. I've experienced second hand smoking my entire life, and as of right now I'm turning 18 next month. The smoking hasn't deterred me from creating a relationship with my mom when I was young but as I got older and understood more, I've distanced myself from her intermittently. Upon starting high school the cigarette smoking has taking a toll on me, and my clothes. I was made fun of for putting on ""too much cologne"" or literally smelling like cigarettes. Which I don't let get to my head but has caused me to not be able to form relationships with people strictly because of that. I've been treated differently because of it and to add to this, my school is roughly 85% white with the rest Hispanic/Black/Asian/etc. I fall under the Hispanic category which gives them more of an incentive to not associate with me.

Starting my sophomore year, my mother moved to a city outside of my state but borders it closely. In this travel, I moved there as well which now put me 45\~ minutes away from my school and even farther for a majority of my friends. My method of getting home would be either her picking me up as soon as the bell rang, or taking the train home. I opted to take the train a lot because I value my mental health (as well as physical) when it comes to just living life. I didn't want to go home every day at 3:00 PM just because my mom wanted me to. I was in high school and I wanted to at least do some things that allowed me to feel human as opposed to coming home to a computer and allergies all day. If I wanted to stay out, occasionally she would fixate her schedule around my day, but this was seldom and as a result of it being seldom, it limited what extracurricular activities I wanted to because trains have a cost too! (3.50$ one way)

My workaround to not obeying when my mom wanted me to go home would be that I would stay at a number of relative's houses and occasionally a friend's house (while lying and saying to my mom that I was at a relative's.) How I managed to pull this off was that I would always carry two backpacks, one for school, and one for clothes/toothbrush/non-perishables/utensils. Every week or so, I would go my mom's house, get my clothes, fold them like a fucking origami master and fit as much as I could into both bags. I would do this and after every school day I would ask to stay at a cousin's house or brother's and I would popcorn off of everyone's houses. After I've exhausted all my clothes or couldn't get them washed (handwash or laundry), I would go back to my mom's house just to rinse and repeat.

Come junior year I meet one of my best friends who allows me to expand on my life just a bit. Me and him stay after school to play basketball and the plot twist is that this guy has a car. He gets to take me to a relative's house or at times, the train station. This is great because I finally get to do things at my leisure (to an extent). This friend has also let me stay at his house a few times during the school week when my other relatives did not let me. He's actually saved me from sleeping overnight on benches a few times. I will forever remember that and I will eternally thank him and his parents for that.

But anyways here is where a huge fallacy in my mom's logic occurs, but to keep this from being ""too long"" I will give a tl;dr on this section in particular. Half of my family lives in the DR while the other half lives here. My mom saw a job opportunity there and decided to move there for about seven months and leave me here with someone to take care of me. That being my brother, but then my aunt and cousin.

She was out from roughly the middle of junior year to February of now. She gave the responsibility of me to my aunt and I moved into my aunt's house. I got a bed, my computer, xbox, less cigarette smoke, no hoarding, no allergies, and moved really close to school and friends. I felt free for a bit until realizing the fact that my mom literally left me for a job in another country and gave the responsibility of me to my aunt. This thought has haunted me for days on end and has been the source of my sadness for quite a while. It doesn't get to me while I'm doing menial things, but it does come up when I'm just laying on my bed staring at the ceiling in complete darkness at 3AM.

I don't really like my aunt and her son all that much but I do respect and love them.

Ever since my mom came back, she has asked me to move back and I always budged with a no. She kept asking and asking and would stay at my aunt's house for an extended period of time just to see me (even if it was for a bit). My aunt (her sister) and growing to not like each other and something horrific happens in the near future.

Come sometime in May, all of the aunts that live in the U.S. are playing bingo downstairs. I'm watching my cousin play Valorant on my computer while his mom comes in and says, ""hey verdict89's cousin, lets go."" He says ""why right this very moment, I'm in a game."" She insists on leaving and whilst she is insisting, we hear a loud screaming downstairs. My cousin sprints downstairs and so do I but my fatass doesn't have a shirt on. There is wine spilled every where and my four aunts are violently screaming at each other. One thing leads to the next and the aunt I reside with grabs her wine glass and tries to impale my mother with it. The glass isn't broken, but with enough force, **glass is glass**. One of my cousins thankfully restrains her and no one is injured. This debacle started because all of my aunts have this secret vendetta towards my mom about the fact that she doesn't know how to raise a child and apparently one of the solutions is to attempt and kill her. .My brother wasn't here at the time but he comes later that night and we talk about what happened and what is the best move for me. My mom call me later that night and tells me to gather all my shit and go with her to move back with her. This hoarder-esque, cigarette smelling, and privacy-invading small apartment that I used to live in. (Where I used to take the train to). 

I thought about this for a while and about a week ago I decided to move back, not because I enjoy being here, but because I feel bad for my mom. I've given her all the reasons I don't want to be here prior to moving in and she still insists that I come, so I did. I had the option of staying at the house I used to stay at (which is what I prefer) but I'm not sure which is the better decision. My mom basically put guilt on me by saying that ""You should at least move in here for a few months before you start college because you're moving there anyways.""

There is a bunch of things that I left out and if anyone does see this, if you leave a comment or question, I'll respond. 

Should I have stayed with my aunt or did I make the correct decision? She did leave me to stay with my aunt for a job so what should I think? What could I have done better? What is the better outcome?

TL;DR My mom convinced me to move in with her regardless of the situations she has put me through. I moved in with her to not make her feel bad but I'm pondering if I put myself in a worse situation by doing so.

24,"sorry for the long post ahead. a little background: october 2019 i met this guy. let’s call him “bob”. i was in a really crappy relationship and he was there for me all the way - as a friend, at least -. fast forward to the end of this relationship, november, i attempt suicide. was in the er for about a week and the psych ward for about three. after that relationship he stuck by my side all the way. now i’m back in school and i kind of hook up with this other guy “tom” once or twice. during tom &amp; i’s relationship, bob takes me out shopping or something every weekend. it’s the most loved i’ve felt since my attempt. after breaking it off with tom, bob makes his move. now it’s about mid-january and it’ll be the first relationship i’ve been in since november. i reluctantly agree and we have the best three months of my life. i fell, hard, for bob. now it’s the middle of april and i start using again because my life has slipped in to a darker place. bob sticks with me until one of tom’s friends invites me for a night out. i didn’t know this until he showed up, but tom was also invited to this hangout. he tries to make a move on me (in front of his friends) so i text bob and tell him i love him in front of tom so he’d back off. both tom and i are intoxicated at this point and bob knows. a day later, i get sent to a rehab facility. i call bob every day from there. the day before i leave, he calls me and asks if tom was there that night i told him i loved him. i said yes. this was a big mistake on my part, not telling him earlier. the day after i get out of rehab, he breaks up with me. he’s convinced i cheated on him. i get hospitalized yet again for mental health reasons and haven’t texted him since. it’s been two months and i’ve been clean from both drugs and self harm. i’m still not over bob and i won’t be for a while. i feel like what we had ended over a stupid mistake that i made, and that we could’ve been so much more. i keep asking for signs but at the end of the day, i have no idea if i should reach out or not. so being me, i turn to you - reddit. sorry for this absolute novel but please help me if you can.",27Jun2020,1
25,"Hi everyone! I’m planning on taking a gap year this year so I can save up money and successfully move out without having to pay for my tuition. 

I plan on working 30-35 hours a week and volunteering somewhere or even travel my surrounding states (I’m in New England). I’m turning 21 in November and would like to gain more freedom and independence from my parents. I am fairly financially stable, I have savings that will last me 2-3 months when I move out.

28,"I am a freshman in high school and me and my friends like to gather at this kind of hidden area at our local zoo. It’s a great friend group and we always have a decent time. This time however was not. We got together and this one girl that I have been friends with since the beginning of middle school just starts shitting on me. She called me annoying, and not funny many times. Now I can take constructive criticism, but when you are just insulting me over and over and not even letting me talk to you it can upset me. When I asked her why she was shitting on me she just once again said “because you are so fucking annoying” Ok this is where it gets kind of funny, she was taking a bunch of selfies and doing other shit with things like tik tok like a typical teenage girl, I don’t know why nobody has taught her to be more patient and nicer, but I decided I had to be the parent of the situation. I took her phone when she wasn’t looking and hid it somewhere that she wouldn’t find it, but there wasn’t a risk of it getting broken or stolen either. THIS GIRL had the biggest freakout I had ever seen about someone hiding their phone in a playful fashion. She threatens to hit me (she does muay thai or whatever so she thinks she is all that and has reminded me many times that she is not scared of me but I have never tried to make her scared.) and eventually she does. It doesn’t hurt. She kicks me it doesn’t hurt. She is also making the biggest fucking scene ever and threatens to call the cops while screaming “GIVE ME MY FUCKING PHONE” you would think she was about to be stabbed. She tried to keep hitting me so I say “calm down” and grabbed her hands and tried talking to her while she couldn’t hit me. She bites me. When I push her off just to get her off my shoulder (not to harm her I would never actually hit back) she scratches me. I know I should have just gotten the phone at this point, but I didn’t want her to keep thinking she could just get away with stuff. She then yells that her data is running out. My other friend goes and checks during the conflict (he helped) and said it’s not on. Eventually I just fucking give in because I have had enough. She has still yet to apologize for anything she did or said. She has me blocked currently. I have been struggling with mental health and have bad anxiety so being called annoying so much hurt I guess because I care what my friends think of me. I can’t contact her obviously because I am blocked, but I want to try to get some kind of apology out of her so business in the friend group can go as normal. Do I just stop being friends because I don’t need a friend like that, do I just man up and apologize for taking her phone and stomach the rest, or do I keep trying to get her to apologize?",27Jun2020,1

30,"Like, when I see young ugly people (especially women) all I can think of is how they must have always compared themselves to their peers, how they tried very hard to look good but they just didn't have the conventionally attractive bone structure or nose, what hardships they faced, how much they were unnoticed by people, how many more things will be denied them in the future, the nights they must have cried cursing the world for their genetics, maybe they have depression and suicidal thoughts because of it... etc.

We had many healthy conversations when we worked together and there were times I saw things from her perspective and times she understood things from mine.

Now that I no longer work with her, the only way we really stay ""in touch"" is via Facebook. For the last month since the BLM movement has been picking up steam, I read them most horrific posts on her page. The one I just read was frankly racist and down right ignorant. 
So many of my actual friends, that are in my ""liberal bubble"" have said things like ""I don't have time for racists and I just unfriend them."" In my heart, I feel like that's the right thing to do, but at the same time this woman has been there for me at some of my darkest hours. I'm just really torn and looking for some advice.

35,"Hey everyone. I’m starting off by saying I’m a 17 year old, my cousins and I are all girls. I’m the youngest, the second youngest is 19. She struggles a lot with mental health, has been suicidal in the past, and she’s extremely strong. However, she’s a immature for her age, if you really knew my family you’d understand why. 
Anyhow, she’s been with this guy for about 6 months now and they got engaged 4 months into their relationship. He’s 22 years old. 
Our family was pretty supportive, however we tend to stay in our business only unless they’re asking for advice on whether or not it’s a good idea. Then we give our two cents. 
Today she stopped by and told me that her and her fiancé are trying for a baby. They are not moved out of their parents house yet, they’re looking on the market for a town home. They are only supported by her fiancé, who makes on average $17 an hour as a plumber. 
I promised to tell her I wouldn’t tell my family, but I am genuinely scared as her cousin that this situation could turn out the way that they don’t expect. I’m afraid her mental health will completely shut down if they ever separated, and having a child in this picture is scary to me. It isn’t my business but it is when it involves safety of my family. 
I’m looking for advice on whether or not to tell my family before she does. If she continues trying for a baby, she will end up pregnant. If I told her mother right now, they may stop but nobody can stop teens when they have their mind set on something they believe is right.",27Jun2020,1

38,"I didn't realize this until later, but I had 'daddy issues' as a result of a turbulent childhood. My parents didn't love me, and at 7 I was shown porn and started masturbating. Instead of associating love with care and intimacy and respect, I associated love with sex. I never fit in at school and continued to use sex as my 'secret getaway.' I was disgusted with myself, but sex fantasies were the only things that made me feel loved.

Fast forward to when I'm 14. I meet a boy who admires my work ethic –– sees the good in me. Sees value in me, cares about me and is more emotionally available than my father ever was. I fall hopelessly in love with him...I look up to him, aspire to be like him...he becomes my role model. I imagine having sex with him and my heart swells with a warmth I've never felt before. Well, at 17 my life begins to fall apart. I lose the IB (international version of AP) program, my best friend backstabs me, and with my first D in chemistry my parents threaten to kick me out (I was also in cross country, marching band...they did eventually kick me out). I again turned to sex to recover. I started having sex with random guys on craigslist because they made me feel valued. 

Then –– a horrible thing happened. I reached out to the boy I loved from when I was 14. I asked him to hook up (didn't think I was good enough for a relationship with him)–– degraded myself, begged him to have sex with me. Joined the military and then followed him and ...he exploited me. He never slept with me, but he kept me on the back burner: made plans with me and stood me up, said he'd call and didn't, etc. I think he was punishing me for having been a disappointment to him. I didn't have self love/self respect and he was treating me as badly as I would tolerate. 

I loved him because I thought he loved me –– and I had to learn the hard way : he didn't love me. He emotionally abused me. If he loved me or cared about me, he would have dropped the situation and not have exploited me for his own ego gain. 

TLDR: I loved a guy because I thought he loved me –– and I had to learn the hard way : he didn't love me. He emotionally abused me. If he loved me or cared about me, he would have dropped the situation and not have exploited me for his own ego gain. I completely demeaned myself for him and lost my dignity miserably.

I went to Walmart and when I walked through the front door, there was a few people (like 3 and they weren’t really paying attention) waiting in line to get shopping carts. There was more carts in the line next to them with no one waiting, so I went to go get one of those carts. 

As soon as I skipped over to the other line some dude that was talking on his phone starting spouting off at the mouth with some shit about how I was entitled blah blah blah. So stated that there was another row of carts just walk around and grab one. He then started pushing me and being hyper aggressive. I kept my mouth shut and he walked away. 

He then hit me in the ass with the cart he grabbed while saying shit under his breath. I lost my cool for a second and flipped his cart and shoved him back. He started screaming that he was gonna fuck me up. Then I just turned around and walked away.

45,"Today I had a verbal conflict with a waiter in front of my boyfriend and I’m very embarrassed.

So my (24f) boyfriend (29m) and I are in a long distance relationship. After a breakup (we were still deciding whether dating long distance was possible, but we’ve decided to go full in) he came to visit me in my country, driving 6+ hours to come spend time together. 

After some nice days of camping, we decide to eat at an actual restaurant, instead of grilling outside. We were already starving when we sat down. We had the worst luck because after we ordered beers, a power outage happened and the kitchen was not taking any more orders until they could solve the issue. We sat and waited and waited but ultimately got so hungry we decided to walk to another restaurant. We were in the restaurant for about an hour.

After finally finding a free table and the other restaurant, we sit and make ourselves comfortable. The restaurant was super big and super busy. At this point we were still in a relatively good mood. We sat and waited to be seen by the waiters, but it felt as if no one was seeing us. We flagged a couple waitresses down, only to be told “my colleague will be with you shortly” but to our knowledge, they never contacted the colleagues. Then it starts to pour cats and dogs, which sort of added to the frustration. Since we weren’t offered a menu, I walk over to a station and grab it myself. 

Then, at this point we had been sitting for maybe 30-40 minutes. We start to get frustrated because no one has approached us to ask us for drinks or a menu. I start to get very focused on getting someone’s attention. 

I flag a guy down and motion towards the menu as if to say “we would like to order”. The guy makes a joke, that I didn’t take so well. He points to the water and makes sort of a sarcastic mocking face as if to say “I don’t want to get wet”. I turn to give my boyfriend a look in the eye as if to say “really?”. There were umbrellas but he was pointing to the gap between two umbrellas. The waiter comes over anyways. 

“So you didn’t like my joke, take it easy. You guys can afford to wait. What would you like to order?” I couldn’t focus on ordering because I got distracted by his tone. I mentioned to him that no, we can’t afford to wait because we’ve been waiting for more than half an hour and on top of this, we were at the other restaurant where there was a power outage. 

To be honest I sort of forget what exactly was said after this but it escalated very quickly and we both got very loud. He was basically butthurt I didn’t fake laugh at his joke, when I was trying to get just get someone’s attention. And I really disliked the sarcastic comment about “you guys can afford to wait a bit”. We have been!

I told him I wanted to speak to the manager because I didn’t like the way he was speaking to me and he told me he is the manager (we never really verified). I asked him (quite aggressively I must admit) if he will take our order or keep wasting our time. He aggressively took both the menus and said he doesn’t want to serve us. At this point we are very loud. I told him I don’t wish to argue anymore, but he stuck around instigating the conflict to continue. I ignored him because I really wanted to talk to my boyfriend before we got up to leave to figure out what our plan was after this. He eventually left and to my surprise my boyfriend was mad at me, instead of mad at the waiter.

The waiter, in my opinion, was a totally insensitive d*ck who got butthurt I didn’t laugh at his joke. After waiting for an hour and a half just to be able to order something to eat. My boyfriend was mad at me because at this point it was too late to start looking for another restaurant and it was still pouring rain. He told me I could’ve handled it better, which now after calming down I do agree. 

I believe I had a valid reason to dislike the waiter, but I just wish I could’ve handled the situation better. I’m not the kind of person that respects people of authority who abuse their power. Maybe it is because I have had a very abusive relationship with my estranged father. But moments like this one, aren’t scarce. Last month, I got a bullshit ticket from an officer, for something minor that could’ve simply been a warning. But because I chose to not kiss his ass and instead defend myself, he gave me the ticket. 

I would like to learn how to de-escalate these type of conflicts when they happen. Something at the pit of my stomach burns when I feel disrespected by someone in position of power. I am really embarrassed to have yelled like this in front of my boyfriend and I must admit it was selfish of me to ruin it for the both of us, even though the waiter was an ass. I also feel bad because this was our last full day together before he returns home and I feel like it was ruined because we couldn’t eat. 

I would like to come to a point where I can let the person know they are not being nice, while not having to kiss ass and not getting in a conflict such as this one.

Does anyone have any experience with de-escalating conflicts like these to avoid getting a ticket, for example or something similar. How do you defend yourself when you feel disrespected while still maintaining calm and not going ballistic.",27Jun2020,1

53,"So not quite a month ago my ex tried to strangle me. He wanted to kill me because to be totally honest I cheated on him. For the duration of our 2 year relationship he was emotionally, sexually, and financially abusive to me. He would go thru my phone almost daily, he would threaten to hit me if I didnt comply with what he wanted. It was just all around shitty. I started a new fulltime job a few months ago, and my one coworker and I started talking more, i told him about my situation and then he and i got involved with each other. My ex found out, and after he strangled and hit me i went to the police. So he was arrested and i have a PFA.  So after he was out of my apartment i started to talk with this coworker more, and I thought it was going well, he even said he was falling in love with me. I had specifically asked him if he had ever done anything with any of our other coworkers, he told me no. That was a lie tho, he lived with someone I work directly with, had some sort if brief encounter with another girl I work directly with, and got the job because he was dating a supervisor. So I naturally felt very used and lied to, I told him I no longer had romantic interest in him, but we might be able to be platonic friends and continue to work together. He agreed to that. Over last weekend he knew I was going out of town for the night, he asked me repeatedly if he could come too, I initially told him no. However when I got to my room I got very drunk, and he continued to ask, so I eventually let him come over. At first it was fine, but when I started to pass out he got in the same bed as me and started to grope me. I cried, hit him, begged him to stop, but he held me down leaving bruises and continued. I told my coworker who he use to date about what happened.  She gossiped about it and our boss heard that he assaulted me. So I had to file a report, which i hadn't decided if i really wanted to do yet or not. So now hes been suspended pending investigation, and i just feel like shit about life. I dont know how to cope with the emotions from all of this happening in such a short amount of time. I wish i could just stop existing.

54,"My neighbor asked to borrow my pesticide. I agreed, with conditions,  I  told her the right amount to use, pointing it out on the label, gave her access to PPE in case she didn't have any, I told her make sure she wore it, left all of the instructions and packaging that came with the insecticide and  advised her to read it, left a an additional pamphlet that gives all warnings. I provided more than enough guidance, and said several times it only takes a small bottle for the area she's spraying. 
She came to me after and told me she knows I told her to spray only this amount, but she decided that wasn't enough, so she went into my garage and used an entire gallon. Enough to cover my entire house 3 times over  Now her eyes are burning. She didn't use any of the PPE. She's claiming my insecticide is dangerous. 

I told her to go to the hospital and I reported the misuse to the appropriate places. You have to report to when there's an insecticide spill or an overuse.

Secondly, we have a cat that is terrified of other cats. If she even smells another cat, she flips the fuck out and gets extremely stressed.

The reason im not brushing this off as just neighbors being stupid, is because theyve confronted my mom a second time, and she is getting extremely irritated over it, because she obviously knows ive never pet their cat before.

67,"My husband T (42m) and I (39f) have been together 4.5 years, married 2. He was raised solely by his mother, Sally, being told a man named Jim was his dad. Jim is clearly black. Sally always claimed Jim was Cuban. When my husband was 19, Jim (who he saw maybe 1-2x a year - Jim left Sally when T was 3 and started a new family) sat him down and told him he didn’t know why Sally had always lied, but Jim is black. Grew up in deep south Alabama, and his grandparents had been slaves. My husband relayed this conversation to Sally, who was enraged and claimed Jim was lying and he’s Latino, was born in Cuba, and his parents moved here when he was 4-5. We found some old school records, and that’s factually incorrect. Jim is who and what he says he is. 

Jim is very dark skinned. My husband appears white, though tan. He looks sort of Greek. People ask me a LOT “what” he is, which I find odd because I don’t think there’s anything about his looks that would make you wonder more than any other tan person, but it’s happened a good deal. So two years ago my husband did an AncestryDNA test, and it said he was 90% European mutt, and 10% Nigerian. 0% Cuban or Latino. Given how dark Jim is, we now doubt Jim is actually my husband’s father, though I acknowledge it’s possible he just didn’t get much of Jim’s African ancestry. Jim’s two other children - with a pale, blonde woman like Sally - both appear biracial. My husband doesn’t, but again, I understand everyone gets their own mix.

Jim never bothered to come to a single birthday of my husband’s (growing up, he always claimed he couldn’t remember when it was - it’s the day after his own birthday), give him a Christmas present, or even a card. He didn’t come to graduation, never paid a penny of child support, didn’t bother replying to the invitation to my husband’s first wedding 15 years ago, and he’s never reached out to my husband since. My husband does want to know if someone else is his father - and frankly, hopes someone else is. He feels he could stop hating Jim if someone else was his dad and perhaps never even knew he existed. But he doesn’t want to reach out to Jim to ask him to take a test himself, since Jim has always disappointed him and has shown no interest in being in his life. My husband also doesn’t believe Jim would ever actually get around to taking he test and sending it in.

The clearest bad guy here, as far as I see it, is Sally. She MAY have lied about who T’s father is, and she definitely lied about Jim’s race, then called Jim a liar about his own race when cornered. 

Also, my husband was born in 1978, and his mother has always told him she lost his birth certificate (and stood by this claim when he needed it to get married 15 years ago). When he got a copy from the county, it has no father listed.

Sally has rage issues, and actually has two felonies for road rage incidents. Because of her rage, everyone in her family stopped speaking to her 20+ years ago, so she is my husband’s only family. She is also a profoundly unpleasant, mean person just day-to-day. Nonetheless, my husband doesn’t want to lose her and is unfair to upset her. We have a new baby, and I believe he deserves to know if he might have a grandfather out there (my father is dead). He deserves - at some point - to know more basic truths about T’s family than we currently know. 

Given that T is afraid of Sally, I believe the best path is still to ask Jim to take a test, or ask one of Jim’s other two kids to. My husband thinks it’s best to eventually go through Sally. It’s ultimately his call. But if anyone has any thoughts, alternatives, or anything else, we’d love to hear it. We’ve been thinking this over for almost two years now, and we keep hoping there’s some other option we haven’t considered.",27Jun2020,1

Hi im 17 years old and my mom and my dad are probably going to divorce. My mom knows that my dad has some girl he's been talking too for god knows how long and my mom didn't care because she says to him ""If you have a child with her, we done."" So my mom and dad confronted each other on the phone. 

My dad is 6 hours away from us. We own 2 businesses and he runs it and my mom runs the other one. My mom is tired all the time and has no time for herself. My dad is complaining how he does so much work and that he does more than my mom. My dad doesn't pay for anything, the bills, taxes, and all. My mom has to suffer from it and doesn't know what to do, shes in debt because of it and doesn't tell my dad because she says ""as an adult, you'll know when to help and the money to pay for bills and taxes.""

She is beginning to not give a fuck about anything of the business and says to me ""do you want another mother?"" and ""what are you going to do if you have another mother?"". I usually say ""i don't know"" but it seems through her actions, she is going too.

My dad is not giving a fucking shit.  He's here and giving his money to his GF who has 2 kids not from my dad. My mom got mad because my dad's spends a fuck ton of money and leaves the country to go back to PH. Now my mom knows why he spends so much money and where it is going too. She says to me ""your dad is giving money to her and helping her while im here tiring myself to put food on the table and pay the bills and your dad not asking to pitch in money to help out with the bills and taxes."" i don't know what to say anymore

My aunt from my dad side who is our go to family member for help or whatever. She heard about this and she starts to talk to us, (my cousin, mom, and myself). she asks questions about it and she says to my mom ""are you okay with this?"" my mom response was ""as long as he doesnt have a kid there."" Now my aunt called my dad when we were heading back home. My aunt told him that what he is doing and why do you have a GF. My aunt got emotional on the phone and she starts to tell him about family stuff.

Now I'm getting hurt from this. Im going to be a Junior this coming high school. I'm planning to pack my luggage and leave for a while. I have no friends, just acquaintances. I lost my close friend back in November due to miscommunication from me and it was my fault for this. I cannot stand this anymore and I have no one to talk to nor do i planned to. If this results into them divorcing. They'll soon to know the son they once had gone, vanished from their life. (not suicide) My dad will learn and take in losing their son. 

Im sorry for this. This is a problem in my family and I'm getting affected from it.",27Jun2020,1
72,"I grew up in a home where people are emotionally unavailable. Sure we are close and can joke around each other, but we don't talk about feelings. I have never seen my parents being affectionate with each other. They also never gave me a sit down talk. It's probably because they grew tired of the whole parental discipline thing since they have already been there with my older siblings (don't get me wrong, they still show their love through other means).

I also view relationship a job. There are so many responsibilities like the need to update them so they won't be worried, celebrating anniversaries, making sure they're happy, cheering them up when they're sad. And if I fail to do any of this, I will feel guilty.

I tend to overthink a lot too because of trust issues among other things. In my mind, if we're not gonna break up now, it's still gonna happen sooner or later. If we don't break up over this problem, we're still gonna break up for another reason. Why prolong the suffering?",27Jun2020,1

Although I should be happy for the breakup I really want him in my life. If he could heal from his wicked ways we would be a powerful couple. I used the online form and gave some info.

80,"I am a 22 year old white guy and I just graduated from college recently. I've changed a lot in the past 4 years but maybe the biggest change has been in my sensitivity to other people. Back in high school I definitely had an ""edgy"" sense of humor. There still were lines I didn't cross, but I made a lot of jokes that were offensive just for the sake of being offensive. At the time I thought that I was being funny or ""making fun of"" people who actually believe that stuff, but looking back I really regret all of this and realize that even though I thought they were jokes, my words still carried weight and contributed to the problem. 

Back then I had a friend who is black and bisexual. We definitely got along and talked and enjoyed being around each other but he did not like these kinds of jokes and would call me out for them whether it was in the moment or later that day. Every time that happened though I wouldn't really own up to it. I would just kinda give him the ""I'm sorry you were offended but it was just a joke"" excuse, and I feel really bad about that. We've stayed in touch a little bit since high school and he doesn't seem like he's holding it against me but I still feel like he deserves an apology for my behavior. I've felt bad about it for a while but for some reason just never brought it up.

My question is: how should I go about this apology? I can't exactly call him up and say ""hey lets grab some coffee"" so should I text or call him? I also wonder if he even cares at this point. I really don't want it to come off as me just trying to clear a guilty conscience because I do genuinely feel bad about my past behavior. I feel like if I texted him now it would come off as disingenuous. Should I try to contact him and apologize or would that just be piling on to the amount of shit he already has on his mind?

Also, because  I may not be interested in men and women sexually but I have no problem with self-love. Maybe I am just interested in cultivating emotional bonds first.

This is so damn confusing. And clubbed together with the fact that I live in a country which is not very progressive, it is really hard to figure out who I am. And I feel this need to find something to define myself. Feels like I am in this transient phase and everything is so confusing. It's so frustrating. And I am 27, so going through this crisis makes me feel even more pathetic. Shouldn't I have figured myself out by now?

84,"So there’s this girl I work with that I like but I have no idea if she likes me or not. We started talking a little and started to notice each others similarities at first. This was where I thought she had liked me. We played some games together online and texted. Stuff seemed pretty good. So eventually I asked her out and she said sure. This made me happy since this was going to be my first date ever. So I said tomorrow but she was busy. So then I asked what day and stuff and she said she didnt know. So I start getting really impatient over the next days and got really overconfident and got dillusional thinking she was already my girlfriend. Thats when I got hit with the “Sorry, but I still need to get to know you” stuff. Then it hit me. I got too excited over being on my first date and having a girl for once. So I learned that lesson and remembered to take it slow. 

So I tried doing so and apologized to her but then she started ignoring my texts. It’s my fault I thought so I guess I deserved it. So every now and then I would just say good morning and goodnight until three days later, I gave up texting her. When we’re at work though, it’s like none of that stuff happened. So we proceed to be friends irl but on texts when I attempt to talk to her, she still mostly ignores my text. This is where I start getting confused.

After weeks go by, she then decides to text me all of a sudden in a really nice way. So Im thinking “Oh now you’re texting me? I wonder what happened. I text back in a positive way, so far so good. Then she asks that she needed a big favor. She needed a ride home. So that triggered me for a while but I still kept my cool and said I couldn’t because I have a little brother to watch at home. She didn’t angry or anything so that was fine. 

So the day after in the morning she tells me good morning. I was still pretty mad about yesterday so I gave out dry replies and an eventual ignore afterwards. She then didn’t text me again when she noticed. Then when I came to work, she was at the door on her phone, I say hi of course but then she quickly looks down at her phone. In a way I felt like I have gotten justice for all her actions and glad that she starts getting a little mad. Well since that satisfied me, I plan on apologizing to her tomorrow or so even though I know she’ll ignore me. So I need advice on what to really do from here. Should I stick with her or just give her up?",27Jun2020,1

the two emotions i feel the most of is anger and sadness. i was working on my mental health but when i get one thing in life balanced out i sorta start to slack in other spots. my anger wasn’t as bad but i feel it coming back. i cry every single day atleast once. i feel hopeless a lot of time time. atleast once a day. there isn’t one day i can get by with like no negative thoughts or feelings. 

like for instance i’m a tattoo apprentice and it’s cool but i don’t feel proud of myself. it sucks. i wanna be proud and happy but like idk. i don’t really find joy in anything in life. it scares me bc i literally just turned 20 on the 21st of june and i’m still young.

i find myself wanting to be alone all the time. i’m naturally a huge introvert but people have been pissing me off bad lately. like i just want no one around. and that makes me feel upset bc like i mentioned i’m aware. i wanna be there for my dad and my boyfriend. i wanna be there for my friends and help guide them like they do to me. but i find myself not wanting to care for anyone. it’s not like i’m being mean it’s just literally my emotions. i just don’t care. i want to care though.

For context, I just graduated high school. I have my two closest friends and I’m also part of this larger friend group. There’s this girl in the larger friend group that I had a falling out with a few months ago, and I’m not interested in being her close friend again because I think our relationship was toxic and drama generating. I’m pretty sure she thinks the same, so we were both fine with not interacting anymore. I personally didn’t think much of it afterwards; I don’t actively hate her, I’m just not interested in being close to her.

Because of corona, we didn’t get a normal graduation and normal prom. So the girl i’m not friends with arranges this photoshoot with a professional photographer with our friend group, followed by a small “party”. At first, i was lead to believe that these were two separate events, as in, the photos were only for her and a few close friends, and the party was for the rest, which is an okay formula. However, my close friend informed me that I was actually the only one not invited to the photos. Everybody else was going to the photos and the party (the host doesn’t want me in the photos, which is understandable considering our situation. i don’t blame her for that) At this stage, I was still fine with going despite that, but my two close friends both can’t make it for personal reasons and that’s when i really started hesitating. 

The catch is, I was never put into the Messenger group, but my friend informed me that people wanted me to be there and so HE is the one who invited me in a smaller group where the host isn’t. It’s nice of them that they expressed that, but i’m still invited for only part of the event. Furthermore, they actually CUT some people, so basically now there are only about 6 people going, so it’d be even more awkward for me to show up after everyone in my opinion. 

Tonight I texted my friends and told them thank you for thinking me but since i’m only invited to half of the event i don’t really feel comfortable going. They didn’t really seem to understand my pov at first, but i think they might now.

Am i making the right decision? There’s no going back now, but i kinda want peoples opinions since some ppl weren’t understanding my pov at first.",27Jun2020,1

Would it be better to have a short-term relationship or just be fwbs to avoid future hurt?

Hi! I (18f) have been going out with this guy (22m) for a few weeks now. Basically, I really, REALLY like him, and from what he’s said and how he’s acted, I think he feels the same way. Yesterday while we were hanging out at his dorm he even asked the “what are we?” question, which got me thinking.

This really seems like it could be the start of an amazing relationship. Everything would be great... except that in three weeks from today, he’s going back to his home state for a few weeks before he returns back here for college. By the time he gets back, I will have moved to a different country, where I plan on staying for a year. So, yeah.

I’ve been thinking about this situation a lot, and I can think of two ways this can go. I still want to see this guy and spend time with him before he leaves. But I’m wondering, would it be better to:

1. Suggest we date, knowing it’ll only be short-term? Yesterday he mentioned something about being my temporary boyfriend- it seems sweet and wonderful, but I know I’ll get even more attached and it’ll hurt more when we part ways.

Or,

2: Suggest we have a sort of fuckbuddy/ FWBs relationship? We’ll still hang out and be physical and whatnot, but will purposefully leave out the talking about emotions and feelings too much part. Absolutely no mentions of love or the future. Just live with now, have fun, and part ways.

Does anyone have any ideas? I know this situation seems silly but the idea of leaving already hurts, and I’m not sure what to do. Thank you for any insights/advice!",27Jun2020,1
92,"So here's the deal. I see my friends posting group selfies and shit of them having a great time and I'm fine with that. But the problem is that I'm jealous of them having so much fun and I can't be a part of it. See I work a lot, so I can't go with their schedule.

93,"So I've been dealing with this for years and for sure it's probably not a huge deal, but I'm pretty sure my sister is a compulsive liar. I point her out on it all the time but my parents have never done anything about it and she just keeps doing it. She will lie about anything, big or small. For instance, today our laundry got mixed up and she was wearing my bf's shirt by accident I think, thinking it was mine (It was a plain shirt, gender neutral). I overheard this next part, my mom knew it was my bf's and my sister told her I gave it to her and said it was fine to wear it. When I asked her why she said that she had no defense and just told me to leave her alone. The other day, my mom asked her if she got our takeout food from the car, she said yes, but then proceeded to get it because she really didnt. I pointed that out, still nothing, nobody cares. I should really try to do more psychological research on this since its really hurt or relationship a lot and I know I cant trust her with anything. I'm also pretty sure my dad has these habits as well but probably not as severe. But he has either remembered things wrong, or straight up lied about them, not sure which. How do I even begin to approach this? Also if theres a subreddit for something this specific please direct me there.",27Jun2020,1
94,"I was born in Russia and have a Russian name. My mother married a Canadian and we moved to Canada when I was 10. Throughout school I used my stepfathers surname but my legal name remained Russian. Now I am 30. I moved back in with my parents almost two years ago and can't seem to find a job. My mother insists that my Russian name may be a factor when hiring managers are looking at my resume (although I admit I could be trying harder). My biological father has been insisting for years that I change my surname to my stepdad's. The day before Father's day, my mom persuaded me to change my surname and as a gesture, inform my stepdad about my decision on Father's day. I'm 30 mind you. I talked to my biological dad and he is really keen on me having an English name. If I change the surname, I'll be changing my given name as well. Everyone seems to be for this except for me. It does kinda make sense to have an English name though, since I don't have an accent and no one suspects that I'm an immigrant until they learn my name.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

My mother and biological father want me to change my Russian surname to my stepfather's English surname. They also want me to change my first name (Kirill) to an English one . They think there is a negative opinion of Russians and that having a foreign sounding name is hindering my chances of employment.",27Jun2020,1

97,"So last month i cut off my former best friend. I realized she didn’t treat me like a friend and that i was just convenient for her as a friend. She screwed my family after they let her live in one of their rental houses too. She ultimately skipped out on 2100 dollars in rent and left the house damaged and unclean. This ultimately led to my breaking point with her. 

I introduced my other friend to her about a year ago. I knew when i cut her off they would probably stay friends and thats ok. I didn’t explain to him in detail why i cut her off and he hasn’t asked. 

I know its a little unreasonable but i don’t want him to keep talking about my former best friend with me and showing pictures that tell me he’s with her. If he wants to be friends with her thats between them but i cant help but feel like shes doing the same thing to him as she did to me. I feel like an ass for thinking like that but im a bit worried about him. 

I dont have alot of experience with friends outside of these two people and another friend who is unrelated. Until two years ago i had just been friends with my old best friend and that was it. I have no idea how to interact with my friend now that im not affiliated with my old best friend. Especially now that i know they’re hanging out frequently.

98,"I started my new job back in September 2019. It’s my first “corporate” job. In the past I’ve worked in small businesses and freelanced. So when transitioning to corporate, it felt like a culture shock. There were so many new things to understand, new procedures and etiquette...and don’t get me started on all the acronyms. 

Initially, I struggled with outlook, the bombardment of emails, the constant meeting invites, and the management of multiple high-priority projects at once (for reference, I’m a graphic designer in my company’s marketing department). But, as with most things, with time I get better at managing things. 

That is, until COVID. My company used to outsource a lot of jobs, but with the virus, they cut back on this so as to not have to lay anyone off. But, a caveat to that was that employees had to pick up more work that would usually be outsourced. Everything is done in-house now. 

With that said, my work load ballooned. I should mention that I am very bad at admitting when I have too much on my plate. I didn’t want to say anything because I didn’t want to give the impression that I’m “not the right person for the job” or that I couldn’t handle it -- after all, with the virus, being deemed unqualified and being let go was a fear. But, I see now this wasn’t the right move, I got overwhelmed trying to keep up and as a consequence some deadlines fell through. 

Not a good look. 

We have monthly reviews with our managers. Usually mine are good, but this month’s wasn’t good. My manager started off the review by asking me if I was happy with my job/working with the company. Being positive, I told her that I was happy and appreciated the continued learning and challenges. She agreed, telling me she enjoys working with me and that I fit the company’s culture, but then transitioned into my missed deadlines and a few other points of frustration over the past few weeks. 

I left the review feeling completely dejected. I’d worked late most days trying to complete on my plate everything and definitely bit off more than I could chew. I’d done my honest best, and told her that, but it seemed my energy was put into the wrong places and it would’ve been better to let her know that I had too much on my plate so we could move things around rather than let them fall through (but, I was apprehensive to do so since I felt everyone had a bigger workload due to the virus, not just me - so It felt wrong to complain or admit that I was overwhelmed). 

After the review I took steps to better manage things. She took a lot of work off my plate and I took it upon myself to create a development plan and put some action steps into place to ensure I had a better grasp of my assignments. 

But with all that said, I finally get to my problem: I’m now constantly on edge at work. I feel like I’m on thin ice now. Every mistake I make, no matter how minuscule, I completely spaz over because, in my mind, I feel like it's another point against me (as though someone is keeping track).  Every error feels like the end of the world in my mind now. But, despite me triple and quadruple checking everything - I am human - sometimes things happen that I don’t foresee. 

My projects can get pretty complex with multiple steps and multiple people involved, so hiccups are bound to happen, but I’m terrified of making mistakes now. This is the highest paying job I’ve had and with the highest prestige. In this climate, the fear of losing it keeps me up at night. I can’t shake the feeling that I'm “in the red”.

I know bad reviews happen, and I’m taking steps to correct things, but I just can’t shake the possibility that my job’s in danger. With every little hiccup I encounter, I feel like I’m one step closer to termination. My manager never said this explicitly. She’s actually been very nice and supportive - helping me to manage things and keeping me on track. But alas, my angst has my stomach in constant knots. 

Any advice in managing a stressful job in these hard times? Handling mistakes? 

As an added note - my girlfriend of 3.5 years broke up with me the day before my negative review. Our relationship did not survive this pandemic. And my mind has been on edge ever since. In media, characters are always at their lowest when they lose their girl \*and\* their job, so her being gone, I feel, plays a huge part in my worry. 

Any advice?

101,"To preface this, I live in the middle of nowhere. My house is on a dead end and I am literally surrounded by trees. My neighbors are about a 1/4 of a mile away and I can’t see their houses in the summer because of how many trees there are. I also live right next to a very popular mountain trail. There’s all kinds of animals out here including wolves, black bears, foxes, coyotes, and the occasional mountain lion. 

My fiancé and I every Friday go to get donuts as a treat and today we passed by two kids on bikes. I noticed one of them because he had a bike just like the one I had as a kid. This was at like 11AM. 

At 1PM my fiancé, mom, and I went to the grocery store and when we returned around 2PM the bikes of the kids we saw this morning were on the side of the road where the woods become government property and about 100ft in starts the mountain trail. The trail goes one of two ways, up the mountain towards a main highway or down the mountain towards a ranger station, small road, and a huge river. 

My fiancé and I went walking at 7:30 (sunset comes at 8:30) and on our walk we ran into our neighbor who warned us she had seen a black bear on her property and to watch out. Usually not a big deal as the bears stay in the woods. However, when my fiancé and I returned from our walk just before sunset the kids bikes were still in the street. Now this worried me because they’d been there all day and it was about to get pitch black. So when we got back in we called the cops. They came and the cop seemed as confused and worried as we are, but I just want to make sure I did the right thing.

107,"**Hello, I'm a 16-year-old who's gonna go to college soon and I need help deciding my major/career path**

I have always been in my life a sort of inconsistent person in the sense that I get motivated for something and then I just stop pursuing that thing after a month or so.

**That's where I've been with Programming**

I've always loved computers and the idea of being a software engineer or a data scientist but I just didn't have any motivation and I've just been doing nothing for the past 2 years (since I started to learn how to code in 2018). However, my life is getting back on track as I'm going to college, and my father pointing out that I have a good tenacity and natural voice/politic to be a lawyer. I agree with him, I like to debate and I love having conversations in general. Now, obviously, when I'm searching for a career path I'm accounting for my happiness, love for the job, and pay. Pay is actually somewhat of a decision-maker her as I love both things and they both pay decent money for the job, however, I wanna be happy with this job, live in a nice home, in a great neighborhood, and assure my children's future. I do want to start a family after I graduate from University and most likely get married. 

**I love computers and the feeling of writing code to make something happen, to create AI, to create a revolutionary idea, and start your own company. However, I am a pure novice when it comes to code. I only know the very basics of HTML and that's it. I bought books/online courses but I haven't done them in 1 1/2 years or so.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**With law, I don't know whether to be a prosecutor and then start my own private firm/ work for a good firm or just go straight to an entry-level corporate lawyer job. However, I would love to later progress into being a judge later on in my law career (if I pursue law).** 

&amp;#x200B;

So really I am spilt half-half on whether to go the CS route or go the law route.

I recently got messed over on my last job and I'm having a hard time finding a new one that was more than $9/hr. I have an opportunity to become a shift manager from my local Burger King which would be a good deal for the time being since I can walk or ride a bike to work since my car is going down. 

What I'm mainly asking is this; we are on HUD (housing assistance where they pay 30% of what you make for rent) and my rent currently is $233 a month. It needs changed as I lost my job 2 weeks ago and no one at the office is returning my phone calls let alone answering them and I can't go to the office because they're still doing covid prevention. 

My utilities is cheap but idk if there are assistance programs for it. 

Yes I have filled out a unemployment paper but no word back yet and I doubt I'll get it. I also applied for cash assistance and as of right now my food stamps is going into cancellation.

115,"Hi guys. 
I came to reddit because I’m unsure who to talk to about this, but I’ve been crying since last night about it and I need to get some of it off of my chest. 

I went to hang out with my boyfriend yesterday, since we hadn’t seen each other in while. Now, we do have access to one another’s phone passwords. I don’t mind him having mine, and it seemed that he also didn’t mind me having his. We often open each others phones to set alarms, take pictures, search things up, etc. when we don’t feel like getting our own phone. 

In this instance, my phone was charging across the room, while his was in the bed next to me. He saw me with his phone (just to clear the notion that I was being sneaky) and I opened it to set an alarm. I then went to his messages because I remembered he’d taken a picture earlier that I wanted, so I was going to send it to myself. 

Upon going to his messages, I saw someone’s ID  as “Bitch”, with “Attachment: 8 images”. This person’s ID had a photo of a female, so I opened it because it seemed a little suspicious. The images were pictures of he and her, they weren’t explicit, but she was sitting on his lap, and they were making kissy faces, sticking out their tongues, etc. This message was sent on June 11.  He hadn’t had any texts from after then. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 7 months, so this alarmed me. I scrolled up and saw she’d sent the same photos back in September, before he and I had met. So I asked him about it. 

He was very nonchalant, and told me it was someone he used to be involved with last year. So I asked why he still had photos with her that were obviously flirty, and asked how he’d feel if I were doing that. Keep in mind that I *do* get a lot of attention from guys (especially on Snapchat), and I ignore them out of respect for my boyfriend. I have stopped talking to people who I was involved with as well, because I believe it’s inappropriate to have conversations that could lead to flirting. 

He said he wouldn’t like it if I did that, so I asked him why he’d done it. He then went on to give me a spill about how she’d snapchatted him about how she’d broken up with her boyfriend and all that, and he “thought about how he felt when he was hurt like that” and wanted to be a good friend. He said halfway through the conversation, he’d thought about me and decided it was not appropriate to keep talking to her. So he says he left her on read after that. A few days after, she’d texted him asking for the aforementioned photos. He’d sent them, and that was the end of the interaction.

He says that he didn’t save the messages (on Snapchat, texts delete automatically unless you save them manually), and that he sees how this could make him look bad. He showed me the parts Snapchat conversation that was saved. But he swears he isn’t talking with her intimately, or cheating on me. His defense is that he didn’t see her as a problem because they’d never kissed or anything. Just flirted. I asked about her ID name and he just said it was a joke they had. She hadn’t pissed him off or anything to get her name put that way. However, we all know that people can lie to cover their asses. So I’m all and all very unsure. 

We talked about it for an hour, and he continued giving me the same story. He said he wasn’t going to lie because he didn’t want it to come back later on. He kept asking me how I felt, and told me he didn’t really know what to say because he didn’t want to seem like he was trying to manipulate/gaslight me. He kept telling me to do what I felt was best, and that he wouldn’t make me look stupid by cheating on me. He apologized profusely because he said he knew it looked bad, and he didn’t mean to hurt my feelings. He cried and so did I, so I feel like he was obviously upset that I wasn’t believing what he had to say. 

I told him I’d need a bit of time because I have bad anxiety, and I knew this whole thing was going to eat at me for a bit. I expressed to him that the whole thing was inappropriate and that I needed him to think of me more when interacting with women (I told him to just put the shoe on the other foot and think about how he’d feel if I do what he does). We hugged, and took a walk. He told me he was sorry for ruining my day and that he’d make it up to me soon. 

He’s very friendly, and I know that. He’s very innocent in that aspect, and doesn’t look at things as inappropriate unless someone is obviously throwing themselves at him. I know this firsthand because he never picked up on anything when I was courting him. I had to be very explicit to get the point across that I was interested in him. 

As he drove me home, he kept asking me if we were okay, and if I was sure about not taking a break. I told him yes, we hugged, and he walked me in. 

However, it’s still eating me up. We haven’t talked since him telling me he got home safely  yesterday (he sleeps ridiculously late). I don’t want to be naive and just go with it, but at the same time I don’t want to go on and break it off based on something so vague. There’s so little information that it could go either way. He could be telling the truth, or he could be lying. 

What should I do?

I applied at a pet store a few weeks ago, and went in for an interview on the 12th this month. The hiring guy said it went really well, but he had to speak to the store manager before making a decision and that I should expect a call on the 15th or 16th. Tuesday night, and I still had no call. My mom made me call to follow up, and they said the store manager was still out and they would probably call either the next day or the day after that. It’s been a week and a half since I called and I still have nothing. Should I call them again? Or keep waiting? I’m desperate to leave my job, but I don’t want to apply/interview somewhere else only to have the pet store hire me and have to quit the other one halfway through the process.

I wanted to change my mind and go to a community college, but my brother pulled me aside and said he hated going there, and that going to a university will guarantee better connections and such. I trust my brother’s word since he has been through college.

123,"Should be obvious based on my title but things are a little more complicated.

I worked in a family business (distribution) my entire life. I’m 26 and Ive been doing it since I could walk. I always thought that my dad was the smartest business man I knew. I mean he trained me and I’m pretty good at what I did. 

Long story short by the time I was 24 I began to realize that although my dad was pretty good at the trade itself, he made terrible business decisions. We had grown to a point where the “asshole family patriarch” shtick was no longer a viable leadership option. As we continued to grow, more terrible decisions were made and as the sort of “Operation Manager” I was left to clean up the logistical messes and deal with the heated customers. 

In January I ran what was pretty much a coup. I had been talking with a larger family run company who was interested in buying my dads company and giving us all jobs with benefits and holidays and incentive (all things we never had or could offer). We would run things in our region but not as owners. My dad (for reasons I now understand) went ballistic and essentially began sabotaging things (unintentionally). After another 2 months I decided to leave which devastated my family especially my dad. Now things have cooled off and my dad eventually sold the company. The new owner wants me back. I have since found a “faith based” job which is the least stressful job I’ve ever had in my life. I love it.....but it doesn’t interest me.  I feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Kindergarten Cop. I’m used to operating under pressure and it’s somewhat exhilarating. But this job is pretty vanilla

Apparently a bird hit the engine as they were landing into the airport, and the mechanic checked it out and determined that it did not cause damage. We waited on the plane until 8:30, then they offered to deplane.

Me and my dad got off without our carry on, and have been waiting for about 2 and a half hours. There is NOTHING open for food, no in airport dining, no vending machines, and no food or water available anywhere on the plane as they are not doing food services due to covid.

I am wondering, I have tried looking on Frontier's website, and there is nothing stated regarding the policy on not being able to provide food for passengers due to delays during covid. I have a Reeses in my purse thank goodness, but I see passengers walking aimlessly looking for food and with no luck.

I have been best friends with this guy since Freshman year. I befriended him, after he broke up with his girlfriend at the time. I was always there to tell him about how she would talk behind his back and whatever. 

This friendship went on, but last year he got a girlfriend. She HATED me, and I get it. I’m the “girl best friend” I have them space, but she started spewing lies about me. And he believed them without even asking me about it. After that, he just abandoned me for 7 months. Once they broke up, I was there for him again. The thing is, he never apologized to me about it, and whenever I tried to bring it up all he would say is “my bad.” 

I tried my best to move on, until I realized that I was being treated differently. I was his “girl best friend” again, but it felt like a lot of pressure. I felt like I was being treated as a side kick. He made sure I always felt intellectually inferior, since I have to work in my ap classes and he barely has to study. I’m scared for him, he has this mentality that he is emotionally mature. But I don’t think he is. Every time I give him advice (especially girl advice) it goes in one ear and out the next. Why does he act like I never know what I’m saying? When he didn’t listen to me, he led a girl on and lost friends. 

He’s also very inconsiderate, he literally abandoned me for my other friends in a town that was 20 minutes away from my house. He gave me a ride there and left early. I have to always work around his schedule, and the other day just set me off. 

Recently I’ve been having a hard time to get out of bed, I just have no motivation. I expressed this, and he asked if we could hang out the next day. I said yes, but he cancelled on me 10 minutes before I left the house. He literally said that his parents only wanted him to leave the house once a week, and he implied he didn’t want to waste his one day on me. 

After all these years, I just can’t do it anymore. I wrote him a letter and said that I want him to better himself, and the things he does hurts my feelings. I told him I didn’t want to be close friends, if he wasn’t willing to realize he’s been a bad friend. I handed him this letter and now I’m waiting for a response. Do you think I did the right thing? I feel like maybe I’m being dramatic, or heard his side, but I’m also just tired. Should I try and contact him, or wait for him to come to me?",27Jun2020,1

I remember, that night, having a sudden strong impulse. I was strangely thinking about sending nudes to people on Grindr and maybe even meeting up with them. I felt a MASSIVE surge of adrenaline, downloaded the app, and did just so (minus meeting up). I have now done this countless times, and I also began posting nudes on Reddit and sending snapchats to hundreds of people, even video calling some of them. I will sometimes stay up for hours doing this, I always feel horrible afterwards. Thousands of people have seen me naked in very, very explicit ways. I only ever met up with somebody one time, but I backed out while still in their car and they were incredibly understanding. I don’t know why I do this, I always feel groggy afterwards. Every time I do it though, I just feel that rush of excitement. To add to this, I.... also began to use my dad’s sex toys around this time. It was the same thing.

151,"Hey guys,

I’ve been a lurker for a while and I had nowhere to turn for this advice.

About a year ago, my family had some new neighbors move in a house couple houses down. We live in a pretty -politely- racist area and as a black family residing here for over 20 years, it’s been a lot to stand our ground. However, this new family is a mixed race family straight from the city who are not use to the unspoken rules of suburbia. They have around 7 kids living in a 3 bedroom house and have consistently wreaked havoc in the neighborhood. Cars impounded and screaming matches, motorbikes all hours of the night Tokyo drifting, multiple visits by law enforcement on different occasions are just a couple of things to name.

When I came back home from college my parents mentioned that they have suspicions that their older son (high school age) is selling drugs. My parents are boomers so at first I thought they were overreacting. However, I soon realized that they’re not. I’ve seen cars come at all hours of the night and just a lot of suspicious activity. Over these last couple of weeks, things have changed. Instead of the cars parking in front of their house (3 houses down from mine) they have been parking on the side of the plot of land my parents own which is giving me anxiety and endangering my own black family living in a predominately white area.

In the instance that something could happen, one of our neighbors could possibly give our address as a connection to suspicious activity and I don’t want any similar no-knock warrants to occur to my family and my aging parents. However, I also don’t know how to fix this situation without creating a problem that could escalate very very quickly to their young African-American son as none of this is proven fact. However, we do have cameras that show the parking of the drug deals.

Speaking to the family isn’t ideal as our interactions with them have been very rude and they seem to not care what any of their kids do. Plus we can’t tell others how to raise their kids.

What should we do?

154,"Back in February, I had a consultation with a tattoo artist for a unique tattoo. I wanted an American Bison with an Arizona Coral Snake around it on my left thigh. About a week or two before my appointment, I had to cancel due to family issues. I rescheduled with the tattoo artist for August and then found out they did the exact tattoo I asked them to specifically do for me on someone else. Same animals, same location, same style. 
This would have been my first tattoo and I feel betrayed because I chose those animals and even the placing for personal, specific reasons.

I [F21] love my bf [M26] but I feel as though he holds me back sometimes. I have a wandering heart- I love to travel, hiking, road trips, etc. anything dealing with outdoors, wildlife, mountains, festivals. He’s the complete opposite. He’s been doing better at going on walks with me and such. But I want to do a lot of things this summer and he can’t travel due to COVID (he’s military) which I understand. But I feel like I always have to put traveling on hold because of him or when he was able to travel, I had to almost force him to go. I have traveled alone before but it’s not as fun as it would be with him. 

I don’t have friends really so that’s not really an option either. I just feel stuck and it’s putting a strain on our relationship because I don’t feel as though I should have to sacrifice something that I genuinely love to do because of him which has caused me to become somewhat unsatisfied with him.

161,"There's a lot more that goes into this but I'm going to oversimplify some things here. For some context I'm F16 and my brother is M18.

A quick list of our life and things you need to know:

- we are kind of co-dependant on each other. We do a lot of the same things and are always kind of seen as ""one""

-we both struggle with food a lot and binge both for comfort and boredom 

-my brother has been harshly verbally abused by our parents as a child and bullied throughout school

-I bottle up my feelings a lot so I'm seen as the ""good"" better kid and this has been shoved in his face.

-Our parents cannot handle any sort of problem that doesnt deal with them and will end up in yellling. (Our mom is a narcissist and my dad will defend our mom to no end)


Me and my brother  just had a huge meltdown at the park. (Usually the place we go to calm down)  because we both binged and felt awful. We walk for a bit and things get intense fast. He tells me how much he wants to die and how he's worthless and how much he hurts me and abuses me. 
[I am emotionally pretty weak and cry easily so when i start crying because i don't want him to feel that way he takes it as him being  ""awful"" to me] overall I don't have much other people in my life so the thought of losing him just hurts a lot

I'm having a panic attack so obviously hes going to think about this as another reason to take his own life. He pretty much monologues about how much he wants to die and all the reasons why. We try walking a bit more in the park to no avail he keeps telling me he's made up his mind, etc.
 Some people litterally throw mud at us as we're walking so I cry more and my brother just says he deserves it.
The ride home wasn't pleasant, mud got into his contacts and this is pushing him even more over the edge than he already was. It was overall horrible experience.

We've both ""calmed down"" a bit but I'm emotionally exhausted but I really want to help guarentee saftey for him.
He told me his suicidal thoughts were creeping back up on him. He has a past of cutting himself and a distaste for medical professionals because the ones he's been to are awful.

I met him on Tinder and things started out so well. I've never met/talked to someone like him. Conversation with him was so easy and never-ending, he made me laugh and deep conversations were normal. He lived in a town an hour and a half away, but that never really affected us. We met up a few times and even discussed the possibility of making things official. At the time, I was waiting on word to hear if I had gotten into nursing school and my institution's honor program, so I told him I needed time to figure things out and hear if I got into the programs. I gave him an out and told him that if he wanted to run he could. He was fine with that, said that he completely understood that I needed time to figure out how a relationship would even work. Things were great. Until they weren't.

Two days before I was supposed to get my decision, he ghosted me. I never heard anything else from him. I don't blame him. In fact, I even told him he could leave, he just decided to do it later. I have absolutely no bad feelings for him. And that's my problem. Things ended in March, and to this day I still can't get my mind off of him, and the conversations we had, and the man that he was.

I could come visit for a week or something to help out with mom. I know things are really busy, but is there a particular time I could call?

So obviously a first car was becoming a relevant topic. My mom for years now has told me that she has been saving up to buy me a nice first car (not like a brand new, 50k car or anything but not a crapy handy down). So just a little over a week ago she finds a nice truck that we decided to go take a look at. What we weren’t expecting is that it was almost perfect. It was 15 years old but only had 100k miles. It had great leather seats. Great stereo system. The paint was good as new. And it was right within our budget. We would end up buying the car with full intention of giving it me as soon as I got my license. I fell in love with the thing the second we left the lot. Fast forward to just a couple of hours ago. My mom comes in to tell me that she found out why it was so nice. She found out the truck was a custom made by Ford. That means that the value of the car was much more than what she purchased it for (The car dealership we bought it from did not know of this making the price much lower than what it was worth). She told me that if I were to get in any kind of reck that put it beyond repair, she would in absolutely no way be able to pay for it. And because I am only going to be 16, there is a much higher chance I end up getting into a reck. So she told me that she would not be letting me have this truck until im in my 20s. This absolutely devastated me because I loved this truck. She told me that she felt horrible for ruining this for me. She said she would make it up to me by buying me a much cheaper truck along with either a ps5 or a couple months worth of insurance payed off. But I was not happy about this. I would honestly rather not have any vehicle than not having that truck. I know i should be grateful at all that she is offering to buy another truck for me...I really should be grateful she bought me on in the first place, but i just can not help but be absolutely pissed that I don’t get to have that truck when I get my license.

I’m not sure how long the couple has been together but they have 2 kids already and 1 on the way. My friend only met the husband because the pregnant wife introduced them, so they are kind of friendly acquaintances. So my friend only sees/talk to him at their work and she only ever talks to him about how their family is doing, is he excited for the new baby, etc. Recently he hit up my friend telling her “let’s have some fun together, come over when she’s (the wife) gone and let’s have some good sex” so obviously he’s a piece of human garbage. He also had the nerve to tell her he’s only asking cause she’s been mean lately? As if that obviously means she needs sex right? That’s some scumbag logic right there. Anyways, the question is how do we go about telling the wife? We feel like it’s the right thing to tell her but she’s about to have a baby so she’s probably very emotional and stressed already. But to not say anything is not being a good friend. And if he felt comfortable enough to ask a friend of his wife for a fling so nonchalantly and unprovoked, then he’s obviously had to cheat on her before right?

I'm 19M. My brother is 17M. We've been having a lot of disagreements lately over everything going on in the world with the George Floyd / Black Lives Matter protests and the coronavirus. These disagreements have caused him to be insane. He always calls me out now for the stupidest shit and calls me names like ""libtard"", ""cocksucker"", and ""Chad"" (which to be honest; I have no idea what any of these terms even mean).

So one night, all of my family was out; my parents were visiting friends in Portland and my little brother was working his part-time job. I invited my girlfriend (20F) over to have a little fun. We were in bed (and I was playing music pretty loud). My brother came home (and I did not know because the music was loud and I couldn't hear the garage open) and opened my door and saw my girlfriend and I going at it. I rushed to put my pants on and he laughed at us. My girlfriend and I were super embarrassed and I felt really stupid for turning the music so loud.

The next day, my brother made a Facebook post calling my penis small. He said so much in the post to bash at me regarding my support for BLM (which was pretty irrelevant). In the post, he said something along the lines of, ""That penis is so tiny that I feel bad for his girlfriend. She probably can't even feel it.""

The post got around 10 likes. It's been eating me alive. I've tried to talk to him about it, but he keeps acting like a child.

190,"I'm not asking reddit to diagnose me, nor am I going to list all the symptoms, but I've been wondering if I'm on the spectrum or have ADHD, and if I should go get tested to find out. I've asked a few friends for advice on this and they all think that I should, but I'm unsure whether they're saying that to be supportive, or if it's the advice I need to hear. For some background, I'm 17, and have been wondering this about myself since I was 12-ish. My dad will be supportive of this should I go through with it, so parental consent isn't an issue.

For some background: I know that things like this are typically caught earlier in life. When I was younger, my sister was having difficulties with school and was struggling with her ADHD, dyslexia, and behavioural issues. Because I wasn't having the same type of issues to the same degree of severity, my parents figured that I was doing fine and that there was no need to worry. There was also abuse at home with my mother, and I figured out that it was much easier to try and handle things on my own and ""act normal"" than it was to be myself. So, that's why it wouldn't have been caught earlier, if I do have it. 

My main reservation is that I was recently tested for a learning disability, and though the testing wasn't focussed on ASD or ADHD, the therapist said in the report that she didn't notice any signs of hyperactivity, or anything that would raise a red flag for her in terms of other conditions. In daily life, I've 'worked' on myself so that I seem normal/not super weird, and I try to make these things unnoticeable, but I feel like if it was really a problem, she would've noticed. Another concern is that my symptoms are just trauma and anxiety symptoms, as there is some overlap in symptoms.

I'm also worried that the therapist will think I'm stupid for going back lol, I don't want to make a fool of myself or make it seem like I'm doing this for attention, or trying to make a big deal out of it. But part of me knows that if I don't get tested.

It changed nothing, so a couple days later, I went up again to knock and actually confront them in person, but although I knew they were home according to the obvious noise, they didn't answer. I then sent an email about it to my apartment building company where they replied and said they will forward it to the landlord. They advised against confronting them myself and to just report the noise as it happens in order to have the landlord talk to them instead.
I even resorted to knocking a broom on the ceiling like some kind of stuffy old lady at one point and they just stopped back.

Finally, I left a message with my landlord and she got back to me the next morning, asking what kind of noise it was and that she will talk to them later that day. But it had not gotten better one bit, in fact felt like it was louder later. I called her back again saying it got worse, but haven't heard back from her yet.

I already spoke with both the landlord and the company about it, both are actually acting on it too, but nothing is getting better and it's causing me enough stress to want to be out of my own home for as long as possible whenever I visit anyone. I moved in about 2-3 years ago and absolutely do not want to move out because of this, and any calls I make to the landlord are not returned until the next morning. What else can I do?",27Jun2020,1

195,"Bad psychological evaluation and poor IQ score. My parents and psychologist were shocked at the results and believe the doctor did us wrong, but did he? What should I do?

Hi, so in February I took the WAIS-IV and had a psychological evaluation to determine whether I had ADHD or anxiety disorder because I display many symptoms of both. Prior to the test/evaluation, my mother and I spoke with the doctor about my symptoms and experiences, but he was extremely rude! He kept cutting us off and seemed like he didn’t care about what we had to say. After the chat, I dreaded taking the test with him. I also forget to mention I’ve always been self-conscious about my intelligence, so I knew my virtually non-existent ego would take a massive hit if I received a low score. Anyways, when I took the test, the proctor was intimidating and rude just as before. 
He made me so anxious, so anxious in fact that I was shaking and sweating; I was on the verge of a mental breakdown, and I just wanted to leave. He even had the audacity to ask “Why are you shaking?” in a rude, hostile tone when I was clearly in distress. Anyways, after all of the cognitive testing was done I filled out a questionnaire with 500+ questions and that was it. I felt so cheated afterwards because I expected an interview or something of the sort, but maybe I created false expectations. Fast forward a week and my parents receive my scores/ diagnosis and they were shocked. It said my IQ was 110 and I apparently do not have ADHD (which is extremely confusing because ADHD is a chronic disorder) and I have general anxiety disorder. 
As previously mentioned, my parents were shocked at the results and showed my psychologist. He informed them that the results are invalid because he’s known me for years and all of the things I have accomplished  such as self-teaching myself piano to an upper-intermediate level, self studying Chinese, academic achievements/awards and etc, indicate a higher than average IQ (He estimated my IQ to be around 125-135). 
When I finally received the news, I initially tried to ignore my IQ score and I tell myself the only thing that mattered was the diagnosis. But the next day I felt depressed. I felt like a moron. I felt like I would never be able to become the mathematician I always wanted to be.

With all of this said, do you guys think my psychologist is right? Can taking an IQ test with a psychiatrist you dislike, and who is extremely rude severely affect your scores? One huge thing to note is that I was on the verge of an anxiety attack/mental breakdown DURING the test.",27Jun2020,1

199," It pains me to write this. It’s very out of my reddit ‘persona’. All the below information is what I figure to be relevant to this challenge.  

Background: 

I have known my best friend since elementary school. I have known them better, and could count on them more, than my own blood related siblings. 

My friend has a college degree, as do I. In fact, we both have more than one. We are both relatively bright—or at least we think we are—and often hold dialectics at solving the world’s problems over glass of whisky. It has been a pastime we have had for almost a decade. We do not always agree—but possess that rare ability to discuss subjects we disagree on to a consensus without animosity. In a sense we have dialectics not ‘arguments’ per se. We both have strong backgrounds in philosophy, psychology, political science, and statistics. 

We have always considered ourselves ‘hybrid’ personalities. Knowing when to be a fox and when to be a lion. 

Over a year ago my best friend started using MDMA while finishing their second bachelors degree. When my friend used the substance I expressed my apprehensions. I told them, “That is a really bad idea. I highly advise against it. That type of stuff destroys peoples lives.” They weren't using large quantities at the time but I still expressed my objections. It seemed that they were still able to function while taking the substance. My friend disregarded my warnings. I have a feeling I was too easy-going about it at the time. 

Months later my friend visited me, and they seemed odd. They could not stop fidgeting. I turned to them at one point and said bluntly, “You realize how noticeable that is. I can tell something is up with you…. You need to stop taking that shit. That shit destroys lives. You need to stop.” 

My friend was defensive, “it’s fine, it’s not addictive”, they said. It was excuse after excuse like they were trying to convince me that the street drug was safe. I had never seen them like this before. At that time I did not relent. I told my friend something along the lines of, “I don’t want to go to another funeral this year. I am not okay with this. You must stop. I’ve castoff friends before, and I will do it again if I must. I don’t want to, but I will.” My friend—still defensive—said he would stop safely at some point. 

My friend did not. 

Not one week ago: 

I called them to discuss recent news related events. It was at first bizarre. My friend was highly emotional. Not knowing where they were going in life, not knowing why they were going in life, and not caring about their previous ambition in life. I gave the best motivational response I could muster. 

I asked my friend, “where is Kat”—my friends girlfriend. To which they responded, “I haven’t talked to her in months”. Mind the reader, I could hear her in the background of the call. 

I could tell something was wrong. 

She then got the phone and I asked, “what the f\*\*k is going on?” She told me my friend had taken MDMA and drank a good amount of alcohol while they were together. She said she thought the MDMA had been laced with something and all of these things were creating a bad response. 

My mind began racing. 

I looked up the effects of overdosing on MDMA mixed with alcohol. Seizures and vomiting were one side effect. I made sure to ask if she knew the ‘recovery position’ and had her recite it to me in detail. 

My friend eventually threw up—what she described as “blood”, passed out, and she had the wherewithal to call emergency services. They picked up my friend and brought them to hospital. My friend is alive. After six-beers, some wine and MDMA. 

My friend called me after discharge, and left a sorrowful message along the lines of, “I’m sorry, I f\*\*\*ed up, I know. You don’t have to call me if you don’t want to. If you want to and if you are ready, I can talk. That was stupid of me.” 

I knew my friend would know all the right words to say. as of yet I have not responded. 

My enigma: 

I have several decisions to make and I am not sure what to do. 

I have advised others—and been advised myself—that addicts are a lost cause. Drop them out of life. Consider them dead. 

But, if I do this at this moment, my friend is dead. It’s very surreal when it impacts your own…",27Jun2020,1

201,"Hi guys, I have a weird one. 

So I'm a white 31F. 

My parents were early adopters of what now is a pretty common ( and cringey IMO) trend were in order to come up with a unique baby name, white parents will kind of just make up something that sounds 'different'. According to the stories told by my parents, my name's a mashup of two names that they liked. One name is really pretty common, the other is less common - but I've met a few people that have it. My full name is completely unique to me, as far as I know, nobody else has it.  My name also sounds vaguely African in origin, which has gotten me into some awkward situations - I can be be more specific about some of them in the comments if I'm asked. 

I very rarely go by my full name, mostly just because it's a bit of a mouthful. I just go by a pretty common nickname for one of the two names making up my name. 

So, have you ever done that thing when you're bored, that you type your name into youtube or google just to see what comes up? So I did that other day on google, and pulled up some pretty boring stuff that first, my old facebook, white pages... but then I clicked over to the image search and it pulled up some seriously dark human gore shit. 

I pulled up one of these links and it pulled up an article with my name in a title, and in places all over article. It wasn't in a language I  can read, but I was eventually able to figure out what language it was, so pulled that language up in translate and typed my name in. 

So it turns out my name means something pretty awful in this language. It not a slur, or swear word, but something violent and tragic. Think like 'atrocity', or 'shooting'. Also from what I can tell, it's used pretty exclusively for a very tragic event  in this country's recent history.  It would be like a well meaning couple accidentally naming their child 'Holocaust' in Yiddish. 

Maybe i'm being dramatic, but I need to change it right?

I don't love my name anyway, and now I just can't stop thinking about the meaning, it genuinely makes me pretty upset when it crosses my mind. 

The biggest issue would be upsetting my mom, who really loves my name. It would probably really hurt her feelings, but she'd probably get over it eventually.",27Jun2020,1

Alt. Sorry if this is the wrong sub. I didn't know where to post it.

I cant stop eating junk food that's bad for me. Ice cream, candy, whatever the fuck that's sugary.
 Its costing me my teen years with my lack of friends and my mother is passive agressive about my problem.

 I ate an ice cream bar. Just one today, she yelled at me as I got out of the shower and left the empty box on the kitchen counter. She always does that. Leave the evidence to guilt me more. I'm already ashamed of myself. 
She's likely mad she has a daughter that's not pretty and can't brag about on Facebook. Other ways of her passive agressive-ness is buying me diet and exercise books. I know I have to try them if I want to get better. I did Atkins when I was 8, paleo at around 10 years and the intermittent fasting right now. 
Nothing really sticks or I just suck at all of them. Did running with my dad for a few months back in late 2019 but I stopped because of my lack of motivation.

Both my parents have been doing really well since the start of 2020. I'm super proud of my dad for losing 30 pounds already and reversing his fatty liver and my mom looks a lot slimmer. Why can't I be like them?

204,"Hello Redditors, I (21) was hired as an intern for a startup company a month back, and my internship ends on July 31st. My subject is Biotechnology so a lot of our work is lab based. Their office is relatively close to me (10 minutes) and under normal circumstances this would h e been ideal. But right now, community spread of COVID19 has been confirmed in my city (India) and it's spreading in a very way. My internship started on June 8th, and I went to office till the 11th. On 11th I asked them if I could do the reading from home, for which they agreed. I was hoping that by the time the reading ends and the lab work starts, maybe the cases will come down a bit, but unfortunately the situation has only worsened. I am asked to return to return to the lab on Tuesday (30th June). It's important to note that in India we lives with our parents until our mid to late 20s and I live with my parents who are 56 and 49 respectively, who have increased risk of being affected by the virus.
I would hate to say no to the internship, but if it comes to that, I will prioritise mine and my parents' health over it. This internship will help me get post graduate admissions in universities abroad and it will be a great stepping stone. Should I continue going to the lab despite the risks it poses? Also important to note that employees in the lab do not wear a mask, or maintain s safe distance, or sanitise their hands regularly.

I want to tell the other managers about the things he does, like serving ready to eat food that were dropped on the ground, but I just worry that they might think I'm just trying to trash talk another aspiring manager to get my foot in the door quicker, even though these are legitimate concerns and are all true.

207,"Hello! Thank you for clicking (or tapping) on my post! So a bit of background information:

Last year I posted like 2 things on this app called Poshmark. It's nothing major, just a sweater and a hoodie. I forgot about it for months until one day I woke up and I had an offer on my sweater. At this point, I didn't really understand how the app worked, but I counter offered them for a price that was a dollar higher, and they accepted and I got an email telling me I had made a sale. I was very excited because I had never had any successful business endeavors besides this one and I've been looking for a job or a way to make money on my own independent of my parents but I wasn't having any luck finding anything flexible to my schedule as I'm busy with high school. After a while I started listing more items, expanding to different platforms, and getting more sales. One day my aunt came to visit, and she saw how my business was going, and she along with my other aunt decided to invest. They bought me stuff to package my items as well as business cards to put into my packages.

Fast forward to the present:

I haven't been making as many sales and I started to get to thinking. I don't want to sell or resell used and new clothes for the foreseeable future because eventually, I'm going to run out of clothes to sell. I also don't want to start having to buy clothes just for the purpose of hiking up the price on them and I don't want to contribute to the fast fashion industry. After having a conversation with one of my close friends, I came to the conclusion that I want to start re-branding my brand and distance myself from the re-selling industry. I have an idea of what I want to start selling but I don't know where to start. I want to start selling candles and wax melts and probably expand from there. The thing is, I don't know where to start. I've made candles before for personal use, so I have some sort of idea of how to make the candles. But what I'm really having trouble with is how to start and kick off my new business venture like where to start selling, how to get my brand out there, how much should I spend, etc. Any advice would help me out a lot! Thank you for taking the time to read this!

Everyone says I’m overreacting, and that since I’m in my early twenties and have no medical condition, I’ll probably be fine if I do catch it.

211,"To begin with, I used to be skinny. Skinny to the fact that I’m considered underweight. Now, quarantine started and I thought of working out. Two weeks through of working out and I wondered if an underweight is allowed to work out even. And I found out that it could be dangerous to workout when underweight so I stopped because I didn’t want to get myself hurt or end up in a hospital. Instead, I tried gaining weight so that after I get to be in the healthy range of BMI, I could then workout without worrying myself ending up in a hospital, lol.

So yes, I did gain weight but everyday my mom calls me fatty. She says my face looks really round and calls me a pig. But I just laugh it off. 3 days ago, I started working out again but my mom still teases me with my weight. And the day I started working out she starts ordering pizza, take-out, and other foods she knows very well that I like. And it bothers me a lot. I still do eat because I didn’t want to starve myself. I didn’t want to restrict myself but in moderation, though. 

Today, my dad dropped by our house ( my parents are divorced ). And my dad constantly said to me that I look “abnormal”. She said I didn’t look good. That I looked like a “monggoloid”. And it does hurt me. I don’t even know how to feel about myself. I keep looking in the mirror and I feel disgusted of myself. I mean is eating even a crime? How is that so wrong? To the point that they have to shame my body.

My dad came over because he wanted to invite us to his place because it’s our grandma’s birthday. But I don’t even want to go out anymore after what they told me. I lost all confidence. I don’t want to go there, only to hear more remarks regarding my weight. While my dad was telling me how “abnormal” I looked, I was trying my best to hold my tears and just laughed it off. What hurts is that he didn’t say it in a joking way, he looked really serious and said all those hurtful stuff with a stern voice which I was also really scared.

What should I do? I know I can’t lose weight overnight but I’m sick of them shaming me for gaining weight. My weight gain isn’t even that drastic but do they even have to call me “fatty”, “abnormal”, and all those stuff?",27Jun2020,1

213,"Title basically explains it. I grew up with a lot of weird tensions and opposites in the home when it came to cleaning; keeping things clean and helping around the house was expected and became a sign of affection (""If anyone actually loved me I wouldn't have to ask for help around the house"", etc) - but somehow, the house was always still gross. I remember going to do the dishes once and there was fuzzy mold about an inch tall growing on an old lemon slice. We'd have to ""make a path"" through poles off stuff to get through certain rooms, and would just balance trash on top of the full garbage can for as long as we could before someone finally took it out.

I determined for myself that I was never going to have my home be that way; I hated it. I love having clean, open spaces in my home, and never noticed until recently how much of an effect this has on my mental health; I can't relax and enjoy a day off if I know there's something that needs cleaning or picked up. I don't mind having some mess and don't need things to be perfect all the time, I'd like things to be generally picked up, organized, floor swept, counters cleared and wiped down, etc.

With that said, the three of us all work full time, and we all are tired at the end of the day and don't often have much energy - but I simply can't do everything by myself. At the same time, I'm terrible with communication, especially if I need help with something. I don't want to ""bother"" anyone, and just end up doing it myself.

216,"I’ll call her “blue”. 

Last year I befriended a new coworker. At first I thought she was cool, but she quickly became too much to deal with.  Blue self medicates with edibles all day everyday, it’s disturbing.  I’ve done it twice but I don’t like it because it makes me paranoid.  Blue often tries to pressure me to drink or get as high like her, and it’s frustrating.  Whenever I refuse to do it, she gets a stank attitude towards me and gives me an evil side eye. 

Blue also loves to give me unsolicited advice regarding how I live my life.  She complained a lot that I was too quiet at work and that I needed to go to the bar with our coworkers more often.  Sometimes if I didn’t go, blue didn’t go either, which is weird.  I haven’t known this woman long and so far all she has done is come off clingy and judgmental.  She finds flaws in everything and everyone.  

She also tells me when people at work talk about me, I feel like she likes drama.  One of my coworkers told me blue was talking about me. Apparently blue told my coworker that I’m too quiet and it pisses her off.  She comes off as if she wants to be accepted so badly, it’s cringeworthy. She was recently dragged in a private group chat which consisted of all of our coworkers.  She thought they were all her friend but they reminded her that they don’t mess with her.  They all dragged her one by one. 

I felt bad for her because I knew she was suicidal, but I no longer feel bad.  I’ve seen her start fights with people then run and hide when confronted.  She’s also not self sufficient and comes off childish.  If I didn’t know her age, I would’ve never guessed she was 28.  She does/ says a lot of dumb things but I don’t say anything because it doesn’t affect my life.  She however has a comment for everything that I do/say.  I’ve never in my life came across such an opinionated person, she can dish it but she can’t take it.  Blue recently lost 4 friends because of her behavior and substance issues.

218,"TLDR: I couldn't afford my college offer, which I was proud to receive and now I feel demotivated/sad at how I have nothing to do and feel anxious that my future won't be better.

For a little bit of context, I'm 19 years old and just finished HS a few months ago (due to Covid). I'm not from the US, so I applied to US universities as an international student. As for my family, my mother is single and doesn't work and my dad left our family for another woman. He doesn't support me, but makes a fat salary (7 digits). I was always considered a ""smart"" student, but since middle school I never really saw myself as one or rather, my grades are far from the most important thing about me and I'd rather be known for my personality and how I treat other people.

In March, I received my uni applications back and most of them were rejections (7, to be exact). However, 2 of them were acceptances including my Early Decision university, which happens to be an Ivy League. While I never saw myself as an Ivy League type of student, something about the uni drew me in after hearing their representatives present about it in my school once. So while I didn't apply for the school for the prestige, it still had it as an Ivy League.

However, after the euphoria I felt after seeing the acceptance, my heart sank upon seeing how much I had to pay. Tens of thousands of dollars per year. I applied for need based financial aid from the school, thinking I just needed to get accepted. But as it turns out, the financial aid profile factored in both my parents' income, something I didn't know during application and something that I admit I should've looked more into. I just assumed that, since the unis often promised to be affordable during their presentations, they'd consider my family background (which I explicitly wrote down). 

I spent a bit of time after that searching for other means to support my education. I wrote to the university itself with backing from my school (I went to a boarding school abroad on full need-based scholarship, so my mother barely paid for my expenses these past few years). I tried applying for local scholarships that offered tuition to Brown. But I got rejected outright by all of these steps. I even looked into the loans offered by the uni, but upon calculating how much I'd have to pay back yearly, I thought it'd place immense financial pressure on me for another decade and is ultimately not worth it. 

It's been slightly over a month since I've given up on attending that college. Yet somehow I still get immensely sad thinking about what might've been. I'm stuck at home for another year, where I pretend to be religious and hide my identity (both ideologically and sexual). I no longer have many friends here in my home country after leaving and starting a life elsewhere, whereas most of my current friends are spread across the world. My family loves me and I love them, but as I hide so much of the underlying cause of my pain from them, they can't support me as much as they try. I've lost my will to do most things, including things that I used to love but I used to consider myself a driven and outgoing person. I already brought up therapy with my family and they said I can go (because they'll be paying as I have no money of my own) but I also have to try other things like getting out of my room and doing something productive (among other things but those other things I disagree with, like praying more)

I keep on thinking what could've been if I asked, or if I did more research on their financial aid system. Or if I applied to another school that didn't use that system. I keep on feeling like all the problems I face right now would've been solved if I had an education to look forward to next year. I'll be applying again to other universities this year, but I worry that I'll be rejected or not get financial aid. That I'll be forced to continue my studies here and keep on experiencing the loneliness and mental oppression that I have been feeling since I got back for years to come. I also feel immense shame when people ask me about my uni plans. I know all of my friends will either be going to university this fall or do a gap year they've been planning for months. Whereas I'm even struggling to begin looking for something that I can do, and honestly aren't motivated to engage in anything like a job or volunteer work. 

I also feel sad because I realised I liked the positive attention I got for being accepted into my school. Coming from an Asian country, everyone except my family who're slightly less traditional, always told me I wasn't enough either explicitly or implicitly. Everyone could do everything better than me and I was never good enough, which is why I think I shifted from working on school to working on my personality, which I believe is better in the long run anyway. Still, for the first time, it felt good to have an achievement recognised that I can take full credit for and be proud of (I tend to deflect praise because of my upbringing, always downplaying my achievements or directing it to someone else in my team). Even in the beginning, when people used to congratulate me, I'd have to tell them ""Oh, but I'm not going"" and feel so ashamed. People have told me it's nothing to be ashamed of because it's not my fault that I'm not going and getting accepted is already an achievement, but idk, I still feel bad. And every time I think about me being stuck here for a year, and the anxiety of whether or not I'll be accepted into another university with financial aid or spend probably the next decade or so in my home country (at least), I just spiral again into this unmotivated mood.

So I guess what I'm trying to ask is, how exactly do I pick up my pieces and get the courage to try again? Both to try and make the most of this involuntary gap year, but also to try to apply for a university without falling apart? Also, how do I comfort myself in this situation? And not compare myself to my friends who have things going on in their lives?",27Jun2020,1

222,"Ive felt lonely my entire life, and Ive become depressed, and I have lost touch with my emotions.


I found someone a few months ago, and we became a couple. We became almost inseparable. I loved her, and she loved me. We knew we wanted to be with eachother forever. It may sound cliche, or stupid. But we honestly felt that way.


Things have changed since then. I learned recently that she is confused about her sexuality. She tells me that she genuinely felt all the things she felt about me. But now she doesnt know where her heart lies.


We broke up shortly, but we got back together because we couldn't handle the separation. And we became partners. Which to me I guess meant, not quite a couple.


She told me she doesnt want to lead me on, and I told her I wanted to wait. And if anyone of us moved on, we would. She told me we would be bestfriends forever even if that happened. 


We had a long conversation. Back and forth of essentially what weve said. I told her I would wait, until I moved on. She asked me if I was sure. I said yes. She then said ""ok."" Then said she has to go to sleep.


I messed up, but I couldnt stop myself from saying all the things I said. I know she has feelings for me, and I do too. But this unsureness in her heart has shown her that maybe these feelings are not what she thinks.


I feel like we could have something special, I think we have a bond thats rare. But I understand that shes going through something that take priority. But I just. I dont know. I dont want to lose her. I dont want her to hate me for wanting to wait and hope that she loves me that way again. I cant help that. But I also dont know how to help her. Am I just impatient? Did I screw this all up? I just want answers. Everything in my life seems to never work out. 


All I ever wanted in life was someone to hold, and to talk to. And for them to shar their feelings with me.

I live in Australia and he is originally from here as well. I want to get something online that based in the US, perhaps even precisely down to a California based business, because it'll be easier to purchase something online from here and then I don't have to send it myself. 

I'm struggling to think of what to get him, plus just not being familiar with businesses/companies/online stores in LA or the wider US.

He is a budding screenwriter trying to make it in the film/TV industry. He likes fashion/style etc but isn't as material as he used to be (isn't rolling in money theee days because of pursuing screenwriting). I love film and film history myself so we get along like a house on fire when it comes to that.

She said that her friend, Red (a girl), was in a call with her cousin, Dit (a guy), and Dit did this, the word ""monkeys"" said nigger. My sister said that Red and Dit are both culpable. Red should have called out her cousin for saying it. Red said that it isn't her problem that she should go to Dit. My sister went to Dit and Red and said do not use that word and I want an apology. No apology. Red said she doesn't need to do anything about it because it is not her problem and she isn't involve. I think my sister is using the bystander are culpable argument but not by name.

Red said that if we contact her mother, it is over. My sister and Red are not friends.

I have Red's mom's number and I have Dit's info but not his parents number. How do I go around approaching this? My idea was to cyberstalk for Dit's parents info so I contact them. I live in a small town so it is possible.

232,"Ok this will be long because of backstory there's a TLDR at the bottom thanks for reading.

I need massive help please my husband and I live in an apartment downstairs is a very nice 49M he lives alone and he just really likes our company. Before I got pregnant with DD we would go down often. After giving birth in January I felt like a switch flipped, suddenly I was super scared of SIDS and pedos (no I will not and I am not a helicopter parent my kid will grow up playing outside for hours on end like I did and she'll be fine). 

After a month I finally brought her downstairs to meet the nice old man we'll call K he was outside smoking with his caregiver but when he saw us he put out the cigarette and went and washed his hands. Well when he started holding her he kept calling her his baby girl and his grand baby (we aren't related). Something immediately sent off every sense I have of ""don't let him near DD"", I don't know if it was the way he was looking at her, holding her or talking to her but suddenly I didn't want him anywhere near her. Which is strange because he seems very nice and very friendly.

So every time he sees me he asks where his baby girl is, or where his grand baby is. It doesn't make me angry its just every time he says it I get on high alert and I hate feeling that way so I always tell him she's sleeping (which isn't totally a lie she sleeps a lot).

Well today he said before we move he wants us to take a picture of him and her together. I was totally against it and looked at my husband and said no. We chatted for a while and he keeps asking why Im being a jerk to a lonely old man, he says the only thing weird about K is that he's a little obsessive over DD which in my head is already sending red flags.

Do I keep going downstairs with her or stay away until we move?

233,"I know I am the asshole in this situation. 

Anyway, here's the back story.

I am home from college (we were originally sent home because of covid but now we're well into summer) and I am staying at my mom's apartment. She is very strict about what I do in public, which she has every right to be, but I have had months of pent up anxiety, anger, and restlessness. I know everyone probably feels the same way, but I'm the dumbass that decided to leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lied to her earlier today and told her that I was going to my dad's house for the night to help him move/put together furniture as he had just moved. In reality, I was going to see two of my close friends at their house. About 3 hours after I left she somehow caught on to my plan and told me to return home immediately, and I did. Since then, I have been in my room (which happens to be a walk-in closet which is a whole other story). 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to leave for multiple reasons. 

1) I don't want to expose my mom if I did catch something

2) I can't stay in this godforsaken closet for the next 14 days

3) My anxiety and depression WILL get the best of me, there's no doubt about it

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do at this point. I don't even know if I can listen to reason right now, but I need someone outside of this situation to talk to.

Except for BumbiJumbi she’s...” Then she started to get tired so I took her to my guest room and she slept over.
The next day, I asked her if she remembered anything from yesterday and of course, her answer was no. I decided to go see my brother because of what she said and because I just wanted to see his face after a while. So I went over there, and we chatted and then I asked him,  “Do you like Sarah?” He laughed a bit and after he was done he replied, “That’s a bit random. Why do you want to know?” “Because, yesterday she was talking about how you were, ‘hot’. “ I responded nervously. My brother sat there and then answered, “...Yeah.” It got awkward after that, so I left.

The process is very collaborative and the songs all come from my mind. Even the way the songs sound (almost entirely) comes from my mind. The only thing I don't do is physically create the music.

250,"OK, so this is going to be way too long so I apologize in advance. 

 So I met my best friend 4 years ago in 2017. I was 17 back then (I’m 21 at the moment) and I was heavily depressed and I suffered from high levels of anxiety and stress. Back then, I had a few hospitalizations in a mental hospital and when I came out of them I can say that I wasn’t in good mental shape. That’s the moment I met my nowadays best friend. She was at the same point as I was (hospitalizations, depression, anxiety, etc). We were the same age and we both were about to get out of high school. 

 Anyway, I was able to graduate earlier and she got stuck there. I started my first year of college, got an excellent job, etc, etc. 

Like a year ago I started to get on with her mother (she’s one of my best friends too) because somehow I really get on with older people than I am. So the three of us started to hang out together. We started to exchange family stories (the crazy ones someone would laugh about it) and started to create characters according to our family’s stories which later became everyday acting. I mean that we started to act like them in a funny and playful way. 

 Somehow, that game got out of our hands to the point I can no longer sustain it. Those characters (our family members btw) were/are really mean and I feel like I am being constantly attacked. What do I try to say? Is that, at first, we would joke about each other’s insecurities in a healthy way, but I do feel like I am taking too personally and I cannot take it anymore.

 I am trying to remove a lot of my teenage year's trauma and I feel like I cannot do it as long as I keep doing that with them, especially with my best friend (the youngest one I met first). 

 I feel like I am being constantly attacked by her because we are both really insecure people and I feel like every step forward I make, she tries to undermine it or make it a joke.

 Some weeks ago, she asked me for help for a job interview and I agreed to stay in her house all night in order to help her. What she didn’t tell me before I went is that a friend of hers was there (a friend I don’t get along with, actually I can’t stand her) and she didn’t tell me about it until I was knocking her door. When I knocked on her door and she told me she was there, she said “I knew you were going to be really mad but I really need your help for my job interview” and I stared at her with a “wtf” face. I came in and helped her anyway. That was the moment I felt that something was not going well between us. Like two weeks later, I had a really important exam for college and since I was really stressed out she invited me to go to her house and study there. It was awful. I suffer from ADHD and she knows I cannot hear a single noise while studying, and she didn’t seem to care enough because since the minute I opened a book she wouldn’t stop making uncomfortable noises/playing music. 

 I literally don’t know what the fork is happening with her or why is she acting like that. This year I got promoted and I feel for the first time that I have the best job I could ever aspire for. My workmates make the best work-environment in the whole world. Every time I tell her how good my job is or someone nice that happened to me while at work she minimizes it. She has always told me that she wanted to work at my company, but never paid to much attention to that. 

 My mom’s friend (who is a psychologist) told me recently that maybe she’s jealous of me. But I don’t know what to believe. I honestly can’t tell and I can’t even believe that the one who is supposed to be my best friend would be jealous of me. 

 I have thought about breaking up the relationship I have with her and with her mom but they are the only friends I have. I get along a lot with my workmates but it’s not the same. I’m 21 years old and the youngest one there already has a family. 

 I don’t know what to do, and I don’t know what to think. 

 What do you all think by reading this? Thank you all in advance.",27Jun2020,1
252,"So basically, ever since middle school I have been interested in typical girly things like makeup and stuff. However, I never told anyone because, in my family, gays are bad and any man that does something girly is gay, like wearing makeup, (but not doing manly things like sports is normal). Also, being bi is just as bad as being gay, to let y’all know how bad my family is. To explain what I mean, when I was in elementary school, we had to do tests in gym class, like run a lap, walk a lap, stuff like that. One day my dad saw a report card for gym and saw that everything was good except one thing, skipping (which according to my dad, is gay). He was so exited that I couldn’t skip that he told his entire work. Also one day we were leaving my grandparents house and my grandad was asking if we had everything, all our phones, chargers, and looking at the females of my family he said, purses? I decided to make a joke and said I left my purse, my dad said in a serious but kinda joking way “if you had a purse we are leaving you here” and my grandad said “if you owned a purse you can’t stay here.” I have always been honest with them (unless it’s an obvious joke) so they believe me when I say “I don’t like gays”, when they go on their rants about them. I only agree so I don’t get disowned or something, but I don’t really care if a person is gay or not. The way I see life is do what makes you happy, unless it’s a crime, don’t do crimes. Which is why I want to do makeup but can’t because of family.

However, now that I am in college living on campus (not now cause of quarantine but during a normal school year) I have opened up to some people who helped me experiment with nail polish and painted my toe nails for the first time and loved it. Everyone at college was cool with it and either complemented my nails if they saw them (I wear flip flops a lot) or just didn’t care. However, due to my family’s hatred of all things “gay”, I  was so terrified to ask I almost passed out due to anxiety. I feel like it will happen again so I haven’t worked up enough courage to ask a girl to show me how to do makeup properly (because they typically know what to do and how i need to do it to look good) cause I have only done my makeup while I was home alone. I know that I am bad at it and that I need some help (which is why I want to ask a girl).

So reddit, how do I build enough courage to ask a girl to do my makeup without passing out because of anxiety. The reason for the anxiety is because I’m afraid that people will treat me how my family treats gays. Based on my painted nails though, people won’t care, but nails aren’t makeup so I don’t know how they would react.

Also if I somehow offended anyone, I am sorry. I didn’t mean to offend , it wasn’t my intention to do so, I am sorry. Also I posted something similar to this the other day, if some of you think you heard the story before, but I was asking if wanting makeup meant I was gay instead of what is now. Also I now know it doesn’t mean I’m gay, so thinks for the advice there.",27Jun2020,1

255,"I've been in the mental health field for ~ 2 years now. Feeling super burned out, I took a week off in hopes of resetting my routine and building a self-care plan.I promise this next part is related and will be tied together so bear with me. I also just moved and have been so busy with work I've either not had time or energy to settle in, so that's my plan for the week off. But then low and behold, someone breaks into my car and steals my checkbook with my DL # on it, so now I've got to take steps to deal with that BS. I'm pretty God damn over humanity. I dont think anyone deserves my help anymore, and I don't know how I can continue on in this field now. I feel like an imposter consistently as a therapist (granted I've only had my license for one year), I don't feel like I am actually helping anyone, and I get paid shit. I get paid $10/hour less than person in my position before me and I have more licensure and probably $20k less/year than anyone else in my department. I've had thoughts of ""I should have been an engineer"" at least since quarantine started. I'm pretty tech savvy and I enjoy doing tech stuff in my spare time.

 So I guess now that's off my chest, there's two things I want advice on. Should I say screw mental health? And if I were to get into a tech field, what would people recommend? I would want something I could do online learning (I did that for social work school) that would provide something with starting salary of at least $60k, and hopefully not more than 1.5 years of courses. I like repairing stuff, problem solving, etc- computers (though I've never built one or repaired one I've researched it some already(, home theater, home automation

259,"Me and my best friend have been friend has for about four years, recently we've spent less and less time together though. 

It started when we joined a new school and we went to different classes. I was at the time under a lot of pressure as my big sister was in the hospital so I had to live alone and take care of the house, dog and school simultaneously. I felt lonely during these times as I had no friends other than my best friend. 

The first time I felt like our friendship was crumbling, was when we had to go to a theater show. No one wanted to sit with me, so I asked her if maybe I could sit with her, but she declined saying she'd rather sit with her classmates. I wish I had told her how much I needed her then, because she now underestimated the gravity of our current situation.

I got into a long distance relationship a few months ago, which seemed to make her contact me less. We would usually text eachother, invite one another and generally have a good back and forth communication, but all of that seemed to come to a halt. 

My boyfriend made a discord server for all of our friends, including my best friend. At first it was ok, but then too many people joined the server and my best friend and a few others really didn't feel comfortable with it, as that meant they would have random people joining their conversations out of nowhere.

My boyfriend then got a job where he would work 4 days of the week, meaning I would be alone for four days a week for several weeks. I would wait for my best friend or one of the others to come online, but their status would stay offline. Then I would open up a game to check on some of stats, and guess what, they were already playing together while talking in a DM.

I felt distraught and excluded as my best friend seemed to completely stop inviting me and the other's hadn't even thought of asking if I wanted to play. I brushed it aside and later talked to a mutual friend who was part of our friend group, who explained it was never intentional, so I decided to trust him and not think further about it.

They still wouldn't join the server as often, I still would never get invited and me and my best friend grew further apart. 

It all came to a head when we had planned to watch me play outlast, I am a pussy and get very easilt scared so I wanted some of them to watch me out of comfort, but after hours of waiting, no one had come on to the server. We messaged them on the server and no response for another hour, that's when I had enough. I practically begged for someone to answer me so I didn't waste any more time waiting and hoping for a reply and finally they answered with a ""maybe some other time"".

I wrote some childish status about ""not wanting unreliable people in my life"" and my best friend decided that was intended to be only towards her.

She decided to then avoid me, for two weeks, which meant I had no one for two weeks. Everyone who I hung out with would be in a DM with her and I would be alone for two weeks. She told me this after writing the messages pasted below, as I talked to her today.

The fact that she abandoned me on purpose for two weeks is what hurts me the most, because I kept telling myself ""she would never intentionally avoid you, she's your best friend after all"". My world is honestly shattered and I don't know what to do, I know if I voice my opinion it will just complicate the situation, but I really don't want to sit and let these feelings slowly build up till I burst. 

My mental health has declined because of this situation, because of me feeling like this for months, I have been unable to eat much of anything, I sleep most of my days away, I feel exhausted and can't even focus on activities I once found fun. I've given up essentially.

What should I do? What can I do to mend my mental health and friendship?",27Jun2020,1
260,"**Trigger warning for rape needs to be added to this. No deep details but it is a key part of the story. **


My husband has a rare lung condition that is 100% genetic. His whole family has gotten tested since we found out. His dads test came back as negative and his mom was of course positive. Per the Dr both parents would have to have the gene for him to have this condition and it to manifest the way it is. 
He told us this months ago when we first met with him and my husband doesn’t really care to ask his dad about the results so it’s not been discussed. 
His dad mentioned today that his test came back negative. (His parents are divorced and his mom left him and his brother with dad at a very young age). 
We know from a very traumatic Thanksgiving his mom was raped by her father. 
(He looks identical to his grandfather) (She also tried reporting it as a child and ended up in a group home because the family claimed she was unstable and lying. The police were also very buddy buddy with the rich powerful grandfather).  We’re not 100% sure it happened after she was an adult. However she was her parents care taker until her fathers death. 
My concern is he is unknowingly the product of incest. 
My husband struggles already with alcoholism and I’m afraid this will make things worse. 
My ask for advice are- 
Do I come clean with my concerns and have my husband potentially hate me/ and withdraw himself from his already stretched family ties? He could potentially just shut down and drink himself to death. 
Or do I keep quiet and not say anything? We have a child together and potentially discussed having others. I worry about my child’s health.

My parents are divorced.  she is convinced she's not gonna tell our father's side of the family. (hence why I'm using she/ her pronouns)  It came as a shock.

268,"So a while back I found a channel on streaming site for gamers called Twitch that caught my attention, more on that later.
 I usually don't like to give out clout to people who make stuff since a lot of it is boring in my opinion.  I don't even want to follow my cousin's channel since it's just Call of Duty and Fortnite stuff. 
Not to sound sexist but I usually do not like the female streamers. Mainly the popular ones that are controversial. They sort of ruined my view on the gamers who are female. They all just seemed to be basic girls using their bodies to get away with guidelines and get followers easily. They tend to play whatever is popular to get under the radar. 
I had that toxic mindset until I saw this one streamer who mostly makes streams of a fighting game called King Of Fighters. I found the channel because i got curious about that franchise after seeing one of the characters in Smash Bros. Her channel and two others were the only ones live on the KOF category. She was the only English speaking one.
Long story short, I was impressed with her channel. She knows a lot about games, she is charismatic and she seems to hold that specific game series close to her heart because of her childhood she's mentioned before. Seeing her channel made me regret saying and thinking bad stuff about female gamers and that there is actually good ones out there. They are just being overshadowed by the rest.
Last time I checked, she only had 119 followers on Twitch. I thought she would have more followers and it is sad. She deserves way more and I wish I had a platform to help the kid out. There is way too many channels that just feel like clones of each other.

She was more hoping for excitement and got met with the “your not ready and abortion is an option” speech. Which I know may seem harsh but we have a pretty strict no bullshit rule with one another.

278,"hi! this is a throwaway account because i don’t want my mother to find this. i’m still a minor and under her roof, which is part of this problem. this might be long, so grab a snack if you want to read. if u don’t i understand :) 

my mother was diagnosed with BPD before i was born. we’ve always had issues, since i was younger; she had a bad childhood and was sexually abused, along with being borderline. so she often used my child-ness and stupidity to encourage me to be overly sexual and even tried to teach me to masturbate when i was 3-4. along with this, she does “typical” borderline things, such as threatening suicide often and claiming it’s my fault, not taking me to school on occasion, partying/doing drugs/getting very drunk, kicking my siblings out of the house after traumatic events, etc. every day is really hell, along with her casual belittling of my appearance and general life performance. 

i’m only at her house 50% of the time, though! my parents are divorced, on account of the BPD, haha, and my dad is very nice. however, every time i bring up him getting full custody, he just says it’s “not possible.” let it be known: i know legal fees are super fucking expensive. but my father is VERY wealthy and we live a very comfortable life, to the point where he’s definitely able to spend that much. 
i know it’s possible, because we live in a state that values the “child’s best interests”, so they take the child’s word seriously. as well as the fact that i have photographic evidence against my mother and witnesses. 

so hearing my father say that he can’t take me out of a situation that he knows is bad (my mother did the same things to him, and constantly belittled him for his appearance like she does to me) really hurts. he was the one who revealed her diagnosis to me in the first place, so i know i’m not just being a dramatic “i hate my mom!” teenager... i just don’t understand. there’s a problem, there’s a solution that is VERY available to us, and he won’t do it. it feels like he doesn’t care about me, although i know that’s not logical thinking. 

it’s a tough situation and i would really appreciate your advice on this, whether it be how to convince my father to go to court over this, or books/resources about coping with borderline parents. thank you very much for reading and responding, and i’m sorry this was so long! :) have a good day or night.

279,"TLDR at end. 

Lately my emotions have been all over the place. One day I feel super happy and I guess untouchable, and everything around me seems good. Then the next day I feel so completely ~blah~ and that’s really the only way I can describe it. 

Tonight has been one of the worst nights I’ve ever had. A number of things have built up and are weighing on me, and I just feel like I’m ruining all of the relationships that matter to me. And I feel like all I do is talk about myself, which makes me feel like an awful friend. 

My mom is mad at me, my dad is tired of me being sad all the time (tonight he came into my room to tell me to “put on a better face tomorrow”), and my sister keeps saying (perhaps sarcastically, though it’s taking a toll) that I hate her. 

If I knew why I was feeling like this, I’d fix it. I don’t want to push everyone away, or walk around mopey all the time. But no matter what I’m doing I end up with this little voice in my head reminding me of all the things I’ve done recently that are perfectly good reasons for the people who matter most to me to leave our relationships behind. 

I don’t know if this even makes sense. But I’m asking for advice on what to do? I don’t know if I need to talk to a professional, or just push through it, or if I’m just overreacting. Any advice would be appreciated. I just want to feel like myself again. 

If it matters i’m 18F. 

TL;DR: I feel like I’m ruining all of my relationships and like I can’t do anything to fix it. I don’t feel like myself and my emotions are all over the place. Advice on how to stop feeling like this/how to handle it?",27Jun2020,1
280,"Now, recently i realized all the movies, music, games, I've been playing all my life other than studying had some sort of art in them, were manipulated by media owners(they) to potray a general idea for the public to follow to produce a certain effect in the society so they'd continue to live easy lazy life,,, now that i realized it, i realize I've never felt art in my entire life, meaning remove media has removed my sense of direction, the near surroundings around me don't feel the same or if they do they still pretend that media is""cool"", and i see my parents bickering away, frustrated even at the smallest details, pushing us to be slaves of the system unless i build ideas from my education and build on them( I'd consider that flow). So all this has led me to deterioration in terms of activity, education, friends, cuz (everything used to dictated), now i don't feel the strength to follow through with my own instincts .. I would but i question them. So currently I'm thinking of isolating myself from pop media and missing out on society to actually understand the society and probably find something worth my life and education.. I really don't want to be aggressive to get my point across. My parents have been wrong a lot and they did this all the time... Am i trapped or should i follow my instincts and stick to em?..



For me i feel i have to live with less of societal noise which is the opposite of what I've been. Doing thisbwhole while cuz as i did stuff for people to know me. Now i don't have a direction. How do i even choose anything and not fret it is a trap.. 


I'm currently thinking of disconnecting myself off media for 30 days and fall back on my post grad education, and economic, social, theories to understand better and maybe hold some goverment power and removing this unnecessary deviation for students to exist and to come.? 
If this is a trap! Convince me now and save a terrorist.",27Jun2020,1
281,"So my girlfriend just received news that her best friend will be gone for a year with no way to talk to eachother, and she won't tell her why.

282,"To start off, I’m a senior this coming year of HS so it’s a little drama filled. Im a real lone wolf at home and don’t ask for advice; but I desperately need it right now. 

I have a best friend (for sake of the post will be called “A”)and our group.We had two new girls (who are best friends) join 2 years ago, though before school started this year they broke things off and one left. The one that stayed (will be referenced as “B”) now joined me and A’s best friend circle, now making it a three way BFF triangle between us all. And tbh I felt kind of jealous. 

Over that time I have felt more and more left out since the two have a job together, and all they really talk about is the job and all the drama in it. 

They talk all the time like I’m not there and I try and talk to them about things they like and they brush me off. I’m also in a sport (that has literally saved my life and been my home for the last 5 years) and I have politely hinted at them that I want them to come and what time, where etc. they showed up once only after I slightly begged them to please come.  

Friend B is great and we get along pretty good together but she ignores me more times then talks to Me. And friend A doesn’t talk to me as much about things anymore and usually just turns her back on me. 

So over the last semester I have progressively just been on my phone reading more and more instead of talking to them, and I have also been slightly aggressive when talking to them. (I feel kind of toxic for being aggressive) They also didn’t wish me a happy birthday on my birthday or anything even though I go above and beyond for theirs; they don’t have to get me anything just send a text saying they love me on it or something to show they care. My teammates wished me one over text along with my coach. And a best friend from a couple years who I stay in contact with wished me one too. 

I confronted them about how I feel left out and stuff and all they said was “we need to talk more” a couple days later and it was spring break.

I haven’t talked to them and vice versa since March of 2020. I miss having a best friend but we’re they ever my best friends? 

Thank you for getting this far PLEASE give me some advice: should I work harder with A and B, become a log wolf for my senior year of HS, or should I reconcile with my old best friend from years back who I stay in contact with?

283,"For context, I’m a 16 year old female and he’s an 18 year old male. So, my dad is being deployed in about a week and a half and I’ve been taking it really hard. And on top of that, I’ve been having typical teenage girl confidence issues and there’s been some drama surrounding things that have happened in the past. And everything that’s happened in America is really affecting me because I’m a young black girl and I have a lot of black males in my family that I’m extremely close with. 

Now my boyfriend, lets call him D, seems like he’s always in a bad mood or he’s upset or complaining about something. Now normally, this is no big deal because I usually just let him talk it out or vent or provide emotional support.

Recently, though, it’s been so difficult because of the things I’m currently going through. I’m having a hard time juggling his feelings and mine. Tomorrow, my dad’s having a going away party and invited him so he could meet him before he gets deployed. And D really wants my dad’s approval, so he’ll be here tomorrow. I was thinking of talking with him after the party and letting him know how I’m feeling and asking for a small break, but is this even a good time to do it, right after he meets my dad? 

Also, should I even do it at all? One on hand, I don’t think it’s fair to him that I can’t be there for him like he needs me to be because I can’t figure out my own feelings. I don’t expect him to completely focus on me and ignore his own problems considering the fact that I usually suppress my emotions or deal with them on my own. It’s just that I’m already dealing with so much and it’s overwhelming having to help him deal with everything too.

On the other hand, I don’t want to turn my back on him when he needs it, and he’s already sad, I don’t want to make it worse. And it’s unfair that I’m “running as soon as things get rough”, according to my mom. Which, I don’t think is true, because it’s not like we have issues with each other that I don’t want to work out, it’s just me. 

I just don’t want to tell him that his problems are overwhelming me because I don’t want him to think he can’t come to me when he needs to vent, or that I don’t care about him and his problems.

Can I please get advice on how to deal with this?",27Jun2020,1
284,"About 4ish months ago my gf was kissed by a guy that we both used to work with at our job when I wasn’t there. To give context I was about to turn 18 while she was 17 and the guy was early 20’s. Let me be clear and say she did not want anything to do with this guy and I trust her so I knew this wasn’t anything to hurt our trust at all. The thing about this was that this guy is a creep he would take his lunch breaks and come stalk my gf and I while we were working ( we worked in the same department). Leading up to all of this I feel so guilty I should have seen it as this dude was literally borderline stalking her on his breaks. On top of that he had her Snapchat previously to him acting weird and he started hitting her up asking her to go out and saying that she didn’t have to tell me about any of this (him saying this was a day prior to what he did and at around 1 AM so I was asleep at the time so I wasn’t aware). So basically what happened at work was he followed her around late at night when all the managers and customers were basically gone and when no one was around he forced himself on her and kissed her. He was fired the next day but he still occasionally comes into the store. To me all of this feels like dumb teenager stuff and I just need to let go, justice was served and we have no problem anymore. But this was almost 5 months ago and I still remember when I picked her up how she was crying in my arms and I still want to break this guys neck. I feel so guilty like I should have seen the signs and told him to get lost when we were at work and I feel like I lost that protection she feels around me. I’m still upset and angry and over all feel like I failed her. I know we’re young and all and this probably reads like a middle school rant but I just can’t get over how a 23 year old can force himself on a 17 year old like that. How do I get over this?",27Jun2020,1
285,"Hi, so in an effort to keep the background short, from a newborn to toddler I lived with my abusive, drug addict, meth dealing, scummy bio dad. (Mom passed away right before I turned 4) he was in my life until was 7 and I was officially adopted and they could waive his rights to visit me. He called all the time until I started refusing his calls when I got older.

I have a 13 year old sister in foster care, he's her primary guardian.

He's currently in danger of losing her forever(it should have happened a long ass time ago...) 

He was in jail until recently, only a few months into his 2-5 year sentence. He got out becuase he has cancer and had a stroke. 

He's back trying to get custody. 

He. Wont. Stop. Calling. Me.

He calls me ""sweet heart"" and ""princess"" and says he loves me, mind you I never actually answer the phone, he leaves voicemail. I have picked up a few times on accident when hes called from different numbers. This man was never a father to me, my adoptive dad, my grandfather, was. 

I don't want to tell him to get the fuck out of my life, incase some how he manages to get custody of my little sister again. I love her to peices and I don't want to lose contact with her again. I'm only 20 so I can't petition for custody in her state. 

I'm being worn thin, he called me 40 times the other day. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

I don't want a dozen voice messages in my inbox from the man who threw me down a flight of stairs after I was ""Too much of a burden"" after my mom died. I don't want to change my number  because my little sister has it memorized, at it's the only was she can really reach me when she switches homes. 

I just really don't know what to do anymore. I feel like at this point I'm waiting for the man to die, so he will stop haunting my life. He's been shot 8+ times, nearly drowned, been in multiple car/motorcycle accidents, been stabbed, this is his 3rd time with cancer. The man is a fucking cockroach. With the health issues he's caused me, I feel like he's going to out live ME. 

I have a general feeling of helplessness with all that's going on in the world, my health, and now this dirtbag is out of jail.

287,"to make a long story short: 
my dads girlfriend (I’ll call her T) and her son (i’ll call him animal) has been staying with us since quarantine started. 
animal is an immature piece of shit and is so incredibly rude and appropriates the fuck out of other cultures. 
and T was* a great positive influence. she always talked about her political views and i know that she’s racist, transphobic, &amp; homophobic. but since i’m nice and have to respect my dad since shes his gf i just decided to bare with her. 

anyways, this week T and animal came with my dads side of the family and i to the beach. 
drama happened because her son vandalized the beach neighborhood sign and she didn’t do anything to tell him that vandalizing public property is wrong????
instead she got so mad at my cousins for calling him out for his ridiculous disgusting behavior. 
T made homophobic comments at my cousin who actually is gay and was so rude to her. she was threatening to beat up my cousins and was saying racist shit to them too (my cousins and i are half japanese and T said how theyre asian trash?) meanwhile her son was calling us rich white privileged bitches?? 
theyre white too and idk why T and animal kept bringing the race card into this. 
she is a “karen”. 

my siblings witnessed this and my other cousins. 
i was outside with my aunt because i felt myself getting an anxiety attack so i couldn’t hear things T said. 
anyways, the next day after this drama, T was texting me all this crap and won’t say shit to my face. her apology towards my cousin was fake as fuck and i was in the corner of the room trying to not laugh bc her apology was bullshittttt. 
then she turned around and talked shit about my cousin to ME VIA TEXT. i never responded to her. 
i haven’t spoken to her in 2 days either and i really don’t want to. ive jsut been in silence and only communicated w/ my cousins and aunt n uncles. 
T embarrassed herself in front of my whole family and ruined the vacation. 
my dad is also mad at me for some bs reason so i haven’t spoke to him. 

i’m moving in with her within the next couple weeks too and i know she’s going to try to talk to me again. i want to respect my dad since he’s with her. but i really don’t want to associate myself with someone who offended my cousins. and talked shit about who we are and made homophobic remarks. even political wise shes said offensive stuff about the current events too but as already said, she is racist. 

how do i talk to her again. she hasn’t even apologized to me. i don’t want to talk to her. and i don’t know why my dad is upset with me either. 
it’s so stupid. 
i don’t wanna go into every detail about the drama but this is just the bare surface. 

the thing that makes me so sad is the fact that i wanna talk to my dad again.  i am afraid to because i know he gets mad at me easily and am treated like shit. 
but anyways, when T talks to me again, what do i say and how should i act. the last thing i want to do is argue and waste my breath. 
btw i’m 20 and also wanna move the fuck out but it isn’t too easy to do that since i’m also in college. another thing that is too complex to share here haha.

295,"I think that one of my best friends needs serious psychological and psychiatric help, but I don't know what to do. Just for context: we have been been close friends for about 3 years now; I am 2 years her senior. She has always been interested in spirituality, but in the past month I think she has become seriously involved with magic (i.e. talking about curses, karma, sacrifices, etc.). Today, she could not stop repeating that she had committed an unforgivable act, which she would not disclose to me despite my relentless questioning. I finally came to the conclusion that she believes that she has sold her soul to the devil as she mentioned having to baptize herself to reverse her wrongdoings. I was the most freaked out when she told me that she needs to pass her magic onto me so that I can reteach her and make her believe in it again (I don't know what she meant by this).

I am terrified. I am unacquainted with magic and curses and whatnot, but I truly believe that this most recent behavior stems from extremely buried psychological issues and trauma. She has severe abandonment issues, which she has told me. She had been talking to a boy she met off Tinder on and off for two years (never seriously until a few months ago), but it seems like he has moved on. I think she cannot bear the pain over another person in her life leaving her so she has turned to magic. Our friendship has passed the point of being toxic, and it honestly feels like she uses me as a therapist and nothing more (i.e. 3 hour + FaceTime calls on a daily basis). Frankly, I don't feel qualified to deal with some of the things that she tells me.

Help! I seriously do not know what to do. Although I am unhappy with our friendship right now, my primary concern is my friend's mental health and sanity. Is there anything I can do? At this point I am worried that she could seriously hurt herself or others.",27Jun2020,1

ive been in a facebook community for a long time, ive interacted with many different people, some good and some bad, but about 2 years ago around this time this amazing person whom we will call X came into my life. it was a weird time for the both of us, i lived in a different state and so did he. i was single but he was in a relationship that was ending. we started talking on facebook and eventually the conversation moved to text message/calls, i had never done the online thing, it was just weird to me really. i fell in love with him deeply, he was just an amazing person all around, by this time he had already ended his relationship with his longterm girlfriend and was beginning to pick up the pieces of his life and i was happy for him and hopeful. my situation has always been tough and i was always very open with him about it, there was never secrets between us. we both were in love. i cant describe how beautiful our bond and friendship was - it was like i had known him my whole life. we were entwined by the soul as he would say. eventually, we started to sort of drift apart and due to my situation i was accepting it but with the reassurance we would remain in each others lives, soon enough our daily texting became to once a week texting, we wouldnt talk for a week.. although it hurt we were letting each other rock. he truly helped me and healed me whej i was down and i will always be grateful for him and for what we had. we remained closed friends and knew where we stood but most importantly, we loved each other. the last couple of months of 2019 nov-dec we started to become close again, we would call each other and catch up, we would stay on the phone for hours telling each other secrets and telling each other i love you. it was amazing. 2020 rolls around, my life is getting back on track and we have huge plans, he was finishing up his PC and his birthday was coming up (FEB 14) so he showed me his set up and i noticed he was missing a mic so i told him to link me what mic he wanted and i would gift it to him for his birthday. i did. he loved it! for his 30th birthday his family had gifted him a trip to the motherland since he had family there, last time i talked to him on the phone was the end of feb. we ended the call with i love you and him telling me about his trip. he said he would message me while he was there, he was leaving first week of march and staying there two weeks.

we didnt talk those two weeks, i was letting him enjoy himself. around this time is when covid started to popoff. he got back from his trip, and he decided to go home to his parents house since he was going to quarantine for 14 days, we had set up a date to be together all i was waiting on was a call for me to give me the ok to go be with him since he wasnt gonna ride out the whole 14 days at his parents' home. while he was home, he was spending time with his family and updating facebook - which i was following.  last couple of days of march i started to feel ill, started to feel ill around march 24, some cough and sore throat, merch 25, really started to feel it, didnt understand what was going on, weird sickness. march 25 was the last time X posted on facebook, beautiful picture of his moms renovated kitchen and a picture of his last meal. march 26, im REALLY ILL, not feeling good, checked his facebook and saw no updates, found it odd.. but normal. at the end of the day i was really sick i ended up puking, decided i was gonna rest all friday. at about 10am im laying in bed, and i get a text from his sister.. telling me he had passed the morning before, idk what it was, but im pretty me feeling that way the day before was a part of me leaving with him. i think about him everyday and try to live for him everyday and try my best for him everyday. i dont think i'll ever find someone like him again. i waited for that phone call and it never came........",27Jun2020,1

305,"i have known my best friend for almost 9 years. i realize about a month ago that i am a very possessive, needy, and optimistic (always hyper and cheerful) friend. last week i had the bright idea to only text her on 2 occasions: when she texted me, and to say goodnight (we have been saying gn for so long that it is has become a habit)

i thought this would show that she can’t go long without talking to me like i cant go without talking to her. instead, it just proved my observation that i need this friendship more than she does.

again, it has only been a week. however, the amount of times i wanted to text her is horrible. 

she is the only friend i normally talk to, but she has many friends and a boyfriend that she has met online (never talked to in person). 

is this wrong of me to do? should i keep doing this and wait it out?",27Jun2020,1
306,"Okay first of all my grandma is what you call a self centered, out right mean with not one ounce of compassion . She has tortured my mum and dad throughout their lives . She pushed my dad to kill himself when I was only 6 . I fought with her 2 years ago because she was saying something mean to my mom . I have not been on talking terms with her since then . But she has tried to initiate conversation. I come from an Indian family where the family leaves together. Anyway , I am moving out next year and I don’t have to deal with this . I do worry about my mom but she has to hang in for a year or 2 . Anyway now I’m going to a temple and she will offer me money(small amount ) to donate to the temple just like how she gave to my cousins . How am I going to say without her going all out on me . Because when she gets angry she’ll shout and tell every single person . And the excuse will be in the name of god . How do I go about this ? I have been hiding from her for now .

308,"I try my best to feel and understand others as much as I can. Of course, I know, I’m obviously no psychic.

I want to help my friends, and whoever else to better their life,  feel validated and loved. I just want to be useful.

But I’m too ignorant. 

I’m always around in group chats and discord servers with my friends, and often, people rant and ask for advice. I try my best to contribute as best I can, but sometimes it’s just so hard to organize all of my thoughts and write them in little paragraphs, so I always end up saying what I don’t mean. I have difficultly in being able to get my point across. It  just makes me seem to reek of ignorance. And I do, but I think you get the idea of what I mean. 

Right now, it seems like around me is suddenly going through so much, and I try my best to be there for them all. But again, I’m just so fucking useless and stupid. I’m no help. I try to be there for them, but all I can do is sympathize and try to give my shitty advice on bettering this situation that I don’t completely understand myself. I can’t put anything into words. 

Heck, I’m even bad at being there for my best friend, because of my idiocy. I have another friend that’s pretty good at it though (we’re all in a group together) and I’m really grateful for him. But I want my best friend to know that I care, too. I want everyone to know that I care.

316,"It’s hard to phrase it in the title but what I mean can be explained by this example and preface. I’m homeschooled and I go to a small co-op with other homeschoolers. One boy there also goes to my small church. So people around us constantly put us as a couple, only because we are a similar age and we are friends. As sad as it sounds, he is one of the only boys I text. It’s just all these contributing factors; same co-op, church, age. People always gawk at us and say “oooh! You love each other!!!” Of course not blatantly to our face but word gets around. For a Morse specific example my parents will always bring this friendship up in a romantic context. I will ask to go shopping for clothes and then out of no where my parents say “it’s because she wants to impress, that boy. Ohh, are you going to look nice for that boy?” What can I do? I can slap my face and deny my non-existent feelings but what good will that do? Both me and this boy don’t have feelings for each other. And what I need advice on is, how do I convince, what do I say, how do I teach my parents and the people around me that I can have a totally platonic (I think that’s the right word) relationship with a guy without me having to sacrifice the way I treat or hang out with him? As a side rant, it occurred to me that it’s kinda like a form of underestimation. Of course my family is religious and they have the belief system that a man is supposed to be the head of his family. But I don’t want to be tied down by that expectation. Supposedly a woman is expected to get married and be a nurturer while the man provides and there is nothing wrong with that at all (the function not the expectation) but for that label to be placed on me, which is what I see when being taunting about liking a boy, that “label”  is diminishing. Personally I’m a self-reliant person and I want to go to medical school, I want to save lives, I want to be independent. The last thing I can see myself doing is staying In a house all day with children. But to specify again, a stay at home, single, or any type of mother is a super hero, however it’s just not me.

I'm too scared to see a therapist, but I know that I need help. I'm an older teen, ftm, and some seriously messed up stuff has happened that I know I should report to a professional, but I'm too ashamed to even bring it up to someone. I know that no legal action can be done, but growing up I was assulted by my step sister at the time (her mother and my father are now divorced and we do not have any form of contact with her family) and my cousin, and they're both only 5-6 months older than me (both are females). I've always just tried to tell myself that we were just kids at the time and they didn't know any better, but it's really starting to mess with my head. It's getting really bad because my cousin will be coming over to our house more frequently now that it's the summer, and she follows me on all social media, so I'm constantly forced to communicate with her. I'm sorry if this just sounds dumb. I just need to get this off my chest and I honestly just don't know what to do anymore.

We got ""caught"" (an adult came into the room while it was happening) multiple times and I was always the one that got beat because my cousin and former step sister would blame me even though they were the ones who made me feel guilty for not ""playing"" with them when I tried to say no. I tried to tell my dad once when I was maybe 5 or 6 and he just screamed at me. I don't even know honestly. I've always just tried to behave so that people won't get angry with me, which I think is why I just let everything  happen to me for so long, and I feel like if I speak out everyone will try to say that I'm lying and be pissed. Especially my cousin. I also don't want to ruin my family relationship because my dad and my cousin's mom (his sister) only just stated to talk again last year because for about 7 years, they weren't on good terms (that's when my cousin stopped abusing me because she moved to another state. I was about 11 years old). I feel like if I speak up, I'll just ruin everything and they'll ignore each other again.

I'm getting older now, and I'll be starting college very soon, and I just feel pressured to have a relationship and to start having sex with other people but I can't I literally can't every time I've tried to get close to someone in that way, I start to panic and it just feels like I can't breathe and I just hate that I can't be normal.

  I ranted to my boyfriend about how much it upsetted me and how sad I am that I have to repeat everything. I sent him long ass messages regarding this, in hopes to receive comforting words. The problem is, all he sent was a ""it's okayy"" WHEN LITERALLY IT IS NOT OKAY !! 

  I know I complained over something shallow, but this was how upset I was that I had to restart. I got a little pissed off that his response was absolute garbage, so I responded with a ""thanks that's really helpful.""

After a while, S told me about how he was kicked out of a “group of gamer friends.” I felt bad for him and offered to be his friend, I did NOT know what I was getting myself into. He accepted and then added me on Discord.

On Discord: We continued to make some small talk and he asked me where I was from. I said “America” and then he called me a racist. He said I was a racist because America refers to all of North and South America, not just America the country. It wasn’t worth arguing so I just apologized and kept on making small talk. This was red flag number one.

Then he asked me if I have a snap chat, I said no. He then asked me if I play Fortnite. I told him yes, because I have an account, but I don’t play often. He then started begging me to get on and play with him. I got on and we played some matches, it was kind of boring but I was trying to be nice.

The next day: I didn’t message him for the next day because I didn’t think much of it. He then messaged me around 5:00 PM of how he was upset how I didn’t message him. Like wtf? I said sorry and just started making small talk with him. He asked me to get on Fortnite with him so I did. This is when I really started wishing I had never met him.

The next day he asked me what was my real name. I thought, why does he need to know? But I told him anyways. He then later asked if we could exchange pictures of each other so we could know what we look like. I thought this was sort of weird so instead of sending him a photo of me, I just sent him to a link of a YouTube video that I was in. 

As of now, he wants to talk EVERY DAY, ALL DAY on discord, PLAY NOTHING BUT FORTNITE, and tell me of how angry he gets at people sometimes. I’m considering just ghosting him, but I don’t want to hurt his feelings.

I (26M) have to do a medical check for a new job but at the clinic today the nurses told me because of a high temperature (37.7 C) and possible fever I have to reschedule to next week (precaution for Covid).

For as long as I can remember my body temperature has always been high averaging around 37.5 C and I am often picked up at airports and other places by the infra-red cameras even when I am completely fine.

I understand everyone is taking extra precaution with Covid at the moment but there is a high chance I will lose the job offer if the medical check cannot be completed soon. I have already become jobless since April because of the virus and now these new measures are quite possibly stopping me from getting a new job.

340,"So basically, ever since middle school I have been interested in typical girly things like makeup and stuff. However, I never told anyone because, in my family, gays are bad and any man that does something girly is gay, like wearing makeup, (but not doing manly things like sports is normal). Also, being bi is just as bad as being gay, to let y’all know how bad my family is. To explain what I mean, when I was in elementary school, we had to do tests in gym class, like run a lap, walk a lap, stuff like that. One day my dad saw a report card for gym and saw that everything was good except one thing, skipping (which according to my dad, is gay). He was so exited that I couldn’t skip that he told his entire work. Also one day we were leaving my grandparents house and my grandad was asking if we had everything, all our phones, chargers, and looking at the females of my family he said, purses? I decided to make a joke and said I left my purse, my dad said in a serious but kinda joking way “if you had a purse we are leaving you here” and my grandad said “if you owned a purse you can’t stay here.” I have always been honest with them (unless it’s an obvious joke) so they believe me when I say “I don’t like gays”, when they go on their rants about them. I only agree so I don’t get disowned or anything , but I don’t really care if a person is gay or not. The way I see life is do what makes you happy, unless it’s a crime, don’t do crimes. Which is why I want to do makeup but can’t because of family.

However, now that I am in college living on campus (not now cause of quarantine but during a normal school year) I have opened up to some people who helped me experiment with nail polish and painted my toe nails for the first time and loved it. Everyone at college was cool with it and either complemented my nails if they saw them (I wear flip flops a lot) or just didn’t care. However, due to my family’s hatred of all things “gay”, I  was so terrified to ask I almost passed out due to anxiety. I feel like it will happen again so I haven’t worked up enough courage to ask a girl to show me how to do makeup properly (because they typically know what to do and how i need to do it to look good) cause I have only done my makeup while I was home alone. I know that I am bad at it and that I need some help (which is why I want to ask a girl).

So reddit, how do I build enough courage to ask a girl to do my makeup without passing out because of anxiety. The reason for the anxiety is because I’m afraid that people will treat me how my family treats gays. Based on my painted nails though, people won’t care, but nails aren’t makeup so I don’t know how they would react.

If I somehow offended anyone, I am sorry. I didn’t mean to offend , it wasn’t my intention to do so, I am sorry. Also I posted something similar to this the other day, if some of you think you heard the story before, but I was asking if wanting makeup meant I was gay instead of what is now and I now know it doesn’t mean I’m gay, so thinks for the advice there.",27Jun2020,1

We dream about our future together, we say I love you, we have sex, we support each other and try to help each other navigate “adult things” like college and bills and whatnot. But today I brought up not having sex anymore because it makes me so anxious afterwards that I’m sick. Obviously I didn’t mean forever. I just meant for the summer until I can go to therapy and work through it all. When I first brought it up he just talked about how we’re super protected and that my brain is just going against me again. A little later though he started acting funny so finally I just asked him if he’d break up with me if we didn’t have a sex life. He dodged the question a bit and kept saying that sex was an important aspect of a relationship for him. I understand that, it’s important to me too, but my mental health is also important to me. Eventually he cane out and said yes it would be a dealbreaker for him. It completely caught me off guard that he would leave me over that, so I need some advice. Do you think I’m crazy in this or am I being reasonable?",27Jun2020,1
342,"recently i graduated high school and lately i’ve been thinking back on my experience and one person sticks in my mind. i had always been aware of this guy that was in my grade that was always so intriguing and mysterious to me that i knew of through our mutual friends. i thought he was attractive and he was shy, in a cute kind of way. we had exchanged words once or twice freshman year (but no formal introductions because it was obvious we knew of each other already) so it definitely wasn’t a “he doesn’t know i exist” situation, more of a “there’s no valid reason for us to approach each other,” since i never had an actual class with him. 

sometime in high school i followed him on instagram and i uncovered that we followed many of the same things and shared a bunch of random similar interests because i would see him liking the same posts as i would. i thought it was interesting but i never did anything about it. i developed a small interest in him, not a crush because i didn’t really know him as a person, just a form of intrigue. i had relationships and actual crushes on other people through high school but this guy was always in the back of my mind, just as someone who i wished i actually knew. i never told anyone about it just because i thought it was no big deal and i’m a private person. 

well, i obviously don’t see this guy anymore but i still think about him oddly enough. i don’t think he would be on my mind if i wasn’t aware that we share the same interests because in my head that means there could be a potential for something. that sounds kind of silly but i feel like i have to do something about it if he’s still on my mind. at this point i just want to get to know him because even if there is no potential of a romantic relationship, there is the potential of a good friendship between us due to our similarities. if i dmed him on instagram, it would be out of the blue and perhaps awkward since we’ve never had a formal conversation. i don’t want to drag anyone else into this because i’ve drifted apart from the mutual friends we had that initially made me aware of his existence. should i just try to get over it? if so, how? 

any ideas?",27Jun2020,1

344,"I'm not sure hot to start this, so I'll go ahead and just start from when I was really happy with life. 

So about this time last year, I was graduated from high school, I was in great physical shape, I went to the gym everyday with my friends and i was just very happy. I grew up a fairly bigger kid, and early last year I lost about 40 pounds and I looked good for the first time in my life. I was pretty big for somebody that was only working out for around a year and I was happy to be able to do it with my friends. 

Simulate a few months later, I quickly realized that I couldn't just workout everyday and focus on myself only. I had plans on going to college next semester, and I knew I needed a job. And this all kinda happened all of a sudden. So I got a job at a local grocery store making horrible money, and I started my first semester of college! And both of those took ALL of my time away. I couldn't just slack in school anymore, I couldn't just sleep in every day etc. Let alone I hated my job. So working a job I dislike, and going to school really has taken a toll on me mentally. I no longer can go to the gym in the middle of the day with my friends like I used to because of work and whatnot. And with my lack of time / motivation I've started to gain some weight and I slapped on about 20 pounds over the past year. And that's what made me happy. I loved working out every day... I'm still currently at my job working almost full time, and I'm pretty much saving every paycheck I get since I don't have to pay bills thankfully. So I don't really have motivation to even go to my job either. I just wake up miserable because I have nothing to look forward to. I know that it'll just be in my savings account next week anyways so I'm not even excited to be paid. And when it comes to school, I'm doing well and I'm only taking a few classes so im not too stressed out. 

But I need advice on how to be happy again and how to gain motivation to find time to workout and eat healthier. The only thing keeping me sane everyday is my girlfriend, besides her I find it hard to be genuinely happy when I work 5 days a week and then when I'm not working I'm doing home work. Can somebody just give me advice on what you'd do if you were in my shoes? I mainly really need motivation to take care of my body and workout again. It's the only thing that gives me purpose in life",27Jun2020,1
345,"I try my best to feel and understand others as much as I can. Of course, I know, I’m obviously no psychic. I can never truly understand what someone else is going through, especially if I haven’t gone through it myself. But I want to be able to be a shoulder to lean on. I want to help my friends, and whoever else to better their life,  feel validated and loved. I just want to be useful.

But I’m too ignorant. 

I’m always around in group chats and discord servers with my friends, and often, people rant and ask for advice. I try my best to contribute as best I can, but sometimes it’s just so hard to organize all of my thoughts and write them in little paragraphs, so I always end up saying what I don’t mean. I have difficultly in being able to get my point across. It  just makes me seem to reek of ignorance. And I do, but I think you get the idea of what I mean. 

Right now, it seems like around me is suddenly going through so much, and I try my best to be there for them all. But again, I’m just so fucking useless and stupid. I’m no help. I try to be there for them, but all I can do is sympathize and try to give my shitty advice on bettering this situation that I don’t completely understand myself. I can’t put anything into words. 

Heck, I’m even bad at being there for my best friend, because of my idiocy. I have another friend that’s pretty good at it though (we’re all in a group together) and I’m really grateful for him. But I want my best friend to know that I care, too. I want everyone to know that I care. But I’m just to useless and stupid to express it, too useless to truly help with anything, too useless to properly sympathize. 

I want to be a good friend. How do I grow up from this?",27Jun2020,1

355,"In middle school, there was a girl (I’ll call Kathy) who was horrible to me. She moved away and I didn’t hear from her until I was 20 years old. She added me on Facebook and i was originally interested in what she had to say because i thought it was bizarre that she reached out to me. We had a few conversations here or there when she’d message me, but nothing really extensive.

My middle school best friend called me shortly after to tell me this story about Kathy. She said Kathy is actually a part of her biological family but is not welcome in her family because she’s someone’s illegitimate child. She also mentioned that Kathy had a baby recently but doesnt have custody of the baby.

Fast forward to about a year later, Kathy reaches out to me again. She doesn’t know what my best friend told me. She said she is depressed and she has a huge problem that she doesn’t know will ever go away (I suspect it is about her child).  She also told me her baby’s father cheated on her with her ex friend. She repeatedly states that she is depressed...etc. 

If I don’t reply, she messages me again, saying “don’t you want to talk to me?”, “please reply” or something along the lines. I obviously was a little creeped out but I let it go, giving her the benefit of the doubt and convincing myself that it is important not to kick someone when they’re down. 

The days I spend with my bf, I don’t even look at my phone. I spent the entire day with Him but I noticed she was messaging me multiple times and asking why I’m not replying.  She said “where are you, do you know want to talk?” 

My bf is sitting next to me, in my bed and he just seemed creeped out by the whole thing. I replied , “I’m a little busy right now.” So I can get her to stop freaking out. She replied, “okay, when should I message you?”

Yes, the messages are constant. Our conversations are as frequent as my conversations with my bf. I really don’t know what to do. The entire thing is bizarre. I don’t want to be confrontational.",27Jun2020,1

357,"So I (20f) just got a phone call from my dad saying my brothers (22m) in hospital. He’s been bottled over the head, stabbed and beaten up, and they’ve also taken his car. 

We live in south west London but somehow this idiot finds himself across the bridge in north London. 

I have told this boy number our times that he needs to change his life. He can’t be doing illegal shit and act like someone he’s not because it will bit him in the fucking arse. 

He’s twenty three in two weeks and he’s got two baby and one on the way, each with a different person. 

He had no job. He drinks himself into a mess. He can’t afford his insurance. He can’t afford fuel. He can’t afford his kids. He can’t afford Jackshit. I earn £500 a month because I’m capped at sixteen hour and he takes a fifth every month. 

He pays me back but by doing this illegal shit. But it needs to stop. My dad and I have tried everything we have tried getting him help for his mental health but he rufuses. We’ve tried making him understand that his future is prison or dead before he’s thirty. 

We have two young sisters who are sixteen and I’m scared of them finding out about this. 

How can I get his life back on track because I don’t want to lose him. He’s my best friend and my little brother even though he’s older than me. I have tried getting him a job but he can’t keep it. 

He has been so close to people being shot and stabbed that he’s become numb to the danger. It just a another part of living in London theses days but he is too close to gangs and other people who have ill intentions and he wouldn’t be able to see them coming for him. 

I have no idea what to do but things need to change. So how can I help someone who doesn’t understand the danger their putting themselves in?

Do I just get him another job and hassle him to go every shift? Do I try and get him back into education and help him find something he wants to do? 

I’m supposed to be getting ready for work right now but all I can’t think about is if he’s okay. There still doing all there rest at the hospital but since he’s in north London I have to wait for someone to take me because I’ve ran out of money for the bus.

358,"So back in May, I was looking to move to a place in Philly. I found this ad on craigslist through this girl (E). I paid her my first month and deposit and got a signed ""agreement"" that I pay 650 a month and I gave her a non-refundable deposit and that I'm a month to month tenant.

Enter N. N comes in a few weeks later and says that the house is actually hers and that I will be paying HER the rent from now on. E tells me when she's out of earshot that the house WAS hers (it was her dad's before he passed, but she had some personal issues), but not anymore and that I need to continue to give E the rent month. I paid E my June rent through cashapp.

Today, N shows up again and tells me I didn't pay rent for June. I said I gave it to E because that's what she told me to do. N says E isn't paying anything and everything is in N's name, so E essentially stole my 650 for June. N is fine with it and we came to an agreement that I can pay her a little bit each week.

Now, my confusion comes from the fact that I don't know who the fuck is the legal owner of this home now. I don't know who I should be paying. I don't know who I should trust. I don't know if my rent from last month is a lost cause or what. N says she's going to change the locks tomorrow and kick E (and her wife) out.

So, my questions:

What are my options to recoup the 650 I paid to E if, in fact, she is not the one I should be paying rent to?

Am I going to have any issues legally from any sort of ""fight"" that may occur between E and N?

Is there any way I can figure out who is telling me the truth and who is lying to me? Because I'm totally confused at this point.

I posted this on /r/legaladvice as well.",27Jun2020,1

Which in return, I was expecting a counter-apology, but he just said “Thank you.” And then he was over it. 

I mean, the entire thing happened based on a simple cause and effect. He was being totally unreasonable out of nowhere - I was studying for 7 hours from 4am to 11am for an exam, and he was upset that I couldn’t go out to lunch with him. I would’ve let it go if it was any other situation, but my mind was exhausted so I lashed out on him. I apologized for my part, but he didn’t apologize for his wrongdoings.

363,"I'm 20 living at home with parents in college. The past year I've struggled to find a job and only recently got one at a local supermarket (due to need during COVID-19). As a result I don't qualify for any kind of assistance. I don't want to sound like I'm being greedy and need to buy a new wardrobe or a new car or something. My family isn't doing too well financially, so I have to pay for almost everything I want or need. I know there's others out there struggling much more than I am without a roof over their head or a reliable vehicle. I just can't help feeling jealous when I see my friends have everything handed to them, and on top of that are recieving $8000+ for a part time job where they maybe made $300 a month. Meanwhile I'm barely making enough to pay for gas and such and still attempt to save a little each week. I feel like I should be happy for them. It's hard when they want to go out and do things all the time like it costs nothing while I'm checking my bank account to see if I have enough.

My girlfriend also has the mindset that I should pay because I'm the boyfriend, but she's doing so much better than me financially I can't help but feel upset about that. I'm not saying I don't ever want to treat her and do nice things for her. I just don't know what to do with these feelings of jealousy and feeling like she isn't really being supportive. I want to be happy for her and my friends and just try to enjoy our time together without feeling like they have to drag me to places because I don't want to spend the money.

I barely brush my teeth, maybe once a week do I actually do it. I just keep forgetting, getting too focused on writing or drawing.  As for bathing/showering, I always take baths. (For my body dysphoria, since I see less of my body. I am a trans-male) and sometimes I wash my hair, but I usually end up just shampooing, but sometimes I don't even do that, and just wet my hair so my mom doesn't scream at me. (Lotta story there, in short when I was younger and even now if I wasn't to her standards she would scream at me, and purposely humiliate me to her few friends and my aunts, even though she never taught me how to actually clean my hair anyway so)

I have a lot of acne too, and I keep picking at it. I just feel so gross, but no matter how much I tell myself that I'm going to get better, I'm just.. not remembering to.  Do you have any tips on how to remember to keep up hygiene?

366,"About a year ago, a friend of mine sold his Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 3ds. I didn't know and asked if I could borrow it. He told me he bought it back, and also told me to keep it. I thought that was nice and all, but I didn't really want him to do that. 

Around that time, an ex of mine did something really traumatic to me, and the friend, (I'll just call him Jerry) was the only friend I actually told about it. I told him not to tell anyone, and he was very understanding. 

Jerry and I failed a math class a few months later and the counselors came to him to talk to him about summer school, but they didn't come to me, so I didn't know what to do. I was scared to go to them and ask because I was ashamed of failing. Skip to a few days before it's the last day to sign up for it, and I asked Jerry for advice on the matter. He told me that I didn't have to, and that I can take the summer school next year to make up for it (and my dumbass only realized that it was a joke half a year later). I kept asking him if he was sure about it, and he said he was 100% positive. I trusted him, because he talked to the counselors. 

Because of this, I spent half a school year retaking the math class, half a school year taking the math I haven't learned yet, and half of the summer finishing the math I haven't learned yet. Of course, this was my fault, and I realize this. 

Sometime during the retaking of the math class I failed,  someone (in my friend group, I'm assuming) went through my backpack and took a comb that I used. My ocarina of time game was in there, along with my 3ds loaded with super smash bros. I noticed the ocarina of time was gone too, so I told Jerry about it, assuming he took it or something (I don't know why but I felt like he'd know where it was. He would go through my backpack occasionally), and he said, ""you lost my Ocarina of Time?"" Technically I did. I felt bad. 

A month or two later, Jerry and I were playing DND with a couple of friends after school and we were making fun of small things about each other. He said, ""at least I haven't been molested"" out loud, and all of the friends we were playing with looked at us. One of them asked, ""Kat.. were you molested?"" And I couldn't talk. I couldn't think at that moment. 

That's twice he's fucked up. 

My dumbass forgave him, and he started more shit later in the year. I don't even remember what it was about, and we talked a week or two later. 
Guess what? He starts more shit in front of his crush.

I was supporting him with her. I was trying to be a wing woman despite the shit he's done. His crush is African American, and he thought it would be funny to tell her that I, ""spew racial slurs to every black person I see"", and I lost it. I didn't want to ruin his relationship with his crush, so I just told him to stop making stuff up to every person he sees.

I stopped talking to him after that. His crush reached out and was understanding surprisingly. He hung out with her a lot, so he might've done something for her not to trust him.

Fast forward to now and he asks me out of no where, ""hey I know we haven't talked in a while but do you still have my Ocarina of Time"". What do I do? Am I being too childish?
Sorry for drawing this out for longer than I should've.

368,"Now, I know both are very different places, but I wanted to access the pros and cons of both. Someday, I would like to move to one of the two. I am no stranger to the cold, nor the heat, as I have grown up in the Northeastern U.S., where every year feels like some bitchy Karen let their entitled children fuck with the thermometer in a supermarket, except of it were projected on a state-wife scale. Now, looking at the two places, They both have their pros and cons, so I’m going to list them below 

ALASKA:
(Pros)
- Large open spaces
- Great outdoor activities
- No language barrier
- Unparalleled beauty (vast forests and huge mountain ranges) 
- It’s U.S. State, meaning there is no problems with immigration, not to mention the geographic diversity of NA that I love so dearly 
- Fairly easy to find work for trades 

(Cons)
- Slednecks (I don’t vibe well with that cast, growing up in the Northeast)
- Fairly high crime rate
- Highest suicide rate in the nation (the state is not well-equipped as opposed to its counterparts of similar latitudes)
- Low standard of living (I read it’s largely bar food or whatever you can buy with the absurdly expensive prices) 
-Super high alcohol consumption among the population (bad experience with alcohol growing up, so I tend to be resentful of this)


NORWAY:
(Pros)
- High standard of living
- High internet accessibility
- More people
More culture (I have always loved the various groups and ethnicities of Europe, as well as their customs) 
- Beautiful geography
- Close to other beautiful nations for vacation 
- Good healthcare as far as I know (Grew up without stable healthcare, so I will take what I can get)
- More people (Less trouble for my horny ass) 
- Better education standards/access

(Cons)
- Geography is arguably worse/better than Alaska (less expanses, mountains smaller. Equally as beautiful though)
- Language Barrier (I love learning, so I could probably tackle this, but that doesn’t demean the challenge)

SHARED CONS
- Low sunglight
- Expensive 

Overall, it would seem Norway wins, but I have yet to really decide. Part of that romanticized beauty of Alaska is what still has me interested, as well as the freeing lifestyle (Which I have heard Norway has) Idk, what are your thoughts? Anything would help. Thank you!",27Jun2020,1
369,"The first time I wrote this it turned into a book so here are the highlights… I met the man of my dreams 5 years ago. We worked together and it turned into something undeniable. He was unhappily married and is still married. I had just gotten out of a bummer relationship. We both have children. Things moved fast but when his wife found out she understandably lost it. She threatened to keep the kids from him so he told her he would quit seeing me if she would drop the divorce. Not only did we not quit seeing each other, we spent time together every other night. We went from making plans to get married to me being a secret from everyone in his life. I got into professional school and moved out of state a year ago. I thought he might finally take the leap and file for divorce so I wouldn’t leave but he didn’t. He has consistently said that he and his wife have no relationship. I believed that since he was with me so often. I also don’t know how she couldn’t know when he was gone at the same time every other night. Maybe she just quit caring as long as he stayed with her. This man has forever been so kind and loving to me and my children. He has encouraged me to pursue my career, he has helped me provide an amazing home for my children. I get mad and he just listens and tells me he loves me. As his kids have gotten older he has talked more about getting divorced but I can tell he is very nervous about how she’ll respond. Anything I’ve ever told him that’s problematic for me he genuinely works on… with one exception. I recently learned (from serious pushing and invading his privacy) that instead of no longer taking his wife on vacations, he just started lying to me about it. So around two times a year this was happening. He was extremely apologetic, but said it was just for the kids, and knew it would make me mad/possibly leave. The worst thing I found was a trip just him and his wife went on for his old classmates wedding. Even worse is that he had taken me on the bachelor party trip (I didn’t go to the actual party because no one knows I exist. and he only went for a couple hours) and then he took his wife to the wedding. I found family pictures they have had taken, pictures on trips… It felt fucking awful. But he let me look through everything and that’s the worst I found. I tried to end it but he swore up and down they didn’t have any relationship. Thinking I’ll finally catch him I asked him to record a conversation where he says something about not having a relationship for 5 years. I know I sound like a lunatic. So he does it and her response seemed like it was really the truth. He’s now saying he’ll file for divorce and I have no idea what to do. I love this man. I believe he loves me. I hate that I have become so jealous but not knowing and having been lied to brings the worst out of me. He can tell I’m done putting up with everything and says he will file next week. He says he will work to gain my trust back.. Part of me believes it, part knows he won’t go through with it. Part of me wants nothing more than to finally marry that man and the other part wants to start a new life and forget I ever met him.

370,"Hello,

firstly, English is not my native language, I hope you can understand nevertheless! 

My friend is in a really tricky situation and I am also thinking a lot about it. Recently, he and his friend have  bought the inventory of a workshop from a deceased man's family. The man died a few months ago and was 80-ish, sitting in a wheelchair.

They have bought 5 rooms full of tools and it took them  a week to sift through all the stuff, the rooms were really packed. Eventually, they found his ""treasure chests"". 5 boxes full of pornography from the 1970s-90s,  pretty kinky stuff, mainly SM and apparently the guy had a rape fetish  (everything seemed consentual with consentual adults).  While this was kinky and unproblematic, the last box was not. In the last box, there were magazines from the 70s depicting naked children. Thank God, there were no rape scenes, just magazines that aimed at showing naked children. Child porn, imo. 

He asked me for my advice for what to do now and we brainstormed... these are the options:

(Keep in mind, these magazines were from the 70s when child porn was kind of a grey area in Germany and there were no laws in place):

1. Do nothing, ignore it, don't cause a scene for the deceased man's family. He is dead and can not do any harm. It will only traumatize his family and paint their Dad/husband in a bad light in their memories.
2. Go to the police so they start an investigation. Pedophilia is something that just doesn't go away with time and he may have switched to storing his ""material"" on the computer, consuming child porn online. Police will go through his devices and may find child porn, which could help in finding a CP ring.

It's a really shitty situation and my friend is devastated. I adviced him to call/contact a child protection organization so they can advice him on what to do..

&amp;#x200B;

I heavily lean to option number 2 because the benefits (finding a CP ring) outweigh the harm it causes to the family, though the police may find nothing...

What would you do in this situation?",27Jun2020,1

372,"Hey i've been conflicted about what i should do about this situation. A month or so ago we got a new neighbor across the hall in our apartments, from what i know he's a single parent with 2-3 kids. Almost as soon as they moved in I would often hear yelling and stomping around as he's referencing his kids while i'd go out for a smoke. Me and my wife will often hear slapping/smacking noises right after the yelling and its not uncommon for the kids to be heard crying right after. Just tonight i was outside and heard him yelling at his kids again saying something like ""I swear to god \*kids name\* ill punch you straight in the fucking chest if you \*dont do this thing\*"" It's very uncomfortable to live around and we really feel for these kids, but we don't know exactly what to do. This will persist all through the day and night and i've heard it happening all the way up until around 3 in the morning. It's pretty rare i'll go outside and not hear him getting upset. I'm worried that not only if i report this to whoever that his kids will be taken away (it's seeming more and more important that it should happen) but he would know that we would be the ones to report it because me and my wife often go outside so would be the most likely to do it.

374,"I have a female friend ""J"" who I talk to frequently on snapchat. Well today in her story I saw one of her friends who is just absolutly gorgeous and I wanted to ask J her name in that ""so who's your friend?"" fashion, but would that be disrespectful? To my friend or to the girl?

For context, J and I are not close friends by any stretch. We live about 2 hours from each other, so we've never hung out (although she's said she wants to visit me a couple times and we've tried to make lunch plans a lot, but schedules have never matched) and we usually only talk once or twice a week. More often than not it's just me boosting her mood giving her compliments, so basically flirting (don't worry I've checked to make sure she's comfortable and she says she actually realy likes when I text her like I do). But yeah I've pretty much been playfully flirting with this girl for like a year now.

I am 99.9% sure J's feelings towards me are a simple friendships, as mine are to her. But because of the kinda flirty dynamic of the friendship, I thought asking about J's friend might take the spotlight off J a little and make her feel bad or something? Idk might be a weird thought but it's a concern that came to mind.

Also I don't want to be disrespectful to the girl because I probably have no real reason to be curious outside of 'hey your friend is cute is she single?' And I feel like that might be disrespectful.

So overall I guess it boils down to is it disrespectful to ask my friend about her other cute friend? Could use some opinions.

378,"I've been repairing appliances for 5 years. It's good pay, pretty rewarding, ok benefits, but recently last 3-6 months or so, it's becoming draining, emotionally taxing, and I'm developing concerning wrist, knee, and back discomfort.

The company (formally Sears) has had to reprioritize tactics to reinvigorate profits to offset operation costs. This has been done in some ways I can't get behind, morally speaking.

The model is basically like this:

A customer is given a service charge ($120) amount when scheduling, though labor ($175) is omitted during the scheduling, and the cost of parts has a criminally high upcharge, the best example that comes to mind is an oven igniter costing $110 through us, the average cost is $40. There aren't too many repairs that are under (this amount is important later, remember it) $500.

This outrageous estimate can be discounted 50% if the customer enrolls in a warranty that covers minor repairs on other appliances for $600 dollars a year, and a $100 deductible, and remember that number earlier? They won't repair anything OVER $500! 

This is absolutely unethical in my opinion. Today I had a service call for a customer that got released from the hospital on Tuesday after a double mastectomy. Those wheels on the rack in your dishwasher? The total parts, labor, and tax was $460 dollars. I told her where to order them, falsified my report that she missed the appointment, and will FaceTime with her when they're delivered to help her install them.

I love to help people, it's not a huge thing, but it's a pretty nice feeling to get something working so someone can get on with their lives. I have no idea what to do. This new insidious practice of the company is horrendous, embarrassing and it makes me feel like a total asshole.

title sums it up, somebody came into our house, and only really broke the tv from my knowledge. ""breaking in"" sounds kinda dramatic, the person in question simply slipped in through the unlocked back door. both my mom and step-dad were out, me and my brother were the only people present, both of us upstairs. 

my step-dad found the backroom (their bedroom) trashed, along with the broken tv. the living room and kitchen were undisturbed though, including the pretty noticable ps4. my mom thinks he did it. i'm not sure of what to do about this, this seems so odd considering we're in such a nice suburb :((

one last thing though, i dont know how to comfort my little brother (13 y/o). ik this is kinda small but ever since an incident where somebody walked into our house (which as a side note was kinda fucked, but ultimately unrelated), he's become really paranoid/anxious about this stuff. im really concerned he'll take this roughly, and i have difficulty comforting him when he panics,,,",27Jun2020,1

Months later after she slapped me in the face. I left the job. I cut contact with both of them. Well a few months go by and the guy texts me again. 

Now I'm trying to be friends with him and trying to be happy. Well for the past week....I keep seeing stuff about her. People talking about her or having her as a cover photo. I can't seem to get away from her no matter how hard I try. 

There was this guy who said she left in April. Everyone is saying that too, but the guy I'm speaking to now. Saying she left in February. He's reassured me nothing ever happened between them. Should I trust my gut? Should I trust him?

Hello all. I need help regarding a situation with my boyfriend [M 22] and I [F 20]. I can’t tell if I’m overreacting or not, I have a lot I’m dealing with at the moment and can’t tell if this particular instance is the cherry on top or if it’s actually worth being upset over. 

Long story short, been with my bf for over a year. About 5 months ago he start talking about this girl often. He can have girl friends, I didn’t care. I did care when he seemed to prioritize her.  I would constantly see snaps from her on his phone when he would be showing me something on there. I mean, multiple times in an hour. That made me curious but still didn’t really think anything of it. Then, one night I was crying because of something that had happened and he wasn’t being responsive or supporting me. He then said “oh sorry I’m playing game with [this girl].” I then told me to call me when HES done. Ouch lol. 

One day I was looking at his phone and I accidentally clicked the notification from snapchat from this girl. I couldn’t help myself and looked at the message. It said “you’re so adorable” “no your face is betterrrr” and “TOO CUTE” on various of her phones. I panicked. I asked him calmly what these were about and he said he didn’t realize what was wrong. He said he loved me and she didn’t mean anything. I let it go. 

Then, one week he was particularly thirst and...sexting me often. One night he said “sorry I’ve been so in the mood, the girls in the groupchat have been really raunchy lately”. This groupchat is with this same girl and another. Feels good to know they were making him horny and not me. He said he imagined them making out while we have sex...? And what they were talking about made him think of me...that’s when I pulled back. 

Now, he barely replies back to me and it seems like he replies to her daily. He plays games with her daily as well. He then told me she’s encouraging him to work out when he didn’t even tell me he started to work out again. He then told me last night he FaceTimes and works out with this girl and I just lost it. How should I approach speaking to him about this? I don’t ant to tell him to not speak to this friend ever again but this is making me so uncomfortable.

My friends weren’t being crazy or weird they were just laughing and making jokes. I told him that I was an open book and that he could ask me or tell me anything but he didn’t. After like 20 minutes he said “his mom wanted him home” and left. A few hours later he hit me up again and asked to hangout again, I told him maybe but I ended up going home bc I was tired and a little nervous.

390,"Well here goes my first post.

To all the dads, I just feel like I need input and advise... my wife, 2 year old toddler, and I just moved into a 2bedroom duplex. We absolutely love the home and the area however we must live next to the landlord (70 year old) AND his son(40 year old). They both have separate doors but live under the same number address. My side of the duplex is fenced and has a different number compared to their side. learned to see they are very strict about their property and didn’t take to kindly when I installed my internet with cox having a black line running big directly to my part of the duplex. They told me any maintenance issue I have to go directly to them and insists that I don’t contact their real estate property management team.

Here is where the situation escalated.. I told them my mailbox is broken and I needed my privacy when it came to having a locked mailbox (I’ve had bad experiences with mail being stolen in the past) the son was quick to say “oh I’ll deliver your mail don’t worry..” and that was that. The thing is I’m waiting for my cap and gown to deliver, my college degree, and documents they are important. So, I took it upon myself to contact the property management and told them the mailbox is broken. They quickly sent someone to replace it and dropped off a key to US. The son was quick to come knocking at my door at 8pm and told me he uses the same address I’m renting and that I had no right to have a mailbox with a lock if he doesn’t have access to his mail. He repeated himself that there has never been an issue with mail until I moved in with my family here. I told him that I gave his mail to his dad since he wasn’t home today and he cut me off and said “No, no you don’t do that. That is my mail and I need it given to me not him.” 

I contacted the property management the following day and they came with a solution that he will have to install his own mailbox and change his address adding a “#A” to his address and any mail that may be sent for him that I personally deliver to his address unopened which I have no problem with. 

Isn’t him using my address while I’m renting illegal? What if I want to apply for food stamps, etc. and it appears that him and his brother are using the same address and it comes back as fraud... it’s just all so sketchy and I don’t understand why he doesn’t just share mail with his father who he also lives right next too. (They technically don’t have a wall separating like we do).

I honestly feel a knot in my stomach, I feel anxiety, stress, and I feel like it’s my fault the way he addresses US as the problem (keep in mind we’ve only been here for 3 weeks). My 2 year old throws tantrums, she cries pretty loud when she’s getting sleepy (we all know how terrible two’s go). &amp; I’m afraid since he doesn’t like us as it is he might try to use a “noise complaint” of us being too loud... idk this is my first time moving into a duplex and living next to basically two landlords. 

What do you guys think? I just feel like I need input and advice. What would you guys do? I just didn’t know he had the intentions of basically sharing the mailing address with us and it’s just all so weird.. please give me insight guys. I also didn’t want to show him aggression or cuss, etc. because of how frustrating it is to even think he might go bug my wife one day while I’m at work.

2. The same day we got together he was talking to me about how he had a crush on a mutual friend. Later in the day just like 5 minutes before he confessed, he said that it was weird, he no longer had feeling for mutual friends.
3. He told me before ""I like mutual friend because he was one of the first people who was nice to me. The same very day i was being really nice to him. Letting him vent to me. Maybe he didn't actually have a crush on me, just thought i was nice and was confused whether or not he liked me.
4. He told me that ""I feel I always need to be in a relationship or i just feel empty"" 

(also I'm really confused whether or not i like him. I mean am i just in a relationship with him for the heck of it. because I just wanted to see what its like, or do i really want a relationship. I am so confused :( 

&amp;#x200B;

I just really need some advice weighing out my options

1. Improve our relationship (advice tips etc)
2. Break up with him
3. Wait until quarantine ends and we can just have a real relationship",27Jun2020,1
404,"The “here’s your post from X years ago today” function on Facebook really got me thinking lately.

I’ve always had a sarcastic sense of humor. But I’ve grown as a person, and have to come to realize that some of my older posts may come across as insensitive and “punching down” even tho I didn’t mean it that way at the time.

I want to move on from that past and delete any post that might offend or hurt people. I obviously don’t wanna deactivate my account since that’s how I stay in touch with most of my friends.

Does anyone know how I can do that?",27Jun2020,1
405,"So several months ago a lot of unfortunate events happened that concluded in a suicide attempt. I’m in a much better place both physical location and mentally.



I’ve however sat on many emotions which, bluntly put, never got properly sorted since I had originally planned to log out of life. I’ll be the first to admit I am not a perfect person, years of dealing with depression I’ve made mistakes in the past and depression warps reality and perception so take my rant with a grain of salt for these 2 reasons: 1) I was kept in the dark about many issues in my family and my knowledge is collected from who was willing to admit things and 2) because there are things I’m certain I have no knowledge of but my opinions and feelings were formed from this lack of knowledge.



Also because there is a small but unlikely chance anyone in my family will see this I will leave out some things but will keep relevant things to my venting/processing method?



I can’t say there was a straw the broke the camels back but the best spot would be to start with my planning to help care for my father figure. I had planned to move to be an extra pair of hands and to be close, should anything happen. He and I talked and acknowledge that his time was coming but both hoped I’d be able to make it before he passed. About 3 week before moving he pass of his own accord, I’m most thankful that he didn’t go out suffering. Since I was basically 80 percent ready to move I had to somewhat scramble to readjust my whole life again. My depression at this point was already bad and his passing was just fuel to the fire. Shortly after he died I ended up becoming ill. Like internal bleeding ill . I’ve never been one to ask for help from my family. This mostly because my birth basically became ground zero for a lot of unnecessary drama and confusion and secrecy from the one person it affected the most. Being sick and literally out of surgery I would not have been able to take care of myself. I was basically 800 miles from the nearest family member. I asked a few family members who basically when it came down to it were unable to help me. And the one who did offer and helped me plan and get ready recended after I basically got myself ready to go in a week, leaving me with virtually being homeless about a week after surgery. I fell quickly into a dark space. I won’t say I’ve always been suicidal, but my “will” to keep going was purely based on the obligations I felt I had to others. Considering my life at that point I was certain a car wreck or some entitled idiot would have offed me and I was just going through the movement and waiting for it to happen. 



In retrospect the manic that kicked in to down a half bottle of otc painkillers is probably what saved me. It took a few hours to set in the route I took would be long and painful vs my original idea which would have been quick and painless from my research. (Since I don’t want to give anyone any ideas I will not answer with what my chosen method was).



So ambulance ride, hospital stay to make sure I did no long term damage and letting certain family know what stupid choice I had made I spent 9 days in a psych ward. I was ignored by family and the one who picked up and was my emergency contact basically said I did this for attention.



The feeling of being abandoned by family in a time of need. I still cannot process it. I can’t bring myself to process it. All of them also still have my number and not one has bothered to check on me. In my mind I should cut all ties and I slowly have removed their method to contact me other than by phone.



There is this dark void I feel every time I want to process it that scares me to even want to. I don’t know if it is hate or insanity.  I don’t know how a group of adults who know basically the child of the family (there’s a huge age gap between the young and old in my family, was in a dire situation and to willingly ignore them.



The dynamics in my family I could easily sum up as by just being born I was placed in the black sheep category. I could easily see me no longer being alive being beneficial to them. Tho the one who caused this drama has long since passed we still suffer from their choices. Because that I don’t fault them and I understand the choice. But to accept the anger behind it I don’t know what it would mean for me.



I am around friends who’ve known me for years and have such a support group with them but there are feelings I feel afraid to express to the not cause I don’t trust them but because the gravity behind them I have no way to properly express. this literally is the best I can somewhat form to words how I feel. I still can’t think of what to call this. A rant or seeking advice. Maybe just releasing into the world the betrayal I feel may voice some solution or even register with someone else in the same boat. I know I’m not alone and I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been in my whole life.



I guess this will be a light house for now. I feel some good may come from this, if not for me, others who feel the same.



Last 2 things: I am working on getting better so saying seek a therapist would be redundant advice for me.



2 - In the smallest chance you see this mother, we’re strangers. Always have and probably always will. I don’t ever think I was your child to being with, just a replacement for “Her” to prove she was not a failure of a parent. By the end of 2020 all means you would have to contact me will be gone and I would prefer if we do pass we just stay strangers. I don’t have the energy for family and I will take any means to secure my happiness now. The only think I’ll keep of you for memory was you singing to me as a child, that’s the only memory that cannot be stained.",27Jun2020,1

410,"My mother and my stepfather divorced January of this year. In the past my stepfather has said in reference to his uncle who has molested him in the past, that a good way to kill someone would be to leave paint thinner with a rag in it and if it gets too hot it will self-combust.

Now I don't know the logistics behind this or the science, so I don't know if this is true. But he has mentioned this to both me and my mother on separate occasions, regarding this Uncle. 

5 months later after the divorce, we have discovered five cans of paint thinner sitting in my mother's attic, leaking. These were not there a month prior to yesterday, as we actually had the fire department out to check for possible fire/smoke (during remodel) as well as putting old Christmas stuff up two months prior to yesterday. 

Since this, we have had someone remove the cans as well as the liquid absorbed through pads and towels in the attic. My mother did not take any pictures. We had the same person check the other three buildings on our property to make sure that nothing was suspicious and nothing came up. 

Since the divorce, it has happened a handful of times where we either have packages waiting outside our houses, we leave our trunk open while we are unloading groceries or something similar, and he will actually text us to say ""You have a package"" or ""Your trunk is open"". This may not be sinister, as he works at a pizza restaurant nearby as a delivery driver. But with the recent events, it is concerning. 

I'm not quite sure how to deal with this, emotionally for one point. We have gone through all options in our heads and we cannot figure out anyone else who has had access to our attic that would also have motive to kill my mother. I am the beneficiary on all insurance policies regarding the house and my mother, so it is not like my ex-stepfather would financially benefit. 

We are not sure what to do, if there's anything that we can do to prevent him from doing anything if he did have any ill will. We're not sure if the text that we have could possibly mean stalking, and along with the paint cans could mean something, we're just not sure. Any advice would be appreciated.

413,"Asking for some reassurance and advice here. I’m 25 and live at home with my mum, dad and sister. I love them all to bits and love being at home with my family but recently I am starting to get fed-up with how controlled and ‘unfree’ I feel. My Dad doesn’t make me feel this way but my mum does. I’ve also never lived away from home as I did not go to Uni and am getting desperate for some of my own space and independence. I was messaging someone on my phone a few days ago and in mid conversation, my mum stopped to ask ‘Who are you talking to?’ (Referring to me texting). I straight away answered and explained myself (which I shouldn’t have) then got frustrated at this and asked her why it mattered who I was speaking to and why in her conversation did she need to even worry about what I was doing. She then said ‘I think you protest too much’ and immediately I felt guilty,  like I was doing something really bad or naughty (as she was implying). But I’m 25!!! If I want to text someone whether it’s my friend, a man whoever I don’t feel I should feel guilty or even have to tell anyone/explain myself! I work, I pay my own phone bill... This is not the only area of my life where I feel like this especially towards my mum, either and that’s why I am really itching to move out. I tell my parents ALOT probably more than any other 25 year old. I work hard and am always honest. I don’t go out partying every weekend. I have never caused them any trouble or been bad etc. They know I’m sensible (If that makes sense) so I just don’t get it. I’m worried it’ll eventually turn mine and my mums relationship sour. I also don’t feel like other 25 year olds have to explain themselves as much as me. I guess I’m just ask whether from an outside perspective, do you think I am right in feeling this way?

416,"This is long. I’m sorry.

I’m a 27 year old woman. I’ve never dated, never kissed, never entertained the thought of being in a relationship because the relationship I had with myself and my self worth were so abysmal that I had convinced myself that it would never happen for me. At least not until I had met all of these expectations I set for myself in my mind that would make me even worth someone’s attention. So I worked on that and pushed the thought aside for a long time. I was able to justify not trying because I was working on my education and my career and that seemed to be a good excuse when people asked. 

But recently, I met all my expectations I set for myself in my youth. I finished my degree. I got my dream job. I bought a house. And now I’m hit with this crushing loneliness that is absolutely stripping me of any of the joy I deserve to reap from those accomplishments. 

I’m lonely. Living alone is a world of peace and a world of hurt all at once. I started coping by reading and I found myself reading fan fictions about a certain fictional pairing from a game I liked. I didn’t go looking for it, I just stumbled across one and found I really enjoyed reading about those characters and the new details people would add to flush them out. The fact that there’s new ones and different versions of the same story every few days is just more daydream fuel for me. Every now and then I’ll find one that doesn’t end well and the hurt I feel from that is not healthy. 

This is so embarrassing even to write out, I know I couldn’t talk about it in person to someone. I know exactly what I’m doing. It’s a coping mechanism. I’m putting myself into those stories and I’m making myself have these completely unrealistic expectations about what a relationship is like and I’m reminding myself over and over again that I don’t have that and I feel like I never will. 

I’ve always had this anxiety about myself. When I was young I would hide the music I listened to. I still turn my radio down at stoplights. I don’t like being acknowledged, I do not want to be the center of attention, and most of all I’ve tried very hard to be background noise my whole life because I’m horrified of being an individual for fear that someone will look at me too closely and see all my flaws.

All of this has resulted in me completely isolating myself and it hurts and I’m tired of it and for once, I’d like for someone to think of me fondly. To want to text me or talk to me. To miss me when I’m not around. I don’t want to be background noise forever. I have one friend that I see frequently but that just isn’t the same. A lot of times I find myself wanting to talk to someone and there’s just no one there. I open my phone to text but I don’t have anyone to send it to or I send it and they never respond. Everyone is just too busy living their own life. I’m loved by my family, but I’m not anyone’s main focus. I’m just kind of there. If they have a few minutes, they’ll talk to me. But at the end of the day it’s just me alone again. 

I’m not ugly, but I don’t have the perfect body. I stopped wearing makeup a long time ago because I’m not very good at it. I don’t feel like, of all the woman in the world, there’s anything that special about me that would make someone chose me over literally anyone else. But I know in my heart I have so much to give. It’s just that I don’t how to give it. Not like that. 

Is there anyone at all that has ever related to any of this? What do I even do at this point? 

How on earth do I possibly start dating in a society that to me seems so focused on casual sex and hook ups? Most people my age have so much more experience and I worry that my inexperience will come across as a red flag that something is very wrong with me. There’s not. I’m not crazy. I’m not mentally ill. I’m just a little anxious and a little slower and much more timid around other people than I should be. I’m just worried no one will see that and I’ll get looked over as I usually do. 

Where do we go from here?",27Jun2020,1
417,"I have a boyfriend, and, to get straight to the point, i feel like out relationship is slowly becoming more and more one-sided. He constantly wants to text me and whenever he’s upset i always remind him that im here to talk to him. We see each other almost daily, but i have a job and i can only do so much. Im working my hardest to get myself out of the house so we can live together once the time comes. The problem is, as much as he claims that he loves me more than i love him (not in an abusive way), it genuinely doesnt seem that way. heres some examples:
whenever im busy and dont text back, he gets upset, but when he doesnt text back im expected to pretend like its no big deal (i dont usually get upset anyway, but sometimes its an emergency)
ive struggled with dating “straight” guys my whole life, i’ve already talked about this with him, and he respects the fact that im male. I know that im the only other guy he’s ever been attracted to, but the fact that he gets so defensive when anybody mentions that hes “gay” is a but off putting to me. He doesn’t even call himself bisexual. I dont expect him to label himself, but from what ive seen it really seems like hes just trying to pass himself off as straight while dating another dude
i had a breakdown and almost relapsed the other night, he always talks to me about how even if its late, i can call him if its something like that. I called him and when he answered he seemed so annoyed and, again i didnt expect him to be some sort of therapist but he wouldnt even talk to me. he ended up falling asleep, and the next day, he said “i feel like being alone today” when i so clearly needed to be around someone for my own damn safety.
he smokes weed, i usually do too but im on probation so thats out of the picture for me as of now. even before i stopped, i never really liked being around him when he’s high because he just acts different. today i wanted to spend time with him and he came over, played cod, got his dick sucked, and passed out (after repeatedly telling me he wasnt tired), he does the same shit every time he comes over after smoking earlier.
Idk, maybe i’m making a big deal out of little things. i dont think ive ever been in such a functional relationship, and im scared to ruin things. as much as it may seem bad from this post, this is the best thing ive had. its not worth leaving him because the good definitely weighs out the bad, but because of my past partners, im not even sure how to bring this stuff up without making him feel like shit.

I have asked if she had been professionally diagnosed with any of them and she said no, now that should’ve been the final conclusion that no, she doesn’t have it, she just wants attention, but i’m also aware that some parents don’t believe in mental health and take pride in their children not needing therapy or what not, which just makes this whole thing so confusing for me, cause, as someone who is currently suffering from anxiety and depression i want to support her and tell her its gonna be okay that i’ll be there for her.

425,"Hi everyone. First of all, I appreciate any feedback. This has been a real struggle for me. So, some background information. I am a 20 year old guy in a relationship with a soon to be 21 year old girl. The thing is, her drinking makes me super anxious. This is (I think) mostly due to her being raped before we met and alcohol was a contributing factor to that (I'm not in any blaming her. Just saying that alcohol was involved). It's so bad to the point that talking about it makes me more anxious than when I went skydiving. I went skydiving to break my fear of heights (Didn't work. Was scary). Anyway, her 21st birthday is coming up soon and I can't be with her because she's on a family vacation. We've talked about it and established ways to mitigate my anxiety while she can still have fun and enjoy her 21st to the fullest. Is there any advice you all can give on how to handle this?

Like I was talking to someone tonight and it feels like they want to sleep with me and I don’t really care for it. Granted I’m only 18 and maybe it’s because I’m a virgin but the thought of it grosses me out. 

I really just want someone to snuggle and cuddle with. Someone to talk to and laugh with and then down the road yeah have sexual but not for the 1st couple of months. The only time I’ve had a sexual attraction for someone I wanted to wait a while longer and they didn’t so we went our different ways. Is there something wrong with me? Am i too much of a prude? Is this annoying or off putting to not be that sexual? Bc with the guys I talk to it really feels like I’m an outcast? Is there any advice on how to be more sexual?",27Jun2020,1
427,"before i start, im kind of new to reddit and i made this anon profile to share this specific story, any advice would be greatly appreciated.
so i met this guy online awhile ago, we’ve known eachother for 2 years so far, and decided to start dating around 5 months ago, over those 5 months my ex(going to keep our ages out of this, but we are both under 18)has sent me 2 sweaters of his. i never asked for them, he willingly sent me these with his OWN money.
about a week or two ago, i broke up with him because of personal matters i guess. anyways, his mom is furious at me for breaking up with him &amp; is demanding his sweaters back, she wants me to pay for the shipping ontop of all of this, which is expensive where i live, and it’ll probably be around 60-80$ to send back to him. if i dont send his sweaters back, my ex and his mom are threatening to message my parents and show them intimate conversations/pictures me and him has shared between eachother. his mother has all of my pictures/convos on her phone, and his phone aswell. i honestly dont know what to do
(my parents kind of knew we were in a relationship, but i never directly told them)",27Jun2020,1
428,"All my life I have never really experienced a family setting. My parents were always working and it was just me and my older sister for a bit, but, of course, she didn’t spend time with me either. Spending most of my time alone was rough but what can you do about it.

As years went on I was still mostly alone. Friends never stuck around and the ones that did were pretty toxic. I also had issues with myself such as stubbornness and reliance on others to cure my loneliness. Getting out of middle school was a pretty smooth considering I wouldn’t really miss anyone.

Throughout high school I had a consistent friend group that didn’t really include me in things. It might have been just me seeming inapproachable but who knows what it really was. My family wasn’t there for me either during this time as well when I really needed them. Depression, loneliness, fights with friends, etc all made high school such a struggle. I was always envious of my friends who interacted with their parents on a daily basis. The worst was senior year when my parents didn’t even go to my graduation. I know it’s selfish of my to want them to attend things or even just write me letters for my senior retreat, but they had to work. I understood that. Is that normal?

The summer after I graduated I worked at my parents restaurant to help them out. I didn’t go in with the mindset of making friends because I felt they wouldn’t last anyways. Boy was I wrong. After 17 years of my life I finally got my first boyfriend. Also l, my family and I were interacting more. It was like a miracle. Sadly it went downhill from there.

I told my mom about my boyfriend because I felt we were getting closer due to working at the restaurant but she didn’t approve. She just kept saying no stay away from him you don’t even know him. Don’t message him. I would always reply with but you don’t know anything about him because everything she told me was false. This was my first relationship but I am a very cautious person. I always asked my boyfriend if what she was saying was true. Some things were and he regretted them but other things were completely false. After 18 years (we started dating on my birthday) I learned that my mother was a narcissist and unstable. I refused to break up with my boyfriend and she went insane. Everyone in my family was okay with our relationship except her. 

It didn’t end with her just disapproving our relationship. She took everything away from me. Car, credit card (barely used it anyways but whatever), even food. I just started college so my boyfriend and sister took my to school. She tracked me on my phone to try to keep us apart. Said I can’t work when he works. She found out we were still together and she fired him. I would walk from my house to his car just so we could hang out. It was amazing to finally find someone who loves me and wants to spend time with me, even with everything going on with my mom. Her verbal abuse was endless to both me and my boyfriend. Telling him to break up with me and saying that I’m ignorant and don’t know what I’m doing. The harassment went on for a while and eventually I couldn’t take it anymore. She took his phone to yell at his mother for dating me. There is so much more but I can’t go on forever. 

My sister tried to be their for me but then eventually got tired of it after I got caught bringing him to the house after my mom said not to. I’ll admit not my brightest idea but everyone makes mistakes. She broke the painting he painted me and the keyboard he gave me. At this point she decided to not sign my fasfa unless I broke up with him and said I had to move out by March. I tried going to some family to get help but they were all on her side because they are traditional. She would come upstairs to yell at me and say it’s my fault that everything is falling apart. Even though all we do it stay in our rooms all day and don’t spend time as a family. 

This torment lasted until finally I just moved out. I tried to get my fasfa but didn’t work. This was my dream school but it’s okay. Just recently (today actually) I tried one last time to talk to my parents. All I got was my dad saying they had a long day at work so what I had to say wasn’t important and my mom mocking me and running away. I can tell they didn’t want to listen so I just left. Soon after my uncle (who is also a narcissist and doesn’t listen to anyone) texted me and said that he is gonna disable my phone plan and that I ruined everything in this family. My older sister always takes his side for some reason. From this point on I’m trying to figure out how to attend college without financial aid. My boyfriend and I are still together and going strong. We are supporting each other through everything. I know I’m crazy to put so much trust in a guy I have been dating for 10 months in counting but he was the first to love me for me. I didn’t have to pretend. 

I have plenty of issues with me caused by my family. Abandonment issues, anxiety, depression, stress, emotional trauma. My boyfriend is trying to help me through it but it’s so hard. I can’t even properly express myself because I feel my voice doesn’t matter. If I stay quiet then things will be better or he doesn’t really care. I have experienced many things while being with my boyfriend. He never gives up on me. He makes me truly happy. 

Is it okay for me to be mad at my family? I don’t really ever want to see them again or harbor any feelings of regret. Everyone is blaming me for breaking up the family except for my boyfriend. Was it really my fault as everyone says it is? I just wanted to love who I love. Is that such a bad thing? Why did they want to get involved in my life now? They weren’t there when I was struggling in high school. I’m still young and have a lot to learn. I know I made a lot of stupid mistakes but I can’t change the past. I also know that my situation is not as bad as others but Im still at a loss. Please give me any advice you could think of. Thank you for reading my story and sorry for any typos.",27Jun2020,1

While things were complex, overall, she stopped being my friend at my worst. It was very painful for me and put me to rock bottom.

I started back on Monday, and it's clear they're not taking coronavirus seriously. People aren't sat 2 metres apart, fans all over the office blowing coronair in everyone's faces cos it's so hot. On my first day back three retards tried to shake my hand. Not a mask in the building.

And today I woke up ill. Banging headache and fever. Great. Probably fuckin caught it haven't I.

And now, I don't get sick pay, and my boss is refusing to put me back on furlough for the time I'm going to be off sick. He's pretending it's not possible but I know for a fact it is entirely possible. He's told me because I've returned to work, I'm no longer eligible..I've read up on it and you can be taken off furlough and put back on no issues...the company don't even have to start contributing until August, so I could be ill for a month and still receive furlough pay, which is a lot more than statutory sick pay.

It's crazy.

Not sure what I can do here. Any suggestions?

436,"   My dog is terrified of thunderstorms, and an extremely loud crash absolutely mortified her. I usually just let her pick where she wants to sleep since she is so incredibly picky about it, but tonight I put her up on the bed to comfort her and she immediately cuddled up with me.

     It’s 4 a.m. and my dog is currently snoring right next to my ear. She’s asleep on my arm, and when I say arm, I mean up to the shoulder. I’m hot, it’s stuffy, and I need sleep. The problem is that it’s impossible to sleep under these conditions.

     Is there a way to kind of “tuck and roll” her off of my arm without waking her up? Like Friends?Everybody knows the rule: if your dog (or any pet for that matter) is asleep, don’t disturb them. So how do I get a good night’s sleep AND make sure that my doggo does too?

But after talking with him I started to get really scared. It's been really hard for me to date because I'm plus size and not the prettiest but he said he didn't care about how big I am and that he thinks I'm pretty. So I was really excited and we talked about meeting up tomorrow. But I had to back out of that because of how scared I am. I told him what was up and he said we could go at my pace, but I told him that I couldn't go meet him. But he responded back again trying to convince me to go for it, just to wait for a while. Anyway he gave me his number and told me to text him tomorrow. But I'm not sure that I want him to have my number. I did try to tell him that I wasn't ready but in the end I just sort of said okay and told him I would text him. I don't know, part of me just wants to delete tinder and not deal with this. But I feel bad, we talked for a few hours. I don't know, part of my hesitation is that I'm Bi and I guess I kinda just thought my first sexual experience would be with a girl. Girls feel a lot safer and with guys all I can think about are the horror stories of possibly getting r*ped or worse. I'm not sure though, maybe this isn't really as big of a deal as I think.

***TRIGGER WARNING JUST IN CASE, SORRY***

Hello, I’m sorry if this triggers or burdens anyone.

The last couple of months have gotten increasingly worse, which led up to me resorting to an past bad habit. I’ve found myself relying on so much to the point where I do it to feel something when I can’t , to make the feeling go away, and to sleep. If I don’t, my skin itches and I feel unwell like in the pit of my stomach.

The habit doesn’t really bother me, it’s just a hassle to hide and would ruin everything if anyone found out. I wouldn’t do anything with it since I’m too scared and babyish to, so that isn’t a problem. I just need something less bad, I guess.

My family is quite big and overlooks me; so, I can’t tell them. Plus, it would only make them feel bad and I don’t want that. (I have guilt problems to the extend of having trouble breathing and shutting down.) I don’t really trust them all that much, to not tell anyone that doesn’t need to know or tell me to get over it. It just feels like I’m by myself in everything.  I don’t have friends I can tell this to, so I’m unsure on where to turn.

I’ve thought about therapy, but it cost money, that we don’t have and would have to cut in the expenses meant for the others. 

I just need another outlet to push all those unwanted feeling into. I’ve tried a lot of things like counting and breathing and hobbies, but it just makes me worse and freeze. I thought that if I reached out on a big platform, a few people would have some ideas that could help me. 

I appreciate it to the people that have read this and decided to comment, um you don’t have to if you don’t want to so don’t feel pressure I guess.",27Jun2020,1

But I'm constantly unwell. No medication has been able to provide relief. I've gone to naturopaths as well.

This health issues has taken precedence over everything in my life. It's given we barely have a sexual life cuz I'm always on pain or too low to do anything.

My husband has been my pillar of support, never saying a word during all of this, always encouraging me but it's so unfair to him. He deserves to be happier and live a better life with someone.

I just tell my parents I’m going to hangout with a friend, so if they knew they probably wouldn’t want me going. But they’re pretty hypocritical and have visited their friends, are always out and about, visiting family now, and they take my brother everyday to hangout with his friends at a super crowded beach. Also my siblings are going to their sports practices so we just try to be cautious.

Maybe it’s also me just feeling some anxiety about going, and my mom makes such a big deal about going out and needs me home at a certain time and like I’m 20 and it feels kind of ridiculous now. I just get anxiety now when i go out bc I’ve kind of trained myself to like being alone since that’s what I needed to better survive the quarantine.

462,"Having a very hard time accepting getting older and change.

(Sorry that this is SO long, just needed to get it out) 

So I just turned 24 a few weeks ago and all of a sudden I am feeling so old, my childhood and teen years were everything to me, so many amazing memories, there was adventure and magic in everything. I was so young and free and didn’t have to worry about a thing other than math homework. I could be reckless and have the time of my life. I had everything going for me and so much time. 


Nostalgia makes me very sad, so many of my favourite tv shows like mtv’s teen wolf and films like lord of the rings are all doing cast reunions and watching these make me both happy and sad. Happy because it brings back all these amazing memories and sad because I know that those memories are just that.. memories, it’s all gone forever and only in my mind. 
I just think back to when I was 15 and these shows first aired, the absolute excitement I felt and having posters of the cute boys on my wall and having so much passion and energy and going to school and freaking out over the new episodes with my friends. Being a teenager was so much fun, bike rides with friends and crushing on cute guys in class and having that butterfly feeling in your stomach, having blue hair or sneaking out late at night, sleepovers with friends and gossiping about stupid stuff, going trick or treating, watching stupid girly movies and fun family vacations. Everything was exciting, everything was new and fresh and young. I used to love holidays like Xmas and halloween now I don’t even care about them. 

All of these things I grew up with have so many memories attached to them, they even remind me of my family and when I look at these things from my childhood it makes me miss it and then it makes me scared about the future.
the fact that one day my parents won’t be here, the fact that I’ll be 80 and wrinkly one day and teenagers will call me old and ugly, the fact that I’ll be paying bills for the rest of my life, the fact that young people will think of me is old is crazy I’ve always thought of myself as young, even the fact that I’ll die. when you are 15 you think you are invincible and immortal but the older you get the closer you are to death and the scarier it gets. I’ve never been afraid of death until now. It’s just the fact that everything you love and have passion for will be gone one day forever and that’s kinda scary and crazy to me. 


I feel like time has passed me by so fast, one day I was 17 and now I’m 24, how the heck did that happen 😂 I also think being an adult time goes even faster, the days just fly in. 

Now when I look at my life it looks hard and scary, it’s nothing but bills, worry, loneliness, having no friends, struggling to connect with anyone especially in the love life department, working dead end jobs and feeling regret because you didn’t work hard enough from 18-23 to pursue your dreams and goals. Trying to keep up and feeling so behind in life. At 16 everyone’s your friend, pick up the phone and call someone to hang out they are there right away because no one has responsibilities and now they all have their own partners in life that they hang out with all the time, I’ve never even had a boyfriend at 24 I feel like I’m going to be alone forever and that also scares me. 

I think growing up is hard for me because my childhood/teen years were SO special to me, it was nothing but happy and exciting memories filled with love from my family. 
But as soon as I hit 22/23 life was different, your parents are no longer there to help you, you are doing everything all on your own, you don’t have any close friends anymore and no one is with you loving you and looking out for you everyday like when you were 10yrs old. You feel lost because there is so much pressure to have your shit together and if you don’t you are deemed as a failure or made out to be someone who is lazy. The judgment is so cruel.  It’s hard and everyday you wake up fearing for the future. 

I’m driving my car and see teenagers hanging out and having fun and I get so jealous then I just become sad, I look at kids like my nieces and think damn they have so much time in front of them. It’s getting to be a problem where I hate hanging out or looking after kids in my family because of the envy I feel. 

From ages 22 to now I have been feeling all these feelings mostly at 24 it’s gotten worse, it has stopped me from doing anything. I associate change with being old and my having childhood be gone forever. 
Everyone around me is changing and I feel like I am stuck as the same 17yr old, I see people I looked up to as a kid like actors and stuff now getting pregnant and  getting married and I feel so old, it felt like they were 16 just a few years ago. I see people I went to high school with buy houses and fall in love and have these great careers. 


I feel I am behind in life because I done nothing from ages 21-24 I wasted time because of this feeling and it sent me into a spiral of overthinking and sadness for years. I feel like I have very little time to get my shit together and to live out my dream, in 6 years I will be 30 if I ever want to start a family 34/35 is the max age for me and I feel like I only have 6 years to pursue something and it doesn’t feel like enough time and that scares the shit out of me, I want to do all these things before I get older but I feel I have no time left. And not having that excitement and giddiness I had at 16 makes me look at life as an adult as one big messy boring long ride you can’t get off. 

How do I change, how do I get over this, how to I stop fearing for the future and always looking at my childhood, I want to feel happy and excited again, I want to stop doubting myself and follow my dreams, I want to fall in love, there’s so much I want to do but doubt and fear and my age is holding me back 
I don’t know what to do , change scares me because I associate it with being old and parents dying and childhood just becoming memories and not having a happy fulfilling exciting life in the future. I honestly don’t fear looking older it’s just the fact that I might miss out on some thing in life because I’m too old to enjoy them. I have always looked young I got called a 15yr old the other day by a 60yr old woman the other day when I was parking my car, she literally though I was 15 and stole a car 🤣 

anyway yeah this is how I feel and I need help. I know some people might say therapy but I really can’t afford it.

I've been smoking quite frequently since the end of January until around March, around 5-6 times a week, but I stopped for a month after March 16th and smoked occasionally starting from 4/20, meaning around 1-2 times a month. I have a drug test tomorrow when I go back to the military, and it's a urine test. The last time I smoked was May 28, will I pass? Am I still a ""chronic smoker"" even though I stopped doing it frequently, or did will my THC levels drop faster now that I stopped smoking as much. I want to get people's opinions, because how long THC levels are detectable in urine are always categorized based on how much you smoke, but since I changed how much i smoked, I was wondering if my category would be different now.

Also, Is there anything i can do today and tomorrow (the day of the test) to increase my chances of passing? The drug test is at at night, not sure what time",27Jun2020,1
466,"Hi everyone,
     I’m new here on reddit but I felt that this would be the best way to let everything out. My mom befriended this lady( we will call R) and her whole family about 4 years ago. R has a son( we will call O)  who she was always trying to talk about to me even in-front of my boyfriend. No one had met O before but all of a sudden he tried messaging my younger sister who was around 15/16 at the time but she ignored him and he blocked her, but then a few months go by and he also messages me but I also ignore him as I am still in a relationship with my boyfriend so he also blocks me. Anyways we all finally meet O and he is supposedly super shy but came of as SUPER disrespectful when being greeted by my family and myself because he wouldn’t even look at us or respond to our hello’s. Fast forward to this past December and my sister started acting super weird towards me until she finally confessed that she was talking to O and that he was really nice and caring but after my experience with him I did not approve not only because he was much older then my sister (which isn’t a big deal) but also because he gave me really weird vibes, anyways we got into a little argument over it and we stopped talking for a few weeks, but I decided to be supportive even though I thought it was weird that he was interested in a little girl which that is what my sister was at the time! A 17 year old girl! But I started getting more and more suspicious of this relationship they had because it felt like he was trying to groom my sister by getting her little gifts and then having R tell my sister that he was already so in love with her because she was positive my sister was his first girlfriend ( really, a 24 year old whom went to high school with one of my best friends and was told that he was the most perverted person she had ever met, never had a girlfriend? Weird) and that this was the first time she ever saw her son gifting things to a girl. R and her whole family live here in the USA as illegal immigrants, so when I found out that he was a DACA recipient, my suspicion of them planning for him to be with my sister was for them to get papers and become citizens but I had no evidence of this only suspicions. Anyways a month after all this R started being a total Bitch to my mom making snarky comments towards the way my mom was making my sister clean all the time even though that was her responsibility, R would say “I would never make my daughters do anything that is inconvenient to them” but my mom would brush it off. My sister started spending more and more time over at R’s home since that is where her son O still lived but my sister would go over even if O wasn’t there, but she started getting home and would disrespect our mom by calling her nosy or always yelling at her and giving her attitude so we started to suspect that R was feeding shit into my sister trying to turn her against my mom until she was successful and somehow convinced my sister to run away and live with them, at only 17 while her son was 24 yrs old, anyways one day she didn’t show up and my parents new what was going down and called R to see wtf and R was like I don’t know they left to go eat and they haven’t came back but my parents new they would be staying at the hotel where R works as a cleaning lady, they drove to the hotel and saw his car there but my sister wouldn’t answer. The next day they decided to go talk to my parents but O didn’t have the damn balls to talk to them as a man and instead took his dearest mommy R to help him, they talked and my parents( I have no fucking clue why) agreed that it was her decision to move out if she wanted to. I was very mad at my sister because for months I had told her if she wanted to move out then O and her needed to save money before moving out but she let the dumb witch R manipulate her and a comment R made to my parents, confirmed my suspicions when she said that if it was okay with my parents they should marry!!!!! That is when I knew they are only using her for papers. Anyways my sister graduated high school a few weeks after leaving home and my parents make her a BBQ for close family and R comes along and in my own home acts disrespectful towards me but I brush it off cause I don’t like her anyways for manipulating my sister but as time goes by every time I see her she keeps being a bitch until her and my mom get into a heated argument because she tried to disrespect me to my own mom where she tells my mom that I hate her son and don’t approve of my sisters relationship because her son didn’t have an education( which I never said that, I had told my sister back in December when we argued that he was uneducated in the form of when people said hi he couldn’t even return a hello or even acknowledge people, which btw was something said between sisters and she shouldn’t have told anyone that but also she said that I also hated them because I lived in a glass house and they didn’t so that meant that they were poor for living in a mobile home, which wtf I also use to live in a mobile home and have no problem with them as my boyfriend and I were planning on buying one. Anyways after that I found out that my sister was trying to turn my dad against me by telling him that I never answered her calls and that when we did talk that I would only do it to disrespect her but little did she know that I had proof that I never did those things, and that was the last straw for me because I never did anything to my sister or her dumb relationship with O I never disrespected O even though he is an uneducated twat and I’m so angry at my sister because she is acting as if I hurt her when it is the other way around and now she’s getting married and possibly pregnant by a 24 year old who still lives with mommy and daddy and possibly wants her for her citizenship because in many occasions he has shown that he doesn’t care for my sister, on one occasion he was caught being very flirty and touchy with my aunty! But I decided to cut all contract with my sister and I don’t know if I’ll ever forgive her for trying to put everyone against me when I was the only one willing to put my feeling aside and help her out. Oh and I also found out that O let’s his uncle, R’s brother, use his DACA information so R’s brother can work at a McDonald’s while O works under the table to he doesn’t have to pay taxes, is there anything that can be done for that? Anyways I’m sorry this is very long, I just needed to get all this off my chest. Any advice for how to deal with all this is very welcomed!",27Jun2020,1

468,"i am aware that this is very weird

but i actually have troubles processing my emotions; i feel fucked;

&amp;#x200B;

there's this girl

same college

same year student

&amp;#x200B;

kinda liked her, she def liked me too;

but, here's the weird part;

for example. over weekends, during this time i couldn't see her, my feelings used to kinda brew up, and i was almost sure that i had to make a move, or i mean, respond to her, cuz she was already making moves.

and then i'd see her in real life again, and i used to be like ""meh""

all those feelings used to go away in a snap

it isn't even that she's ugly or anything

i cant even explain

but i regreted every second i thought about her

and it has happened 1000 times too

its just crazy how radically my emotions changed too; it almost seemed impossible;

i used to be like, there's no way its gonna happen again. but something wasn't right, and all of it went away in a sec;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

now, obviously, cuz of corona havent seen her in fucking forever

as you can imagine, same is happening now; im dying;

instagram doesn't help too, cuz everyone looks perfect there;

&amp;#x200B;

it sucks; i dont know when i'll see her again; and it actually does hurt;

but the thing that sucks even more is that i know that i'll go thru that shit again;

i know that the way i feel about her rn, is gonna change drastically once i see her IRL

&amp;#x200B;

i cant even explain what i want....

gosh

i just wish i didn't feel this way, cuz rn, cuz of the feelings i regret ignoring her so much

and again, she looks very good on pics too, and it doesn't help

but i know, that the same will happen;

even tho it seems impossibe.

but it has happened way too many times;;

&amp;#x200B;

it even turns into fucking insanity;

what can i do?

how can i shut my emotions off?",27Jun2020,1
469,"Bit of back story, I’m a Houston Texas native and I met my girlfriend over Instagram in 2017. It was a normal friendship but it grew in 3 months into an online relationship. All we did was talk all day everyday and when we would sleep we would FaceTime audio call. I ended up seeing her for the first time a year into the relationship and visited 3 more times before I made the move over to Toledo Ohio. Everything was amazing the first year but very recently(3 weeks ago) she said to me she doesn’t love me anymore, that she just fell out of love and wants to be single. It was a disaster I did what you’re not supposed to do and lost it, I was paralyzed mentally and physically and I wasn’t eating. We went on a break for a week that was supposed to last for a month but we live together and I was in the room across the hall. For a week I was just destroyed and had anxiety every single day and couldn’t take it anymore. I went in the room and told her she needs to make up her mind because it’s messing with me physically and mentally and I just couldnt take it anymore, shearer said she doesn’t want to get back together or doesn’t see a future together but every time I ask can I try again later along the road she says “ i don’t know I can’t tell the future”. She asked me if I wanted to stay friends because she loves me but isn’t IN love with me anymore and it’s kind of odd right now. We’ve been broken up for a day and I went through all my crying stages and still feel bad about it but not gonna cry, I was texting her earlier and we started arguing and I just thought “I have nothing to lose we’re already broken up, I might aswell have fun with this and flirt anyway cuz that’s what I like to do with her” I ended up flirting with her and she didn’t mind that I called her “fine”, “thicc”, “sexy” and even said that I can flirt with her but call her pretty and stuff. I knew that’s what she liked because she’s drop dead gorgeous. While we were long distance all we did was play video games with each other and talk on the phone so basically just our voices and the occasional FaceTime. It was all communication. I told her that she’s going to fall In love with me again if we play games and talk on the mic or phone because that’s how it all started, while we were on break I told her reasons why I love her and the main things she said why she loved me was because I was funny, really easy to talk to and charming. And just last night we still slept in the same bed but had obvious boundaries. She said she didn’t know why she fell out of love with me but now that I think about it, it was the lack of communication for the past 3 months because I started a new job. I would get stressed and come home and hop on my computer and play games while she would be watching tv or playing her switch. And when I was done playing I would go to the bed and talk with her a little but we would just be watching tv and make small jokes. She says she doesn’t want to get back together and wants to be single but I know for sure that if we play games or talk on the phone since she wants to stay best friends it’ll happen all over again. She hasn’t been sparring my feeling during this break up and I know if she really didn’t want to fall in love with me again while I was joking she will later she wouldn’t have said “idk maybe that’ll happen” she would have said “no I just want to be friends that’s it” I know her inside and out when it comes to likes and dislikes. And I have a plan to make her realize that what she’s doing is a mistake and that we just needed to work on a problem we just didn’t communicate about and try and make it work again. I have a 50/50 chance of moving back to Houston and I really don’t want to, I want to try and make this work again. Should I try and make this work again by telling what went wrong and being strong and confident by telling her I know we’re gonna her back together, because if it worked once it’s gonna work again, or should I just call it quits and move back home. I’m insanely in love with her still but at the same time I respect her decision but that doesn’t mean I have to like it.",27Jun2020,1

In my bag I found my crush’s shorts, even thought we always slept in different rooms and I really don’t  know how they got there. It’s been half a year since I got home, and it feel really weird knowing I have a pair of girl-shorts lying in my drawer, where they don’t belong at all. What should I do to get rid of them?

471,"I've written this a few times now and it was always too long. So I'll try my very best to keep it as short as possible.

Basically this:

- met someone through /r/2meirl4meirl 

- we chatted daily with each other through reddit and later text messages

- we talked about everything and nothing, daily for literally 6 months

- at around the 6months marks they withdrew a bit and daily talks lessened. Went from daily to every second day, to a few times a week, to once a month, to being ghosted for months on end.

- They were open with their own issues, in their own words they withdrew due to their own issues with depression.

- I was always forthcoming and giving as much space as I could. While I was ghosted I would message them only once a month in hopes that they'd reply.

- the last time we spoke they actually didn't ghost me, but they did tell me that they just don't feel well enough to keep talking, so they'd need to be on their own for awhile.

- That was nearly 8 months ago now. I haven't messaged them once this year and vice versa of course.

- but for a long, long time I really wanted to, I didn't because I respect her wishes and if I'm being honest, I believe she just doesn't want to be in contact anymore. Which I also understand.

- But I really want to know how they are doing, I really hope they are doing well and to be honest, I do want to reconnect. But I realize that the friendship we once shared will most likely never, ever return again. However I wouldn't mind the kind of friendship where we check in with each other every once in awhile.

She makes up lies about us and tells her friends and her moms family.  Last time it was that she had to go without food and she has had to help buy food.  That she had to work for us to be able to afford food.  This is completely false.  My kids have never gone without.  When money is tight we may have not gone out to eat as much but we have cooked at home.  


My husband and I both work from home and do opposite schedules but due to covid19 we don’t have a regular babysitter or daycare currently.  If we do have to ask they baby sit, we pay them.  Typically it’s because one of us has an appointment while the other is working. So we will ask one of the three to watch her, which usually entails them just sitting on the couch watching tv with her for an hour or so and then they get paid. 

This time, I gave all three kids the option to either do their chores or I would do their chores but asked they play with their little sister (she is almost 3) in the pool while I did them.   I did all the dishes, vacuuming, mopping, mowed the yard, laundry put away in about an hour and half while they played out in the pool.  

Then tonight I get a message from her mom saying she is upset because my stepdaughter is saying that we are making her raise her little sister.  That all she does while she is with us is take care of her.   Which is not even remotely true.  I told her she spent most of the day in bed playing on her phone.  I did make her come out to eat supper and then asked them if they wanted to play in the pool or do their chores. I ended up sending her screenshots of the screen time today, which shows my step daughter spent 5 hours watching Netflix and hulu, plus 3 more hours of Snapchat and tiktok.   So then she backed down about it.  But I don’t even know how to address it.

I (27M) have been living an emotionally unhealthy life for years.

2 years ago my wife and I moved to another country. It was emotionally really hard for me leaving the rest of my family behind, as well as managing all the uncertainty related to not having a job, not having a place to live and being careful not to get scammed.

Thing is that the past few years I've struggled a lot to get a goob job and reaching a good salary by working my ass of and using my free time to acquire/hone my coding skills (I'm a developer) and for the sake of it I stopped gaming and doing things that were ""a loss of time"" with no results. I've also been trying too hard to be the perfect husband by giving more importance to her needs than mine own and avoiding all possible confrontation to the point I'm starting to feel insecure about speaking my mind freely and kind of feeling trapped. My wife and I have tried too hard to save as much money as we can so we can buy a house and for the sake of it we have refrained from doing fun and new things, sticking to a frugal life saying ""We don't need that right now"" to ourselves.

I have come to a point where I'm totally burnout and its affecting my marriage. I'm having some kind of boredom crisis I can't cope with since I have forgotten how to have fun.

490,"My english isn't that good so please bear with me. 

Around one year ago I started developing a crush for a girl I'd see on an almost daily basis at the GYM. I know people go there to workout, so I never made a move - our only interactions would take place when both of us arrived to the GYM before it would open, we'd just exchange greetings and that's about it.

I'd look at her from time to time, but I wouldn't say it was creepy (no staring/chasing or anything weird), just the normal thing when you're attracted to someone? As weeks went by I catched her looking at me a few times, she'd immediately turn her sight to the ground as soon as I looked to her. At first I thought she might be into me too, but then one day as we crossed each other and I was about to greet her, she looked to the side in disgust... so at that point I assumed I might have been creeped her all along. 

From that point on I avoided her at all costs, both because I felt ashamed and because I didn't want to ruin her GYM experience, but this somehow only made things worse. The more I purposefully avoided her, the more we seemed to bump into each other. Couple times I'd be in a machine and she'd sit in the one right next to it, even machines that I had never seen her use in a whole year. The last time I bumped into her, she froze and stared at me... I just greeted her and moved on as fast as possible. 

Since that day she's changed her GYM schedule by about half an hour. At first I wasn't sure whether it had anything to do with me or not, so after couple months I took a week off from the GYM and the first day I came back she had restored her previous schedule, only to change it again as she saw me around. 

Now notice I've never even talked with this girl, both of us seem to be socially awkward. Should I go talk to her and apologise? I've commented the situation in length with couple friends and they think that I'm overthinking everything, or that given on what I say it's more likely that she's into me and felt rejected rather than creeped.

493,"Is he a good friend?

Hi, i am friends with a boy for already 10 years. We dont see each other every week but we keep in touch and meet often. 
We live in a total different environment. I am more the stay at home good girl and he is more like the lets go get drunk and high kinda guy. 
i am pretty shy and have almost no confidence so i dont have a lot of friends just a few really good ones. I dont go party al lot and i dont drink.   
Now the problem is that he is very very selfcenterd wich i dont mind but it gotten to the point where i only listen to him het doesnt give a fuck about me (i think). When i say something he always says stuff like: shut up or loser and etc.
And he totally made me feel insecure. He told me i had no friends and looked like a lesbian because i dont like girly stuff. 
I love BTS and Kpop but he totally bashed me because of it. BTs is the only thing that really makes me happy and loved and he just constantly hates on it. He made me feel boring and took away that little confidence i had left. He is a really sarcastic guy so i guess he said those things as a joke. But i cant seem to get rid of the idea that it is true. 
I really love him as a friend and he means a lot to me and im sure he will protect me and stuff. He even says i feel like a sister to him but he makes me feel disgusted of myself. 
Am i being emotional or something. I just want to feel respected, nice and beautiful.

495,"Hey guys, I’m trying to make a big decision and have no idea what to do. My best friend invited me to rent an apartment with her. I currently live at home. It’s about an hour and a half away from where I live. She goes to a four year college—I’d go to a junior college nearby. I made a list of pros and cons but still have absolutely no idea what to do. I feel sick over it. 

PROS
--------
Strong Pro: It could be very good for my depression. My depression is currently not getting better and I don’t see it getting better without change. 

Strong Pro: It would force me to get out of the house and have more of a life. 

Pro: All of my family thinks I should do it and that it would be good for me. 

Pro: It would help me make friends. 

Pro: I would learn to be more independent. 

Pro: It could be fun. 

Pro: My best friend would be very disappointed and probably mad if I didn’t. She misunderstood my response when she asked and thought I meant yes I’ll do it when I really meant I’ll think about it. 

Pro: I could still come home when I want to, it’s not that far away. 

Pro: I’m currently so depressed that I rarely leave my room meaning I don’t spend much time with my family. I know I’d miss them if I left, so it would cause me to spend a lot more time with them whenever I came home. 

CONS
--------
Strong Con: I’d feel SO guilty leaving my mom. She’d be alone sometimes.

Strong Con: My boyfriend really doesn’t want me to. 

Strong Con: I wouldn’t be able to just go to my moms room and cry and be comforted when I need to. 

Strong Con: I would be homesick and miss my pets and family. 

Strong Con: my sister is also moving out to go to college at the same time. Having two of my mom’s daughters move out at the same time would be hard on my mom and siblings. 

Con: I’m not sure that I’m ready. 

Con: It would be really scary. 

OTHER FACTORS
--------
I will move out eventually 

Not seeing me depressed all the time could make my mom less depressed. But at the same time missing me and being alone sometimes could make it worse.

498,"I am in California and I work at a restaurant. Right now we only offer takeout orders and we have signs all over our windows and a few more before the entry saying “No Mask No Service”. We have a plexiglass that divides me and the customers at the register but I feel like it’s not enough to stop germs spreading into the restaurant.

We still have a few customers that come in and don’t wear a mask but I have been afraid to speak up to them because I am afraid of pissing someone off. I know there are people out there who feel like wearing a mask takes away their freedom and I just don’t want someone to start acting combative towards me.

My boss sees every customer who comes in but I feel like he is not protecting me enough. When he sees that a customer is not following the rules he doesn’t say or do anything to enforce them.

There was an incident when a customer came in without a mask. He covered his face with the menu and said “this is my mask” as a joke. I felt so disgusted that he put the menu on his face like that. I just nervously laughed because I was afraid to say something. 

When the customer left I asked my boss how I should have handled that situation better and all he said was “there’s always going to be people like that.” 

I even talked to a coworker and he pretty much said the same thing and told me to be extra careful.

At this point I’m fearful of catching the virus with too many stupid people out like this.",27Jun2020,1
499,"Im 22, going to uni and living on my own. Ive always been pretty close with my parents, but lately Ive been feeling like they are a little too involved in my life. They call me at least once a day just to ask how/what Im doing. The thing is, I recognise that Im kinda sensitive when it comes to people being in my business, I get annoyed really easily if I feel like Im having to explain myself to someone else. My parents are probably just trying to be nice and considerate, but it feels weird as a 22 year-old to explain my daily schedule to them. 

So I guess Im asking, is it normal for parents to check up on a 22 year-old at least once a day, asking what theyre doing? Am I being too sensitive? Honestly feels like a shitty thing to complain about (boohoo my parents are too caring), but Ive been feeling a lot of anxiety about this. And also: if you think Im not being too sensitive, what do you think I should do? Should I just stop answering their phone calls all the time, or talk to them about needing more space? Im scared of coming off ungrateful and selfish, dont know if they’d understand where Im coming from.",27Jun2020,1
500,"Hey redditors, So I went into full time employment at 18 and worked religiously for the last 10 years I've bought a flat which is now up for sale and I've been thinking a lot about leaving my job and travelling for a while. (I'll be going next year when Covid is blown over), the flat should make a tidy profit and I've decided the time to do it is now

I won't lie, the thought scares me, leaving my secure job and selling my flat. But the thought of being stagnant and staying working in the same town all my life scares me more.

I can't help compare myself to all my friends who travelled in their early 20's, is 28 too old to be doing something like this?

503,"Hello! I’ve been working part time at a grocery store since last August as a produce clerk. For context, I struggle w/ my mental health, so the hours that I work, while less than someone full time, can be very overwhelming for me. I enjoy my tasks assigned &amp; get along well with my coworkers, but the environment can cause me significant distress. I work 20-30 hrs on average in a week. My friend has encouraged me (gently) that it might be good for me to quit around mid July, so that I can “recharge” before attending college this fall. I’m conflicted however, as I get anxious at the idea of lacking any consistent income....

I’ve considered putting in a request to reduce my shifts to average out to closer to 15 hours a week. I’m unsure if this is something an employer would take seriously without providing a concrete explanation- not that I wouldn’t be uncomfortable with specifying, it’s just I don’t know if that’s considered professional or not. 
So, I either attempt to reduce my hours, or I budget so that I can subsidy off my savings for the next two months (I have minimal financial obligations as I live with my parents and commute by foot, though I do buy most of my own food and pay my phone bill) if I quit .... but what to do?

510,"I am sixteen years old and my Father and I's relationship has gotten progressively worse each year since I was twelve. I don't know how to describe our relationship coherently so this is going to be written weird I guess. Here's everything that's caused friction between us:  My father doesn't let me make any plans without asking him first. I'm not supposed to have social media. He has a tracking app installed on my phone. My father had a camera in my room from the age of 6 to 15, I had to beg him multiple times to remove it. He wouldn't let me leave the house on my own at all until I turned 14. When he gets angry with me he lashes out and says stuff like ""Are you retarded?"", ""How come you can never make me happy?"", or he makes jokes about how I'm going to be a loser in life because of my grades. I'm usually a 3.0 gpa student, I guess that's my fault though because he always says my one job is to get good grades and I don't deliver. When I don't do what I'm asked he starts to treat me like I'm worthless, 7th grade was probably my worst year academically so he was pretty upset with me, One day I remember him making me do the dishes, which is fine, but before I started he told me that with my grades I better get used to doing dishes, and then he told me that I didn't have the right to speak around him anymore, before he walked off he doused his hand in water and flicked it in my face. If I don't want to do something with him he says I'm selfish and that ""life's all about you."" Recently I told him I've been feeling depressed, so I asked him to name qualities he likes about me, he couldn't name a single thing. When me and him have conversations it just feels weird, like to Lego pieces that aren't meant to connect, and I'm afraid to tell him anything personal about me because as soon as we get in an argument he uses it against me.

He buy's me nice things, he takes me nice places, he say's I love you a lot, but the older I get the less I feel close to him.

511,"Hello people! I'm in desperate need of some advice. I've asked my parents, my siblings and my friends, and while they did give me some insightful advice, I am still undecided.

Basically, I live in Austria and I am 16 years old, turning 17 next month in July. I finished 10th grade last year around this time, and there is this law here that everyone under the age of 18 HAS to do something, whether that is going to school or doing an apprenticeship. I moved here five years ago, and while I have improved in my last year of school, most of the schools here look at all your grades, and my middle-school grades are pretty bad because I was an idiot and because I also had trouble with german. So since I could not get into the school I wanted, I had to register myself at the Public Employment Service (going to call it PME from now on) and look for an apprenticeship. They basically ask you about your interests and what job you would like and then send you said jobs to your email (if you fit the criteria). You also get a person which you can call at anytime if you have any questions, and you meet up with said person around every 2-3~ weeks, where she just asks you questions and tells you about things which might help. At the time I wanted to do an apprenticeship as an IT-Technician even though the chances were pretty slim I would actually land a job because a) my middle school grades, b) there are really not a lot of apprenticeships and c) they like people who quit a tech-school midway because then they have some experience with coding and don't have to start from zero. I have been invited to some tests and even to three interviews but had no luck.

At one of the meetings, said person who you can talk to suggested I roll in a 10-week long course where I would basically learn everything that comes with job-hunting (CVs, talking on the phone, how to behave at an interview and so on and so forth). She also told me I would get paid for it. I took the chance because I thought it would be better to do something instead of sitting at home all day, and as a bonus I would get paid too. Little did I know it was a mistake. The first week was great, I learnt a lot of things, they pointed out the mistakes on my CV and corrected it and I found it really informative, The next 9 weeks though were hell, we would basically sit 7 hours in a PC-Room and our ""coach"" would tell us to look for jobs and send our CVs. Thing is, there are only so many jobs and while a new one pops up every week or two, we basically had to sit in front of a laptop wait for time to pass. First 10 weeks I found nothing, but I had to chance to go for 10 more weeks (they give this chance to people they thought did their best to look for a job but didnt have any luck) and I accepted, because they told me I had the chance to start an apprenticeship through them (basically paid by them) and I just had to find a company I would work at. So I was basically working for free for said company, they just had to teach me. (I also never ever want to do this course again)

At this point, I decided that I wanted to try my hand at studying and go to university to study law, but to do that I need a certificate for which I need to study then do tests every around 6~ months from German, English, Maths and the job I chose. I can do this certificate for free only if I am doing an apprenticeship (then it gets paid by the country). Only other way I can do it is if I pay for a lessons, textbooks and everything else separately. First price I found after a quick google search (for the lessons, textbooks not included) is 3000E for a year or 1590E every 6 months (which I have to pay up-front). I can't afford that and my parents don't want to pay for it if they know I can get it for free.

At this point I decided to look for other jobs too and I found a company which offered me the chance to work for them paid by the course I was in, and then later on (in a few months) they would let me sign with them and be an official employee of that company. This was last year in November. I had the chance to do four or five 3-day internships for them (even did one last week before christmas) and then I had to wait until the 27th of January to actually start working for them. (this was already a bad sign but at that point I did not care because I was just happy I could finally start). 

I started working and I was really happy that I was not jobless anymore, my colleagues were nice and I liked the job too. The company told me I would 100% sign with them on the 27th of April (so basically 3 months from when I started) and that made me even happier. I worked overtime (even though I am not allowed to) and even went in on a Saturday (basically worked 48 hours) because I thought the boss was happy with how I worked and that's why I was getting signed. I worked from the end of January to around the first or second week of march before Corona hit and I stayed home until May.

When May came everything changed. For the first three weeks, we had no break at all. We worked 8 hours without stopping everyday, and since I didn't sign with them on the 27th of April I went to my boss and asked when to reschedule. He told me he is going to talk with the higher-ups and then get back to me, and that he did. A few days later he told me how he thinks I am not doing enough for the job, how I am not good enough and I have to improve if I want to sign with them. He also told my colleague to assign me more work (we talk a lot with each other because I mainly work with him and we're also both from the same home-country) and he told me he has nothing to assign me because I already do everything I actually learned and CAN do. My boss also told me to annoy my co-workers and constantly keep asking them to teach me new things but we are 7 people (me included) in a huge warehouse and nobody ever has time to actually teach me anything whenever I ask them (my boss has taught me nothing, everything I learned was from my colleague before). My boss also frequently just goes to the wait-room and drinks coffee whenever one of his friends visits (it doesn't matter if we have a lot of work or not) and then gets annoyed at us because ""we are not fast enough"" and ""we are not giving it our 100%"". 

The negative just kept piling up and at one point I called my ""coach"" and told him that I want to talk to him about the job. I told him everything, and he said he was going to call my boss and then he was going to make an appointment where he would personally come to the company and we would sit down together (me, my coach and my boss) and talk about how I feel. We had said discussion and he basically admitted to what he was doing and nothing useful happened (it's what I thought but my coach thought that everything is cleared up and fine now). My boss told me I could sign with them on the first of July and then have a three-month term where I have to prove myself. I had a week to decide if I want to start or not, and this week on thursday I said yes but I am not sure if I really do.

I don't want to be jobless again however I feel pressured by my parents (especially my mother because my dad has been jobless for more than a year and doesn't want me turn out like he did) but I don't want to work somewhere where I would work for ten hours everyday, not be able to take a vacation, and basically just don't feel good in the company. 

Here I am now and I just got a call from the office if I can sign on monday (one of my parents has to come with me because I am underage) and I said yes however I don't know what I should do. There are a lot of things wrong with the company and I honestly feel it is a toxic environment and I would not feel good working there, but everyone is telling me to suck it up and work there and look for something else in-between however I would basically have 0 free time. Also, to do said certificate I mentioned before I would have to go to a school (don't know which one yet) AFTER work (so basically go study after ten hours of work and then do the same thing the next day). I also need 30 minutes by bus to get to my workplace (and back), and while my parents can come get me once in a while, gas costs money too.

I really feel like I should not sign however I feel bad for my mom and for all the work people put in for me (office lady writing up the contract, coach coming to talk to my boss and always being there if I had trouble) and I feel like I would just fuck them over right now. I also feel bad for my colleagues because another person would help them for sure (the company doesn't want to employ other people because ""they have no money"" even though they made 6,7 milliard euro in sales last year) and there is just too much work for the little people we have.

This might sound like a pity-post or as if I would be looking for someone to tell me I shouldn't sign, and it is probably that way but I really don't know what to do. I have horrible back pain, my feet hurt even though I changed shoes three times and everything sucks right now. Please give me advice on what I should do.

Thank you for everyone who takes my time to even read my post, it took me a bit of confidence to share it online but I thought I have nothing to lose anyways and should just post it.",27Jun2020,1

515,"
I was born 33 years ago to two very mentally ill people. My mother was 19 and my father 33. They split up when I was a toddler and I was raised by my mother. She never had any more children. My childhood is a big blur, possibly due to all the trauma I suffered. Obviously I have no recollection of my earliest years but my mother has admitted to shaking me as a baby and I found out my father was also physically abusive (threw a mountain boot at my face when I was 2 or 3 because I woke him up). I didn’t see my father once they broke up, maybe a handful of times. When I was 10 he took me to South America on holiday and tried to molest me. So it was just my mother and I. She wasn’t physically abusive but extremely neglectful and emotionally abusive. She’s extremely narcissistic (she was later on diagnosed with bipolar disorder but I believe she is also on the spectrum of BPD/NPD) and she just wasn’t interested in me growing up, she wasn’t affectionate and only seemed to care about herself and the men in her life (I had a new stepdad pretty much every year). She didn’t teach me anything, guide me, comfort me, made me feel special or worthy in any way. Thanks to this, I now have depression, severe anxiety, a personality disorder which means long term romantic relationships are hard if not impossible, I have anger issues, trust issues, no self esteem and I’m incredibly lonely. She took no interest in my education and so I failed academically and dropped out at 17. I moved to a different country the same year and have been here ever since, far from my family. Working low paying jobs so I can support myself and never have to rely on any of them. My mother could be caring and loving but it always was/is on her own terms and probably for selfish reasons.
I have stayed in touch and visited yearly up until 3 years ago when I finally realised I couldn’t deal with our toxic relationship anymore and needed to put myself first and protect myself. I went no contact.
I don’t miss them but I feel guilt daily and feel if she dies I would never be able to grieve properly or forgive myself. I still love my mother despite everything and I wish I didn’t because it would make life easier.
I am very similar to her and the fact that I deal with the same mental health problems as her make me understand why she didn’t have the patience for a child or did a good job (I chose not to have children and this is one of the reasons) so in that sense I feel immensely sorry for her and feel tempted to forgive her and let her back in my life. But then I think about the helpless child I was and how I never asked to be born. My life has been mostly suffering and I feel she failed me completely and that I deserved so much better. It’s a huge dilemma for me. I can see both sides and don’t know if I’m doing the right thing or if I’m a judgmental asshole. Thank you for reading and any replies.",27Jun2020,1
516,"As the title states, my nieces (1 and 2) and nephew (5) are in my care now. They are all mixed race, half white from their mother (my sister) and their bio father is half African American and half Latino. Just so everyone can get a more clear picture, all of them have tanned skin with super curly brown hair and eyes. All of my family is lily white with straight blonde hair so I am not fully confident in my ability to pick out the right products they need to manage any hair and/or skin concerns or what they might be. They could pass as being of fully Latin descent or simply a tanned white person, but I do believe it is important they grow up knowing all of their heritage and embracing all aspects of who they are. It’s not something I want to ignore.

I have made it my mission to educate myself so I am able to help them down the road. However, I do not have any experience whatsoever in this arena so I need some help with learning how to care for their hair and skin/what products to use as well as the more emotional side of things, like the struggles they will have and how to best communicate with them. Any reading materials/videos or suggestions for hair care or skin care would be great. Any advice would also be appreciated. 

I hope I didn’t not offend anyone, I am just trying to do the best I can. My sister and her husband both died and I was the only family member on either side that was willing and able to take them in. I did NOT want them to go to foster care. I refuse to fail them and want to properly raise them and celebrate their heritage. Thank you.",27Jun2020,1

518,"I (22F) am currently renting a room in a house. My room is actually perfect but the rest of the house is shit. Everything is broken or on the verge of breaking. The common areas barely have any furniture and my landlord is pretty useless. For the past few days we have had ants in the bathroom, which I’ve harassed the landlord about but still nothing has been done to sort it out. 

I have started looking for places and found a great house today. The thing is that I haven’t met the two guys who live there so it’s a bit of a risk. I also have coursework due in a month so it may be a bit disruptive if I move right now and it would be better if I waited?

519,"Background information: I'm 15, and my friend is 16. We're both classmates, and I spend a lot of time playing games with him and a few other friends. He's gone through a lot of shit throughout his life, and it seems like every other day something else is happening to him. He told me that his dad had gotten into a relationship that was very unhealthy, and essentially ruined both his, and his fathers life. Some shit she did to him involved stealing multiple things from both of them, blackmailing his father, being abusive to his father, etc. His father became very depressed, adopting some dangerous spending habits, and eventually being forced into filing for bankruptcy.

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to this morning, my friend called me to let me know that he was going to attempt to bail his dad out of jail. His dad had gotten with his ex once again, and something happened between them sparking another fight. She hit his dad, his dad tried to restrain her, and eventually his dad snapped. His dad attempted to hit my friend multiple times, and eventually threatened both of them, saying that if they moved, he'd shoot them both, and claiming that he was going to make them watch him kill himself. His dad started saying things like, ""When I die, let everyone know (insert ex's name her) is the reason I died."" and my friend, being the ballsy motherfucker he is, ran out of the house with his phone and called the police alerting them as to what occurred. 

His dad is currently in jail, waiting to go to court under assault charges, while his girlfriend was allowed to walk away basically unscathed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've come here on behalf of my friend, and on behalf of his father.  What is there he can do? What is there that can be done that will make his dad realize what he's causing his son to go through, and what he's causing himself to go through? I'm out of ideas, and so is my friend.

I currently work at an optometrist office that operates 40 hours a week which is what we were doing pre-pandemic with almost no changes in number of patients coming in. I'm a part timer averaging 25 hrs a week with no benefits besides my hourly compared to full time employees who get paid sick leave and insurance benefits.

524,"So my cat went missing for about two weeks, and we got him back 31st May. Before he went missing, he ate perfectly fine, we give him a mixed dry food and wet food diet. For the couple of weeks after he came back, he was still eating normally. However, within the past week we’ve noticed that he is licking the gravy from his wet food and leaving the meat chunks in the bowl. He still eats his dry food fine, and he drinks little from his water bowl. We don’t know if this is correlated with him going missing, but I just put that in there just in case. As for wet food brands, we use either Felix or Tesco home brand. He doesn’t like Whiskas. Tesco home brand used to be his ultimate favourite, but this is the one he is currently refusing. We’re just a little worried that he wouldn’t be getting enough iron if he’s not eating his meat chunks. We leave his dry food down and constantly refilled if he eats it all, so he can nibble on it. He yells for food at the times we usually feed him, but once again only licks the gravy. I wondered if anyone else had had this experience with their cats and if I should be worried. He is a 7 month old boy cat. Thank you in advance!",27Jun2020,1
525,"A few months ago during the heat of coronavirus in our country, my housemate (28m, friend of mine for 5 years) and I (25f)had a conversation with our other housemate about our anxieties about the risk he was exposing us to while we were in a government sanctioned lockdown. Because it was illegal, and because his profession he is not allowed to be breaking “bubbles” for the safety of his clients, he was hiding his outings from us and going out very late at night or lying about where he was. I was very careful to be understanding and gentle, but told him that it was making me uncomfortable that he was constantly seeing people outside of our countries legal “bubble”, going to stores unnecessarily just to shop around, on top of working at a place that had the most positive cases in our area where he interacted with positive cases all day. I had actually been laid off due to the nature of the work he did and the risk of exposure from that, as I work in a group home with a high risk person. Mostly, I tried to come across that it was about our anxiety about all of the cases we were now exposed to. I suggested that if he was going to continue, it was useful to communicate this with us so we know to social distance from him, he shouldn’t touch my dog so things aren’t spread, etc. He responded well and decided to move out to a hotel for the meantime, which his work was able to sponsor for free. When he came back about two months ago, he was completely different and would no longer speak to me or the other roommate. He actively avoids us, no longer keeps his food in the fridge, has not seen us face to face for months except when he was coming back really late at night and unexpectedly ran into us while we took the dog out and he didn’t say anything to us and walked to his room, etc. I tried to speak to him over text and apologize/try to talk about it but he dismissed everything and said he was just busy, I tried to leave a box of donuts for him as a peace offering at his door and he said “thanks” but never spoke to me again. He then said he was leaving in September to find another place. 

I feel so awkward and uncomfortable about this whole situation- it’s so odd to me that this blew up like this, but that he’s also not willing to fix this or communicate about it or even acknowledge that it happened after 5 years of friendship. He made it clear that he does NOT want to talk, so I guess there’s nothing to fix. I really get nervous for when he comes home from work now and hide out in my room because it’s just.... uncomfortable when he comes through and doesn’t even make eye contact and slam his door shut. I don’t really know what to do in this situation. Is he just gonna avoid me for 2 months until he moves out? What would you do?",27Jun2020,1
526,"Hey, I don't care if you want to download something less then legally. That's up to you since you have to live with possible consequences. My friend is a big VPN fan, though he doesn't know much about PCs except VPNs ""protect him"". He downloads all tv shows, movies, music...etc. And everytime I see him he reminds me he has a VPN and that I should get one. He even offered me his name/password so I can install it on my PC.   


I told him no. I feel like using a VPN is something you do if you want to hide something wrong that you do. That and not having one leaves me with no temptation to download things. I'd rather miss a movie or game...etc then do something illegal to watch/play it. None the less he still bugs me about it. Even sent me his name/password anyways in a text. And he messages even more letting me know about how great a certain movie or tv show was.

527,"Hi everyone, I (*17M*) am currently waiting to start my last year of high school; I study Computer Science in a Technical Institute, and I've always loved CS and programming as a whole.

However, when I first started this school four years ago, I enrolled in a TV production class, called WebTV, where students created their own regional news show, complete with cameras, sets, editing and writing rooms. By that time, I also got a lot into photography and cinema. This started giving me doubts about my future.

I am currently stuck between two choices on what course to enroll in when I graduate, and move to University.

* Computer Science: this has always been my passion. I found myself really good at problem-solving, and efficient coding, but the whole thing of working a 9-5 job sat on a chair looking at a computer screen kinda makes me feel depressed. Also, many people told me that this job kinda relies more on skills, and past works, rather than a degree, and that the diploma I'll get when I graduate in high school is sufficient to get a good paid job in the sector; my school has got, like, a really good name in the industry, and works really close with businesses around the country, providing students with a good job opportunity as soon as they graduate.
* PCT (Photography, Cinema, Television): it is a 3-year degree which gives notions about the three fields mentioned before. This is something I really like to do, I worked on a set before, and I really dig the whole artistic process behind the creation of a movie, or a photo shoot. I'm currently working with a photographer right now, but it's more like a sidekick gig rather than a thought-provoking one; the quarantine kinda stopped our work, and we're looking forward to begin shooting again, and I'd like to ask him to teach me more things about photography, so I can start shooting pictures myself. But I also feel like this kind of degree falls behind practical skills and past works/a good portfolio; and that experience on the field, rather than theoritical expertise is favored.

There's also Game Design, I'm really fond of gaming and in the recent months I got into game developing and game design. There are a few degrees in my country, and they'd all require moving to another region, so I'd need to work to maintain a roof on my head, food in my body and paying school fees (which are not as expensive as U.S. ones, but still quite heavy), that means I'd be quite slow in progressing in my studies. And I'm still quite unsure about this one.

**TLDR:** unsure about degrees to pursue: Computer Science, PCT (Photography, Cinema, Television), and Game Design, main choice is about the first two. Love all three fields and would likely enroll in all three of them, but it's expensive/time intensive, so I'm looking for advice about which one to choose.",27Jun2020,1

536," On mobile so sorry for formatting. I felt I needed to make this post though because I (16F) have been really worried about my friend (also 16F) and her drinking over the past month or so and was hoping for your input. In my opinion the situation is really bad, she has been drinking (stealing from her parents who are entirely oblivious) pretty regularly (most days) over the past month or so. She hasn't been drinking particularly heavily on these occasions, only having 2 beers or 2 shots (ounces? What is the proper way to measure booze?) Of vodka or so. She often calls me during these late nights and while not completely wasted she is definitely noticeably drunk. She struggles with mental health and self harm so this recent development has me really worried. According to her it's not a big deal because she's not drinking very heavily or anything and she says she can quit whenever she wants (which I think I believe, I mean every addict says that but  this is a more recent thing for her so I don't doubt that she could stop). She acknowledges that its unhealthy but according to her it's not that much worse than say having a sweet tooth and isn't anything to be very worried about. So sorry for the all over post but I guess what I'm asking is: is my worry justified and should I ne concerned or is she right and I'm just overreacting?",27Jun2020,1

538,"Hey, just wanted to know if its possible if Christianity (if taken to the extreme), can serve the opposite of it's purpose — to hurt and ruin people's lives. My mum has always been a fevent worshipper (sometimes too extreme). She has been complaining about our family's financial difficulties for years, hence my siblings and me always took up part time jobs while studying to provide for the family. She excuses her abled body from work because she is too preoccupied with prayer groups in her church. I feel like she is investing all the time she has available into praying or reading the word. Which is every single day. This annoys me because her religion is getting in the way of basic necessities or duties as a parent which is to provide. Furthermore, my brother has always struggled with mental health issues since young, My siblings and me suspected it was OCD because of the hours he spends in his room folding his T-shirts, tying his shoe laces and being late for school most of the time because he cannot leave the house for dumb reasons. He is eccentric and gets very agitated when we touch or clean his room. He talks to himself some nights in his room and was often bullied. His multiple outbursts over the years made my siblings and me beg my mum to get him professional care. His one and only assessment with a psychiatrist years ago revealed suspected case of OCD. Since then my mother never allowed for follow ups. Her reason of not sending him to get treated or for therapy is because she believes that 'the power of tongue' (prayer) will heal him. she also dismisses our pleads because she is afraid of what the church community would think of her if they found out that her son goes for therapy. in my culture, mental illness is a taboo and many don't seek treatment albeit the severity. It serious sucks how she thinks that prayer alone can miraculously heal him because isn't prayer without action fruitless??? Haven't she realised that her prayers over the years hasn't been working??? Sometimes I feel like her ways or thinking are just cultish and it makes me question my own religion which is Christianity.

My parents are officially together, but if you were to ask me what was the last time I saw them happy while being within 5 meters of each other, I would not be able to answer. Recently my mom and I opened up to each other about a lot of things and I discovered that she fell in love with a man that she met while they were both promenading with the dogs. As much as I am happy for her, because she appears at least 10 years younger and she is practically glowing (when asked if she is happy, she says yes, which hasn't been the case in a long time), I can't grasp the situation too well. On one side, my mother is finally living her own life and on the other is my dad, who works day and night to afford to support us. I am not particularly torn apart over the thought that my mom loves another man mentally, however, the thought of her meeting him (she has confirmed they haven't done anything besides holding hands and platonic kissing and I believe her) behind my dad's back feels wrong. She does not plan to disclose this info to my dad yet, as he won't be flying over until the quarantine situation is finished. What should I do as the kid of both these people?

550,"It's not that I prefer to be alone but that when my mental health is in check, I'm very happy with being alone. I don't get friendship. At least not close friendship. Confiding in people other than, say, a therapist who can help me makes me feel worse and I don't feel any relief from having people listen to my problems without actually giving me good advice or helping me solve my problems. And I know that friends aren't there for that purpose.

The only time I enjoy other people's company is when we are studying or doing an assignment together and they're very dedicated and driven. I love that in people and I get along very well and respect people of that nature.

But other than that, friendships are meaningless to me. I do have friends, I am loyal to them and I do like them but I could still picture my life without them. And the more I isolate myself from people the better and more productive I am. Unless the person is interested in purely studying and mutually benefitting each other then I don't want to do anything with them. I just don't feel a connection with anyone. There's nothing wrong with many people but I just can't do it.

I don't see the meaning of having friends.

I'm scared that if I go out, I'll be putting my parents' health in danger.  We are also living in a city with a really high number of covid cases. Am I being too paranoid?

558,"My fiancee recently had a meltdown about her body size. 

She is a 6'2"" woman that has had two kids and has kept a bit of the weight from the pregnancy. 

I knew that she had eating disorders previously, such as bulimia and anorexia, and thought that it was all weight-related. During her meltdown I found out that the weight is only part of it; she is mortified at her body in general. She hates that her hips and shoulders are so broad and hates that she is a 'giant'.

She then proceeded to show me pictures of her ideal body size and what she wants to look like. The pictures she showed me were of girls, that, quite frankly, looked like they were on drugs or anorexic. She wants to be tiny, with all her ribs visible, and doesn't feel that losing the weight she can lose will change anything about how she feels about herself. 

I made the mistake of becoming passionate and telling her how attractive I found her when she first started crying; unsurprisingly she became angry at me. I know that my opinion of her here isn't what matters, or even capable of making a difference, but it was something that just came out. It is just hard to see the love of your life in such a state of self hate.

I told her that I was sorry for how I reacted, that I felt blindsided by this because she never really hinted at wanting anything more than to lose a little weight. 

She is seeing a therapist for other issues that probably caused the difficulties with her body image. Currently she has online appointments and is struggling to open up about her issues; because it's hard when they aren't meeting in person. The lockdown has her increasingly anxious because she feels like she can't leave the house or be productive. I have never had experience with someone that hated their body like this and I don't have the tools or knowledge to help cope. What are some things I can do or say to help calm her or move the conversation along when she is having a hard day? How can I help her make a plan and stuck to it when she doesn't think that anything will ever help her because she 'will never be a petite 100lb ballerina' that I can just 'pick up and toss'.

Sorry for the terrible grammar and formatting.

565,"I’m not sure if “lazy” is the correct term, but maybe you’ll be able to tell.

I feel like my husband is lazy and puts a lot, of not most, of the responsibility of living a life together on me, and I’m real tired of it. I am the one who thinks about our future, plans for it, has to initiate fixing things around the house or bringing our car to get fixed/inspected. I’m the one who planned everything for our wedding, I make arrangements for everything. I’m so sick of it. 

I feel like I’m a nagging mother to a teenager. I’ll ask him to do things, after I’ve thoroughly researched, and be like “ can you call this number to get our bikes fixed”? He had a bike his parents gave him 2 years ago that I finally pushed him to bring somewhere to put together. Only because I needed to get mine fixed, he’d never do it on his own. Like I asked if he could get the car inspected yesterday (he has half days on Fridays through the summer) and he said it was crowded and he’ll do it next week. Fine that it’s crowded, but I know that he won’t just go next week on his own. It will be me asking him to go. 

I am so busy at work, so busy. He is too but hardly anything like me. I literally work 9-5 and could work through that all night 7 days straight and never be caught up.

When I ask him he gets so exasperated with me. Like “ugh okay” “finne “. Why do I have to keep asking? He smokes a lot of weed and plays D&amp;D a lot. I wish he was as passionate about helping us succeed as he is with other stuff.

I want him to have fun and be with friends etc, I just don’t want the “mom” role anymore. 

We have been together for 10 years, married for 1. I know quarantine is making this worse but it’s also showing me more. I need some advice because i feel so pissed and think about it all the time. I love him and he’s a very kind man with a big heart, but it’s a real turn off.

I had a boyfriend from age 13-18. Thought he was the one. But he fucked me up royally. He was careless and had cheated on me with almost 10-15 girls in the later part of the relationship.


December 2017, we cut contact. In May 2019 he calls me saying he is in my city to meet me. He flew halfway through the country just for this. I go meet him. He wants to know if we can have a future together. I flat out said no. That I was with someone and very happy. Never talked to hom after that. Till yesterday.


He calls out of the blue saying to check his texts on Instagram. Apparently I have texted his current girlfriend threatening to back off and shit like that. It is outrageous. I haven't used Facebook since 2017. 


After that I've constantly received calls from him and his girl threatening me and calling me names. My boyfriend says that this is just bullshit and to ignore. I also don't want to engage in this so I've just blocked numbers. My friend says I should also call amd curse them. But I don't think that is right. 


I've blocked 10 numbers since yesterday and it's getting to me. I am totally clueless as to what as happened. I have not texted him or his girl. I don't even know her name. 


He has sent my friends what is apparently texts from my number to his girl abusing her and me calling her. I have not once called her.

I am so lost. It's taking a huge mental toll on me. Does anyone has any advice

573,"A bit of my background so I can explain what I am going through. I was born into a humble family in an archipelago in the Atlantic. We didn't have much but my dad who got into pension try his best so that my 3 siblings, mom and I would never skip a meal. I am quite grateful for that.  My parents were strict about everything. When we could go out, when we had to get home, who should we be friends with, what we should do, the clothes we had to wear, we had to call them by ""sir and miss"", we couldn't talk back to them unless we were allowed to. I tried to endure everything and one day maybe when I got my autonomy I wouldn't be always under their pressure. My dad brought me to Sweden so I could study and work. Even though it was amazing, I wasn't able to fit in as an introvert and anti-social. I have close to no friends here. I don't know where to go or what to do and the only fun I could have was to play video games. That's where I started meeting some online friends and I got deeply attached to them. But i wasn't realizing that i was getting addicted to video games and the internet. I wouldn't go anymore unless i needed to. I wouldn't do my house chores because i got quite lazy. I would skip my Swedish classes and future courses I've gotten into. I couldn't find a proper job because I knew nothing about my environment and what to do to. I was a complete failure. But my dad was always there sending me money to help me but also scolding me for everything, that i was ungrateful, lazy, that i lied to him several times to get my way around things so he couldn't find out what i was up to.    
Yesterday, he snapped for good and found out i was playing games all this. He was really angry and doesn't want to talk with me anymore (he is a man of his word and doesn't go back in his decisions). He told that if i want things to go back the way they between us i have two options. To back to my home country where i would live with them so they can put me in line and prepare me for life, or i would have figure things myself in Sweden, get a job, study and take responsibility for myself.

 I don't want to go back. The thing i always wanted was to not be pressured by them and try to live by myself. I have recently found a summer job that will put me in some economic stability but not for so long... I want to get back to studying and i don't want to be someone without a paper. But i feel like a loser and that eventually i will succumb and will have to ask for their help again. I don't want to. I want to change and really don't know how to. Could you please give me some advice? Do you think i should return to my homeland and be raised again by my parents as they want me to do?

575,"Since I was a child I had issues controlling my anger. I was physically and verbally violent and when somebody made me angry I tried my best to say things that could hurt that person. 

As a teenager this issues created big problems in my relationships with people. Problems I didn't see until it was to late. I began realising that I wasn't really ok mentally after a bad breakup. A boy I dearly loved left me and even though he didn't specify his exact reasons it was easy to see that that the fact that I was abusive with him made him left. 

After that I tried to be a better person. It worked but not entirely. While I am a lot better at controlling my emotions I still have moments when I go back to the old ways. 

I usually do that when I am tired, stressed and also something is frustrating me a lot. 

I think my problems are a result of my parents not so good parenting. My mother is the kind of woman who cannot say something nice, has only bad things to say, is very controlling and thinks she's always right. 

My father was mostly absent from my childhood. He worked in another country and  I was seeing him 2 times a year at best. I'm sure this made me get either extremely attached to people or not attached at all. Otherwise he was very caring and a total opposite of my mother.

I wish people who went through this kind of issues to give me some advice. I do not have money for a therapist (or self development books)  and I don't really have any friends left that I could ask for advice/help. I recently ended friendships with people who where either profiting of me or being negative with me.

579," 

Okay so I (F16) lost my father when I was a baby and my mother who couldn't look after me due to self-negligence and substance abuse isn't/barely in my life anymore. I grew up with my mother's parents (my grandparents) and after experiencing my mother at 12 years old having a full-on drug mental breakdown have basically lost all my respect towards the woman. I didn't grow up with her, her coming once in a blue moon to give me gifts and or asking for help from my grandparents (I have watched her drain the happiness from them throughout my entire life), she lived with us for a year two years ago and had a whole go at me saying that my deceased father would be ashamed in me because I had raised my voice towards my grandmother in a disagreement. She hasn't been a mother to me my entire life and frankly, I don't believe she deserves to be called that as she has had multiple chances to become better for her two daughters (my sister and I have different fathers and live with different families).

I have had an on and off relationship with this girl (F15) for almost a year now and when I make a joke saying I have no parents or that I'm one step closer to becoming Batman, completely shuts me down saying that "" you do have a mother who just chose drugs over you,"" completely shutting my attempts down on saying that she technically isn't my mother as I am basically adopted.

Is she still my mother although I don't associate her as one and should I be allowed to make jokes about not having parents?

Her mother doesn't like me as I seem like a bad influence because I wasn't raised with my parents, I understand that she has a close relationship with her mother but I don't think she should have thoroughly explained as to why I didn't live with my parents let alone think I am a bad person just by that knowledge alone. She hasn't grown up in a perfect household either with a horrible divorce throughout her younger years and financial troubles, and from she has told me has been getting a lot worse. I have explained some of it to my grandmother who holds no prejudice for those reasons as my grandmother was also a foster child and has dealt with the same judgment that I have gotten.

I don't understand how she says those things towards my childhood although I have grown up not surrounded by it and says it as if she were better then me because of it and I'm not holding this against her but she drinks, sneaks out and has to take very high dosed antidepressants and yet treats me as if I am lower. I'm not saying this to use it against her because although I haven't gone through what she has I understand her struggle and try my best to be there for her no matter what although she isn't there for me.

How should I respond to when she tells me that I do have a mother although just the topic of having no parents in a serious way personally makes me really emotional.

Within a month of dating he confessed to getting a blowjob from a girl in his hometown 2 months before we met. He was clearly very upset and guilty over it and told me as not telling me would be a lie by omission. He said he was kind of desperate and this girl who was a year older than him, was into him and approached him during a night out and they made out and held hands that night. They texted for a while after and most of it was sexting and arranging when they would have sex etc. She had already slept with a few guys my boyfriend knew so she had a reputation for being “easy/slutty"" so she would probably sleep with him. She gave him a blowjob during her lunch break one day. This is the furthest he had gone before we met and he had no luck with girls and saw her as easy because she had done stuff with others and she seemed into him.

I have been thinking about this again and now I'm panicking that this is a huge red flag and he is secretly a misogynist because he saw her as easy and only hooked up with her because he was desperate to get laid.

606,"I'm in my twenties and currently live at home for financial reasons. Both parents are clinically obese (and probably borderline diabetic) and I've come to realise how disgusting their eating habits are. They both sit on the couch and shovel away huge amounts of processed and sugary foods - and they don't ever exercise, either. As I come into adulthood I realise how I absolutely don't want to repeat their lifestyles and want to make better choices for myself. Watching them slowly kill themselves makes me feel sick, angry and also pretty helpless. They're engaging in enormously destructive behaviour that could so easily be avoided. 

I'm a former athlete and am still a healthy weight, pretty lean and make a point of exercising every day. I've also become quite diet conscious in recent months. Like the rest of us, I slip up occasionally and will eat crap. For instance, last week I demolished a tub of ice cream by mysef. But generally I'm careful to pick low sugar and fat foods. 

Want to know how I can live alongside my parents, in the same house, and mentally deal with the fact that they are doing this to themselves. In my mind, they are educated and intelligent people who should know better, and yet they're behaving like children in a sweet shop.

They're asking him to do things right in front of me, as opposed to asking me about them.

I think I'm overreacting, but I've had a history of being compared to, both in the workplace, and not. When I worked as a janitor, apparently who was someone who cleaned better than I did (apparently they felt the need to instruct me on my sweeping, which was super embarrassing and confusing). I've worked in retail and I've had someone actually try to talk to me in slow motion, as if I couldn't understand English, and in that same workplace, on my first day of that job, I found out that the manager was making fun of how incompetent I was behind my back. In my opinion, I was just trying to help- it felt like I never got a chance.

And I also have a problem with her controlling my appearance , I’m not wearing anything skimpy or etc , I just want my hair up to my waist , I’m 15 and know basic hygiene and know that I’m capable of taking care of my hair at that length , but my mother isn’t letting me and said that she’d cut my hair against my will. She’s making a big deal out of it for some reason and would always bully me for having a big butt cuz apparently it’s ugly. She’s always so bias towards my brother , buying him gifts and etc , there was one time I had to run all around a whole fucking resort , won an ipad and when I got home my parents forced me to give it to my brother because he “wanted it” and said that if he ever breaks it , they’d scold him. 6 months later he PURPOSELY broke the ipad ( he has anger issues ) and they didn’t even scold him , they held me ACCOUNTABLE and made me walk all the way to the retail store to fix it and since I have a love for technology, they took that advantage and forced me to fix the software problems he made. The reason why I’m so angry now is because non of my parents bought me and my sister the things we NEED , except buy my brother things despite him just sitting down all day at hes computer playing games. My mother recently bought him an ipad when me and my sister clearly needed it for more reasonable things such as her studies and for me a new digital drawing tablet because mine recently broke , it wasn’t hes birthday it was just a normal day. I often have problems with my mother , she never spoke to me once in my life and thought she knew everything about me. I was once assaulted by an elderly man and my mother blamed me like CRAZY for it , saying that I was provoking him for wearing a pair or OVERALLS and a shirt. BTW I was only 10 back than, and said she knew it was going to happen but she wanted to make me get molested / raped just so she could teach me a lesson apparently. I plan on calling the police on her if she ever touches my hair but I doubt the police will listen to me because she’d say something about me being unable to take care of myself when she again hasn’t spoken to me for so Long and only knew the me when I had severe depression after moving back to my home country from England.

Since Covid hit, she was laid off from her job, but was able to get unemployment momentarily before she landed a new job (woo hoo!) She's now having a number of concerns about the move....and we aren't sure what to do.

\- She was okay with the insecurity of not having a job in CA before Covid hit. She's now afraid she won't be able to find a job because unemployment is so high

\- She wants her next job to be something fulfilling and not just something to pay the bills (she's not sure what industry that means)

\- When she leaves her current job, her daughter won't be covered under any health insurance policy and god-forbid something happens during our transition

619,"First post on Reddit- hoping to get some outside perspective. It's a strange situation. Bear with me. 

6 months ago, I (26F) left for a 4 month trip to travel. I work remotely and live in California, but can't afford it and have PTSD after getting caught in 2 huge fires. I've wanted to move for 2 years, which I've told my friends and family. 

During my trip, I was visiting family in Canada, visiting some online friends in Missouri I've known for 4 years, and then going to 3 other states I've been considering moving to. 

Once I got to Missouri, my friends convinced my to stay with them and let go of the Airbnb I'd booked for 2 weeks. I soon began seeing one of them, X (28M). I've liked X for a long time, but hadn't thought we'd ever be more than friends. We clicked in person and everything's been great. About one week in, everything with COVID worsened, and we were on lockdown. X told me I should stay until it blew over, and his roommate pulled me aside separately to say it was great having me here and to stay as long as I like. 

I decided if I was staying longer than anticipated, I should be paying rent, which I started to do. I also bought almost all the groceries for the 3 of us,  cooked all our meals, and helped keep the house clean. 

I've now been here for 3.5 months. 

Both X and his roommate still seem happy to have me here and have reaasured me that I'm welcome to stay, but obviously I feel weird about being here so long after I only planned 2 weeks. Additionally, my family has been pressuring me to come home to CA because they miss me. My family is very tightly knit and I'm less emotionally entangled with them than they are with everyone else (I grew up between 3 households and so am used to the distance).

I'd talked with X about 2 months ago, and he said he thought it was important I see my family before thinking of moving out here to get some perspective and clear my mind instead of going off momentum from being on lockdown. I 100% agreed, even though we've both been really happy together and would miss him a lot in the meantime. X is fairly blunt and honest, which I appreciate a lot. 

It's now June, and my family has upped their pressure again. I began making plans to drive home because my car is here, and X was thinking about coming for a week as well, but my mom (who has been pressuring me) is now telling me it's not safe and to reconsider. She wants to meet in Utah instead for a week and thinks I should then return to Missouri. California has more infections. 

My concern is that fire season (September) is rapidly approaching, and I would like to see my family before then. If I go now, I risk getting stuck in a lockdown there. If I don't go now, I am most likely committing to being in Missouri until December. If I start to feel like I've overstayed, I'm fine finding an apartment somewhere as well. 

I've been really torn about this. I can't bear the thought of being there during fire season - it was especially dry this year and people have already been telling me about fires. If we have to shelter somewhere, there'd be massive exposure to other people as well. I also dont want to expose my high risk mom by traveling to meet her in Utah, as fun as that sounds. And I definitely don't want X to feel trapped or obligated to let me stay here in Missouri (which I've told him several times).

I don't know what the most responsible thing is to do. I'm happy to answer questions, but this post is already mega long.",27Jun2020,1

He raped me in the kitchen. I never told my mom until 2 weeks, because he said he’d hurt her and I both if I told anyone. Last week I was so fed up and distraught over it and just wanted support from my mom, so I told her what he did. 

She confronted him about the molestation and the rapes and he lost it. He beat my mother so badly that she was unrecognizable and unconscious. There was blood everywhere! I was so afraid. I tried to help but he pushed me into a wall and I hit my head pretty hard and hardly could get back up.

623,"So, I (25F) got my B.A. in Arts &amp; Technology back in 2017. I've been doing video work for the past few years for a retailer, and I've enjoyed it. I get paid pretty well, have good benefits, I like my team, and my parents are very proud of me.

I recently moved from the heart of Dallas, TX to the mountains in North Carolina. Since I've been out here, I've been experiencing nature like I never have before, and I'm in love. I've also begun to hate my job. The videos I'm making feel like a waste of time, as their purpose is to boost sales, bring glory to my company, or share messages that I don't believe. I want to do something that matters. Purpose has always been a major theme in my life and once I realized that my happiness is not in moving up the corporate ladder, I became a little lost. 

So, I'm hoping to change my path to something more rewarding, like conservation. The problem is, I have never even thought about this until very recently, therefore I have virtually no knowledge or exposure to the subject. I've spent my whole life in suburbs/the city, so I haven't been prompted to fully experience or care for the natural environment. 

I recently considered going back to school to get a Masters degree in Forestry, Conservation, or something related. There are a few problems, though. 

1. A lot of programs I'm seeing require an undergrad degree in something related. I'm not sure I can BS Arts &amp; Technology into being related.
2. Due to the pandemic, seems like online school is going to be the only option. Can you even get a degree in these subjects without a physical class/labs?
3. I live about an hour SW of Asheville, NC, and even if I could physically attend classes, I can't find a school nearby that has exactly what I'm looking for.

I know that there's a way to go about this that doesn't include me getting my Masters. One is to just get another Bachelors degree. Though, I would probably would run into similar problems above.

Another is to find an entry level job in the field. The US Forest Service has tons of jobs they're hiring for near me, but I can't figure out what jobs on their website are accessible to me. Most of the jobs sound like they need to be done by someone educated and experienced. There's always the customer service representative but dear god I cannot do that. 

When it comes down to it, I don't even know what kind of job I would specifically want to do. All I know is that I want to do something that at the end of the work day, I'm proud of and I know it's made a difference.

Anyone out there who works/is educated in a related field, please let me know what you think, how you got where you are, and what you would suggest.",27Jun2020,1
624,"I broke up with my boyfriend of three years about three months ago because he couldn’t keep himself under control and had a long history of talking to other women online, trading nudes and paying for them, etc. he’s super scummy and abusive. last night i received two separate phone calls from his friends expressing a lot of concern that he is sleeping with a minor, he is 24 and she’s 14 and i’m really concerned for her safety. so basically my ex had been staying at his friend matt’s house for like three months after we broke up and things started to get weird. he used to leave and go home while matt had work, but then he started hanging around the house while matt was gone and spending the day with matt’s little sister and her friend emma (both 14 years old). i had even seen my ex driving around with the girls without matt there and it gave me a weird feeling in my stomach, like something was just off. over time i guess they could kind of tell that my ex’s demeanor towards emma was off and he would do subtle things like touch her knee. my ex isnt allowed at matt’s house anymore because his mom recently found out about the situation and she told him to never come back to the house and to stay away from emma. so last night i got a phone call from my ex’s friend matt saying that my ex and emma have had sex multiple times and he even gave her a pill because she isn’t on birth control. matt also found two new boxes of condoms in my ex’s car. i found out he’s been grooming her, buying her alcohol, clothes, weed, takes her out to breakfast and gets food with her and takes her out all day. i am really concerned for the girl’s safety i think that anybody could agree the mental age gap between 14 and 24 is pretty massive. matt lives about five minutes away from emma, and my ex would tell matt that he’s going to give emma a ride home and then emma’s mom would call them two hours later asking where emma was, he wouldn’t even drop her off he’d drive around to wendy’s and go smoke weed with her and whatever else. he’s an extremely manipulative person and he even opened up to me in the past about sleeping with his sister 20-30 times when he was younger and other really really fucked up shit and i cut him out of my life. i know that this probably isn’t my place to get involved but it just does not sit right with me that he’s hanging around every day with a literal child. does anybody have some advice on what i should do/how to handle this? unfortunately the girl he’s been seeing who’s 14 doesn’t have a super supportive household and her mother is an alcoholic so i’m not sure if anything can be done if the mother doesn’t see an issue with it. it just really scares me because in my eyes this is abuse, he lives in the same town as me and after i left work yesterday i saw him driving around with her in the passenger seat yesterday with my own eyes. i’m just really disturbed and want to put an end to this. i know he’s messed around with some underage girls in the past too but i have no concrete evidence that would prove it. should i just leave the situation alone? i really feel the need to get involved.",27Jun2020,1

628,"About nine months ago, I (20) and my ex (23) broke up. It was a good thing it ended since I had figured out I had been mentally abusive for some time, and he ended up cheating on me twice. Since then, we have not had much contact, but we have checked in on each other from time to time. I moved on pretty quickly (or so I thought), while he didn't seem to be able to get over our relationship. 

  
The last two weeks, we have had more contact, and we have hung out a few times. We used to be really close, so it has been a lot of fun seeing each other again, this time only as friends. Although my ex has now told me he is still in love with me and that he never lost feelings for me. A couple of days ago we got sexual with the intention to maybe try out fwb, but we quickly discovered this wouldn't work since he felt ""his heart was in it too, not only his body"". To my surprise, I kind of felt the same thing. 

  
We have decided we have to either only be friends or actually try to date again (and he wants me to be absolutely sure I'm in love in case we do this.). Now I feel very conflicted. I'm not sure what my feelings towards him mean - is it love or do I just like him as a friend, and are attracted to him?  

  
He is a very sweet person, and our bond to each other is..very special. I have never felt as relaxed with anyone as I do with him, certainly not with my other friends. I could literally tell him anything, and he would never judge me. We also have a lot of fun together. And, of course, I'm very attracted to him. At the same time, he is also the person who annoys me more than anyone else ever could. We are so alike yet very different, and some of his quirks drive me mad. I do realise my irritation towards him has to do with my own self-image, and that it's something I can work on, but that isn't exactly something that will change in the near future no matter how hard I try. The fact that I wasn't always such a good girlfriend also adds to my hesitation. I've seen a psychologist, and I've worked on my issues, but sometimes I manipulate without even knowing. Around him, I find myself constantly worrying about if what I'm about to say abusive in some way. I'm terrified of being like that again. And I'm of course scared he would cheat on me again. As I said, he is a very good person, but he is quite unreliable/unstable (in literally every aspect). I know we have both grown as people, but of course, there is no guarantee it wouldn't end badly again. 

  
I really want to keep seeing him, but I'm not sure I could keep away from being intimate with him, and I know it would be very unfair towards him to be intimate again unless I want something more - a relationship. But I've never been as close to anyone as I am with him. And he is so helpful and understanding about my issues, which is unique.   
I really need some good advice..",27Jun2020,1
629,"Hi everyone. 

I'm working on a year long contract abroad with the possibility of renewal. The work is quite easy and it makes okay money, but I'm seriously considering quitting because of my colleague. 

She's not trained in the same field as me. That means she needs to ask my help every hour of the day, even outside my working hours. Since it requires very little of me, I usually do it, but considering the sheer amount of questions it does get tiring, especially because I can't trust her to fair on her own at all. 

But that is not why I'm considering quitting. The reason is her personality. She is easily the most unstable person I've ever met. She goes off once a week, blaming me for a myriad of reasons. It's always my fault, I have not somehow met her impossible perfection standards. I am not allowed to spent time on my own because this is read as me avoiding her and then she throws a fit. Either I listen too much (I'm too interested, as she put it) or I don't listen enough, and I'm a shit person for it, no matter what I do. In my mind I've always listened the ""same amount"" and asked questions regarding the topic etc.

I've done nothing but been my own, polite self. Yes, I like spending time on my own because regardless of my talkative nature, I need to recharge my batteries sometimes too. But now I'm getting punished for it like it's a crime? And honestly, she doesn't listen to me, either she's not present mentally or she clocks out of the ""conversation"" as soon as I try to offer my own experiences or thoughts. And she talks a lot. She pours all her problems on me and then asks for a solution, and that is mentally draining. I have been mentally drained for some time now already. And honestly, she's not wrong when she accuses me of not wanting to spend time with her. I still try. I put my best game on, I listen, I console, I offer advice, and when she finally distracts herself by calling someone to do the same, I retreat into my room to just lay down.

She's pretty volatile. I'm not a fighter, I've never really fought with anyone verbally. She yells at me, accusing me of being a shit person for reasons X Y Z and then I just calmly respond stating why I don't think that's correct, but if I'm such an unpleasant person to spend time with then let's not. Then she yells more, I feel awful and stressed, then she calms down a few days later only to repeat the process some days after. My pulse skyrockets every time and it's out of sheer stubborness I stay cool and calm in the situation, because the inside me wants to hide and cry most of the time, but I'm not willing to show weakness to her. 

When it comes down to it, I'm not getting much out of this work experience either. This is basic level stuff that doesn't challenge me and is pretty robotic. This country is not really offering me anything either that would keep me here. I've stayed because of the fact that I signed for a year, but I just can't find any reasons to stay anymore. 

So that's the background to this pretty much. I'm honestly just shaking typing this because I'm afraid she'll find this post and do something. Anyway, the thing I need advice with:

How do I phrase this with my boss? Or should I just lie and say that the Covid situation has taken its toll and I need to go? Because I'm honestly afraid that if I tell the truth, that an unstable and unskilled colleague is driving me out of this job, she'll honestly do something. Like idk, she'll stalk and hound me on social media even when I'm back home, or such. I'm not sure I believe she'd be able to destroy any future career options for me but... I am afraid of something. She's honestly crazy. It's that I don't know what she might do if she finds out that makes me the most scared. I don't want the result to be that she loses her job either, because I don't want to stay for the job, and then I feel she'd really do something if I made her lose her job.

So. How should I go about this. I intend to obviously think about this hard before I make any decisions and that's why I need some outsider voices. How do I go about quitting with this in the background? Am I actually required to state any detailed reasons? At my last job I quit I just chatted with the boss about it and left my two weeks notice, but now I can't do it face to face due to the covid situation.",27Jun2020,1
630,"I don't know why but im not emotionally connected towards my family. Specifically my parents, first off, I grew up without them, up until im 12. They left me with my grand parents-that i also don't feel any emotional connection. My mom and dad,  they're both okay it's just that i don't feel the 'love'. Mom noticed it a bunch of times and she was like ""You don't care about how i feel"" and i would always find a way to cover up. 

I can't remember any happy moments or such, i just want to move out as soon as i can. Im thankful tho, they cared for me because i am their daughter, but i don't love them-hell i don't even know what love means when it comes to your mother and father.

631,"Hi, as the title states im looking for advice on enclosing my back area with wire mesh. My small backarea consists of a verandah that covers most of the top opening, high concrete retaining walls and fencing that surrounds it, and several openings between the fencing and my roof. 

i would like to run a wire mesh across from the fence to my roof to enclose the entire area from above. it may be hard to visiaulise, but the distance between the fence and my roof is small enough to do this, however I am unsure as the the best method to secure the wiring to my fence and roof to ensure they do not move. 

This image gives you an idea of what I mean by my back area, however the distance is much smaller, within 1-2metres, and fully concrete.

632,"Hi all, I’m selling my switch in an attempt to cut video games from my life for various reasons. Selling to my best friend from my childhood, and while I want to give her a good deal, I also am really low on money myself and want to get close to the amount I would get if I sold it to a random person. The pricing works out like this:

I looked for used switches online and the average price I saw for pre-owned ones is 380 USD. I then subtracted the value of the comfort grip and the safety straps  when they are sold separately (I can't find them), and also the price of the left joycon (it's drifting a little, and I figured it was a good way to make the deal a lil' better for her). Price now is 310 USD.

Then comes the games that would come with it. I took the price that each game seemed to usually sell for used online, subtracted 10 or 15 bucks per title, and that added up to 130$. I also didn't include the price of the Smash bros DLC (of which I have all) and Celeste, because it's a game she probably wouldn't have bought if she was buying a clean switch. Now the price is 440 USD.

This is where it gets complicated. Some of these games are digital titles, and therefore I usually wouldn't be able to include them in my sale at all if I were selling to a random person. The reason I can still sell to her is because I'm gonna give her the login to my Nintendo account (I trust her) so she doesn't lose Animal crossing, the smash bros dlc, Jackbox party pack 3, and some other digitally downloaded stuff.

Also, turns out new switches retail for only 300 - I didn't realize that. While it seems like you can't buy a new switch anywhere rn, so the effective price of it is 380, it still feels like I'm marking it up on her. And I can't act like I'm getting less money from her than I would from another person, because I would lose all of the digital games that I'm selling if I sold to a random person!

She expressed some doubt about the original price of 380 for the console, so I'm trying to decide the right thing to do. Sorry for not being entirely concise, and thanks for sticking with me on this. Obviously not the hugest deal, but I figured this sub might help me out. Thank you :)",27Jun2020,1
633,"Hello everyone from the UK. I'm not good at making decisions especially about this situation. I feel like I've been partially scammed.

I hired a small Gardening business to clean then my parents garden. The man offered £60 for the garden and a extra deal of £40 for gutter cleaning too. Also another £105 for cleaning all of the trees and logs that has been left on my parents garden for quite some time now. 

We needed a car or a machine to remove the tree logs unfortunately me and my family don't have a car and getting a job is tough due to the pandemic, I'm also just a university student so finance is more limited.

I wasn't planning to clean the gutter in the first place but I said why not if everything is clean the better. 

A few days went by, he came to cut the grass and take out the logs. However, he then told me he would finish the gutter in the next day with someone else to do the job. 

So, I waited the next day no one arrived. Waited an extra 2 days and no one arrived again. Asked him on Sunday, he said he would arrive in Tuesday. Once again he didnt arrive, texted him on Tuesday he said he would arrive 10am the next day. And yet again he didn't arrive. And again I asked in Thursday and he said he would come today. And again the same story. 

I've gone out of patience of waiting and was wondering what I should do.

I told him my problem with no one showing up yesterday. And again he went on to say the next day. I'm either gullible or too lenient.

What should I do in this situation?

634,"I live in the city but each summer I go to a town in the coast were I have a group of friends, the problem is that we are 14 years old wich means that changes are starting to happen in some people and that's the problem.

Let me get you in context, I have two friends, let's call them Lucas and William, with wich I spend most of my time in the town and most of the times two more join us, let's call them Peter and Martin. The last summer Peter got mad with Lucas for no reason and William and Martin just weren't as friends of Lucas as they used to be but during that summer I tried to keep Lucas, Peter and William united in a group, thanks to me and to Noah, a kid that came in the middle of the summer, nobody had met before except for me and came from another city.

Noah got very attracted to Peter and they became good friends during the rest of that summer but also bad things happened like Peter making Noah be mad at Lucas for no reason, thankfully Noah wasn't so mad with Lucas as Peter. Noah had to leave and him and Peter never talked again. During the next fall, winter and spring a few things happened but the main ones were: William started being friend of Lucas again and Peter started a Cool Kid phase in wich his musical taste changed, his hobbies changed (he used to make abstract art), he stayed out late with his new friends but most importantly, he stopped being friend of William for no reason. Right now the friend group is just Lucas, William and me. I thought about trying to hang out with Peter wich now was best friend of Martin but I tried once and I just didn't feel he was the same.

Now, here come the problem, Noah is coming to the town in ten days and he thinks that we still hang out with his super friend Peter and he doesn't know that Peter has changed so, what should we do? William and I have been talking about this for some time and we just don't know what to do, we could try to hang out with Peter and Martin so that Noah could decide but we also have the fear that maybe Peter makes Noah don't wanting to hang out with us as he did with Lucas.

642,"Hi all, this is one of my first time posting something this personal, So I think I'll just do my best to explain everything.

My grandpa is going to die, they just found terminal cancer throughout his body, and the process went faster than any of us expected, with him already in hospice in a month with only weeks to live. My grandma is taking care of him along with hospice, and she keeps us updated, as hard as I can tell it is for her. I want to give them a call to say goodbye and tell him I love him but he is really foggy because of all the drugs and my grandma says he might not even realize he is terminal, so I will most likely just be talking to my grandma.

At this point, I really want to call, if not to say goodbye to my grandpa, to talk to my grandma, show her the support and the love she has here, but I don't know what to say when I call. Do I ask how my grandpa is, we know that he will pass and she keeps us updated. I don't know if it will be ridiculous to ask my grandma how she is doing, as how could she be doing okay in a time like this. I know that I will probably want to and at some point during the call break down, but should I refrain from doing that to avoid making my grandma do the same?

So let me try to explain.. about 2-3 years ago this guy was after my young brother and he broke into my parents home and stabbed my brother with an axe, luckily it wasn’t that “bad” and he survived. This guy has a young brother who my sister either started dating or was dating at that point. And knowing this she kept seeing him. 
Last year however they broke up. But today I found out that she had contacted him and told him many private things especially about my mom (my mom has terminal cancer, and she has problems with getting to the bathroom) and she told him that she started using adult diapers bcuz of this. And has literally stalked him. Scratched his car. Lurked in his windows and even tried to make other people beat this boy up. She constantly lies, I mean she lies about everything. She’s very manipulating. She’s has something with her liver which means she can’t drink alcohol but still does this. 

I have been trying to be there for her and talked with her and be a good big sis. And every time she will tell me she will straighten up and try to be better. But it always turns out to be a lie and will go out with people that aren’t great for her. And will contact her ex again. 

Every time I try to be there for her cuz I know she’s not in her right mind and I mean that she needs professional help.

When I was around 11 my grandfather passed away, I always lived with my mom and we are a middle eastern family (This doesn't really matter). But, ever since then for years my mom has been drinking with me in the house. Drinking until she is very drunk and in-cohesive, crying audibly loud, bursting into my room in her drunken rants, crying to me, etc. And this has been going on for YEARS. Last time she was very drunk was last year on New Years, I had friends over and she was crying so loud and hitting things that my friends obviously heard, it was extremely uncomfortable. 

Anyways she would take me to her friends house and get drunk and cry and cry, and cry some more. And I had to witness it all from an extremely young age. My dad on the other hand wasn't really too involved in my childhood, he never had a substance problem but would yell and scream at me for almost no reason, when I just tell him about things i'm doing, etc. And still tries to indoctrinate me with his islam (The only thing that he ever talks about). This is already way too long but what I'm trying to say is that I find it hard to connect with my mom anymore. It took me years to figure out that she had a problem and I was watching it unfold for years. I am 18 years old now and just graduated high school and I just wish I had a healthy relationship with my mother. We don't talk much and when we do she makes me so fucking mad for no reason. And it usually ends up in little arguments and it makes its way to explosive yelling.

The savings I'm referring to is also just the big tax break we received this year ( two young kids). We already are burning through it some fixing this house and I really want to utilize this time that we actually have money to make the move. We plan to be careful, pack all of our food and drink, only let kids out to walk in grassy areas not through stores, not even into bathrooms, one is in diapers and we have a travel potty seat for the other so everything can be done in the car. We want to stock up on cleaning supplies for the road to help with stops that need to be made. Can we make this work? Are we overthinking this?",27Jun2020,1

Hi all, using a throwaway. Previous posted this in r/covid_support but it didn’t gain much attention so I’d like to seek more opinions. Sorry for the long post, but I’m trying to be thorough.

My S/O and I are in our early-to-mid 20s. I currently live with my family and she lives with roommates but we’re planning to move in together in the future. I’ve been quarantined at her apartment since the beginning of April. I got laid off due to COVID and am still looking for a new job, but have enough money to get by for now. My S/O works online odd jobs for an associate. My S/O and her roommates are all from a country that was one of the first to be hit hard by COVID, while I’m from here in the US (However, my S/O and her roommates didn’t know each other prior to becoming roommates). I was initially planning to spend quarantine at my family’s house but my S/O wanted me to come see her. My S/O’s space is very small - she lives in a 3-bedroom apartment, with the living room converted into a 4th bedroom to fit in an extra person and save money, so we’re essentially almost always together in her small bedroom.

In mid-April, after two weeks at my S/O’s apartment, my mother tested positive for COVID and she self-isolated in her room at my house for two weeks after that. My mother was tested again in mid-May and tested positive, so she quarantined again. She was tested a 3rd time in the first week of June and tested negative. After some complications within the past several weeks, she feels a lot better now. Despite frequently being in close contact with my mom, four other relatives in my house (two brothers, my aunt and my elderly grandmother) all tested negative for COVID in mid-to-late May (my two brothers got tested at separate appointments, and my aunt and grandmother went together). I was honestly surprised as I thought the four of them would catch it for sure. Before my mom tested positive, they were not always the most responsible in taking precautions against COVID. What are the odds of four people receiving false negatives at three different appointments?

So now I’ve been at my S/O’s place for over two-and-a-half months. After following news in her home country, she’s extremely worried about the virus and critical of the U.S. health system. Thankfully, we haven’t had any major symptoms (though we both are a little chubby, and I had an unrelated disease in my lungs four years ago). She does not want us to get tested as she’s worried that medical facilities could be breeding grounds for the virus. She also doesn’t want me to go home as she’s worried that my mother could have gotten a false negative or still be infectious via her stool or something like that. She would prefer that my mother get two or three negative tests in a row before we consider going over, and I tried to hint at that to my mom, but she doesn’t really plan on getting tested again and her doctors haven’t recommended it or anything as far as I know. My mom is even going out to meet friends (with mask, gloves, etc.) Of course many of my clothes, legal documents and other stuff are still at my house. My relatives have hinted at times that they would like me to come back, and I do have some important matters to discuss which I feel might be better done in person.

My S/O’s roommates have very graciously tolerated my presence (“fortunately”, one of her roommates is in their home country and has not been able to return to the U.S. for several months due to travel restrictions) but things are a little tense/awkward at times with me and my S/O being together almost 24-hours a day. I do go outside at least a few times a week for walks and exercise and to run errands (with mask, gloves) and to give us some space, but sometimes she’s even worried about that. This entire time, she has only once gone outside the building without me, not even for exercise- if it’s a small errand, I almost always take care of it, if we need to get something outside the neighborhood from a supermarket from her culture or something, we’ll go together and is basically her moments where she enjoys being outside the apartment. One of S/O roommate’s works in a lab near a hospital and is outside almost every day, for what it’s worth (though my S/O insists she takes every precaution). It’s a bit overwhelming sometimes as I seem to have basically moved in and we don’t have much privacy.

TL;DR - Been quarantined at S/O’s apartment for almost three months. My mother tested positive for COVID then tested negative. The other relatives at my house all tested negative. Is it safe for me to go home?",27Jun2020,1
655,"So I’m a 18 year old female and ever since I was young I hated affection especially hugs but as I’ve grown older it’s gotten worse I hate saying I love you to my family and friends when I do say it I feel like it’s forced I cringe at it, I hate hugs if I do have to hug someone I’m like a statue I keep my arms tight and I tense up I feel vulnerable when I have to hug someone. My mom gets onto me for never hugging my brother she calls me nasty and assumes I hate him I’ve tried telling her I don’t like hugging anyone and she just moans, idk why I’m like this any sort of affection freaks me out it makes me feel sick. I hope I don’t sound horrible, I have adhd and asbergers too. I feel bad but I just can’t bring myself to give or receive affection from anyone even if someone calls me beautiful especially a family member I freak out and get paranoid about it. I cover up around my own mother and get paranoid even wearing crop tops around her. The thing is she’s never hurt me I’ve never been abused before so I don’t understand why I’m like this. Any advice please?",27Jun2020,1

658,"I had this friend that lived super close to me so I would hang out with her very often. We were very close friends until few months ago. Then all the sudden my friend blocked me and started to do these micro aggresive things like for example         if I'm talking to A she would come talk to A to make me feel alone and if I move on to B she would immediately stop talking to A and come to B and If I move on to C she would immediately stop talking to B and come to C. Latter she started to write hurtful messages on the whiteboard. As this was going on I had talked to a person named A to talk with. A perpressure me into apologizing her even though I did nothing wrong. Eventually I apologized to her. Instead of talking things out like how I thought would happen she publically shamed me. I told A this and few weeks latter A on Instagram demanded me to apologize to her. At first I was a bit suspicious since A knew that she didnt accepted my apology so I asked her why and as she was talking she used a nickname that only she ""my bully"" calls herself,  nobodycalls her by that name. So I knew that she was using A's account to demand another apologize to probably humiliate me again so I said no and she manipulate me making me feel bad and started throwing swears and hurtfulthings at me.*Fast forward a couple of months I received a text from her saying ""hey"" What should I do?",27Jun2020,1

661,My mom’s best friend of 40 years is getting married on July 3rd. Her husband unexpectedly died like 13 years ago so it is an exciting event. There will be roughly 30 people there. But my mom and the wedding goers are in the camp that coronavirus isn’t real and masks are dumb. I don’t feel comfortable being in a church and sharing food buffet style with 30 people I don’t know and who refuse to wear masks. If I tell my mom I don’t want to go because of coronavirus she will mock me and find me ridiculous but I have terrible health insurance and COVID cases are skyrocketing in my state. Should I fib and say the car broke down? Or simply state that I’m not going and let her have her hissy fit and be mad at me? This would be different if the wedding wasn’t during a global pandemic when cases are on the rise again.,27Jun2020,1
662,"     I just turned 27 years old. My husband (A) and I have been married for 5 years. We got married when I was 22 and he was 23 years old. We met when I was 20 years old and I do thank God for having met him. Although we married young and moved fast, he saved my life in some ways. When I was 20 years old I was feeling really depressed and self destructive. I had no loving family and I grew up being sexually, physically and mentally abused often. It had messed with my mental state, because I was so ashamed, I rarely ever shared my experience with anyone. I was living with my friend at the time, recovering from also an abusive ex boyfriend and working as a server in a restaurant. When we met, I was absolutely not trying to get into another relationship, I was also lost and taking classes online to feel like I was working towards something. He fell in love with me. I slowly allowed him into my life and began to experience an unconditional love that I never knew was possible for me. My ex was a career criminal/narcissist (much like my family) and being associated with him landed me my first criminal charge for marijuana. Yes, yes I know I was extremely dumb for even getting myself into that situation, but I’m telling you, I was deeply depressed with myself. I realize now that I let someone like my ex into my life, because at the time I believed it was the person I deserved, the only person that would love someone like me.
     
     At 20, when A (my husband) came into my life, he was the most normal person I knew. His love helped my self esteem grow from feeling worthless to feeling a bit more normal. I kept the stress of going to court and dealing with a lawyer to myself and only shared my experience with A. He comforted me in my darkest time and we formed a deep bond. The marijuana charge had set me so far back in some of my feelings for ambition, because while I was in college, I started to question what jobs I was able to get with having that on my record. Then at 22, while still working and in school, A and I got married. He is originally from El Salvador and there was a situation where we were worried about him being deported.

       I know it sounds stupid for me to have married him considering everything that I had already gone through, but I really did not want to lose him from my life. We learned to bartend together and became known in the community as the married cute couple. We have had an article written about us, attended bartending competitions, and designed a few cocktail menus. Bartending is not something I want to do for long and it is not something I am proud of, but it has allowed me to survive and save money. 

      Throughout our relationship there has always been a lot of love and understanding. He is the best listener that I have ever met and he has helped me heal a lot of my childhood trauma. I also really feel that he is dedicated to me, because I never even once felt insecure about our relationship when it comes to him having a wandering eye or anything like that. On the other hand there were many periods where he would drink heavily after work and come home blacked out. He was never aggressive, just extremely unattractive during these times. Also he is super addicted to marijuana and video games. Those are the things that I wish he could change. I guess because I just turned 27 and I’ve had so much time to process/reflect during this quarantine time, that I am started to look at my life like it is at a crossroads. Even though I feel like this man is so loving that he will be on a deathbed beside me, a part of me wants to leave him. This entire time we have been together he still hasn’t gotten his license or gone through with filing his citizenship papers. There were countless times he was late on his half of the rent and couldn’t help pay half of our bills. I have always been financially secure, because I had to be. I’ve had that survival instinct. So I just let him pay me back later, time after time. The last few months he has turned around financially, but man it was a long time coming. I also am the one to constantly think about our future and I file our taxes every single year. He seems to be absorbed in video gaming, marijuana and staying close to his friends who are into the same things. I have slowly 

      I currently am sober and planning on being sober for a very long time. I don’t have an issue with alcohol or marijuana, I just realized I spent a lot of time drinking with friends and It has been time wasted. I guess I am feeling more ambitious about my future and I want to change my life. I don’t even want to be around people that aren’t sober anymore and I want to spend my free time feeling productive. During this quarantine time I even started sewing face masks to sell and worked on other possible streams of income. I also have been reading a lot trying to figure out where to go from here. I decided I want to go move to Los Angeles, because that is a place I could see myself really growing. I enjoy warm weather, outdoors, vegan food ect.. I currently live in the DMV area and I grew up here, which is why I really want to live somewhere else. I feel my life and time slipping away from me and I’m feeling like I want a shift. I don’t want to be around the people I am around now and I want to be far enough that I can just focus on myself. I have some money saved and no responsibilities to keep from leaving other than my husband and the current state of the economy due to the virus. My husband has already expressed concerns about moving, because he wants to stay close to his family and friends. 

     I keep envisioning myself living out there alone. Moving to small studio to continue saving money, going back to school, laying low and staying busy. Getting my life together, staying sober and basically celibate. Maybe I’m craving so much of a better future, because of everything that I have already been through, that I am actually considering leaving the one person that loves me. A part of me just wants to be my own hero and save my life. I want to have a career and own property one day and I know that situation that I am in right now is not fulfilling that. I love my husband and there were times where I could have never seen myself leaving him, but now I am worried he isn’t changing or he doesn’t see the big picture like I do. I feel like he is always going to be addicted to video games and alcohol/weed. I feel like I am reminding him about priorities everyday and it is a lot of me to deal with, because I am also trying to work on myself. I personally can’t even enjoy hobbies if they don’t make me money anymore, like I’ve gotten so much more serious about my life. I know its because I can’t really rely on anyone financially except for myself.  It’s just difficult for me to decide what to do, because I don’t know if anyone in the future that will ever be able to be compassionate with me that way he has. He is the only person I have ever met in my entire life that has made me feel loved for who I am, a girl that comes from a dark place. I know I am attractive and will have people that may want to be with me, but when I think about my past, I’m afraid people won’t understand who I really am. I feel like he is the only person that I can be myself with and that loves me. I feel like in the far future if/when I let other people into my life they will only see a stupid person that made the worst decisions. I have almost accepted my success in life might have to be lonely and I might have to be the champion of my dream future...Anyway I hope that I didn’t send anyone into too much of a rollercoaster with reading this and I hope that people would share with me the best advice that they have.",27Jun2020,1

664,"Hey guys

I am a 30 year old man with a very small family, but the one I’ve always been closest to is my cousin (he’s 34 male for context) He’s been my best friend since I can remember. We’ve done almost everything together.  Lately though (last 5 years or so). He’s been extremely toxic. This all started when he tried to get a job where I’m at and failed.  (I work in a very stressful sales job).  I worked hard to help him get the job there and he really didn’t apply himself. Took time off. Hung up on people, and ended up just quitting without notice after 6 months. (Only 3 months really working the rest was out on short term for “anxiety” that he made up)

Here is a few of the most recent things he’s done that have really pissed me off

1. When my dad died he took al the bereavement our company offered. Didn’t visit my mom besides maybe one. Didn’t reach out to me to see if he could help nothing. 

2. I paid for him for a trip to NYC roughly 3 years ago.  He’s never paid me back like he was suppose to. Always saying he’s broke. Yet ordering food out everything. Buying video games. Ect

3. I had him watch my dog when I was on a cruise. Not only did he leave my dog outside so it found a way to escape. The dog apparently rolled in some dead animal and smelled terrible. And he just dropped the dog off at my house so my room mate can wash and bathe him

4. I really don’t like traveling alone. But I had to go up north and asked him to go with me. I told him I’d pay for him. He agreed. Than started a job, which would cause him not to be able to come. Than he quit the job. So on the day before I was leaving. I asked him if he was still going.  He than made said I needed to “get over my fear” and that “he had stuff to do”

Now this dudes been unemployed for 3 months (besides the 2 day stint). He’s used all his moms retirement up just paying the bills and is Barry above water.  He sits at home and watches tv or plays video games all day. He has been quit to snap at our friend group (the ones we play online with). Ect

I feel like he’s changed so much.  He never reaches out to see how I’m doing anymore. All he does is be irrationally toxic about everything. To everyone.  I’ve told him before about this and warned him if it continued I was going to cut him off.  I am tired of reaching out. Taking him places to get him out of the house. Helping him find jobs. Helping him financially. Just to have him treat me like absolute shit. He’s supposed to be my closest friend and family member. And he just hasn’t been. 


Should I just cut him off for awhile?",27Jun2020,1
665,I can think of 3 people who have been really mean to me for no reason and the one thing they all had in common is that they had low self esteem in themselves. If you don't like how you look then why go out of your way to be so horrible to other people?,27Jun2020,1
666,"Hey y’all, I’m trying to get more opinions on this matter- please take a quick read and share how you feel if you’ve got the time! 

I live in Brooklyn, NY and last month I tested positive for having coronavirus antibodies. I understand this doesn’t give me total immunity (if any at all), so I have still been very cautious. 

Unfortunately, a couple of days ago my closest grandmother passed away. She lived and died in Houston, TX, where the virus is completely rampant. They’re choosing to still have a funeral procession, and I really want to attend (they also want me to be a pallbearer for my grandmother). 

I have a huge dilemma about this, because- Houston, having the largest medical center in the world, as of 2 days ago was at 97% capacity in their ICU units. I do NOT want to get anyone else sick or infected, and I’m not sure if going down to the funeral is a good idea. If I didn’t go, I would likely feel sad about it for a long time. But I would feel worse if I went and got somebody sick (my mom, dad, nephew, and other family members are elderly and/or immuno-compromised). 

What would you do if you were in my scenario? My grandmother was also a nurse in the army growing up, so I can’t help but feel like she wouldn’t be upset with me for not going because of the virus. I appreciate anyone’s input on this matter. Thank you!

667,"I’m on mobile and English is not my first language so excuses any mistakes 

Allright, about a year ago I was babysitting friends kids and her cat attacked me. Few days later was in de hospital. We are Dutch and live in the Netherlands. For Dutch readers, I have a good health insurance so didn’t need to pay my own risk (eigen risico) for the hospital. We both have a liability insurance (aansprakelijkheidsverzekering for my Dutch readers) and she said if it is necessarily we could use her liability insurance. 
Now it is almost a year later, the scar is healed but so ugly. And I just want to correct it. I got a referral from my doctor for a plastic surgeon. 

There are two options, one is that my health insurance says okay correct the scar or it says it’s only cosmetic so i have to myself. This goes beyond the own risk. That means I have to go to a private surgeon and pay 400-600 euro’s to correct is. 

So here comes the need for the liability insurance. If the health insurance won’t pay, we can try it via the liability because here animals are  ‘property’ and any damage they inflict is can be paid via the liability insurance. Also physical damage. So via her insurance I can get the corrective surgery in the worst case scenario if my health insurance doesn’t cover. 

But she won’t respond to my texts. I explained to her why I’ve come with it now and not a year ago and that I don’t want money from her, only her help with her liability insurance. And if it won’t work trough my health insurance and her liability insurance I won’t enforce her to pay me. I said it multiple times in my text message and she didn’t respond. So now I don’t know what to do. 
I hope I have the consultation with the surgeon ASAP. And I told her I wil let her know when I have more information. But it makes me so insecure and I don’t know how to handle this. 
I just want her to respond. Does someone have advice how I can kinda ask her to respond without being stalking or annoying? It’s just to important for me to have the scar fixed

TLDR: my friend won’t respond and I need her to.",27Jun2020,1

669,"I have been suffering from anxiety since last summer, but I have improved a lot. I began smoking weed more regularly instead of taking anti depressants in January and it’s been great. Since the new year I have barley ever had any major anxiety attacks, only really small ones. 

What I have began noticing is, I make my self sad on purpose to feel it again. This has been happening since the beginning of my anxiety problems, where I would purposely do things that made me sad or made me think sad. Non of these thoughts have led to suicidal behaviour, but it brings this sad chest pain that I guess I crave. I will smoke weed by myself, just to feel so I can feel really sad and think about all the sad stuff in my life. Same with drinking, I rarely ever drink but once in a while I will get drunk by myself just to feel sad. 

I don’t want to say I’m depressed(never been diagnosed), but is this depressive behaviour? I’ve lost joy in video games ever since this started(I still play, but not nearly as much enjoyment as I used to have) and I’ve just lost joy in some things. I realize there are days where nothing but great things happened, but by the end of the night I will make my self think about a past relationship just so I can feel sad and feel that emotional pain.

I’m a girl and my mom thinks that wearing something “for boys” will cause me to disintegrate or something. She wouldn’t let me get a plaid shirt because it wasn’t in the girls or women section.

The weekend after, my mother in law organized a little get together with some close friends and family for fathers day.

674,"I can’t go into huge detail about what my roomie is dealing with at his job, mainly for privacy and also because it’s a lot. he tells me about all the obstacles he runs into pretty much every day (he’s dealt with more issues in the past month). but while he was getting ready for work today, he just broke down over something and it hurt my heart to see him struggling so much with his bosses and fellow coworkers. I really want to help him or do anything really, but he keeps telling me that would be unprofessional and he doesn’t want to come off as unprofessional. 

he’s a sales lead at his store and has been working there for a year or so. the location he’s in gets low traffic yet he is able to still be the best in the company 3 months in a row. he works with the highest form of integrity and respect for his coworkers and the company but doesn’t really get the same back. some of the things he’s dealing with: 1, one of his coworkers told their store manager that he yelled at her on the sales floor in front of customers but in reality she yelled at him and stormed off to the break room (where she then told their SM what “happened”); 

2, after that incident, his boss had a meeting with him and the district manager to talk about being aggressive in the workplace and gave him a packet that went over that. he read it and found out that he wasn’t in violation of anything in the packet but his store manager, some coworkers and district manager fit it almost to the T. he tried to tell them this but no dice.  

3 (this was the thing that made him have a breakdown today), yesterday his district manager said he was going to help him open the store but he ended up being 30 minutes late and he got mad at my roomie for not having the money counted before a certain time even though employees aren’t allowed to be in the store by themselves and need at least one other person there. he juggled sales lead and managerial tasks since the store manager is on vacation, yet his DM complained about my roomie not dusting the walls. he had to do so much all by himself yesterday bc the DM wouldn’t help much. my roomie asked him if he could finish some paperwork since his hands were tied and he said sure. but he got a text in the group chat this morning saying that the paperwork wasn’t done and someone would be hearing about it. my roomie was so hurt because the DM used to be a good friend of his who helped him get the job there, but he recently told him “I know I’ve stood in your corner to make sure you’re not wrongfully terminated or anything, but I’m not advocating for you anymore” over a discussion about my roomie’s concerns in his store.

I wanted to give some examples of the stress he’s dealing with but there’s so much more in between all that. he’s tried to have meetings with higher ups about the issues he’s having, tried HR, tried transfer (but they’re actually preventing him specifically from transferring), nothing has worked, just made stuff worse. his next bet is to go to the labor board. 

I’m a passionate person, and I care about my roommate. I don’t want to see the people who keep putting obstacles in his way for no real reason not get some form of consequence and I really just want to yell to the mountain tops about the crap they’re doing. but I know that probably won’t change much and most likely just make stuff worse. I’ve made sure the place is tidy when he comes home and that he has his favorite things to destress from work ready too, sometimes get food for him. I just wish there was more I could do to actually help him through this. at this point he wants out but there’s nowhere really for him to go. is there anything else I can do to help him with this? 

TL;DR: roommate is dealing with a lot of bs from his job. I do my part to make sure he’s comfortable coming back from work, but I really want to help him more with the situation and I don’t know if I can or how to. many thanks for any advice given",27Jun2020,1
675,"I woke up to a text this morning from this guy I dated my first year of college. 

For some context, we met at orientation day. It seemed a bit star crossed at first, we spent an entire two weeks together after that, I met his parents and we had dinner together, danced around his room to records, stared into each other’s eyes, I thought we were falling in love. Our relationship felt very fated.... a bad omen was, his uncle happened to be my dads divorce lawyer. I should have known lol..

Anyways he pretty much shut me away when we went back to school. He started ignoring me and I was deeply confused. Eventually he told me he was no good and he was saving myself from him. That he was evil and he loved me too much to take me down that path with him. I was confused, but I all but let it go and we remained talking for the year. I was dating other people but we still hung out and fooled around occasionally in between. He changed his mind somewhere along the way and decided he wanted to be with me, but I didn’t want that anymore. He had already betrayed my trust and shown himself. I still wanted to be close to him in some capacity, though. 

It boiled down to one night when I was at his house and we were cuddling/fooling around. He revealed that he had just gotten a new girlfriend, mid cuddle. He said she was a “nice girl” and I was absolutely taken aback. Why the hell are you already pulling your new gf into this mess and cheating with me?! It was all so bizarre. I think he genuinely had some sociopathic tendencies. Not like you see in the movies, but antisocial personality traits like lacking empathy supremely. I left his house some hours later and on the way back I parked somewhere and sent him a text unloading on him. I told him he was a bad person in so many words, I felt sorry for the girl he had harmed, and basically called him socio. Should have done it in person. 

I tried to text him to talk after that to talk, but he never replied. We now haven’t talked for 3 whole years. I think about him but not fondly or anything. I’m in a long term relationship with someone I love very much and will marry someday. 

So anyways, I wake up to a text this morning from this guy. He is asking me for the last text I sent him, the angry one I’m sure, because he lost it and wants it back. What the hell? Is he being genuine, or is this a manipulation tactic? Should I ignore?",27Jun2020,1
676,"I raised myself when I was young because my parents were divorced, and my mom was constantly busy with my other siblings. This led to me having a lot of failed attempts when talking with women. Every time I got anywhere close to being close to a woman, I messed up because I would try to emulate those around me. For example, this girl and I were starting to like one another and I started being really creepy. For example, she showed me a video of her shaking her butt, and I stayed on the topic. She got a bit weirded out. I didn't know what intimate relationships were like. Another example is that I had a crush on a girl, stalked her social media, and she called me out for stalking her social media. Growing up, I went through a lot of mistakes not knowing how to properly talk with women. Especially because I didn't grow up in a positive household.

There’s just so many subjects. I have arabic subjects and English subjects. The English subjects are easy!  But arabic subjects are just useless or misleading.

so last week i (20f) got into a fight with my dad (43m). it was a misunderstanding and everything happened so fast. my mom and sister had come home from their vacation and were standing in the entry way of our home debating what to do with their suitcases and clothes (my family is super paranoid about bed bugs and hotels) and my mom said something a little snotty  to me, who was in the livingroom and I joked back. My mom told me that she didn't want to hear it, I said no one ever does. It was childish but true and a whole story for another time. but apparently my dad had told me to shut up too and thought I was talking to him and being a bitch.

he said some rather nasty things and I just went to walk by to sit in my room so I could cool down. but he blocked me and kept yelling. I tried to say that i was never talking to him and go by. he blocked me again. and now I was starting to cry because my dad is a bigger guy and he was up in my face and pushing me back. the third time I tried to go by my fight or flight kicked in and I was scared so I managed to push by, slide under his arm and go back the hall.

he followed me yelling for me to get my shit and get out of house. I was fine with that. I went back to my room, closed the door and was going to pack my things. then he flung open my door. and panicking, I tried to hold it shut. It was stupid but I was afraid and he was still yelling things I couldn't understand and telling me to get out and that i couldn't have my stuff. he forced his way in as I opened up my closet to get my clothes. and he grabbed me by my hair and pulled me back, telling me to get out and that I could make an appointment to get my things at a later date. as soon as he grabbed me I saw red and dug my nails into his arm. we just sort of looked at each other for a second, gauging if the other was going to start swinging or not and eventually agreed to let each other go. he made me get out of the house and I dont really know what happened from there. I was in a t-shirt shorts and barefoot and about an hour later, found that in a blind rage, i had walked almost five acres through the woods. i didn't know how i got there and I was covered in scratches and dirt, cut my foot badly and hand thorns in my hands and feet. 

I was allowed to come back inside my house and my dad and I havent spoke since. I really thought he was going to kill me that day and every time I go to sleep I feel his hand grabbing my hair and him screaming at me. I want to move out but I only work part-time and finding new job that pays enough has been so hard lately.

A little bit about me:
I grew up in latinamerica with asian parents. Never found a clique or a group of people that i connected with, was always excluded in groups and never discovered a hobby or a way to enjoy my time.
I had a really safe childhood. My parents never got divorced and they always showed me their happy side no matter what. However I constantly broke their trust and disappointed them doing inappropriate stuff and lying to them. Since then I've lived to satisfy and regain their trust through academic excellence; I always felt like I owed them everything and anything I did was not enough.

Being asian didnt help at all. As a kid I would be called alot of names and was initially bullied. This grew on me and I came to hold grudges against everyone, ending up with almost no friends. 

Then in high school things got better but I fucked up big time and had to switch schools. This was the lowest I've been in my life. I wanted to kill myself seeing how my parents were so disappointed in me. From then on I kept living like a robot.

Now starting college I dont have any plans, I live to study and thats it. I never found my passion as I had done everything in life to impress others around me.

Im scared that one day Im going to fuck up bigg time and then I wont be able to look at my parents or talk to them. Im too scared to try new things and ive grown to be a boring and useless person outside of school.

Now that i need emotional support i have no one around me to talk to since i pushed everyone away from me since childhood. 

What can I do to be better. What do i do with my life? Im so lost and havent reslly thought about this seriously. im scared",27Jun2020,1

698,"So, the ex and I talked. He didn't seem to want anything specific of his back and said I could keep everything. We dated for 5yrs, so I have.. a ridiculous amount of gifts/belongings of his. We ended on amicable terms due to a multitude of reasons like timing, our mental health, how we communicated, our lack of growth, past scars in relationship, etc. Overall, he was a good part of my life and I don't resent him for breaking up with me. We plan on at least being cordial/friendly to each other once we've gotten enough space apart, so it's not like we're enemies.

80% of my outerwear belongs to him along w/ some sweatpants, sweaters, and t-shirts (I think I honestly took like 30% of his closet during the time we were together). I've got a ring from him and some clothing he bought for me as well as some stuffed animals that I still shamefully cuddle at night. The breakup is still fresh, so I'm a bit in the 'denial' stage where I think we'll find each other in a few years or some shit.. I don't know what to do.

same college

same year student

kinda liked her, she def liked me too;

&amp;#x200B;

for example. over weekends, during this time i couldn't see her, my feelings used to kinda brew up, and i was almost sure that i had to make a move, or i mean, respond to her, cuz she was already making moves.

and then i'd see her in real life again, and i used to be like ""meh""

all those feelings used to go away in a snap

it isn't even that she's ugly or anything

i cant even explain

but i regreted every second i thought about her

and it has happened 1000 times too

its just crazy how radically my emotions changed too; it almost seemed impossible;

i used to be like, there's no way its gonna happen again. but something wasn't right, and all of it went away in a sec;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

now, obviously, cuz of corona havent seen her in fucking forever

as you can imagine, same is happening now; im dying;

instagram doesn't help too, cuz everyone looks perfect there;

it sucks; i dont know when i'll see her again; and it actually does hurt;

but the thing that sucks even more is that i know that i'll go thru that shit again;

i know that the way i feel about her rn, is gonna change drastically once i see her IRL

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i cant even explain what i want to say....

gosh

i just wish i didn't feel this way, cuz rn, cuz of the feelings i regret ignoring her so much

and again, she looks very good on pics too, and it doesn't help

but i know, that the same will happen;

even tho it seems impossibe.

but it has happened way too many times;;

it even turns into fucking insanity;

708,"Hi, so I just wanted some advice on this because I can’t figure out what is the right thing to do. 

Basically before I knew my girlfriend she was friends with the people in the year above (she was in year 10 whilst they was in year 11), but eventually they left high school and went to college, so she felt excluded and wasn’t invited to as many events and has really missed them after parting ways. However, she still had a mate group of girls that she sat with at lunch n etc and visited at the weekend but she wasn’t particularly close to them and this is when I met her.

Things with them seemed to have gotten worse as they started going there separate ways and she was stuck with only me and about 3 friends that she’d see and it’s making her anxious that she will be alone in college and won’t be able to make friends (she’s been diagnosed with anxiety so struggles with putting herself out there).

I have my own friend group of course, so I thought that if I introduced her to my friends then it would give her a chance to know the people I’m closer to and still be able to live n remove some of the loneliness she has, but we started having a rough patch due to us being unaccustomed to lockdown rules and how it made us change and etc, but I still offered for her to come into my friend group. Unfortunately though it just made us bicker more, so she let me see my friends on my own and now we are fresh and happier again with the relationship, but I feel quite nasty leaving her with nothing when I want to be able to give her something like that.

1. I keep her in my mate group which could lead to more possible arguements and then we could fall out which would only divide the mate group and make it awkward. So it means she has to find a new friend group in college instead. 
2. We keep her out of my friend group so that me and her relationship stays healthy, so then she can count on me being there for her and at least has me to turn to.

I just don’t know if it is considered selfish to keep my friends to myself in an attempt to create some longevity and help us run smoother.

TLDR: My girlfriend hasn’t got a mate group anymore and I’m unsure whether adding her to mine would be a good idea, but I’d feel guilty if I don’t

Two of them are my full-blooded siblings (17 and 11), two of them are my step-siblings (8 and 5), and one is my half-sibling (she’s an infant.)

My stepmom is a wonderful mother and a really great person, but I worry that she is putting my little siblings into gender roles and conditioning toxic masculinity. 

I’m an openly bisexual man, and I’m in a relationship with a boy right now. 
My step-siblings have no concept of homosexuality, or anything other than heterosexual relationships. My little siblings are seeing me wear earrings and nail polish and they seem fascinated that a boy could wear them. I started painting my little step-brother’s nails because he wants them to match mine. They’re asking about gay marriage, and whether or not they can marry people of the same gender. 
I told them that they absolutely could! 
My stepmom retorted that if they marry someone of the same gender, they can’t have babies. I told them that they totally could and then listed examples, like adoption. 
My stepmom let my 5 year old sister pierce her ears, but won’t let the 8 year old pierce his because that’s “for girls.” 
I have 11 ear piercings myself. 
They look up to me a lot, I have tattoos and facial piercings, etc. My style is very punk and the kids love it. 

How do I go about trying to help them realize that being gay, or being attracted to people of the same gender is normal? 
I don’t want them growing up in the closet like I did, it was horrible, and I wasn’t able to be myself until my later teen years. 
My stepmom AND my dad are both incredibly accepting of me, but they’re having a hard time teaching these things to my siblings. 
I want my little siblings to have freedom of expression and love. I don’t want them to be sad and confused for years, struggling like I did.

711,"Hello! I'm a Filipino 21 year old girl, pronouns she/her. Been working from home for the past four months coz of coronavirus. I work with an online publishing company so i write 1-3 articles a day, depending on whether there's breaking news for us to cover. I've been feeling sad lately and it's harder for me to write. I pinned it as writer's block initially but then I tried writing an article under time pressure—I could do it. So I think I'm just really avoiding work. Any tips on how to get past that?

712,"I am a 19F dating a 20M. We have been together for 18 months and he’s everything to me. At the beginning of this year, he mentioned that he wanted to break up. Most of our fights, he says that we’re done and he wants to end it. I end up freaking out and begging him not to leave. This has happened too many times to count now, and I know it’s my fault. I am basically forcing him to stay with me and that should not be how a relationship functions. It’s almost instinct for me when he threatens/says we’re breaking that I beg and plead for him to stay. I hate having to do this and it’s taking a toll on my mental health. Despite all of this, I can truly say I love him unconditionally from the bottom of my heart. How do I let go?

718,"The way my household is set up, my fiance's check handled all the bills, and my income was just used as a surplus of cash flow. We had moved into a new place in Sept 2019, and have pretty much furnished the place (still missing 2-3 items but overall done). When Covid happened, I stopped working, and he was deemed essential. So our living situation didn't change, just less money for ourselves. 

My unemployment finally came through, and I got months of backpay, a lot. It feels like we saved up my checks, without having to do the work. Of course, we bought some things for ourselves, but there's still a good chunk left over, not to mention the continued unemployment checks to come. I really don't want to blow this money, we essentially were just handed our savings account. 

My question to Reddit is, what's a good way to invest some of this money? My fiance has always wanted to get into stonks, and now we have the financial resources to do so. I'd like to put half of what we have now in savings and invest the other half into stonks.

But due to the COVID epidemic, i, and the rest of the family, had not been able to find a job in our previous state. So we moved to another state and the plan is to live at this house for a year at which point my step-father will have obtained a special home loan only available for veterans which will be used to purchase land with the intent of becoming farmers. He has done the math out of estimated profit x acres of various vegetables and he has connections with many of the local restaurants here (many of whom are wanting fresh culinary mushrooms which my step-father knows how to grow). 


The problem: I can't stand my step-father constantly treating me like a 14 yr old kid when i am 21. I've thought about moving out and living on my own but there aren't any jobs available that my degree would qualify for. The only jobs around here are fast food and factory jobs. In addition, I'm terrified about living on my own because when I was in college (approx. 100 miles away from any relatives) I had been kicked out of the dorms because i was unable to pay them off in time when i was working full time (at a fast food place) and a full time student.",27Jun2020,1

724,"Okay so here’s what’s happening: I got a package on Tuesday or Wednesday that was delivered to my address yet didn’t have my name. It’s common to accidentally get someone else’s mail so I didn’t think anything of it. So I put on a blue stickie note saying “this person doesn’t live here” and put it back in the mail so it can be taken care of properly. 

Fast forward to yesterday: A lady comes to our house claiming immediately that we stole the package. I told her what I did with it (Do keep in mind I did not open it or tamper with the package AT ALL except for adding the stickie note. I have no business in opening things that are not mine.) yet she still claims we have stolen it (UPS did send picture proof they delivered it to our address) and that it’s a federal offense. We know it is yet we didn’t take it, just sent it back to the sender without opening it or tampering with it. She just left saying it’s a federal offense and now my address is one the neighborhood watchlist.

I wanna know if anything bad will happen and what can I do to avoid this again? Will I be charged for theft when there’s no proof of me physically taking the package inside my home even if I did return it to sender?",27Jun2020,16

I straight away felt very uncomfortable, since he previously talked about how he used to have a crush on this girl because he thought that she was attractive. I expressed my discomfort but didn't ask him to stop being friends with her. He went on to mention that he had about 6-8 other friends who had onlyfans accounts. This ramped up my anxiety and discomfort about the whole situation since I was wondering how he met these people online. My bf doesn't understand my discomfort and I'm not sure what to say to make him understand. I don't have anything against people who sell nudes online or do sex work, but I wouldn't like to have them anywhere near me when I'm in a relationship and it makes me uncomfortable that my boyfriend talks to so many people who do that stuff. I don't really know what to do about this since I'm not entirely sure why I feel so uncomfortable with it. He also said that selling nudes on onlyfans was the same as sending personal nudes to other people (and these aren't the same thing imo). Is it wrong to feel uncomfortable?

I then asked if I sent her more money, would she send me nudes. She was disgusted with this, and I am too with myself for doing this. It was a horrible thing to ask. I've now deleted said anonymous instagram account. However, I feel so bad about this. Can she find out any info about who I am via my also anonymous PayPal?

731,"A month ago my dad encouraged me and my big bro to start a project with the money we saved and we said sure and started looking into it but not much since we had all the time in the world. And now like three days ago I read that ps5 can handle 8k for some games (I was just saying it because we were sitting together and I happened to see it on my phone). I really didn't expect much since our dad banned buying anything from the internet since we were born we always buy from stores and the last console we had was PS2 (we had a PS1 but I wasn't born to see it before my bro and sis broke it). So we didn't expect our dad to say this what so ever he said ""if you have the money for it when it releases, I will buy it for you"" and he wasn't joking. We were shocked we don't know why he said it and why now. And that means he will buy it from the internet because the area we are in there is no way in hell a ps5 will come here on it's release. Me and my bro were so excited.like this moment is like heaven for us lol. After taking some chores for extra money and doing some calculations we will barely have enough money for it when it releases (20 august I guess from what I heard). But then we remembered our project and when we told dad he said ""I won't help you with the ps5 but I will help you with the project"" (and he meant financially). Now we are so confused on what to do because:

1- we have never done a project before so we aren't experts in this what so ever
2- if the project fails our hope will go down the drain and we will have regrets
3- the time it will take to get back the money back that we spent on the project will take ages
4- we don't know if dad will give us this opportunity again

Before we were like ok because we had nothing to lose but now dad got our hopes up on the ps5 we just can't decide and both of them will take all our savings so yeah. Please give us any advice what do we do?

736,"I (20 yo, female) just recently got a DM on insta from a girl I never met before.

 She said ""I know you don't know me but you are really pretty."" I thought nothing of it because I get messages like these once in a while, so I simply said thank you and went on about my day. Then this person dm'd me again, asking how my day was going. I immediately got suspicious because usually girls that have sent me similar texts NEVER continue the conversation. 

I went to their profile and their bio reads ""Hi my name is (her name), I am new to instargam, I am 21 years old and from North Carolina but I currently live in Seattle. Not sure what else to put here."" She only has three selfies, posted within a day of each other. 

Then I went to check out who she follows, and this is where it gets creepy. I would say 90% of the people this girl follows are other girls from my small hometown in Tennessee. The other 10% are celebrities and a couple porn accounts. 

So I continue talking to her just to see where it would go and if I could possibly get more info from her. She claims she just broke up with her bf and that she is thinking about starting an only fans account...She went into ALOT of detail about this breakup, which was weird because she was being so open with a complete stranger. 

I decided to set up a grabify link in order to see where this girl was located - she clicked the link and it said she's located in Newark, New York. Now I'm thinking ""Why is a girl who basically only follows females from my small Tennessee hometown, saying she lives in Seattle and is located in New York, texting me about starting a nudes account on only fans?""

 I then decide to ghost her a bit just to see her reaction - she double texts and starts liking replies I had sent previously. THEN I get in contact with one of my friends (19 yo, female) and she says this girl has also followed her and dm'd her with the EXACT conversation starters she used with me...I mean WORD for WORD. 

So now we're thinking it might be a sexual predator who is targeting young females in my hometown. I am not sure what I should do; I know local authorities would do absolutely nothing. I have been advised to report his account on insta, but wouldn't it just be taken down and this person would just make another account and keep preying on these girls? As of right now I have just blocked the account and made sure to switch my account to private...",27Jun2020,5

738,"Backstory: To make a very long story short, I dated Kyle (fake name) in 2012 when we were 15. It only lasted 5 months and I didn't think it was that serious, but the aftermath of the breakup was messy and dragged out for 4 years. 

The relevant event in this aftermath was that when we were 16, Kyle threatened to sexually harrass/rape me. I had agreed to meet him face to face to talk. He was acting weird, my instincts were telling me to run, so I bailed. 5 minutes after I got home Kyle texted me that it was a good thing I'd left, and proceeded to describe in graphic detail that I don't care to recount about all the sexual acts he would have forced (his words) me to perform on him had I stayed. 

I cut contact for a while but because we had the same friend group it didn’t last. 

By the following school year (age 17) we were sort of friends because he apologised, and I figured it was easier to accept it and try to move on since he’d never actually touched me. Nobody except 1 friend knew what had happened with me and Kyle. 

I used to skip school a lot with a bunch of friends, and go to Kyle's house because that was where the Xbox was. I started having a number of health problems and at one point, ended up passing out at Kyle's house. I woke up an hour later in Kyle's bed. A friend told me that Kyle and another friend had carried me into the bed when they couldn't wake me up. 

That night, Kyle began texting 'jokes' about how out of it I was, saying that he could have done anything to me and I wouldn't have known. I asked the other friend who'd helped carry me to the room and he said he'd left Kyle alone in the room with me for 10 minutes or so when he left to use the bathroom and then get me a glass of water.

I told Kyle his jokes were making me uncomfortable and he told me it was just a joke and not to take him so seriously. I stopped going to Kyle's house after that.

After graduating, I basically went no contact with Kyle. We were unfortunately reunited by a mutual friend who didn't know the situation. More drama, he sent me some unsolicited dick pics, but DESPITE ALL THIS Kyle and I reached a point where we were civil - the extent of our relationship was that we followed each other on Instagram and texted to wish each other happy birthday. Nothing else. (I'm not the best at making judgements, clearly)

Kyle now has a new gf. A few months ago he posted an IG story about a guy who was harrassing his girlfriend through DM's, asking his followers to go and report the account. After asking everyone to report the account, he went on to give an IG story lecture about how people who sexually harrass others have 'nothing better to do' and 'something is wrong with them' and 'people who do these things really piss him off'. 

Understandably, the hypocrisy upset me. I didn't want to cause drama, so I just (finally) quietly blocked him. It was my birthday a few days ago, and apparently Kyle tried to message me and found out he was blocked. My name was brought up in a conversation a few days later (they were reminiscing about high school apparently) and Kyle mentioned offhand to a mutual friend, Sam, that I was being a drama queen again and had blocked him for no reason.

Sam asked me about it, and I finally broke down and told him the whole truth about what Kyle had done to me and why I blocked him. Sam also knows Kyle's gf, and asked me if I had warned her what had happened and about what a hypocrite her ex was. I had not. I don't know the girl. Sam said I should tell her, and that I was letting her continue to pursue a relationship with someone who may be a sexual predator. 

I said I didn't want to involve myself in the situation. I don't want to put myself back on his radar/in Kyle's bad books, especially since he knows where I live, and I live alone. I am still genuinely afraid of him, and I have never doubted he meant/would have done everything he threatened to do to me that day. 

Sam said he understands, but asked me to think about how I would feel if something were to happen to this girl, and I could have prevented it. I have a few screenshots as proof of Kyle just being vicious to me, but not all the sexual harrassment texts, so I don’t know if she’d even believe me. They've been together 2 years and seem happy enough. Kyle would know for sure it was me who told her.

745,"Apologies if this is too long...

I am a divorced 36 yr old woman who bought a house a little while ago that I knew would need some cosmetic work. This is the first house that I bought myself, and I was excited at the prospect of fixing it up even though I didn’t have much knowledge as far as DIY goes. 

My dad (73 yrs) is retired, in great shape for his age, and offered to help me fix things up. He has owned/worked on a lot of houses, so I was excited for us to spend some time together and hopefully learn from him. 

I’ve started to notice, though, whenever I start a project, he tells me about part of it that he wants to do, but then stalls and completely wrecks the timeline that I planned. When I try to say anything at all about it, he gets defensive and tells me condescendingly something like, “I know you want this done tomorrow, but it is going to take a little longer than that.” 

And when I tell him about a project I have planned to do myself, he will say something like, “I don’t want you to do that,” or, “wait until I’m there to do that.” 

This is really making me doubt myself. Am I really that much or an idiot that, at 36 fucking years old, I can’t be trusted to install a light fixture myself? 

This morning he came over to tell me that part of a project that he suggested is not something that he is comfortable doing himself. (Installing blocking to hang a bathroom sink between studs, if it matters) Once again he said, “I know you want this done tomorrow, but it’ll be a little longer than that.” I said that I just like it when when I plan something, it goes as planned. He responded with, “maybe you should have included someone who knows what they’re doing.” 

He then walked into the bathroom that is being redone and proceeds to point out all the issues with the tile I had just put down. 

I’m ashamed to say, but I just spent the morning crying my eyes out. I don’t think I handle another incident like this. Am I just being over sensitive? I don’t know what to do. 

Sorry, this has just turned into a bit of a rant...guess I just needed to get this out of my system.",27Jun2020,1
747,"I’ve [24F] always had major insecurities about the people I like (romantically or platonically) liking me back to the same extent that I like them, and lately I’m feeling very physically and emotionally distant from my close friend group from college. We’re a few years out from graduation now and have historically done a good job at maintaining our close group dynamic (plus we all stayed in the same city so that helps) but over the past year or so we have been kind of doing our own things with respect to serious partners and jobs. We are mostly all in long term relationships and I am now the only one who doesn’t live with my partner. I instead live with another girl who is part of our group but single, and who I’m probably closest to due to history and just getting along the best. She has naturally felt removed from the group for a while now, seeing as she doesn’t have a long term partner like the rest of us do. 

I understand up to this point that it’s all a normal part of growing up and just what happens to friendships between college and adjusting to our individual lives beyond that. However, I feel that because I’ve chosen to live with my best friend instead of my partner I’ve also inadvertently chosen to be looped into the dynamic of being the single friend in a group of mostly couples. My partner and I are rarely included in outings that involve the other three couples, despite us all getting along well when it’s the whole group outside of just the couples. Then throw this COVID-19 mess into the mix and the physical distance is just exasperating it. 

Our area is slowly (and stupidly but that’s for another post lol) moving towards “reopening” so we all got together for a small gathering that was the first time I saw most of them in months and it was SO nice. Naturally I want to be doing more of that, in a safe and conscious of what’s going on manner of course, but it seems like the three girls who are in relationships are doing things just the three of them or with their partners and not looping me or me + my partner in. I don’t know if it’s just this dynamic that’s popped up bc of our respective living situations or if it’s a more conscious decision on their part, but either way I don’t like it/it’s capitalizing on my insecurities and, really, I just miss my friends. 

The advice part of this long winded post is, how do I broach this topic without a) appearing desperate (this is something I have always feared, appearing desperate for companionship) or b) making a thing out of something that’s actually nothing and then causing the dynamic to be more awkward than it had to be?",27Jun2020,1
748,"RESIGN OR GET FIRED?

Needing some outside advice. 
Long story short,
I’ve worked for my current company for the past 8 years and have worked my way into a Store Manager role and the company relocated me last year. 

The store was a fucking mess when I got it, my DM flat out told me she hates her job and it shows. Fast forward 10 months and I am MISERABLE and the store is still a mess and my boss is constantly writing me up for mundane shit! I’m here upwards of 70 hours a week, busting my ass, salaried @ 40. The job has completely wrecked my mental health, I haven’t been to a therapist in almost 10 years and I’ve now just started seeing a new one in my new town to deal with the stress. 


I’m currently in a relocation contract with my company, if I happen to get fired or quit before 12 months (I’m currently at 10), I have to pay back half of my relocation fees. I don’t see my boss keeping me for another 2 months, nor do I see myself hanging in there without snapping for another 2 months. 

I have 4 months of bills saved up.
SO THE QUESTION ISSSSSSSS:
Do I wait to get fired, so that I can apply for unemployment even though it may tarnish my reputation, and I’ll have to pay back the relocation fee?
Or 
Do I resign, save my reputation and my health, but still have to pay back the relocation fee?",27Jun2020,1
749,"I've struggled with eating disorders in the past and have always been on the smaller side normally (5'6, 118-125 lbs) which has impacted my hormones and overall health. I was just diagnosed (but suspect I've had it for years) with hypothalamic amenorrhea, which is where your brain isn't communicating properly with your hormone production due to basically being malnourished. Right now, I'm not tracking calories or doing anything like I used to when I was anorexic, I just don't have the capacity to eat that much. to make that worse, I've been pretty depressed lately (I'm in therapy) due to some life changes and I have ZERO appetite 85% of the time.

I really want to fix this and know I'm doing everything I can to help myself mentally and physically get better but it is SO hard when you're supposed to eat 1800-2000 calories a day AND you don't want to eat at all.

758,"Around last July I became really good friends with a girl, she was just perfect. 

Athletic, Intelligent, caring, and super nice.

We talked pretty much every day for hours whether it was on face time or on text. 

Then once school started back up we talked at school and started hanging out in person. Now these were the golden ages.

We did this for months, going to restaurants, parks, her house, my house, sporting events, physical training all that.

We even set up a trainer to see both of us for like a 10 week program so we could spend even more time together. 

To start the problem off, there was this guy that she and I absolutely hated. Almost every time his name came up we’d both talk trash about how creepy he was.

We couldn’t see each other for a while because of thanksgiving break. And ON thanksgiving she tells me that she’s now dating the guy we both hated. Now if it wasn’t obvious at this point I had strong feelings for her. So as you could guess this news was devastating to me. 

I was waiting on telling her that I liked her since we only were friends for 5ish months and i didn’t want to ruin our friendship.

After this she slowly lost contact with me, even though i tried to remain friends with her. Reason being? Her bf knew i hated him and didn’t want her to be friends with me. So she slowly stoped trying. 

After she told me this i dropped her from everything for my own good, this went on for about 2 months before she hit me up saying she wants to be friends again. I said yes.

Now you’re probably saying why would you accept? She’s hurt you before. Good question.

Every single time i talked to her she complained about her bf, i endured it and tried to help. But honestly all i wanted to say was, “really the guy you hated and said was a creep is treating you bad, who would’ve guessed?” 

Turns out this whole thing was pretty much just to get back at her toxic bf, and i don’t think she actually cared if we were friends or not. 

After i realized this i dropped her once again, and that brings us to today. 

A couple weeks ago HE broke up with HER. Who would’ve guessed? After this happened she tried to reach out to me and asked me to be homies again. I didn’t answer, but my question to all of you is...

What should i do now?",27Jun2020,1

763,"I'm not sure if I'm posting this on the right subreddit, but if I'm not, I'll move it somewhere else. I told my friends about a situation that happened to me. And they told me he pressured me into it. What happened is one night a while back, I was at a friend's house. She has a big brother and he had a friend over.  Earlier in the day I was telling my friend about problems in my relationship. The friend, we'll call him Nate, which isn't actually his name. Anyways, he took my phone while I was on it and I tried to get it back but he was really tall, and he made me add him on Instagram and then gave me my phone back.

He started texting with me and flirting. I had a boyfriend at the time yet I still flirted back. And I'm an idiot for it. He knew I had a boyfriend and I told him repeatedly but I flirt with everyone in a friendly way so I thought this was the same. He told me to meet him in a room where no one was and we could see where things would go. It was the middle of the night btw and my friend's brother was gone because he went to see his girlfriend for a bit so we went into his room. I was terrified but I went. He hugged me once I got in the room and then things were awkward so I was sure things would end there.

He kissed me and asked if I was okay with it and I said no, and then said yes. (you'll find that's a common theme here, I was scared that I would hurt his damn feelings and I wish I would've just fucking never said yes, but on with the story) we started making out. He asked if I was comfortable, I said no and didn't go back on my word. He said you'll be fine, hugged me and continued kissing me. He started touching my breasts and asked if I was fine with it, I said no, then I said yes. He slid his hand under my shirt and began fondling them and it was terrible I was so uncomfortable but I didn't say anything, I didn't leave. 

I told him I didn't want to do this, he told me not to worry, everything would be fine, nobody would find out, I felt like throwing up and he continued. He moved my hand towards his member and asked if I wanted to touch it and I said no and yanked my hand away then he hugged me and apologized. He went back to kissing me. He then took his penis out and put my hand on it and told me to jerk it. So I did.

He asked if I wanted to do this, I said no, then yes. I did what he said. He sat down on the bed and told me to suck it so I did. He cummed in my mouth and it was terrible. I went into the living room with my friend and when she went to sleep, I cried and cried. 
In the morning she found me crying and I told her what happened. I texted my boyfriend and told him too, he deserved to know. He took a while to process it and then decided it wasn't cheat and I was pressured into it and still loved me. I didn't deserve that.  I'm a slut, I'm terrible, I deserve nothing for doing that, I'm scum. I didn't eat for a few days after that because I felt I didn't deserve to eat because I was a terrible person. 

Me and my boyfriend are still together, but i still feel terrible for what I've done. CPS got involved because the school counselor found out and i had to go talk to some people, but anyways, I want to know what you guys think. I told people I trust about it, even someone that I'm not close to but she went through a similar experience and everybody said I was pressured into it, but I just feel like a slut.

765,"First of all, I love my residents. I don’t hate the job because of the people that I look after. I wanted to throw that out there. I’m a 24F in the Midwest, for reference. 

I work at a group home facility for young adults that have *severe* autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. **The specific group home that I work for is a “last resort” for many of the residents AKA they got kicked out of every other home they’ve ever been to.**

**The turnover rate is astronomical.** Generally, staff doesn’t last more than a few months. The good staff usually quit or find a more “normal” job. The bad ones stay because they have no other options. I have a hard time handling the attitudes and “trashiness” of some staff members. 

**The pay is JUST enough to keep you afloat.** I get paid *just* enough in order for it to be worth it. The pay just isn’t sufficient to what we have to deal with. I guess I can’t really complain too much about the pay, though. 

**Second shift is a trap.** I mainly work second shift, and I feel like I got trapped into working them. Second shifts are awful. We are ALWAYS short staffed, simply because everyone refuses to work those hours. The twelve residents are always rearing and ready to go between 3-11 PM. It’s freaking exhausting. 

**I do all of the work.** The second shift crew is decent. The staff is either fresh out of high school or middle aged. I’m in my mid-20’s, so I feel like everyone just puts everything on my shoulders. The young staff doesn’t know how to deal with the residents due to a lack of life experience, and the older staff all have health problems. I do most of the running around, cooking, activities and entertaining the residents. 

**I get my butt beat on a daily basis.** This is the worst thing about my job. The residents tend to be very violent. I’ve been kicked, spit on, punched and hit by a variety of different residents. This comes with the territory, but it sucks. I’m still not used to dealing with the violence. 

**It’s a glorified daycare for adults.** The only difference is that they never leave. I deal with so much poop, pee, and bodily fluids. A lot of them want to be babied and act like I’m their mom. The goal for the majority of the residents is to one day get a place of their own, but it’s hard to motivate them when the staff waits on them hand and foot. 

I don’t know if I should look for another job. I’m torn, because I know that the residents would probably get another staff that isn’t up to par. Everyone at work constantly talks about quitting and looking for another job. I feel like that’s common, but it’s a little disheartening to hear. 

This is a stupid question, but would you keep this job? It seems like I don’t have any other avenues to go down.

789,"Long story short, during a tumultuous time in my relationship with my parents, my mother decided she needed to administer a hair-follicle drug test on me to see if I had used anything in the last 3 months. As a condition of getting to live in the family house (moved back home from college bc/ Covid,) I have to comply to two urine tests a month. It’s a silly thing for my parents to do, but they have a thing about drugs and I don’t care bc I know I’ll test clean. However, my mother believed that because of ‘behavioral issues’ (we were fighting and my mom said I was having ‘mood swings’,) I may be doing harder drugs. Once my mom started getting suspicious, my parents implemented a rule that I have to submit to a hair follicle test or go live somewhere else (I have no money and only a part time job at this point.) I agree, because it’s the easiest choice. I’ve had a problem with marijuana in the past, but I’ve never done harder drugs and have shown no evidence of doing any. I’ve tested clean on multiple at-home urine tests and have been sober for an extended period of time. 

My mother is a very headstrong person, but when she’s upset she can get aggressive. I’ve broken the incident into parts for clarity purposes.

1-She calls me upstairs while I’m unsuspecting and cuts a sizable chunk off my scalp. I’m willing to endure the one chunk just to get them off my back, bc/ I know nothing worrisome will come up on the test. 

2- I’m called upstairs again, and my father sits me at the dining room table. My mom explains that she didn’t take the hair sample correctly so my dad was going to do it over again.

3- I start to get upset, saying I thought we had taken the sample already, and that I don’t want to loose more of my hair. My mom and dad say “well you agreed to this as a condition of living here.” My dad says “if you keep complaining I’m going to cut it all out in one go. Do you want it cut all in one spot, or in multiple smaller spots around your head?”

4- I’m crying and asking them to wait until after our counseling appointment the next day, and the psychiatrist can advise us. They insist on doing it anyways. My mom said “stop crying, you’re acting so done-to” (oh woe is me)

5- My dad cuts 3-4 (1”x.5”) chunks out of my hair, reminding me that I “agreed to this.” I go downstairs crying, and write out everything I want to say at the upcoming meeting with psychiatrist.

6-NEXT DAY Meeting with psychiatrist goes well, he demonstrates better crisis management skills, and a rule is enforced that “any drastic action will be taken after meeting with psychiatrist” is put into play. He assures my mom I’m not exhibiting signs of hard drug use. Some pressing issues get cleared up between my parents and I. And in the following days, animosity and conflict presents itself significantly less. 

7-WEEK/WEEKS LATER Still maintaining some significant improvement, conflict level significantly less than before meeting with doctor. Nothing has been said about follicle test. I get nosy and poke around my moms room, and I find the hair sample and the test kit in the bottom drawer of her dresser.

8- I confront her and ask why she hasn’t sent it in, she said she planned to do it later and would get to it.

9-WEEK LATER I check the drawer again and the hair follicle test and sample are still there. I get upset and pitch a fit to my parents, not very adult of me I’ll admit. I meet with psychiatrist and I tell him I feel like she used the follicle test to belittle me during a time when she was angry. He says that he’ll help me confront issue in next family session.

10- Discuss follicle test in family session. Mom says that “she isn’t worried about my drug use anymore, so she doesn’t feel she needs to send it in,” psychiatrist helps me explain how doing that could be perceived as an attempt to hold something over my head and that it was reasonable of me to ask that we wait until after seeing the psychiatrist to take the hair sample. Her response is to say “I stand by what I did, I would do it again” and then to eventually go silent when gently prodded by doctor.

11- Doctor reproaches issue by saying “well if you don’t feel worried about it anymore, could you throw away the sample?” THIS she agreed to, I have no idea why. But we eventually tossed the sample with the agreement that a follicle test wouldn’t be Readministered.

791,"I (M19)literally don't know what has come over my friend from university, but whatever it is, I'm not here to accept this treatment and let this shit go.

All of sudden, over text, he has started to outright tease/banter with me but he isn't stopping eventhough I'm dropping literal hints that I'm not in the mood and even told him to cut it out. He replied to a picture I posted basically calling me a punk ass and all this nonsense. I replied with a witty remark to which he laughed and carried on. 

I decided that maybe I'm reading this wrong and gave him the benefit of the doubt, but his recent behaviour is getting to me. According to him and some other people, I ""always get aggressive"" but I only get aggressive when people give me unnecessary shit like this.

Honestly if he says one more sarcastic or passive aggressive remark to me, I'm willing to call him out on his shit and leave this friendship. I'm nearly 20 years old, I don't have time for people behaving like flippen children ffs.

795,"With all the rape stories and the #metoo, my ex decided to post on her social about her own story. About how I was extremely abusive and how I was a pathological liar. She continued on by saying how scared she was of me and how I manipulated her. I was caught by surprise when she posted this and she actually blocked my account so I wasn't able to find out. My friends sent me a screenshot of what she said and it was utterly bullshit. The more I read, the angrier I got. 

**Now before I start, I want to clarify that I do not support nor in no way showing support of sympathy towards people who are accused.** I believe their actions must come to the light and people must hear of their doings. I have a huge amount of respect for those who come out with stories and it should be heard. I have close friends who were victims and it sickens me. That being said, I think its wrong to fully accuse someone when you don't have the evidence. My ex didn't fully expose me by saying my name but that we dated for a year and a half, it was easy for people to catch on who it was. It was also my first relationship, and I'd never thought I'd be in this situation writing this today. I'm going to write a statement to stand up for myself, and I'm asking you guys on here for advice on what I can say. I've never written something like this and it feels awkward. I tried putting  off on writing this post because I felt scared and don't know how to defend myself during this situation. I know it should be second nature to defend yourself for something you didn't do but with all the rape stories going out, It's hard to defend yourself.

**Story of how we broke up**

Also, My ex and I ended on bad terms. I felt sick one day when we went to a carnival with a bunch of friends. Everyone wanted to go on rides but I wanted to sit out. My ex got mad because she wanted to go on a ride so I just told her to go on with my friend. I didn't think much about it. Fast forward, she went on a ride with my friend and they were flirting and holding hands.  (You guys can ask me more about in the comments since it doesn't apply to what I'm writing) But we broke up after that and never talked again. She did much more than this \^ in our relationship. She actually jumped back into a relationship after we broke up lol. 

**Her post about me**

She starts off by saying **""Towards the second half of our relationship, I became aware of how much of a pathological liar he was, but I believed he could change and I continued to trust what he said. Things became extremely toxic and he became more and more abusive towards me"".** I really don't know what to start with but our relationship was pretty toxic, a lot of fighting, a lot of crying and abusive from her. My ex was diagnosed with bipolar and she was suicidal too. In our relationship, she was the one who actually wore the pants with the side of being dominant in the relationship. I just showered her with gifts. Now on being a pathological liar, I actually have proof about this since my parents know about me. Before we dated, I would lie to my parents on going to my friends house just to see her. My parents didn't want me to date anyone during the time but she was constantly on my mind. I've lied to my parents for about a month before my parents caught me. It was actually one of the most embarrassing times of my life. Now that I looked back, I've lied to my parents to see a girl who was actually toxic and abusive towards me. The things I've lied about were my grades because I didn't want her to worry. I was failing most of my classes during that time and looking back I regret everything. I've lied to her about hanging out with her and canceling on plans. We owned a family business and my dad is short on workers. So he would call my siblings out to work with him. Back then, I would fight with my parents on how useless it would be for me to work and I really hated my dad. It was probably one of the darkest times for me. I made plans with her almost everyday going out to eat. I've explained to my ex about me having to work with my dad because he needed the help. My ex wouldn't care and just told me to lie to my parents. I was just in love with her at that time so I did lie. At one point, my dog was being impounded because of false accusations by my dads friend. I was needed there but my ex didn't care at all. She wanted me to ditch that and hang out with her. Whenever we couldn't hang out, She would make me feel like a piece of shit even after countless explanations about my dad needing me. She would guilt trip me into hanging out and I really wasn't comfortable but it was to make her happy. We did have a lot sexual intercourse in the beginning. Towards the second half, I didn't have much sex since with all the fights and stuff, I've started to lose interest in her. If we didn't she would throw a fit at me, scratch me ( I have a scar on my arm) , throw stuff at me and cry. Eventually guilt tripping me into having sex. I really didn't think it was much because we were dating. I started to lose her trust after finding out she was talking to a guy I told her to block. She blocked him on her main, but secretly talked to him on different accounts. I was reading through her chat (with her consent, but she forgot she had the convo with him)  in which she tells him ""you would've been my rebound"". It made me feel like I was the rebound after she constantly assured me I wasn't. Also when I was out of state, she video called him several times to rant. She said she was mad that I wasn't able to talk to her and she missed having warmth. It made me mad so I really didn't talk to her when I was out of state. These are all the little things that I've noticed in our relationship but to think she would twist her story into saying that I was the one who mistreated her really pissed me off.

Now her post does include stuff we did before and one thing she pointed that I acknowledge was the fact that I did grab her butt sometimes in public. We're both underage, I was 17 and she was 16 at that time. By the way she describes it, it seemed like it was sexual assault. **""My body became an object to him, something he could touch &amp; grab whenever he wanted to. I would always say ""no"" or ""stop"" whenever he touched me inappropriately, but he continued to do so. It got to the point where he grabbed my ass while I was talking to a cashier at a CVS when I finally confronted him.""**  I do acknowledge how grabbing someones butt is wrong, but I've never grabbed her ass at a cashier at a CVS. The way she twisted this story made it seem like she was an object and how much of a bad person I am. I'm not really sure how to write this out but I have complete respect for a girls body. It does contradict on how I would grab her ass. I do fully apologize for my actions which I will be writing on my post later on social media. I understand how grabbing her ass sometimes in public is indeed sexual assault but we actually talked about it. She would often grab my dick and touch it in public and we would joke about it. Although its something I can't back up since I deleted all my convo with my ex after we broke up

Lastly she states **""I started becoming scared of my own boyfriend. I was scared of him ever laying a hand on me. Even when he made the slightest move, I would get scared that he would touch me. I cried to him and begged that he would stop. Long story short,  he never did. Physically, I stayed with him no matter show poorly he treated me.I was constantly manipulated and told that everything wrong with our relationship was my fault"".** 

She was actually never afraid of me. We would always play fight in my room with me tickling her. Like in a relationship you think everything is about having fun at a young age. I would poke her when we're out in public and we would have fun. Never have I ever had I hit, slap or raped her. There are no scars on her body or any bruises. I in fact did have bruises from when she threw a shoe at me for not opening the door for her lol. Its hard to defend yourself with a statement like ""**I cried to him and begged that he would stop"".** Before getting into this relationship, I had people telling me how problematic she is and how manipulative she was. I do have proof of some texts from friends. But all the ones that can back everything i said is all deleted. I've tried to back up my icloud but no luck. I've reached out to friends and some of them turned their backs. I don't blame my friends for their actions.  If my friends were accused, I'm inclined to believe the victim first because I know how much the system is against women and victims in generals. I don't blame how they act because it's understandable. I truly wish I can solve this without any actions. I talked to my parents about this and they think pressing charges is the best idea. Is there a way I can scare her?  Also Sorry if this was really long, and I appreciate any help given or any statements i can say that includes having to do with the law or something. I hate that fact that some females will suffer ZERO repercussions for lying and I hope something is done to those who come out with fake stories to get back at their ex. Not saying to those who come out with stories without evidence. But I have more people supporting me than those who accused me. Thank you guys for reading this long ass post.

796,"This summer I’m (F22) living with my brother (M30) because our parents are abusive. He offered that I move in for free other than to pay the electricity bill every month and I get the groceries. That’s cool with me because I have no money and can’t find a summer job. The thing with my brother is that he is very dependent on having another person around, just for company. He has anger issues and drug issues and it’s only a matter of time before he goes off, but I feel trapped otherwise. He gives me space most of the time but gets really clingy when he feels anxious. Really clingy. It seemed like a win-win at the beginning because he gets a housemate and I get a place to stay. 

Today he has a mattress, box spring, and frame being delivered between 4-8. I had plans to hang with my bf today as we don’t see each other much during the week. I said “I have no problem coming back to help and I’ll ask my boyfriend to help too”. I didn’t wanna volunteer my bf without his permission because first of all that’s rude and second we had an argument yesterday and it’s kinda awkward... so yeah I don’t wanna force anything. Then I found out my boyfriend would be golfing from 4-6 anyway and my brother lost his temper saying my boyfriend is really pissing him the fuck off that he’s not around at all times to help him. He said that I’m obligated to help him and so is my boyfriend... I don’t think I agree. I don’t want to cause shit so I told him I’ll make sure I’m around while bf is at golf, but I don’t really wanna stick around all night. He didn’t really ask either, he just expected it. 

I really just want to get out of the house even if it means just sitting in my car all day. I’m a 5’4 girl and I’m not strong whatsoever. His friends are these giant meathead dudes who could probably lift the bed frame with one hand. Our dad’s had a heart attack young and he’s getting older so he’s out of the question. Maybe I’m just entitled? I don’t know but I feel shitty regardless. I’m really nervous to fuck it up. 

Am I a jerk for not immediately dropping my plans to help my brother?

Edit: I should mention that when he brought it up the other day, I asked him to ask his friends just bc I don’t really feel comfortable. I’ll help if he needs me but it’s probably best to ask his friends. Today I asked if he asked his friends and he just said no.

797,"So, I met this person in online gaming. We’ve known each other for about three months now. Text, snap, etc all that jazz. We met up a few days ago (we are a few states away) and I stayed in his hotel with him and whatnots. I’ve done things with him that I’ve never done in my entire life. And I found that I liked him a lot more upon seeing him. So I’m in an instant state of panic (I panic super easily) and one of the first things he said was, don’t be obnoxious. I previously said that I am (talk a lot, dance and twirl down hallways and do two step sprints w/e) also, I am 30 and he is 33. Neither of us have ever met someone from online before. He is very well known to be... idk how to describe it, he has a few fucc-buddies I am aware of. (One actually, but he says there are more) and he is always at her place, she has gotten on his phone and blocked me on all accounts before but is ok with him sending me videos of him fuccing her. But acts a bitch when he plays games w me. He says he don’t even like her, but literally the day he got home I heard her in the background. 
So, the whole time he was here I know I wasn’t myself, and I think that may have pushed him away a bit. Idk. But now I feel like I’m gonne go crazy when he doesn’t respond back to me, because normally he does fairly quick. (Unless he’s busy which we all get busy, I don’t freak out if a few hours go by) but now he’s texted me back like twice since he’s been home (two days) and ignoring me on games, (we have still played a bit since he got home tho)
And when I dropped him off at the airport, he said he wanne come back, so... idk wtf to think. Also, one of the biggest things... I am a single mother of a 5 and 2 year old. He doesn’t have kids and doesn’t want any. I’m not asking anyone to be a father to my kids, I’m just looking for a partner for me. My kids have a dad and they do visit him every week for two days. So, that should be covered. He doesn’t mind my kids nor has he met them tho. He is good with kids from what I understand, he has like 15 nieces and nephews etc.

799,"My bf and I started dating when I was in 10th grade and he was in 12th grade. He moved in later that year and since then it’s been history.

He’s so mean to me now. I mean he’s never been the best bf but now he’s just awful. He’s not supportive of anything, he doesn’t take pictures of me/post me, he puts me down/calls me names, starts fights and then blames me... I’m just so tired. I’ve been trying to make this work for over 3 years. He will do something mean, like make a rude comment as a “joke “ or he will accuse me of something, but once I try to talk to him about it or ask him “why?” hes being like this, he automatically says something like “ALL YOU WANNA DO IS FIGHT. JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP. I DONT WANT TO ARGUE JUST DROP IT!” But yet, I’m just trying to work it out and fix the issue? It’s like he just wants me to just sit here and take all the bullshit he throws at me. But I’m not like that. When people are not treating me right , I speak up. I don’t think I’m necessarily starting a “fight”, considering he’s the one who initially does something for this to occur. I just don’t know what to do anymore. We live hours away from our hometown and I would never want to move back there. He won’t let me break up with him either. I’ve tried many times and he just goes insane. I really don’t know what to do. I’m 19 but I feel so worn down and worthless. It’s always me me me. I do everything wrong. There’s so much more to this that I didn’t include . Like how he doesn’t do anything around our house and expects me to do every thing. I’ll clean the whole house and I’ll ask him to just take the trash out when he gets home and he will say “You can’t do it? Why do I have to?” Or just rolls his eyes and says “YUP I guess!”... after I cleaned the whole place... I’m just so done. Sorry for the rant everyone.",27Jun2020,1

802,"TL;DR at bottom.

Hi I'm a 23M who has absolutely no luck socially, whether with making friends or romantic interests. I have a lot of hobbies (instruments, painting, working out/jiu jitsu, computers, video games) and I try to go above and beyond when it comes to being friendly with people. If I had to be honest with myself and feedback I get from other people, I think I would be a 6/10 in the face department but a little higher body wise. 

Recently I was moved to a new position in work where I will be working with people around my age and I'm worried I will be ostracized like I was in college. There were many times in college that I would meet people, go out of my way to be friends with them but my efforts would either be outright ignored or treated with indifference.

My last position was mainly working with guys twice as old as me and it took about a year before we could make friendly conversation at work. Now I'm basically going to be the outsider coming into a tight knit group of outgoing people who I would really like to get to know but I'm not sure it's going to work. So far I've only been talking to one girl at the job and I am already crushing on her hard but I think she doesn't even care I exist. I am just outrageously inept at normal conversation, when I am comfortably talking to extremely close friends/family I still have a very hard time expressing myself and usually fall into being an off the wall goofball. I'm just most natural when I'm saying random non sequiturs and laughing about stupidity, whenever I slow down to talk about ""regular"" things I usually barely get a word in, especially with more than one person. I have my own problems and I am totally open to admitting my faults but I always fall into a cycle of pretending I'm not a complete goof, getting ignored, getting depressed, and then cheering myself up by acting even less lucid. 

So my question is: when I go to work should I just say fuck it and be a nut like I am everywhere else? (to a point obviously). Will people dislike me and get angry with me for being weird? I just can't take this blase lifestyle anymore and would rather try to build confidence in being myself instead of doing the regular stuff.

TL;DR  I'm an extremely weird 23M who's looking to get to know people/a girl, should I just be extremely weird and throw caution to the wind or what? When I saw weird I mean manic and nonsensical 50% of the time, I don't really know why.",27Jun2020,1

804,"So I have a friend on Discord. We’re roughly the same age. We’ve never met in real life but we’ve know each other’s faces. We’ve known each other for over a year now, but it’s only recently that we’ve been talking to each other in PMs. We also play Minecraft together often in our group server. (There’s 4 of us using it but usually it’s only her and I who play)

Sometimes while we’re talking, I don’t know why but my brain attempts to insert some flirty stuff in what I say. It’s hard to explain so I’ll just give some examples.

-We were playing Minecraft and she said that it was really cold in her room, so I told her get a bf/gf to cuddle you. The thought of sending “What if I cuddled you😳😳” came up and I almost sent it, but I decided against it. (Although from that conversation she said that she didn’t have a crush on anyone she knew and would prefer to focus on studies than relationship.)

-We were playing minecraft and she was showing me her underwater house which didn’t have an exit, so I said “what if we stayed inside together forever O_o” I forgot how she reacted but i think she took it as a joke and played along

-I was sharing with her some cute af art of cuddling and handholding and she mentioned that she felt lonely looking at the stuff I sent because she missed doing these things in a relationship. My heart took it as an opportunity to ask her out(???????) but luckily my brain got the better of me and stopped that from happening. I instead told her that she should get a teddy bear uwu 

I don’t think I have a crush on her because whenever I try to think of a reason why I like her, I can’t come up with any. Perhaps it’s because she doesn’t care that I’m being my weird self? I dunno, im pretty sure that’s a selfish reason. I think I do this because she’s the only girl I know and also the only person I PM.

So i have been considering for the past few weeks, to start an apprenticeship in car paint and body construction. I know it's completely not what I've been doing and learning the past 8 years but I've always been a little car enthusiastic.

I own a 25y/o Toyota starlet, which I inherited from my grandpa. My Uncle and Cousin both work as Mechanics so they mostly repaired and painted my car when repairs where due. I always watched and have been super interested in their works. I also helped them out and got my hands dirty.

Last few days my cousin and I had to repaint 3 fenders because of big rust spots. We also painted my brakes in yellow.

That's when i realised how much I loved to work this way. I prepared my brakes (de-rusting, grinding, cleaning) and afterwards painted them (it looks sick). Then we prepared the fenders the same way and then sprayed them.

I had so much fun and time flied so fast I didn't recognised we worked around 5 hours straight. And I still had plenty of energy left.

I am very aware of the risks: 
*the first 3 years not getting much paid (about 700€)
*probably dipping into savings to keep up with expenses
*I need soon another car because my 25 year old beauty has soon to go into an oldtimer rest
* I am currently living at my mothers house, we share most of the utility bills

Hey guys. My first post in this subreddit and really in need of some advice.

So as the title says, I absolutely fucking hate my job. I am essentially an assistant stock controller for a restaurant. When I was hired, I was to do A, B and C. When the assistant kitchen manager was fired, the kitchen manager would ask me to do small tasks. As the weeks went on, more and more of old AKM's work got given to me. Now I do KM's job on Monday's when it's his day off, and do AKM's duties the rest of the week. On top of my normal work, it can get quite overwhelming. One day, I forgot to put KM's petty cash sheet in the drawer for the owner to process (my job apparently) and I was threatened with termination if I keep slacking...

Now with Lockdown because of Covid, I've been at home for 3 months. In the first month, I brought work's server home and rewrote the database. Again, not my job but it was expected of me. I am sometimes a pushover at work because I'm the youngest and everyone makes me feel like a child and I hate it. They will give me the shitty jobs that no one wants to do, and it comes directly from management so I feel I don't have a leg to stand on if I say no.

The owner sent me a message an hour ago, saying that I have to come in on Monday, I'm happy that I can actually do some work, but they say I must now work on weekends too and I have to take the role of the hostess (Who was let go) if I want to keep my job. I have severe social anxiety and loved that I only work back of house, and I just feel like they are taking advantage because I always say yes to the shitty jobs given to me.

812,"Hello.

I'll try to make this as short as possible.
Out of my 4 ""original' grandparents, I have got 2 living grandmas. One lives a very happy life in a great retirement home in the region she is from and she adores (some 40ish kilometers form my house), while the other grandma lives in my house.


Our house is made put of 2 ""apartments"". One where my parents and me (few years ago it was my older brother as well, but he moved to college) and the other where my mom's parents live/d.
It's worth noting that my grandma usually cooks for my family (usually 6 day a week).

Just few days after 2020 had arrived, my grandpa (who lived in the apartment below me) had died.
Of course, I was very sad and all, but this made me think about something that I had never even thought about in my life.
About human mortality.
Don't get me wrong, I knew that humans come and go, but it was very different this time.
I started contemplating that one day one/both of my grandmas will die.
And that brings consequences.


Now I will say something that makes me feel like a piece of crap.



1. In september I am starting high school, and if something like that happens, I don't know what I will eat

By that I mean relatively healthy food (I don't like eating  too much junk food) that my grandma cooks for us.
My mom is a school teacher that works a lot and my dad is a real estate agent that works a lot as well.
So, thay don't have much time to feed a child until he turns 18 and goes to college.

2. Everyone around me will be sad and uncomfortable, which makes me feel even worse

Quite self-explanatory



I feel absolutely devastated, although nothing has happened yet.

When my grandpa died, I was of course very sad, but I said to myself ""life goes on"". This very cruel (at least to my understanding) advice I gave to myself is what makes my so ashamed of myself.

I would like to get back to that part when I said that I feel like an absoulte piece of crap.
I feel ashamed for folowing that philosophy.

Please, give me any advice you have got.

NOTE: unless you feel like it's absolutely necessary don't please don't tell me to talk to someone.
Just writing this felt awful, and I feel that talking to someone about this is even harder.


Also, I would like to add the fact that there is much more to this problem, but I just don't know how to express it well.


Thanks in advance",27Jun2020,1
813,"Should I delete all of them! I don't want him to have them. 
It's obvious he deliberately kept them they're hidden in a random file location along with folders of his ex's.
Who knows where else he has copies of them!
I need to get out of here because he hit me again!
He's gone out for the evening so I need to act quickly! But want to get rid of them all before I leave!

Edit: 
1. Is it destroying evidence if I delete mine?
2. Should I delete his ex's ones as well?? Would they be bothered? I tried to contact them but obviously I'm a stranger to them!

Edit 2:
Thank you so much to everyone's advice and help. It was a very crazy couple of hours whilst I tried to get my stuff together, figure out what to do and how to get myself out.",27Jun2020,5

815,"I’m a male [24] and I have a pretty high IQ 125-130 range. But for the last few years I keep going into these deep thoughts and when I do I become very depressed. Seems to be the more I know and the more I learn the more I become introverted. When I learn I enjoy it. But I feel like along with the knowledge it’s like the more I learn the large I fall into this black hole or everything. And realizing to know u know enough to to only learn u don’t know hardly anything is a concept I recently learned. I feel like the more I learn the worse I become. Almost to the point where to much knowledge is bad. And I realize how pointless life, existence, personalized circumstance and an individual identity is. I can’t seam to rationalize the notion the life is a good things but it’s also horrible. Like the scale of life vs existence. It’s nothing. What do it do?",27Jun2020,1
816," I’ll start by saying I’m 17 and I haven’t fought a day in my life. 

Earlier this year my group ran into some kids from the town and had a little beef start between our friend groups. I wasn’t there when the incident occurred, the group of kids went to my buddies house, pulled them out and were beating them. A close Homie got bear maced but was fine. The pukes ran off when the neighbor came out swinging. 



It’s been a few months since that and we have ignored them as to not cause more beef. 
A few days ago they started pulling videos of the jumping and talking shit about us individually, I told my friends to ignore it and let them talk, but now they are talking of coming back to my friends house,as well  as my house that they found through the damned snap chat map that I thought was off. Comments of bringing straps (not guns) and pictures flexing bear mace has got me on alert. 
If these kids are serious it could put myself and my family in danger which is not fine by me. 

I know these kids aren’t right in the head (most kids from my town aren’t) so trying to reason with them has only made the situation worse. 
I’m left wondering what the best means of protecting myself and my family are.",27Jun2020,2

Plus I dont wanna be to too done up, after all it's a fast food place not some formal office. Rather try to keep it casual.  And when i search it on Google, I says to wear a button down and khakis, but in a girl and that ain't rly my vibe.

819,"After a car accident a few years ago, my mental health plummeted and I was fighting PTSD, depression and suicidal thoughts. I felt like I was bringing him down in our relationship. I wanted to get married and have kids before the accident, but after the accident, I didn’t want to - I just felt like I wasn’t good enough for him and especially not good enough to be a mother to children when I couldn’t even take care of myself. 

When we broke up, I told him I hoped he meet someone much better than me and that I wanted him to be happy. I felt like I wasn’t worthy to be with him, let alone be with anyone for the long-term.

After almost a year of working on my mental recovery, I’m much better. No suicidal thoughts. But my self-esteem just  plummeted. I feel like I was right. That I’m not good enough for anyone. 

My friends and family have been very supportive and I feel strong enough, but at the same time I just feel hopeless too. 

I’ve been taking it easy this past year with an easy job and not focusing on my career.  I just feel like I’m not good enough to live a “normal” life again and that I’m always going to be doing an easy job because I can’t handle life at its normal pace.

824,"Something happened and I (22F) don't know how to handle it. At all. It's something that's pulling me down and I don't really have anyone to share it with, nor anyone I want to share it with. 

Before I get to the problem, let me say one thing first. I've always found my education incredibly important, it's the key to my future, right? So, I try to work as hard as I can, showing up at every single lecture, always do the homework and listen to my professors. 

It's also right here my problem is. 

I'm scared that my grades are going to kill me.

I'm a perfectionist, hugely so. To me, anything less than a B is a failure. If I get a C, I feel like nothing, like a complete waste of space. If I get a B or an A, I feel fine. Then I'm good enough, then I'm smart enough, it proves that I have something between my ears. 

I recently got my results back from 2 exams. I got 2 C's. 

I know that some will see this as a temper tantrum or me being obnoxious, that I should just get over it. I get that, school isn't everything. But I just can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop crying about it. 

My school is what I have. I'm not particularly good at anything else, but everyone around me has something. They can sing, they can party, they can make friends. I can't do any of those things, I can barely keep my stuff together. 

I want to feel good about myself and be hopeful about my future. It's just so hard to do, when I feel lesser than everyone around me.

829,"TL;DR: sorry this is long. My partner’s mum treats me like shit most of the time. Stuck in lockdown with her. My partner is sick of me and I hate myself.

My partner and I are both 25 year old women. My partner’s mum has never been fond of me since we got together. She said she didnt see how my partner found me attractive. (We are lesbians so maybe thats why as she hated my partner being gay at first). She has always pointed out why I’m not like them and said my mental health will never get better, thinks my partner is amazing for putting up with someone as miserable as me and she can’t choose who my partner is with.

Recently she has made a lot of digs about me being miserable because I don’t talk or interact with her a lot. She says I’m lazy even though I do things around the house. She criticises the way I do chores and says I do them weirdly and it annoys her. She tells me to keep away from any decorating she does because I’m clumsy then tells my partner that I am unhelpful because I didn’t help.

She says I’m boyish when I consider myself to be feminine but now it has impacted my self esteem and I’ve been crying everyday about how ugly and masculine I feel.

She has brought my partner up to spend all her time with her. She doesn’t let her see her dad even though she is 25 years old. Doesn’t let her stay at my house for too long and makes excuses as to why this can’t happen. She controls her and thinks its wrong for her daughter to spend her time in her room and not with her downstairs watching tv together.

I recently got diagnosed with ADHD but we cant tell her because she is judgey and will use it as another reason why I am a rubbish girlfriend to her daughter and not good enough. The medication is ruining my appetite so tonight when it was dinner time I cried upstairs because I didnt want to eat. Her mum said I’m rude and my partner who was going to spend some time in her room with me has now decided to stay downstairs because I’ve made everything awkward. She wont stand up to her mum because when she tries her mum turns it round on us, cries and storms out of the house. She will shout at my girlfriend until she cries and say I’m driving a wedge between them when its her doing it.

I spend all my time upstairs alone because I no longer want to be around her mum because its been 2 years of criticism and I’ve given up wanting to have some kind of nice relationship with her. She just makes me angry, takes my girlfriend away by manipulation and now my girlfriend is spending time with her because I’ve made her mum uncomfortable and I just feel like I’ve reached my limit.

I feel lonely. My girlfriend often jokingly agrees with me when I say I’m sorry I’m rubbish and shit (because we havent moved out yet due to a nervous breakdown I had with anxiety last year I was out of a job for a while and had undiagnosed ADHD plus holding a job has always been hard due to my motivation issues and getting overwhelmed that I’ve had many). So I know she doesnt really want to be around me. I just feel useless. I am a benefit to no ones life. I get dug at behind my back by her mother and then she runs back to her mum and spends time with her and I’m upstairs alone. I wanted to eat my dinner and sit with my girlfriend just us so I didn’t have an audience because her mum points out absolutely everything including when I’m not eating properly. She finds my issues an inconvenience. But now my girlfriend is fed up with me and has decided to spend the evening with her mum instead.

Her mum phones her everytime we are out. Hates my family and the idea of a father figure (my partner likes my dad) and just talks shit about me and my family saying we are all spineless and she uses the dogs being at home as an excuse that my girlfriend cant spend time with me there. Me and my girlfriend have a good relationship when she isnt around and I love my girlfriend so much.

What am I supposed to do? She says I need to get over it because her mum is being nice for now but I just know its only a matter of time until the usual happens. I feel lonely, unwanted and ugly and worthless. I have no friends to listen or care, the one person I need when I’m sad is fed up of me and would rather be downstairs with her mum and my ADHD diagnosis feels like one big mess that I can’t clean up. The medications ruining my appetite and I have a fear of vomiting so I dont know what to do.

My girlfriend criticises how close me and my own mother have been due to my upbringing and having anxiety and my mum sometimes being manipulative and doing the wrong thing but I feel I always put my girlfriend first. We are left alone as 2 adults should be in my house and my mum actually likes her so we dont get hassled. But she insists my relationship with my own mum is worse but I am here with her not with my mum during this lockdown because I want to be with her but I’m alone anyway. Am I just crazy and pathetic? Do I not deserve my girlfriend? I feel like she could do so much better. She nearly left me last year because she couldn’t deal with what an anxious hopeless mess I was and I feel like I perhaps make her doubt me more everyday. Last night I was crying because I felt like I couldnt even shower as I’ve been really down this week and she said no wonder people say things about me when I haven’t showered and no wonder she doesn’t want to sit with me. :( I wish I could love myself and be pretty and know I’m enough but I can see in her face that I’m hopeless and I don’t blame her anymore.",27Jun2020,0

832,"Okay so hear me out! I know you’re probably confused because, surely defending any s*xual assault victim is always the right thing to do? 

Is what I though but looking back on the situation I feel like I made the totally wrong decision.. 

It gets a little confusing so ... 

• Alleged Sexual Assault Victim= AV

• Alleged Sexual Assaulter= ASA 

• Close friend of AV and AS = CF


I am/ was good friends with all of these people. 

This happened sometime over a year ago. Me and AV have been friends for a few years and have always gotten on really well. We decided to go to a party with our friends and had all had drinks. AV is someone who acts more drunk than they are but is still really fun to be around. 

Half way through the night AV started cuddling ASA which wasn’t odd as they had been talking for a few months. About an hour later AV made an excuse and left the party. The next day they told me and all our friends that ASA had put his hand up her skirt, and then again when she pushed it away initially. 

We all took this very seriously and instantly threw ASA from our group and supported AV. 

This is where CF comes in. ASA had gone to them saying they felt really depressed having been abandoned by all their friends, and having a past of self harm CF felt the responsibility to make sure they weren’t going to harm themselves. 

CF came to me a few hours later incredibly distressed and wanted to talk over a few things. Apparently ASA had said that they weren’t aware they’d crossed any line as AV had pulled ASA down to cuddle, had their hands all over ASA and hadn’t said anything  at the time. ASA did they had no idea they’d upset them until the next morning when they got a string of hateful messages from friends. 
 
Despite this I didn’t want to risk supporting a s*xual assaulter and continued to ignore ASA and support AV. 

CF had known AV for 10 years and decided AV was manipulative (AV had lied previously about being in therapy, and friends none of us knew dying for attention) and decided to remain friends with ASA but I know they are torn over if they made the right decision staying friends with ASA. (They were originally hurt when AV blocked them for remaining friends with ASA despite AV not blocking others who also remained friends with AV and ASA but now are glad they aren’t friends with AV). 


ASA actually made a group chat to send a huge message to all their old friends apologising for the way they’d originally handled the situation (wasn’t exactly sensitive and didn’t understand the gravity of it all) but wanted to explain they had not done anything and was willing to take the matter to the police however wasn’t going to as they didn’t want to make the ordeal any bigger. 

ASA also pointed out that AV had asked them out multiple times which ASA had turned down every time. At parties AV would go upstairs and cry and ask for ASA to go comfort them. ASA alleged that AV would cuddle and grind against them making them uncomfortable and ASA didn’t want to be harsh and leave as AV would say they were feeling like doing something stupid. 

They also pointed out that a couple of months earlier AV had admitted to lying about ASA eating them out because they had wanted to make the two see closer. (sorry for lack of less vulgar words) 

Despite all this we all still didn’t want to risk losing AV and be seen supporting ASA however I know myself and multiple others still talk to and hang out with ASA as they are actually really nice. 

I feel bad for throwing ASA out despite actually believing them more than AV but being too afraid of being wrong. I also feel bad for CF who got a lot of sh*t for something we all are guilty of somewhat doing.

I'm currently stressing over whether or not I should move to Canada (currently in the United States). I feel this is a great way to gain independence from my family whom I've been living with since I graduated from college (I'm 27 now). As someone who has always been sheltered, and because of an awful relationship with my father growing up that's left me with poor self-esteem, I never really fought for my own independence before. In my mind, if I do move far away (and I really do like Canada) I'll have no other choice but to claim it.

My only concern is my mother. She's in great health, but I am an only child. Taking care of her while I'm in another country is the root cause of my stress. She won't need aid anytime too soon, but those days are coming. She is a single-mother who sacrificed a LOT for me (when I was a child she quit her high paying job which would have given her excellent retirement so she could work from home and take care of me). In a way, moving to Canada feels selfish. And it's hard to shake that feeling.

My other option, is to move to move to Alabama where we have a home. It's a lovely place with its own plot of land. I'd be close to my mother who will be buying a house near there. On paper it looks like a great option, but it will be settling. It feels like more of the same life I'm living now. I could literally map out the rest of my life if I were to move there... and it just doesn't feel like freedom. It's just the safest option. Furthermore, the dynamic between my mother and I still feels like that of a mother and a teenager, as embarrassing as that is to say. As she is quite conservative, and I'm of very low self regard, I do often find myself filtering my personal decisions through what she may or may not deem appropriate. To further contextualize this: We once had a blowout because of a disagreement on what shirt I should wear to an interview. Spoiler Alert... I caved (for anyone into zodiacs she's a Virgo, I'm an Aquarius).

Sorry, I know this is long, so to wrap up, here is where I'm at now: I've already started the ExpressEntry process to immigrate. Only my mother knows about it (though she doesn't know intricacies of why I want to move or even why I feel I should stay) and she's supportive, but I know she doesn't want me to go. If I continue down this road to go to Canada I reckon I'll be gone in a year's time. So I kinda have to  piss or get off the pot.I really appreciate any advice on this at all, and as toilet paper is scarce and I've been crying all through this, imma leave now. Bye\~!",27Jun2020,3
835,"I live in southern USA, where a large amount of the population refuses to wear masks or even believe that the coronavirus is anything more than a hoax. Unsurprisingly, this has caused a massive spike in cases in my area, which has gotten hit hard in the past weeks due to premature reopenings.

Yesterday, our school district sent out an email stating that for this school year, it will be an option to either go in for face-to-face instruction (with masks only being “recommended”, not required) or choose to stay at home and take online courses for the year. This decision is to be made and signed off on by the parent of the student.

My dad received the email while at work, and came home from work yesterday with a new bookbag he’d bought for me in hand. He then told me sternly, “You’re going back into school. I’m not letting you stay at home this year.” An argument between me and him ensued, but no matter what coronavirus statistics I cited, he didn’t budge. I also have no say in the decision for the choice of going back into school or taking online classes, so at this point, it seems inevitable.

I’m extremely worried for not only my safety, but for the safety of my dad, and also my girlfriend and her family, who are the only people I’ve allowed myself to see in the past four months of self-quarantining, just to keep myself from going insane from lack of socialization. My dad is in his mid 50’s, and is in the high risk group for coronavirus infections. I’m scared that with his refusal to social distance, wear masks, or take any precautionary measures at all, he will catch the virus and be left with long-term health effects, or even die. Forcing me to go back to school this year will exponentially increase that risk of me potentially carrying the virus and my dad catching it from me, and it seriously concerns me.

The final day to make the decision is July 11th. I know it’s probably a lost cause at this point, knowing my dad’s stubborn nature, but is there literally *anything* I can do or tell my dad to finally convince him to take the threat seriously?

TL;DR: I live in a southern state where the coronavirus is hitting hard and showing no signs of stopping. My dad is forcing me to go back into school this year for face-to-face instruction despite having the choice to keep me at home for online schooling. I’m extremely scared for not only my health, but his health as well, as he is in the high risk group. Is there anything I can do to convince him to let me take online classes so I don’t put both him and I at risk?",27Jun2020,1

There are so many beneficial reasons for moving to the US, and it doesn’t hurt that the weather is hotter. By the time I’m finished university in Canada, Trump would be gone so that’s not an issue. But I’m worried about losing my culture, not to mention having to be a part of America’s customs (guns, worser education, bad reputation with the rest of the world, racism, pollution, less open mindedness and diversity, having to deal with the type of people that support trump and watch Fox News, etc.)—don’t mean to offend, I know there are a lot of great America’s out there.

839,"I am currently studying Computer Sciences at a college, recently finished my second semester but it was mostly focused on physics and mathematical subjects rather than computer oriented ones. Perhaps it has only been the quarantine but this semester I've felt a slow and steady downfall to my interest on my career, especially the last months when I saw very basic concepts on programming I should've been good at (got a C in that course while maintaining A+ in the rest of my courses). Finishing the semester I promised to myself to partake into an online programming course, which could help me develop my skills in that particular language but it's been three weeks now and I feel like all my interest to learn and explore topics related to my career have been drained down. 

Even recently I tried to partake into a more basic course of this programming language and found myself frustrated, not even connecting dots or understanding anything at all which makes me question if I should really pursue this path. Before the quarantine started I was always outgoing and tried to always understand the contents of my courses, even if I disliked said topics, with the sole purpose of acing certain classes, but now I feel that inspiration is gone. 

I've felt depressed these past couple of months, not only because I haven't been learning at all, but *learning isn't fun anymore for me anymore*. I know it is supposed to be a break of the semester and that I should relax but I feel that if I do that again, the same thing will happen as that course I got a C at.

840,"I’m considering buying this full costume for 450$. Reason being I love MJ and I’m considering starting to dance for fun then later sign up for stage shows. I thought having fun on my own would be a good start and by purchasing this costume would be a big step. The price is although making me hesitant as its high and MIGHT damage my economy.

About my economy; I earn about 800$ every month. About 400 go to bills, and usually but not every month, I’m able to save 1 or 2 hundreds after every expenses throughout the month. 

So what do you think guys? Should I purchase the costume? After all YOLO. I might go through an economic crisis but I believe I can come back. I really love this! Any advice is appreciated!

I’m a 23F living on the east coast of Canada and will be moving 4600km out west. For anyone else who has done a big move, what’s some advice you can give? 
My mom has put out the idea that we should get a car and drive it across country with all my stuff... another option is to take a plane and ship the rest of my belongings once I’m in my new apartment.

843,"Hey all, I’m posting because I don’t know how to go on with my relationship. Just turned 19 yesterday, and my girlfriend is 18. We’ve been together since last Halloween, and she’s my first serious relationship. She’s lovey, a kind and caring person, but things have gotten weird and scary. 

I know I’m not the only one suffering this, but I think the lockdown is affecting us, and it’s showing. Ever since lockdown she hasn’t texted me unless I’ve texted her first. The conversation is short and dry, and I lost hope. I stopped texting her to see if she would text me first, and she hadn’t for two weeks. I see her online and tweeting and whatnot, so I know she’s still there. She’s busy with life too since she’s moving, but she wouldn’t even send me a text telling me she was ok and asking if I was alright. 

Yesterday was my birthday, and I didn’t get a single word from her. Obviously upset, I expressed my problem to a close friend who proceeded to message her (without me telling him to or suggesting for him to), and told her that it was bad of her to basically be ignoring me. She did message me today saying, “happy birthday, sorry it’s late” in which I just said, “hey, thank you, it’s ok!” Hoping she would continue the conversation without me forcing it out of her. 

My friend ended up in a little row with her, where she told him, “if [my name] has a problem, he can talk to me”. I don’t have a problem with her, I’m just scared she’s losing interest in me and now I’m scared she’s actually angry at me because my friend has possibly given the impression that I have a problem with her. 

I’m terrified to text her now. She’s left me on read, and my friend is prompting me to break up with her, but I don’t know if I want to. I still really like her, and I personally just believe she’s been busy, but I don’t think I should be feeling this scared to text her. 

I know this issue can be solved by just messaging her and directly assessing the situation, but I really don’t know what to say. I don’t want to spark any arguments, I don’t want her to be angry at me. I just want her to still like me the same way I like her. Any advice?",27Jun2020,1
844,"Every writer faces this problem. Am I good enough? But I'm not talking about having more faith in your abilities. It’s about how I don't get any constructive criticism. Because of this I'm not sure if I'm improving, making mistakes. I tend to doubt myself.

I tried once posting on r/worldbuilding. Got barely any answers. I'm not sure what I did wrong. It’s been months. It made me a little sad. I just wanted someones honest opinion, an advice. 

Constantly hearing only complements doesn’t help. They actually make everything harder for me. How do I start writing better when ""it's amazing"", ""a great idea"" or ""really interesting"". I realise not every person I asked knew what to say. Not everyone is a writer or has this knowledge. But still, I feel like I make them uncomfortable, even if they deny it. I talk and all I get is nodding. 

Could you at least tell me what you liked about my idea? One thing? You can do it while discussing movies or books. Their face when I mutter any question... I genuinely wish I stayed silent. I probably overreact, right?

845,"I haven't had sex in like 3 weeks and the last time was trash. I can't masturbate without porn, but watching porn makes me feel bad.  It's been 2 months and I can't even look at porn the same way I used to. I'm grateful for that and I'm proud that I've changed. But I'm so frustrated. I've also quit my sexually promiscuous behavior so I don't have anyone to have sex with.  I've also quit drinking and doing drugs. Maybe I shouldn't have quit everything all at once. I don't have a desire to do anything but I don't know how else to make myself feel better, besides eating but I don't want to do that either.

I've been working out but it takes a lot. I have to go to an outdoor track and there's usually like 20 people out, so I can't really run. I've tried talking to ""friends"" but most people don't respond to my messages. I don't feel like doing anything positive. I don't have the urge to finish my puzzle, pray, or paint. I'm really disappointed because I thought I gave myself a lot of positive activities to stop myself from doing the negative ones.

849,"Over the past couple of months I’ve gotten to know my neighbors. They’re a man and a woman in their 40’s/50’s, they have grown children of their own. They also drink quite a bit which is sometimes why I have to be like “ight imma head out” 
But other than that they seemed cool, they’re nice, they insist on having us over for dinner and expect nothing in return, let us use their pool.
I am a 28 y/o female living with the father of my child who is 29, we have a 7 year old together. We however, are not dating/married. We both have partners, neither of which live in our house but they will visit and occasionally stay over. (Reminder that everyone has a separate bedroom and my daughter has known our partners for practically her entire life) 
We are co parenting and we generally get along well and are able to more easily take care of our daughter this way. 
So my neighbor (the woman) who has known about the living situation for a while now, as we were just casually standing outside by her garden having a normal conversation, told me that she thought it was weird that I had two men in my house and I need to get one of them out. Now I try to explain to her that I live with my daughters father and my partner is just visiting for a few days. She told me that’s even worse. At this time my daughter and her father were inside watching a movie and I think my partner was making some food in the kitchen. She said “I bet they’re both in there right now molesting her” 
I was absolutely shocked and obviously like, uhhh no??!! What the fuck. She said yeah and I bet her dads partner (who happens to be male) molests her too. She kept asking me how well do you know them?? How do you know what goes on when you aren’t there? Basically accusing me of letting people I love of abusing my daughter. She also said if child services were to see two men in your house at the same time they would think the same thing and they would snatch your daughter up just like that. And what made me really uneasy was that she told me if child services shows up at my house that it wasn’t her which makes me think that she’s insinuating that she will report me. And at this point I’m boiling and I yell at her telling her she doesn’t know shit these are people I’ve know for more than half my life she’s talking about and how dare you accuse me of being negligent. And she was kind of shocked looking and then changed the subject back to the flowers in her garden. 
Now there’s no way in hell I’m ever going to talk to her again. They don’t know that yet. They think everything is fine for some reason??? Unfortunately they happen to be my neighbors. I will probably run into them at some point. Now I’m super concerned that they WILL call child services because I decided to cut ties with them after that conversation. Just seems like something they would do honestly. 
my daughter is thriving and is a super happy kid. I’m just afraid of the what if’s, what if they call what if they DO investigate? Do I have anything to be worried about? My daughters dad is in absolute shock and can’t even talk about it. Should I just fucking move to be rid of these people forever? I’ve heard horror stories of child services taking kids away for no reason, I know this system is fucked (in the US at least) so I’m really scared that my neighbors crazy drunken allegations will be enough for them to take her away.

853,"Just to give a little background on my life (I’m 29m) and my relationship with this person (26f):

For pretty much all of my life growing up, I was abandoned, neglected, and abused physically and emotionally by my parents/other family. I didn’t really have anyone who was ever there for me at all or didn’t feel like anyone cared about me or that I was good enough for the people I cared about for the first 20 years of my life. 

About 10 years ago, my friend was the first person I ever had feelings for in my life who reciprocated them back to me. We didn’t end up in a relationship, but we talked for a few weeks and hung out a few times, stuff like that. Even so, considering what I’d been through in my life up to that point, it was a pretty powerful connection and as I’ve learned recently in therapy, I ended up forming some pretty deep attachments to her at the time.

Anyway, after that didn’t work out, she got engaged and married a couple years later, moved out of the country for a few years. We came in and out of contact sporadically during that time.

Meanwhile the last 6 years of my life have been pretty traumatic. I got into my first real relationship back in 2014, and it ended really painfully which ended up surfacing all of my CPTSD symptoms from the abused and neglect. In the last 6 years, I’ve been incapable of forming new connections and feeling attraction to new people since my breakup.

Except for my friend, who sort of came back into my life a couple years ago after getting divorced and moving back the US a couple years before that.

___

Anyway, as to what’s happened recently. Since my friend moved back, she’s been really come and go, not someone I can really count on consistently responding and stuff, as it’s always kind of been with her. When we have hung out together though, she is the only person in the last 6 years that I actually have real feelings for. I’m actually probably more attracted to her now than I ever have been.

But the inconsistency and intermittently ghosting me and ignoring me for months at a time really started to hurt. I blamed myself for it, and figured she probably didn’t understand why she was as important to me as I obviously treat her, so about a month ago I wrote her a message kind of explaining the same things I mentioned above. The lifelong abuse, how she was the first person to ever break that pattern for me and what it meant to me. I really hoped she would have something to say about it, but she ignored that message too, just the way she has the few other times I’ve tried to talk to her this year.

I didn’t think she would say she had feelings to me - I didn’t even mention that, as we talked about that a year ago, or at least I mentioned that I still had feelings for her and that I could use some space.

___

Either way, I know I’m not going to hear from her at this point from the message I sent her, and I know nothing is ever going to happen between us at this point. And it just like....hurts so deeply that I don’t think I’m ever going to be okay. I just have such deep feelings for her, that I’m not really capable of having for anyone else at this point. Since my breakup it’s felt literally impossible to feel this way about somebody else. And just beyond the psychological attachment stuff, my friend is beautiful, like maybe the most beautiful woman I’ve ever met in my life, she’s incredibly smart, she’s interesting and likes cool things, she’s really funny and has a great sense of humor. And we’ve always just had some kind of bond between us - she went through a lot of similar stuff growing up, so there’s kind of a trauma bond element to it I think.

But either way, I just don’t feel like I can go after this. I just feel completely defeated. I’ve been drinking pretty heavily almost everyday for the last month just to get by and manage the feelings.
Every time I’m reminded of her, it feels like I’m being eaten alive inside. I would give anything for her to feel differently about me or just to acknowledge me at this point, but I know it’s not possible at this point, and I can’t really take it anymore.

Friend B says he won’t get infected no matter what, which is also not true, yet I couldn’t convince him otherwise.

I tried to ask them what they would think if they get infected and end up spreading it to others, in which both replied “I don’t care.” Which is really selfish if you ask me.

856,"Some backstory here for all of you.

(Sorry for shit writing, I've never been good at it)

My dad was a hoarder, and had a giant obsession with cats. Like a minimum of 13 cats at all times, all inbread one way or another since none of them were fixed, and were all kept inside. Our tiny suburban house was fucking filled with litters and litters of little fucked up cats, and none of them were or would be neutered.

As a small child I found solace in all the cats that roamed around our house. My Dad was neglectful, and an alcoholic, so he wasn't really there. I found myself making friends with the 8 or so kittens that roamed around the house. (Most of the adult cats ran away after it started getting crowded). They were all pretty friendly, and i thought it was cool that my family had all these cats, but it slowly started getting out of hand, the cats would not stop mating, and my dad would refuse to get them neutered, so the cat population started becoming a hassle.

At the all time high of our cat infestation, my dad decided to get a dog, she was a mutt named Maggy, and for the most part she was chill, the cats didn't really bother her, and everything seemed to be going fine. 

One day, afew months after we had gotten Maggy, one of our female cats had a a litter, this was normal, Maggy seemed a little on edge, but my parents thought it was fine. Cut to the middle of the night, my parents wake up to distressed yelling coming from my sisters room (where the mom had had her litter) immediately they race in there and find Maggy, the mom, and 2 of the 6 cat litter. 

Maggy had eaten 4 fucking newborn kittens.

We were all pretty distraught, and frankly horrified (I was just confused for the most part since I was only a toddler) but my parents refused to kick Maggy out, since my sisters still adored her. It never happened again, and most of our cats died soon after from health complications (whether it be from the incest or old age)
And we all just carried on with our lives. We got another dog circa 2011, a chihuahua thats the bane of my existence, and nothing noteworthy happened until 2016 when Maggy died of old age. We only had around 4 cats for a few years, all but one either dying or running away. And to this day only one of the original cats remain, but she's terrified of the new dogs my mom got so she says outside.

Ever since the incident, I've never been able to look at dogs in the same way as I had. We have 4 dogs at the moment and they're all just so terrible to our cats, even though all of them grew up together.
Everyone I know thinks I'm a terrible person for not liking dogs, but those cats were the one thing that made my dads neglect livable, and I've just never been able to look at any of our dogs the same way since.

I'm not scared of our dogs, and i don't hate them either, they can be sweet when they want to be. But every time I see them I feel nauseous.

862,"my mom just said, albeit in the context of a humorous story, that without the 'kids' (my sibling and I), did my dad really expect their marriage as long as it has? and then earlier today in some other conversation, again, in a 'joking' way, he faked-complained about what they would do after I leave for uni (next year). when i say that they joke it's not really joke bc there's very visible tension and it always goes either one of two ways: the other one laughs it off and they kind of avoid each other for a few hours, or it escalates and becomes a proper fight. this happens in front of me pretty often these days.  i think they've just spent too much time together this lockdown and are seeing different sides of each other, which has both its pros and cons right, like their positive traits become more defined and they bond more but their negative traits are painfully accentuated and they're forced to talk about and feel things that they've pushed aside for years and years because of the business of my dad's job and my mom focusing on my sibling and I. but now my sibling has a job and I'm going to move away next year and I'm just so scared that everything will crumble now that both of us won't be there.

they love each other very much but they're just so short tempered and their traits don't go well together at all, like my mom is so stubborn and will never apologise and my dad is so oblivious and doesn't ever learn from his mistakes, and now that I've also spent so much time around them (alone, because my sibling lives somewhere else) and I'm more grown up, I'm seeing more of how they actually behave around each rather than how they behave around each in the context of me as their child. im old enough now and have always been really mature for my age, but as childish as this may seem I really wish that they could go back to hiding this part of their marriage because it's really scaring me and if, god forbid (please god forbid), they decide to separate I'd much rather be shocked than be like 'I saw this coming' because right now I feel so much guilt because I keep thinking what if I could have stopped this? but I know that it's not my fault, it's an issue between them.

I try slipping stuff in sometimes during conversations about how they could improve their communication and stuff, but a) I'm their child and it's not my place to lecture them about their marriage and b) you can't teach old dogs new tricks. So I just sit here helplessly and I really don't know what to do. I don't want to talk to my sibling about it because even they're stressed out so I don't want to burden them, even though I know that they wouldn't mind it, but I still don't want to. I can't talk about it with my friends because I don't want to ruin our family's reputation. They're really lovely people and parents, so don't think of them as superficial, it's just a trait of the society I live in. Like I'm 99% sure my friends won't tell their parents but I don't want to take the chance + it's an unspoken rule in our peer group that we don't talk about family problems.

I'm really stressed about school and university and the pandemic bc there are cases really close to where I live and I'm so tired of staying at home and being distant with my friends but all of that I can deal with and get over it but not this it's really terrifying me. I know I shouldn't overthink it but what else can I do? I just wish things would go back to how they were before lockdown, but I know that that's selfish and whatever decision my parents make will probably be best for them because they're self aware and rational people. i just wish they could communicate and LISTEN to each other and that everything works out for the best when I leave.

I'd really like to listen to people who have been in similar situations, and any advice or warmth or comfort is much appreciated because I just feel so alone right now.",27Jun2020,1
863,"Note: English is not my first language, sorry for spelling and grammar. Also on phone.

Backstory: It will be long, but just so that you can understand as to why.

Ever since I could remember I was the black sheep of my family. I am the youngest of 3 daughters and although my sisters and I are not far apart (oldest being 3 years older) I was always treated as an outcast in my family. 

It would range from not being asked to play to them and my cousins (some were younger than me) ditching me while playing. I am also overweight and have been all my life, I also never really did well in middle school. Compared to both my sisters who are thin and have good grades. This was always a topic at family gatherings. My family would always bring up my weight and grades, it was always in a joking way. They would make jokes and compare me to my sisters. It became so bad that whenever there was a family gathering I would usually just sneak away and sit in the bathroom for hours. My family also never called me on my birthday, ever. My oldest sisters would get calls and money. They never called me or sent me money. Sometimes they would message my mum a couple of days later and said stuff like, ""O, we didn't have time to call but we were thinking about her etc.""

There were stuff like during school holidays both my sisters would get a chance to visit my aunt for a week. Separately. Then when it comes to be my turn something happens and the say I could come first next time. Next time comes around and then my sisters would get to go first (because they are older). My uncle started this thing were each time he would take one of us on vacation. Started with my oldest sister then the next one etc. It had been 8years since he started this, both my sisters have went on vacation with them, more than once. I gave never been once.

So my point is my family never really involved me, now when we all see each other I just go sit in a room alone. They always make comments about it and all, but I was just tired of not being loved by them. Because of this I grew up introverted.

As for my parents. I love them, don't get me wrong. But they never really helped with everything. Middle sister (B) would get all these new things for sport and oldest sister (A) could always get new stuff for hobbies she tries out but ends up leaving after a month. I always loved 2 things, music and technology. Took me 6 years to convince my parents for piano lessons, begged them for another 2 years for a piano to practice on. I had always been a tech savvy and started asking for a computer. It was around the time I could choose my own subject at school and also needed a computer for programming class. 

It was the day of my school dance and I had a photoshoot planned with friends. We went to the mall and to a tech shop. My dad started looking at computers. We were there to get one for my sister (A). We spent the entire afternoon at that shop to buy my sister a computer after I had asked for one for almost a year long. We ended up taking to long and I had missed my photoshoot with my friends and I was late to the dance.

Another thing is ever since I was young I had these terrible migraines that caused blackouts, had me constantly throwing up etc. I was put on heavily pain meds at a young age. Now that I am older, whenever I feel a small headache I would drink around 3 pain pills to prevent a headache. I drink 3 because my immune system builded a resistance against pain medication from all those years. Because of this my parents and my sisters never take me seriously when I complain about pain or injury on my body. They believe I only want it for the pills. Therefore my parents don't take me to the doctor when I am sick or complain about pain.

5 years ago I dislocated my knee at school, went to the hospital and got a cast. Over the years I had problems with my knees that my parents ignore. Constant pain, sometimes dislocations. Last year I  dislocated my knee again at school and was taken to the hospital. Agter some more test, turns out my muscle was shorter on the one side, thus my kneecap was not where it should be, it was a bit higher than normal. The doctor told my parents I need physical therapy to help lengthen my muscle. Later that day my parents told me they couldn't afford therapy. I understood that money was tight, I had this pain for 4 years I could live with it for a little more. 2 months later, they bought my middle sister a car. Never had seen a therapist till this day.

A month ago my neck started swelling and hurting, my mom said I had just slept wrong. 1 week later my dad told my mom to take me to a doctor. The swelling started causing breathing problems. Took my mom a week to make a doctor appointment, her excuse was that she was busy. ( Had offered to make appointment myself but she refused). Turns out I have a tumor.

Stuff like this, it's why I suffer from depression. My family never abused me or anything. But growing up, I didn't need to be an adult to realize that my family didn't like nor love me. That I was just there. But it was stuff like of what I had mentioned that I never talked to my family or my parents about my feelings. I started feeling depressed around 4th grade, I was about 9/10 years old.

Around 6th grade I was really in a dark place.  It went on to 8th grade. First year of high school. A friend of my oldest sister(A) saw my scars at school and told her. That night she sat me down and told me she knew my secret, I was shocked, but a thought that maybe I would finally have someone to support me.

Nope.

She didn't ask me if I was okay, or why. She was angry. What would people think of the type of parents we have, what would people think of her as a sister. She was worried about her social status and our family image. I was devastated. Continuing that year she constantly threatened to reveal my secret. The stress and the fear that had caused me. It was cruel and awful.

That brings me to now. My oldest sister (A) who is now 21, she works while studying. A couple of days ago she revealed to me that she was on new antidepressants, she continued on about how she hopes they work and that she can't stand crying herself to sleep every nigh anymore. I wasn't really interested in what she was saying and I think she could see that. She stopped talking. But over the days she initiates conversations where she talks to me about her depression etc. and every time I would redirect conversation.  I can see she really wants to talk to me about it, but I don't want to. 

My entire family knows her situation and whenever it comes up in conversation I just ignore it. My family asked me if she tried talking to me. I said yes, but that I didn't care about her situation and that I would rather her not talk to me about it. They were pisses. Apparently I am the only one she tried talking to so far.

Years of depression and self-harming, all those times I was put down by her and my family. Never had I gotten support from her, she used my own mental health against me. I don't want anything to do with her. 

The only reason I still talked to anyone is because I still live with my parents. 

My family have been calling me, demanding I talk to my sister and help her. I don't want to and I don't care what my family thinks.

But I know how bad depression can get, and all my life all I wanted was support and love from my family. It took me a long time to realize that I didn't want my family in life and had mentally already disowned them. 

My oldest sister have only reach out to me so far about her mental health. On the one side I know how hard mental health can be, but on the other side, I don't want to support her because she threw me away when I needed her and I feel like i don't owe her anything.

I just need to know if IATA for ignoring her depression and her attempts to talk to me about it? Also in advice on how I can handle this situation further?",27Jun2020,0
865,"My wife(28) and I (32) currently live alone with our 2 year old daughter while suffering from CPTSD and a couple of other mental illnesses that leaves us in a serious bind and we can't see a way out. We are DESPERATE for real answers. I'll go a bit into both of us: My wife has severe cptsd that manifests itself as many symptoms, including uncontrollable bouts of rage, severe depression, and constant suicidal thoughts. She feels suicidal just about everyday, but some days are better than others. They happen frequent and it leaves her with very little ability to handle stress. Shes never had a job despite constant trying. When these episodes happen, if shes not in a rage destroying her stuff, shes self harming, with very toxic thoughts. We've been going to therapists and doctors for years now starting in 2016, ever since the first time we went to the hospital. We've tried for so long but it seems all doctors care about is the insurance money (of which we no longer have making things much more difficult) When they accepted her at a mental hospital, it was just an adult day care, and they would prescribe her a random different pill each time, seemingly shooting at random. All the different therapists and psychiatrists were the same with the typical methods of coping, and another random pill. None have worked, and some pills made her SO much worse. One pill (Wellbutrin) literally made her feel homicidal towards people and it got very scary very quick. We also tried a couple of other therapies (CBT, etc) 

Well after a couple of years of doing this, it was getting worse and worse we needed to do something different or it was going to end in disaster. While  desperately searching for answers we learned about therapeutic ketamine infusions for ptsd. We got a small loan from her mother whom we were living with at the time to give the treatment a try, and it worked like magic. Suddenly she was all happy and cherry most of the time. When stressful events would occur, she would keep her head on her shoulders and work through it easily. The problem with this treatment is its only temporary. After a month or two she needs a reboost infusion and they are VERY expensive so we saw this was not going to be a solution. Vets get it 100% covered through the VA (Or they did until recently) We also tried a couple of other self therapies (canabis, psylobin) but anything and everything proves to be very 

After some time we lost our insurance and had to use the free city services, which are ABYSMAL. You wait 4-8 hours for the chance to see a doctor. Once we were there in an emergency only to be told the doctor was gone for the day. We've stopped going to the emergency room at hospitals during times we feel she will kill herself. They just keep her for a couple of hours, and let her go. They don't even bother sending her to the mental hospital anymore now that we don't have insurance (Not that it helps)

For myself, this takes an enormous toll. I already suffered from past ptsd and depression myself, but it was not as bad as it is now. After 10 years, it's made my depression and ptsd crippling. I have lots of days I just want to die and fantasize about killing myself.  I just don't see how we can escape this. My wife does not do very well alone so it makes it very hard to work. (We have a pretty unhealthy co-dependency with each other) After a couple of hours her mental state takes a massive decline when shes alone. When I'm out running errands nothing feels worse than getting a text from your spouse that things are getting bad and is feeling suicidal, and racing home. I have nightmares about what I'll walk home to. Because this makes working difficult, I've been working from home as an artist but this has its limits

We were both actually self employed artists years ago, and were steadily making more and more as we improved. When we're consistent we can make thousands per month and actually self sustain. Around 2016 she had a major mental breakdown and was at the hospital for a while. During this time, it was both hard to cope emotionally and to keep up with both our workflow. We ended up losing our largest clients that make up 85% of our wage. With that, they repo'd our car too. We started selling our stuff to offset (Dslr cam, instruments, any electronic) but the hole just kept getting deeper. The worse her mental health got, the harder it was to get a hold of life and climb up. Right now we're stuck in a situation where we desperately need GOOD mental help to work, but we need to work to afford the mental health. We currently have no one to rely on. I'm constantly just barely getting enough art commissions to keep food and basic necessities but a lot of times those are tight too.  

We are currently living on her grandmothers cabin. It was empty because her grandmother had a very fast onset of dementia and needed to be in assisted living. We were previously living with my wifes mother, but that was not going well. Her mother is the source and reason for my wifes mental illness (Was extremely abusive and still is) We were living in a single room with a bathroom attached. Because of the effect she has on my wife,  my wife would barely ever leave the room sometimes for weeks or months at a time. My wife's mother was very emotionally abusive and liked to aggravate my wife's condition with blatant gaslighting. It's a whole thing I won't really get into, it would make this post 10x longer. 

Then we also have a daughter. Shes 2, and the most amazing this that happened to us. She wasn't planned but we both love her so much. My wife's and I's mental health is so bad we constantly skip meals, or I'll go a very long time without a shower, but our daughter is something we always put 100%

I feel so lethargic all day every day, but we take turns playing and teaching her. Shes growing up so fast and is really excelling in all categories. I'm so scared I won't have a partner to help me raise her one day, and I know for a fact my mental health can't handle that kind of loss. 

Currently living and going on day by day is so hard. We wake up, keep our daughter on a well thought out schedule, but by the time shes asleep for the day, we have no energy left to do anything. We sit and try and recover for the next day. We never let our bad mental health affect our daughter (as much as we can) If one of us is having a mental breakdown, the other one takes care of our baby, and help the downed party when they can. It's worked well so far, but it can't last forever. 

To this day my wife's and I's mental health deteriorates everyday, and I don't know what to do to get a grip on life. I feel if I just go get any job to work, I'll come home to one family member less.. and I don't know how to get help for it. We've tried the free clinic for YEARS. We had insurance at one point but the apathy of doctors made it so hard to be heard and get real help, not just another pill roulette.  We've tried signing her up for disability and that was denied. 

I need advice. I need help. I don't know what to do anymore. Do I write to fucking doctor phil? That's how desperate I'm getting..",27Jun2020,1
866,Hey everyone! So I'm moving cross country tomorrow and my dad is driving me out. I'm really excited but classic eating disorder stuff won't let me get too excited. We're gonna be driving 8-10 hrs a day for 4 days and I'm terrified. I love working out and I'm really anxious about not exercising for 4 days. I also have that ED thing where you're terrified to sit down for any length of time (which is super fun). So obviously this cross country drive is like an ED nightmare and I don't know how to handle it and the fact that I'm going to be sitting for 4 days straight and not exercising. Can anybody give me advice or tell me everything's gonna be ok? Thank you so much for help in advance!,27Jun2020,1

868,"tldr: Told a guy I like him then rejected him. Now, I'm uncertain if I like him due to loneliness. 

I know of no one else to turn to regarding this matter. This friend of mine, let's call him P. P and I have been friends for a few months now and at the start I confessed to him and so did he. We didn't start dating as I told him I wasn't sure if I liked him as a friend or more. Fast forward to a month ago when he asked me how I felt about him and I told him to just be friends. Now, I'm feeling confused as to whether I do have feelings for him because I have been thinking about him non-stop everyday and it has irked me alot. 

Both of us have similar beliefs and he likes the same band that I do. He treats me with respect and cares for me which is something I rarely experience from my other guy friends. Also, my type of guys are often taken or uninterested in me. Or, guys that are interested in me often ghost me and do not have pure intentions. 

I will be superficial here and just say that P is really not my type. He's average-looking, shorter than average but his personality made me enjoy spending time with him. 

However, sometimes I get pissed because I have to initiate things to do whenever we hang out whilst he is a person that simply goes with the flow. Sometimes, I get bored from hanging out with him. He is also rather timid and introverted while I'm extroverted. 

I've been single all my life and now Im wondering whether to give the dude a chance and to just try dating first but I'm not sure if I really like him and want him to be my boyfriend. I dont know if Im liking him out of loneliness and just want to date to experience first-hand how is it like. I've been told to just wait around for the 'love of my life' to come around but frankly I feel that if i only keep waiting and not lower my expectations, I'm going to end up alone and miserable having not experience the fun along with painful experiences from being in a relationship. 

Can someone please advice me on what to do? Should I propose just dating first before making it official? Or should I calm down and try to stop thinking about him all the damn time?",27Jun2020,0

870,"Hi there. I am 21, female and live in the USA. I’m moving from my current state to Texas and I bought my mom a ticket to come with me and help me move and get settled in. I have asthma and I am high risk but driving there would be 20+ hours and I don’t drive well enough to drive that far and it’s $1000 to hire a drive (I checked) so I settled on a direct 2 hour flight. I have kn95 masks that I’m going to wear underneath a face shield for precaution. With all of that being said, my mom is not taking the pandemic seriously. She doesn’t wear her mask properly in social places even though she herself is high risk and I’m high risk as well due to asthma. 

Roll around to today, she is at her friends, kids birthday party. I am already very paranoid about flying and most of my friends are driving to Texas. I have not gone anywhere outside of the grocery store (sometimes, mostly I get it delivered) since March. I am very pre-cautious because I have asthma and a respiratory infection could literally kill me. Not to mention that I’m very sensitive this time of year due to changes in the weather and I normally get very sick around this time but I’ve been taking my preventative inhaler. She has gone to about 4 or 5 parties since the pandemic began. This may be dramatic but I have already emotionally prepared myself for her getting covid and passing away. There are people who take every precaution and still get it. My mom and I don’t live together. 

Last week, her husband was coughing in the phone and I told her that both of them need to get tested. She got angry and hung up on me saying I was trying to start an argument between them....which I found...odd. I just want her to be safe and sleeping in bed with someone who is coughing during an international pandemic is terrible. 

I am seriously considering canceling my mom’s flight because being around her in my new home could be potentially dangerous for me. She doesn’t wear her mask, she goes to many social gatherings, and my furniture for my second bedroom may or may not be here by then so we would have to sleep in the same bed. She isn’t doing what she needs to do to protect her self but honestly at this point, I feel like I need to do what I have to do to protect me whether that hurts her feelings or not. Would I be wrong to cancel her flight?",27Jun2020,5

He is always arguing with me for no reason whatsoever and it always ends in “ You’re just a kid you wouldn’t understand” this makes me feel very bad and stupid. I seem to feel like I’m not as important as everyone else. I’ve known for a long time without my parents telling me that scratching your crotch close to people is bad manners. But not for my dad, he sits in the couch and does it. Most of the time I leave the scene. I’m bisexual but in the closet. My father is homophobic which makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong with my sexual orientation and recently I’m forcing myself to be straight just to please him and have no risks of being beaten down to death. He talks about women in a very disrespectful way. He treats them including my mother like objects. He keeps telling me “ Son one day you’ll see that women only have one purpose, sex. And if they refuse you force them” I usually start crying and go to my room. I know that’s not true and women deserve all the respect in the world but I can’t say that around him. But I always remind my mother that she’s worth and I love her very much. Also he hates my godmother which right now is my “best friend” and he makes it really hard to be around her.

879,"Ok so my dad and mother got separated when I was a child, they went to court and I stayed with my mom. 

When my sister and I were kids we got raped by my uncle, he is 5 ish years older than me.

My uncle is technically our cousin because his father is my uncle but my grandparents adopted him. 

It is long suspected that he has autism but my grandmother refuses to accept it.

My grandfather knew about him raping us when we were kids yet said nothing.

My dad found out when about him raping me when he read a letter I wrote in 8th grade, all he did was hug me, but overall did nothing.

We went to Oregon saw my cousin (rapist) and my uncle and his family, while I stayed there I had to stay in the same room as my cousin and he touched himself while I was in the room.

My grandmother found out about the rape when my sister was living with her, she then kicked MY SISTER out of the house.

My grandmother still supports my rapist by buying him shoes and clothes etc. My dad buys him things on occasion, everyone at this point knows about is getting molested and raped as kids.

My mother knows about my sister's rape and my rape and how he touched us but only accepts that it happened to my sister and not me because I was hardly there as a kid.

I left that house often because I got scared at night because that is when he would touch me and I usually stayed up at night when I was at my grandmother's house (we went there alottt as kids)

When I was a child I would get so bothered at night if I slept that I would pee the bed alot and wake up throwing up. (This went on for a few years (I was never taken to the doctor)) 

My dad got married and had a son (he is now 8)

My mom got married and had two kids (one is 2 almost 3 and the other is 1 almost 2)

My dad would hit us in the past till my step mom got in and said if he was gonna keep doing that he could leave and he eventually stopped.

I was suicidal and my stepdad said he would ""pop"" me if I didn't do my homework one night.

I went to school and then refused to go home after school and then ended up telling my teacher (God bless him) about my step dad and my cutting and trying to kill myself (I overdosed)

(My overdose failed and all I did was hydro vomit and I couldn't eat for 2 days (I did not go to the hospital (I took 30 painkillers (my family refuses to accept that this happened and told me if it was true I would be dead)))))

I was evaluated and told that i borderline needed to go to a mental hospital but my dad said no to that so they said I needed therapy and to probably take medication.

I went to therapy for only a few months (only twice a week) before my mom and dad just stopped taking me (once they needed to pay for me to because before we didn't have insurance)

When I did go to therapy I started taking anti depressants but I stopped taking them because my sister and mother would tell me I'm becoming dependant on them and then tell me a bunch of stuff about me faking everything. 

My mom threatened to send me to military camp for my ""behavior"" but that was simply because I asked to keep going to therapy and my dad said he would send me if I pulled this shit again.

During my evaluation CPS had to check on me and they said everything looked fine and that I was probably imagining things (then my family took my door off so I couldn't sleep,change,go to the bathroom by myself (yes it's precaution but it sucks having someone watch you like your a whore))

During that time my step mom told me I was going to hell for trying to take the life God gave me and my little brother told me the same thing. 

Just a few days ago my dad picked us up to see my little brother for his birthday since now we rarely see him, he thought my step mom left with my brother and now it's all sideways because my little brother was actually home and so was his mom.

My dad didn't even knock on the door and the decided we would leave, my little brother sobbed for hours and so did his mom.

It turned out that my step sister husband got drunk and my step sister decided to get he mom's car to chase him because he left the house.

I don't ever get alone time at home because my two siblings (2 y/o and 1 y/o) love being around me all the time, I practically raised them. They call me mom, Mama, ama and sometime dad and they rarely (literally unless told by my mom) call me by my name.

They don't call their parents mom or dad unless someone else tells them that that's their mother or father. 

Sum this up Ive been raped, abused, suicidal, have tried killing myself and yet nothing has been done and when I finally started getting help my family berated me, and most of family doesn't believe anything that has happened to me because I'm a ""liar"".

Im a liar because to them I lied whenever I said I didn't do anything (my sister would blame a multitude of things on me) and because I didn't do my school work (that was because I became so tired of life since i was a literal 1st grader and have been unmotivated to do anything)

I want to kill myself but I can't. My dad's an asshole so is my step mom but I can't help but want to bring them out of their asses. My mom is too much of a gold digger to leave her to work my step dad to death. My step dad works himself to death then when he's home he always plays video games. I can't leave them babies to them yes they need their parents but my mom doesn't know how to be a mom and same with my step dad and my older sister is just plain lazy.

What do I do with my life.. I'm gonna graduate highschool soon yet I feel like most things are pointless and that I shouldn't be here. What do I do? Where would I go? How could I help my family, my babies (the kids I call them mine..) and fix thing? Is it bad that I'm like this? Should I even try anymore? Is it bad that I feel horrible? I mean I have a roof and clothes and food... Am I just being whiney and ungrateful?... 

Should I just die..?

2 and a half years ago, a really good friend of mine had to permanently move to Tennessee because her father found a job opportunity there that he couldn't pass up. That month felt like a complete blur, I was in denial the whole time, and we met up one last time before they moved out. It honestly just felt like a normal day out. 
By the time the day they moved out came up, it didn't phase me much. I think I was so in denial that I just bottled up all of my negative emotions, despite my friend's crying. 
I haven't heard much from them since. I heard from my mom that they were having a really hard time adjusting to their new school, and that's when I realized how much I really missed them. I felt so bad that they had to adjust and I wasn't there. I wanted so bad just to shoot them a text letting them know that I was there for them. I didn't though, this was probably at the peak of my social anxiety. I decided to just forget about it again.
The past few months I have had a two reoccurring dreams: one where I have a reunion with this friend, the other where I talk to them again and they either don't care or don't remember who I am (completely unrealistic, obv) but it still got me thinking.

The same day after he left I decided to take my motorcycle for a ride. I went to our locked shed and found out that my helmet, gloves earplugs and some tools had been stolen. There's no signs of brake in to the shed, but in theory it could be opened with a thieves lockpick / tool.

What are the chances that my moms boyfriend stole my stuff? What should I do in this situation?",27Jun2020,1
888,"Please, if you’re going to look at my post history about him don’t comment. I’m sure many won’t - we may have a poor relationship but he’s a person I love and he is hurting. 

Last night, I was on the phone to my boyfriend (hands free while he was on a drive )and he got a call from his mum saying that his quite young (64)grandfather had been taken to A&amp;E after a heart attack. Because I was put on hold the call went straight back to me and he sounded like he was having a pretty extreme panic attack. I helped him keep calm by breathing with him and told him to update me at the hospital. Please note his granddad was effectively his dad, as his actual ‘father’ is an addict who has gone missing for months at a time for his whole life .  Then I got the call, his cries were the most awful thing I’ve heard in my whole life- that man was his dad and his best friend. 

He’s in utter shock and so am I , he was just at his house the other day. I had to work and regret not going. I’m worried he resents me for this .  He’s utterly devastated. I don’t know how to help him , he’s not come home and has kept turning down my offers to go and see him and his family with ‘it’s okay’. What should I do ? 
I reflect on how I felt when I was pretty much just waiting to hear my grandma had died from cancer and I was utterly heartbroken- I can’t imagine how he must feel with it being so sudden. I’m worried I’m not helping enough . Does anyone have any advice ? I can’t stop thinking about it and I just don’t want him to be hurting.",27Jun2020,1
890,"I’ve been having some problems with my mother a lot lately. I haven’t helped her on anything at all. She always did the work. She’d mop the floor, do my laundry, sweep the floor, wash the dishes, fold the clothes, etc. My mom did not raise me to be independent. She didn’t teach me the things every child is supposed to know. I don’t know how to do my own laundry, I don’t know how to cook, I don’t know how to mow the lawn, etc. She never taught me anything in my childhood years. All I ever did, is pretty much sit in the couch and play on my phone all day. Because of my bad habits, she gets mad and yells at me for not helping her. I do feel guilty for not helping her. I know that I need to help her but the truth is, I don’t even know what to do to help her. The only reason why I pretty much play on my mobile device everyday is because I don’t know what else to do. My mom just stands there and yells at me for not helping her. If she actually gave me a list of chores or told me to do something, I would’ve done it. Sometimes I get so mad at her because I can hear her talking about me to other people. I do want to help my mother but I don’t know what to do. I at least help her with the dishes and take the garbage out for her. I really want to change my bad habits but my mother isn’t doing anything to at least get me to do something for her. She never gives me any chores. It’s like she expects me to know what to do when I don’t know. Sometimes when she’s busy cleaning, I don’t even want to ask her if she needs help because I can tell that she’s pretty mad and stressed. I get pretty nervous asking her if she needs help. If I see that she’s mad, I will get nervous and most likely will refuse to ask if she needs help. My mom never taught me nor any of my siblings to be independent.",27Jun2020,1
893,"This is my first reddit post so let me know if I do anything wrong.

My family and I just moved into Collin County in Texas, in a city called Mckinney. Anyways, the schools here have decided to give us the choice of weather or not to return to school or do it online.  I really want to go to school, and have been looking forward to this for forever, but I don't know if it would be a good idea. I am not at risk, but I am worried of possibly catching the virus and spreading it to people who are. What should I choose?",27Jun2020,1
894,"Hi reddit,
I am good friends with a few people. With two of these people, Jim and Jason(fake names) I had planned a drinking vacation to Spain in the summer. We are all 18 years old.

Jim is one year higher in school than me and Jason and we have been friends for about 5 / 6 years. Jim will be graduating this year, so this vacation may very well be the last time Jim can come with us.

In february I had an appointment with my dermatologist. The dermatologist decided I needed some pretty heavy duty medication to treat my acne. I would start on said medication in September, since I wouldn't be able to drink on it. I would have to take it for at least 6 months.

Well, fast forward to about april. Corona is news everywhere and with the lockdown we were doubting whether we could still go on vacation in July. Stubbornly we decided against cancelling the vacation in hopes we could still go. 

End of april I decided to call my dermatologist to see if I could maybe start on the medication early, since I thought the vacation wouldn't be happening anymore and all the clubs and stuff were closed anyways. 

Fast forward again to about 2 weeks ago. My boss told me I would have to take an extra week off after we came back from vacation, if I still decided to go on vacation. Since his mother died from the virus, I respected his decision. Under normal circumstances I would have taken 2 weeks of the 7 weeks of summer break off anyway  so that wasn't a problem.

Today he approached me, he told me instead of the 1 week he told me I would have to take 3 weeks off. For me, this is way too much, but I again respected his decision. So I messaged my friends and explained them the situation, but they just think I'm money hungry.  

For clarification, summer break is about the only time a year in which I can work a lot. And of course friendship is more important to me than money, but to me, still going on vacation seems completely illogical. I don't think the vacation will be as exciting as we intended as when we planned it, since all clubs are closed and due to all the public restrictions in Spain and my inabilaty to drink.

I proposed we could go somewhere closer and just cancel the vacation to Spain. My boss would then allow me to still go to work after and we would have still gone on a vacation together. Jim wasn't happy with that idea however, since we had to complete the payment today. So the vacation to Spain is already paid for. We could still get 40% of our money back if we cancelled within the next 2/3 weeks.



What should I do, should I still go on vacation?

Edit; I'm an 18 year old male from the Netherlands.",27Jun2020,1

896,"I’m just learning how to play Bass Guitar and I’m looking at a used fender precision squier Bass that includes an amp in pretty good condition for $185, but the person (and possible future bass teacher) had negotiated with the person to possibly sell it to us for $160. The problem is that it’s in storage and I would have to wait until the week of July 13th to get it (3 weeks from now). I went online and found the same model new with no amp for $230. I also found an amp that was just under $40 online. It would be quicker to get the new model the amp, but it would be $100 more than getting the used model that already includes the amp, but I would have to wait 3 weeks before I could get it.

900,"okay, so about a month ago i had posted something that involed my ex (boyfriend at the time, who is five years older) and i got some decent responces. heres a follow-up to all that. so if your completely clueless on what im talking about, i had posted a long story (which is now deleted) about my older boyfriend and what i should do n stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

im still a ""kid"" and i should have never met him at all. my parents ended up finding out about him and they didn't enjoy that. i got grounded for a month, and i just got my stuff back a few weeks ago. so, i thought everything was just gonna be chill, and that everything is in the past, but no. my friend, katie, decided to send me a text, saying ""how do you feel that im going to hang out with \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*?"" i didnt handle that well and blocked her on all social media. a week or so goes by, and she makes a new account and asks me if we could just forget about it all. i didnt want to deal with all this, so i agreed. another 3 days past, and she texts me and tells me what happened. she went to \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* place, got drunk, and they kissed. she also mentioned that she didnt want me to tell austin (who is her brothers best friend, but her brother and \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* fight a lot). me, being the petty bitch i am, block her again and decided to show austin. austin showed her brother, and he ended up doing nothing. another 2 days past, and i had found more evidence that \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* had cheated on me, and still being upset and frusterated, posted the screenshots. heres where it gets kinda dumb. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* had every right to call me out on posting that stuff about him, and he got kinda frusterated with me but whatever. and then katie decided to send me a nice lil message on how i ""black mailed her"" and how i was ""pussying out"" (which, i wasn't because i told her i was angry and i blocked her? plus how did i black mail her, i have nothing to gain out of this).  she later when on to declair we are no longer friends.

anyone have any advice or thoughts on how to fix ANYTHING. i feel like this is mainly my fault, and me and katie where best friends before all this. i just want some way to get her back &amp; fix any damage i may have done",27Jun2020,1
901,"No, this is not really a mental health question. I (M27) am considering opening a bakery/coffee/tea shop in the town I live in.
Worked in different restaurants over the years and even served in management in some of them. I know how a kitchen/front of house is supposed to run and I have other people who have already stated that they wanted to join me if I start. I even have original recipes that I've been sampling out, and have been getting really favorable reviews from (two of them have caused someone to cry tears of joy). Even considered roasting my own coffee (lot of money on the front end, but could create outside business at boutiques and the like).

Here is where it's driving me insane:
1) It costs a lot of money to get started even if everything was purchased used. Getting a loan shouldn't be a problem, but I'm not sure.
2) Corona (Should be self explanatory...)
3) I would have to give up my job that I'm making 37K a year. Might not seem like a lot, but it's the highest I've ever been paid.
4) If I try it and fail, I would leave my wife with no money coming in from me (Even though she make double what I do and is 100% supportive) and employees that would be left in the lurch.

I think part of the hold up might be my depression, but I wanted to hear some opinions besides those around me.

A few weeks ago she flew down to visit me. A friend found her a job in the town that I live in and my girlfriend decided to take it. She works really long hours, 65 hours a week, for almost half of the minimum wage. Her shift starts at 7am, she comes home at 8pm, eat dinner, take a bath and fall asleep by 9pm. She's exhausted.

903,"Basically, in the beginning of February, I (16f at the time), decided to distance myself from my now ex- best friend (16f). She was showing signs of a toxic friend because we had lots of fun together but she had made some passive aggressive comments including some ridiculing my close friends, she didn’t respect my time, was pushy, overly needy and kind of inconsiderate. She also demanded a lot of my time and energy and didn’t really show a genuine interest in my life. I couldn’t be that honest with her and have productive conversations because she was really defensive. I often felt dismissed or judged and like I wasn’t being listened to while I was expected to be constantly available for her. She wasn’t really that self aware and I felt kind of used sometimes because I was always giving her so much support with her mental health issues and it left me feeling really emotionally drained. She’s a pretty nice person overall but I think she just lacks some self awareness sometimes. 

But I decided to distance myself from her and didn’t provide an explanation because it was going to cost me my peace at that time and I just didn’t have the energy for it. I cut her off by drifting away. For most of February we sat separately (in class at school) with our own separate friend groups. She texted me sometimes and I would reply but then she wouldn’t reply back. Some days we would sit together, but the connection was always off because I wasn’t being an invested in the friendship. Then, near the end of March, she texted me and asked why we fell off. She said stuff about how I never replied to her messages (which wasn’t true because I replied most of time, it’s her who didn’t always reply back) and how I never started conversations first in class (which was true). I thought us drifting away was pretty mutual although I was the one who initiated it. 

I briefly apologized for not communicating why I needed space and we began talking again until mid April where we drifted apart mutually again. She texted me on my 17th birthday in May and I replied but she didn’t reply back. I reactivated my (previously deactivated) Instagram account, saw her 5 week old messages and didn’t reply because they were so old. Then at the end of May, I complimented her artwork and she replied with a thank you. And now we haven’t talked for a while. We’re not on bad terms because she still follow each other on social media. 

However, what I feel bad about is the fact that I drifted away initially without giving an explanation. I feel really bad and I don’t know whether or not I should reach out to apologize again. I have a tendency to overthink my mistakes and now I can’t get my mind off of this. I just feel like I could’ve set boundaries or communicated more clearly rather than just disappear from her life slowly. I don’t know what to do and any advice would be appreciated. Thank you :)",27Jun2020,2
905,"So my mom won’t let me (f17) leave the house in a tank top even though it’s very hot where I am right now. She said it looks slutty and like I’m trying to lead guys on. For context, the tank top in question was white, but not see through or sheer by any means. I don’t have huge boobs but they’re definitely prominent, and I also have a small frame and a smaller waist so It definitely makes me look very full on top. The tank top wasn’t pulled down low or revealed any cleavage, but my mom still thinks it’s extremely inappropriate. However it feels hypocritical to me because she wears tank tops all the time.

We recently had our house painted and now my parents want to lock the dogs outside all day and only let them come in if they go straight to my room. I don’t think this is fair to the dogs because they have been able to freely roam and I live in a hot climate. It’s currently summer where I live and most days it’s in the 90’s. Our dogs are panting all day long outside, even when they sit in the shade, and they just look so sad. I feel so guilty because I want to let them in but I can’t.

927,"**Hey all, I'd like some advice re: next steps for the issue I've been having - I've tried various things over the years but now things are taking their toll and I'm puzzled as to what to do next. Some background:**

I'm 27M, recently started a job in the sector I've been dreaming of getting into since I started my career. I rent a nice apartment, live away from home and things look lined up to be great...

Except they're not. Imposter syndrome, loneliness and anxiety are running my confidence into the ground. Everyday at work, there are new challenges (work in healthcare and it's a very steep learning curve). I'm a hypersensitive person and I get overwhelmed very easily, spiraling into overthinking at any moment, to the point where my thought patterns become maladaptive and obsessive. It happens when I have to move even slightly out of my comfort zone, when I have to learn something new... even when I'm trying to sleep or just enjoy my hobbies.

You may be thinking, get help - it's so obvious! I've done quite a bit of counseling which did help before but things are getting tougher and tougher now, I'm not a layabout and I've been fighting for years to push myself and improve. I've turned my life around in a lot of respects but I guess in the end, anxiety always rears its head. I tell my patients that it never truly goes either, but finally I'm in their shoes and it's getting exhausting. I sit in silence a lot at home, barely doing anything because even my hobbies are becoming draining.

I finally made the step to call my GP and I'm on an SSRI for the first time in my life - day 1 today and I'm hoping it'll help some of my symptoms. But it feels like it's too much... the internal pressure... Sometimes I just wish I wasn't around, though I'd never ever take action on that.

I'm also dealing with rejection after rejection in online dating. I know, not the best place in general and esp for someone with thin skin but I don't want to not try (plus I'm terrible at approaching in person). I know it's real easy for me to be like 'I don't know what I'm doing wrong, it's all them!' but seriously I'm at a loss. I have great initial conversations with girls and I make the effort, but then they totally dip. It makes me feel worthless, esp after they say they're interested and are very forward about wanting to meet. I'm starting to doubt my looks, whether I'm just a horrible, boring person. I've never had a relationship or done anything and it all feels so hopeless. Some of my best friends are girls and nearly everyone at work is female who I'm definitely confident around but dating just escapes me (and makes me incredibly anxious) so I guess I'm not a totally lost cause but I wonder sometimes...

I just hate myself and don't know what to do. I wonder if this is my lot in life. I don't know what to do while I wait for the meds to kick in... or what happens next...",27Jun2020,2
928,"I’ve gained a lot of weight recently, it’s making it hard to exercise so I wanna diet to help strip some fat before I can confidently go for a run or to the gym without worrying about looking like such a fat piece of crap.

Most diets I try I fail because it’s all portion and calorie control, and I’m a big, strong, tall guy and I work a hard job(chef). But keto diets just seem to be “as long as it’s no carbs, no sugar, eat what you want”

I’m not gonna struggle to cook meals or be creative with ingredients because I’m a chef, and the diet still lets me drink alcohol if I want to as long as it’s spirits.

He's claiming the apartment my mom originally bought for me and my sister so we'd be closer to school. We had to move out for a couple weeks and go back to our old house because someone from our building had the virus. We allowed our brother to occupy the apartment for a while but that's a huge mistake. I don't like staying in our old house anymore so I told him I want to go back, but he makes up excuses not to let me stay there. He says that there's no food to eat there since he rarely buys groceries. Fucking lie. I hate how he refuses to let me stay when I always see in his Instagram stories that he lets his girlfriend stay over.

I told him to pay for his own stuff and he thinks he's so smart, saying that why would he pay for his stuff when someone else can. I mean, he has a job and he shows off, so why can't he pay for his shit?

One time we came by to get some stuff and we see all the mess he didn't bother cleaning up. Everything was everywhere, everything was dirty. He just had to wait for our housemaid to clean his mess.

My(F17) friend(M23) has been staying with me because of covid-19 for the past two months and we have always been close.

A week ago I overheard him using really bad terms like 'r****d' and the 'n' word. I later on confronted him over this and told him that it was not good to say these words and he should stop. He said he was sorry and I didn't hear him say it again.

We had a conversation together a few days later and this topic came up again. I told him that it was not right and I stood my ground. He then tried to explain his situation and said that it was okay because he didn't use these terms towards other people and he only said these terms to his friends. I asked him why he thought so and he said that because no one would hear them saying it and all of them were okay with it. I tried to reason with him saying that he wouldn't use these words in an endearing way and it is just not right to say it.

He tried to turn the situation around and asked me what I would do if somebody told me I was wrong and I replied him saying I would try to educate myself and not say those terms anymore. He told me that it wasn't fair because not everybody in the world would listen and so he does not want to change his ways in fear of losing his friends.

She’s leaving me on read very often and like 20 mins ago i asked if she wanted to talk about something and she said why would she and then I apologized and said I was just being nice and she left me on read. Idk if I should just stop trying or maybe I did something wrong or if I should try salvaging the friendship",27Jun2020,2
939,"This situation is pathetic, to sum it all up Ill give my best go, ***no TL;DR.***

My uncle is an absolute moron, he is a man child, in fact, a child will probably have better rational.

To explain the household, just toxic, Ill ran you down their personas:

**My uncle**: a twat, with no head, just a dick he can't keep in his pants, he should be castrated.

**Uncles ex** *(my aunt)*: We don't get why she is living there, she a manipulator, another twat with no head, she has a child with him, living in the house as well.

**Uncles new gf**: An incredible 25yo child, straight out of a show, she is brainless, she has a child with him, living in the house as well.

At this point you might be thinking, what the fuck? Yes, me too.

Now the ones that should not be there, because they are actually sane people:

**My cousin:** Dragged because he is his father, 18yo, matured way too quick because of this, pure angel, I grew up with him, he will move with me when I get a place, guaranteed, can't get a job because of paperwork his dad didn't do, surprise...

My grandparents: They are old and fragile, sane and wasting their time, they already gave up on him, they need an out card, but they need money, that I can along with my mum and other uncles (the good ones) provide but need to figure out how we can move them with us, they're on another country, and the situation is hard to make someone move.

I'm currently blind with anger, all this situation is disgusting and shouldn't be happening, my gparents gave too much trust, now they don't have a back up, he used all of my gparents savings, he now isn't paying rent, and paying stuff for this brainless chick.

I honestly don't know what to do, I got one more year of Uni, I can't work full time, to save someone elses, it sounds harsh, but man, I don't deserve this shit, not my gparents, mum, nor my cousin.

Unfortunately, the 2 childs, the 2 poor souls, cannot be our problem, it's theirs.

The fix is so simple, but my uncle can't make it.

* Dump the gf, and give her the kid.
* Kick the ex, and give her the kid.

He cannot make anyone rely on him, If he gets lost, he shouldn't have to carry others with his sunken ship, and no, the 2 female adults, are fucking stupid, no sympathy for them, they're fucking leeches. 

WHAT THE FUCK MAN, IT'S SIMPLE AND THIS MORON IS MAKING EVERYONE'S LIVES SO COMPLICATED.

And no, I won't report him to the police or anything like that. His fucking life, I want my gparents and cousin out of it, just like they do, but we gotta provide and escape plan, and If we lived there, it would be so much easier.

I need help guys and gals.",27Jun2020,1

943,"Hello, I am a degree student in mathematics and right now I have been crying for more than two hours straight.  


Since I was little, my dream was to study mathematics at university. I like them a lot and luckily I was very good (I always got the best grade possible in the exams, and I managed to go to the mathematical Olympics nationwide twice). 6 years ago I started my career in mathematics (which normally lasts about 4 years). The first year was not bad at all, I just failed a subject which compared to the other students in the grade can be said that it was not so bad. But since my second year, my academic performance has been a complete failure. So you can imagine it, I think I won't be able to finish my degree next year.  


The worst thing of all is that when I finish an exam for which I have been studying for a long time, I am convinced that it has gone well and that I will pass the course, but then the notes appear and I see that I have failed it again, which has It happened twice today and that is why I am writing this.  


Thanks to the efforts of my parents, I can continue studying, but they are humble people (my parents are farmers) and I can no longer bear that my continued failure is costing them so much, so from this summer I will start working in an AI company (which is my other passion) as a programmer.  


That means that next year I will have even less time to study, but still my main problem is that I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I have read several books (Learning how to Learn, How to prove it, etc) but I still can't pass the exams.  


The truth is that I feel like a complete failure and I no longer know what to do with my life.",27Jun2020,3

I am 100% positive it's not nail polish or something similar ; I tried to remove it but it stayed in place and didn't disappeared at all. It is located on my left hand on the ring finger at the ""base"" of the nail. I tried to search up some answers online but they either talk about rare diseases or things that aren't helpful, so I'm still confused. It doesn't particularly stress me or anything, but I want to be sure it's not something I should be worried about or if it will go away after some time.

I’ve seen you can stream and watch some shows on demand, but not the ones I want always. Is all their current content in paid app? Commercial free?
Sports are another huge one for our family, when they are on. Since they are not on right now tempted to get rid of dish anyway. 
We also pay for Netflix and Disney plus. It’s adding up especially when times are tight. I do want my on demand commercial free shows when I relax or exercise and love live sports.

And today while I was on a date with my wife, work called AGAIN and interrupted it. AGAIN.

Another issue is that I sleep in the living room (I know it sounds odd but I’m 18 and don’t want to have to share a room at this age with my brother) which means the cat doesn’t have the room to himself, as the advice I googled recommended.

if you have any advice then please do not hesitate to tell me, I am getting both really scared and really desperate.

I (f 17) met Zach (fake name but m 19) on reddit a long while ago. We talk everyday even though we have a serious time zone barrier and have gotten pretty close. We both have admitted to having feelings for each other which is a big deal for me, but an extremely big deal for him. Zach is autistic and thought for the longest time that he would never find love, because he does not like to be touched and has a hard time conveying his feelings. He told me that he didn't want a relationship because he had a lot of things that he really needed to work on in his own life. I was understanding of course, but I didn't know the true extent of the ""things that needed work"" until a few days ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

Zach has been having severe panic attacks and trouble sleeping. He is up all the time, during both my timezone and his. He started visiting his therapist more and more but it isn't helping. I then learned that he had been self harming from a post he made on a sub reddit. He detailed that his mom took his ""instrument"" for harming away and now he is even more anxious because of it (this is apparently common for people who harm because they want to always know that they can harm whenever they ""need to""). Zach also posted that he had to resort to punching himself, yanking his hair, and even peeling off a finger nail. 

I didn't want Zach to know that I saw his post as obviously, if he wanted me to know his problems, he would talk to me. But I still messaged him saying that I would do anything and everything he needed me to do to help him with this difficult time. He said, in so many words, that he would probably just need to be alone right now. 

I have been terrified ever since. I don't know what to do or how to help, and I am afraid that he will hurt himself more and more. I don't know if I should talk to him about the subject or just wait until he (hopefully) get's better.

975,"Alright so I don't post very often, and I'll probably delete this if it starts getting too much traction since I know this dude uses Reddit, but this story involves me (15F) and my ex friend, A (15M), it's a little extensive so bear with me, but backstory is necessary in this context. So A and I became friends last year around January because we sat next to each other in one of our classes. We weren't super close, we just talked sometimes and had a few mutual friends. I heard that A began telling *his* friends (ones I either didn't directly know or ones he didn't think I directly knew) that he and I were best friends. Obviously we weren't, since we'd only known each other for around three weeks, but I figured it was a misunderstanding and gave him another shot. He told me shortly after that he had feelings for me, and I didn't feel the same way so it became awkward and we stopped talking for a while.

Fast forward to late May and, as luck would have it, we got assigned to work on a group project together with a couple other people. We started talking again, and I figured it wasn't awkward anymore so I'd give him another shot. We got pretty close, but he ended up needing a lot more help and time than I had to offer, so I cut it off again around last October. He reached out to me again a few months later, saying he was in a better spot, and I was too, so we tried out being friends again. Turns out, A still needed a lot of time and help, and I couldn't offer that, so I cut it off again.

So now we arrive at the main issue. A and I run in one of the same circles, so we inevitably see each other every now and then. Recently lock down has been starting to lift a little bit, so we got together a small group to go to a park and play Frisbee or toss around a football and watch a sunset, nothing too special. Come find out, us seeing each other for about an hour was enough to make him catch feelings again, even after not talking for about 5 months now. The problem arises because I had been getting closer to one of his and my mutual friends, who we'll call B, and caught myself starting to develop feelings for this particular person. I realized recently that with A still having feelings for me, B wouldn't go there even if he wanted to, so I'm starting to get over it. Now I'm ridiculously conflicted because I'm frustrated that this past friendship that's been over for *months* is still negatively impacting my life, and A can't seem to figure out that I'm over and done with it. Is there anything at all that I can do, or do I just have to wait it out until A realizes that I'm not gonna come back?",27Jun2020,1

The position would be property manager and include maintenance, but the property is 1/4th the size of my current property. I have no issues doing maintenance, and an apartment is included for the same price I'm paying now. My current position gives me an astronomical amount of stress and I cannot handle it. I am stepping down to the assistant position, but I do not know if this will help. 


I want to take the job my supervisor offered me.  He does not want to go. He says that he cannot be away from his family and friends. My family and friends are telling me that I should take the position and leave. 


There are some issues with emotional and financial abuse. He makes me feel like crap for buying things I want, while routinely spending $300-$400 a month on cigarettes and alcohol.


He keeps telling me that if I go he will never forgive me and that it will be the end of our relationship. He said that he realizes this is selfish and does not want to stop me from doing what I want to do. I have been trying to talk to him about the situation for days, but he is solid on the fact that he is not going, and has been making passive aggressive remarks about me leaving to everyone.


I realize that it is not the healthiest environment, but I love him. He's not a bad person, just has some issues. I admit that he is selfish and possibly a narcissist. I admit that a lot of my depression stems from the way he treats me, but I have not made things easy either. I have my own faults. I am career driven,  and have issues with work life balance. I do not take medicine for my ADHD or depression, and as a result am extremely unmotivated, unfocused, and do not care about much of anything.


He literally has nowhere to go if he doesn't come with me, as he cannot stay with family.


He has not made my job easy, as he constantly had issues with residents because of his drinking. Unfortunately you cannot help who you fall in love with.


If I stay, I will continue being depressed and stressed. If I go, I will be leaving behind everything and everyone I know. Including the person I have shared the past 16 years of my life with. I can't imagine not waking up without him, but am tired of living a stagnant life. I am torn and do not know what to do. I thought reddit might be able to help. 


My boss wants a decision by Monday as she currently has someone driving from a property an hour away several times a week to keep the new location running. 


Should I stay or should I go?",27Jun2020,1
979,"It's been a year and a half since i(21F) ended the relationship with him(21M), but I can't stop thinking about how much of an asshole i was to him at the end of it.. Everything was amazing in the begining, but then a depressive episode and an identity crisis hit me at the same time. I would ignore his messages for days, then weeks, reply with short sentences and never agree to meet up. I think I got really scared because I started to come to terms with the fact that i was asexual even though there was literally nothing to be afraid of, even when I treated him like that, he kept reaching out in a very respectful and supportive manner. I blocked him on all social media and I blocked his phone number in the end because he couldn't let go after i said i didn't want to continue the relationship. 


It might just be the good memories talking, but he was one of the best things I had in my life, and then I fucked it up so bad, I can't even begin to imagine how he must've felt. I just want to say sorry for treating him that way but I'm worried that messaging an ex out of the blue like that is a bit strange. And if messaging is a bad idea, should I unblock him or just leave it be and forget it?",27Jun2020,3
980,"It started when I went to the DoorDash sub and saw that someone got 1k grant for independent contractors, so I went to the comments to look for more information. But what I got instead was this Redditor intentionally spreading bad information about federal assistance documents. Many people in the comments even corrected him trying to help, but he kept denying it and instead started insulting people. I commented about his behavior and now I’m being followed around Reddit and getting harassed and abused by him.

One is a banker, the other a lawyer and I am a software developer. So our roles are strictly divided.

983,"So I have a few lined up. 

Option A: Current school. Know the teachers and pupils quite well. I fit in and get along with everyone. The subjects I'm taking here are Maths, English Literature and Business Studies and the teachers who teach them are good here. Local so easy to get too so if I need to walk I can. It's also a very small school so there would be around 3-4 in each of my classes which isn't so bad. The negatives include some of the kids are very immature and could disturb my learning. They don't have experience with top Russel group university so would have trouble advising me on how to approach one. 

Option B: The grammar school. Around a 20-30 minute drive so isn't so local. Fresh start I'm a shut-in type of person so I never go out so wouldn't know anyone I am a bit shy at first but, do get comfortable. Amazing reputation sending 3-6 students to Oxford each year. People say they love it. I wouldn't know the teachers though, the year above me isn't so pleasant to say the least. No sixth form centre so would have to mingle with the High School part of it. Classes would be massive around 25-30 kids per class so not as much teacher to student time. A-lot of pressure. Subjects I'm taking Maths,History,English literature and Business Studies 

Option C: The private school. I would have to board so would get me ready for university. Know some of the people. Great reputation. Have visited and the staff do seem friendly. I could easily revise and learn due to boarding. Get to play sports a lot too that's always fun. Negatives include the cost. Going away from home so no privacy to do what I want. A lot of pressure again. The very long days and unnecessary activities like chapel. Subjects In which I would take is Politics,Business Studies, History and English Literature 

So yes here are my options I did have 2 more but, those got scrapped so please please someone advice on which would be the best choice for me.",27Jun2020,1
984,"My boyfriend hasn’t seen his parents in person since March. He has to go back home for something to do with his car and also wants to drop off his dad’s Father’s Day gift. He’s planning on wearing a mask and distancing himself.

He’s just going, not me, but his parents sent me a birthday card back in April and have been so nice to us, so I’d like to send them a plant. I brought a peace lily the first time I met his mom last summer and she loved it.

Is this odd? I don’t want to overstep boundaries and ask him if I can come, especially with Covid now, but I also want them to know I’m thinking of them and want to show my appreciation. I was just going to tell my boyfriend, “Please give this to your mom and dad and tell them I say happy birthday/happy Father’s Day!”

985,"I (19F) work at a grocery store. Lately, a man has been coming in regularly and asking for a 17 year old cashiers schedule. He also asks her where she is playing her school sports at and has commented to one of my male co workers that he thinks she is ""cute"". Then, another man had been repeatedly standing outside on our sidewalk with his face to the window staring in at me and the cashiers. He smokes a cigarette and takes his time watching us. I usually am in the back so it's not always me but I do notice him staring in at me when I am actually in the front. Today I came out of work and he was standing at the door while I was talking to a coworker when I noticed he was staring at me again. I gave him a filthy look and went about my conversation. Earlier, someone had told me he'd made the comment that he ""likes girls with long brown hair"". I happen to have long brown hair, and so does the cashier that the other man is stalking. All the managers know and yet nothing is being done. 

For the man staring in the window, the managers say they can't do anything because the ""sidewalk is public property"", which to me is bullshit. He is flush up against the building, and we have tables and chairs set up on the same sidewalk. I'm not uncomfortable yelling and making a huge scene like a psycho if this guy says something to me, but I really don't want it to get physical. I don't look 19, and I'm worried he's a possible pedo and could be thinking I'm underage. I'm also concerned that none of the managers have told the cashiers parents what is happening. I understand she is afraid to tell them but I think for her safety it's not the managers place to be silent about this. The guy comes in at least 4 times a week. I also am not comfortable with the other man hanging around outside. Sometimes I don't get off until late and I'm absolutely not going to be waiting alone at night outside for a ride or walking to my car. 

Any advice? Can I personally call the cops on the guy who's staring and loitering? I don't even know what I would say. I just don't want this to escalate into someone getting hurt or physically assaulted.",27Jun2020,0
986,"I feel like I’m projecting my own insecurities on to others. But at the same time I can’t help but feel this way.

I have always struggled with my weight, and although I’m not that big (size 14), I still wanna lose the weight. I have never been in a relationship and don’t bother putting myself out there because I don’t think men would be attracted to me once they see my body. 

And I’m trying to work on it but it’s so incredibly hard and I don’t have much support from family and friends. 

So when my friends with flat stomachs complain about their body it’s like I don’t know what to say. Because the only thing I’m thinking is “what the hell are you complaining about?” 

Like where is the negative of having a flat stomach and being a size 4? But then at the same time I understand that people all have insecurities and what just because I’m bigger it doesn’t mean they don’t struggle mentally.

989,"
I’m(22f) just gonna start by saying I ADORE my mum. We get on like a house on fire and she is my rock. Which makes this realisation so much harder. 

Because we have such a close relationship I think she thinks she can tell me anything, and often forgets that I’m still her daughter. I think it’s important to mention here that I have a strained relationship with my dad but they’re still together and I get on well enough with him. 

My mum has had multiple affairs and I know about 3 of them. I found about the first when I was 16. She told me as a ‘secret’ and has even taken me on holidays where her lovers lived and I had to watch them kiss and hold hands whilst keeping up the pretence that she was divorced (I literally had to tell these men that I only saw my dad on weekends). 

My dad is a shitty husband which helped me justify this in my mind, and I do think my mum deserves much better. Since all of this I have told my mum that if she’s gonna stay with my dad she needs to be loyal because it’s not on. 

Anyway, she hasn’t told me about anyone since. But she does often say things like ‘you’d be on my side though right?’ And makes ‘jokey’ comments about her still being the favourite parent and getting ‘joke’ jealous when me and my dad get on. I even feel guilty now if me and my dad are getting on well. 

It was Father’s Day in the UK not long ago and I came downstairs singing happy Father’s Day in the happy bday tune. She immediately went ‘it’s not his birthday’ and I told her to cut it out because it’s a nice day. She immediately got defensive and told me she was only joking and that I’m too sensitive. 

She has a very weird relationship with my dad and projects her guilt onto him by accusing him of being disloyal and arguing with him a lot, but she never leaves. 

I am only just sitting here thinking about this and how actually awful it is that I know all of this stuff about my MOTHER. And that I’ve been expected to keep it all secret and just go along with it. 
But I love her so much and I have a constant fear of upsetting her or leaving her side. To the point where the thought of anyone saying nasty stuff about her under this post is making me upset. 

How the hell do I deal with this? Therapy is the obvious answer but I can’t afford it and dunno if I have the courage to say to my mum ‘hi can you pay for me to have therapy to deal with the trauma you’ve caused me without me realising? Thanks’",27Jun2020,1

994,"this is a long story. so I (17F) started dating a starving artist (18M) and of course, I didn't tell my mother because of fear of disapproval from her part, until she found out when I accidentally forgot to hide hickey. Surprisingly, she accepted and opened the doors of our house to him and even let him stay the nights whenever he came to the city to visit me. This doesn't stop her complaints about his ways of life and how he will never provide for me or future family, and that she thought I would be smarter with my taste in men. I don't really know What to think about this since I'm only dating him; he is my first boyfriend. She is obsessed with me having sex, she won't stop asking whether I'm a virgin or not and that she's not gonna be surprised the moment I end up pregnant. I'm insulted constantly, but I take responsibility. 

I also have been working at her restaurant and it's been a living hell since our personalities crash all the time and we end up arguing, but I always try my hardest, work my hardest, and she even let me all by myself working the cash register and kitchen. I would open and close the place until she decided to close permanently and start a business with her fiancee.

Ever since she has been blaming me for every decision she takes. She tells me she decided to close up her business because of my attitude and how I would ""fuck her up"" eventually. A few days ago my boyfriend visited and stayed over for a few days when I was extremely sick of anemia, so while she was away, he was helping me out which turned out to be the climax to our already unstable relationship. He fell asleep with me in my bed (forgot to mention he can stay with the condition that he sleeps in the living room) as he was trying to comfort me from abdominal pains from extreme vomiting and mom decides to come home at that very exact moment. So everything collapses and I have to apologize. She tells me she doesn't want him here anymore and that I find tickets as soon as possible.

I did not find any so he has to stay another day. She erupts. She begins to tell me how much of a disappointment I am and everything that I've done over the past year (leaving the house without telling her, going to punk shows, not focusing in school even though I am an A+ student). Says that this is another one of my dirty tricks to do whatever I want. I try to apologize. She calls my dad and he agrees to take me in, tells him she will take me to the airport. Begins filing papers, giving me documents. Tells me to pack up. My first instinct is to run away, I do not want to go to another country.  I do it. I move in with my friend. I come back home two days after to apologize and come to terms. She doesn't want to take me in at first but neither does she want me to be taken in by another family. She only wants me to move away with my dad. Says that if I give her the adoption papers to stay with my friend an investigation will be open and that she could lose my brothers.

So this is where I need advice. Could I possibly get her in trouble if I get the adoption papers for my friend's mom to adopt me? Another option is staying with her, but I have to pay rent and groceries, plus she doesn't even want to see me right now. She's been laughing at me for the last three days for no reason and to be honest it's quite unbearable. Another factor is that I am not so far from finally turning 18, but she is not willing to wait until then for me to move away. She says I officially become an adult until I am 21 and thus I am forced to stay with her and pay rent till then or be sent to my dad to another country.

consensus: mom doesn't want me to date, blames me for ending her business, says my behavior is intolerable (though I'm only being a teenager) and decides to send me to another country with my dad. I run away and I fear that if I get adoption papers for my friend's mom to take me in, my mom will run the risk to lose my brothers.",27Jun2020,0
995,"So I recently made the trip ‘home’ for a visit after living on my own for about a year and a half, around 200 miles away. 

I was super excited to see my mum and my sister and everyone still living in my hometown. But ever since I got here I have this really strange feeling I can’t describe, I don’t feel comfortable, I feel anxious a lot, frustrated, I don’t feel like I belong here anymore, conversations with them seem hard and they don’t come naturally like they used to and I feel like I’m faking it which makes it worse.

I don’t know how to explain these feelings to anyone. Somewhere there’s a disconnect in who I was, and who I am now and I can’t seem to settle back into one of the only places I should feel comfortable.

I think I’ve upset my family by being absent in the time I’ve been here and I’m not sure how to explain to them what’s going on without hurting their feelings.

1001,"Like the title suggest I had no idea what to do with my life and no idea where I should start.  I’ve achieved nothing in my life and feel like I never will 


I’m 21 I live in England.  


For those familiar with the UK education system. I finished highschool with all C’s and a B in math. I did extremely poor for no fault but my own. I preferred playing video games rather than studying. I then went to college and was only allowed to do a BTEC so I did a level 3 in business. Did really well the first year but the second year I had below 50% attendance. Unfortunately video games once again became a priority.  I finished college with double distinction which wouldn’t be bad for level 2 but for a level 3 I was basically missing an entire grade. 


I was finally out of the education system as I had zero plans of going to university. I still hadn’t grasped the consequence of my pure laziness and quite frankly my video games addiction. I started applying for jobs to please my parents but I had no plan on actually working. My cv was so poorly done it would simply deter employers from even giving me a second look. Somehow I got a very good opportunity towards the end of 2018. A financial planning company I had applied for actually wanted to interview me. 3 weeks later with no contact I assumed I wasn’t successful but turns out they were very intrigued in hiring me thanks to my references.  It was going well. It was an apprenticeship that would lead me to becoming a paraplanner in the future. I got fired 2 months into the job . I wasn’t really given a reason but I didn’t click with most of the other employees. They were already very well established financial advisors with very successful careers and paired with my bad social anxiety I was just never meant to be there even though I did the job exceptionally. I just turned 19 at the time of me losing the job. 



For the past 2 years since then my life has been exactly the same. I wake up play video games , eat and sleep. It’s miserable but I feel stuck and every time I deviate from my norm I get this overwhelming feeling of anxiety and this very unsettling feeling. I don’t have motivation I really have nothing. I’m constantly put down by my parents and my. Successful family members. The only time I’ve deviated from my norm is early 2019 I attended a AAT level 2 course in bookkeeping and got that qualification. I’ve not been able to use it at all to any advantage. 

I’ve recently been thinking about going to uni but I’m just so scared and I have no knowledge on what I need to do. I’m only able to a foundation degree which my current qualifications.  I’m so lost and I really do need a guide or some guidance because I have none of that in my life at all. My mental health is just on a constant decline to the point I don’t see much worth in my life at all. 

TL;DR

My life is in shambles. I stay at home all day playing video games. I have no direction in my life and I have no idea where to start or even what to do How do I get out of the mental state?


I just stress this:

ANY ADVICE OR GUIDANCE OR ANYTHING IS HIGHLY APPRECIATED.

1002,"I've been talking myself out working there for 4 years. Even though it's a fairly prestigious school and I REALLY REALLY wanted to. It's an insular world that he and I teach in, so I was often meeting people who worked there, who would suggest I apply and ask why I hadn't.

Why hadn't I? #1, I was ashamed to face him. Full stop. I made some of the biggest mistakes of my life in that relationship. Things I'm too ashamed to admit publicly; things that made me question my inherent goodness; things that made me feel like a monster. Things I only did to him and no one else before or since. I can say I ""wasn't in my right mind"" at that time in my life, that he wasn't either, but what does that really mean? I was still in control of myself and my choices.

I've worked hard to make peace with it-- taken better care of myself, sought therapy, written about it, read books, confided in friends. I've been in another relationship now for 3 years and never once considered hurting him the way I hurt my ex. I never tried to run from it, but I also never saw my ex again after our breakup. I was always afraid-- still am--- that the hard work I did to forgive myself will crumble the second I actually see him.

And another reason why-- fear of being treated with scorn. What if he makes it clear he never intends to get over it? He's a very private person, so I truly don't think he would ever tell anyone what happened between us or try to ruin my career over it, but that doesn't mean he has to be friendly. I don't know if my brain could take it if he was cold. Or, what if he doesn't have any reaction at all? What if he treats me as he would treat any other random coworker/acquaintance and I have to accept that I barely factor into his universe? Which would be worse?

Ever since he left me I've been daring myself. Once I went so far as to inquire about openings to (what I thought was) the head of the department, but he never replied and I found out later I'd contacted the wrong person. I already had a job and students I loved working with anyway, so it was easy to talk myself down. *Not worth the trouble. You're fine where you are.*

Then the plague took that job away last month. I started thinking *just go for it.* Now I'm fine-tuning my cover letter, harassing former colleagues for references, clocking the commute time. They may not even be hiring for my position right now, but taking the first step is a huge deal for me. I know if nothing comparable comes up I'll keep pursuing this job until it happens, because now I've allowed myself to acknowledge how badly I want it.

I know I'd love working there and there's no doubt it would be a HUGE boost to my resume. I've worked my ass off to get to a place where I felt I deserved a job there, and it just feels right at this point in my career. But I don't know how I'll handle the moment, whether that's a day or a week or a month into the year, when he sees me and realizes that we work together now. All the possible results of that scenario. But I'm going for it, because what do I have to lose?

There's one more thing I should mention; one more reason why. I'm giving this a shot because it might be a way out. I've been telling myself for 4 years that what went down between my ex and I is proof that the safe route is best. The good guys will only leave me, I'll drive them away, so I shouldn't feel too much or fall too hard. I chose my boyfriend according to that ""wisdom"". Now my life feels pretty fucking empty, and I've convinced myself I deserve all the shit he does to me. I don't want to stay where I'm at, but I don't want to go either.

But what if my ex could see that I'm better? What if he was better? What then? Could I dredge up the strength to leave, if I thought I had somewhere to go? There was so much left unsaid between us, so many things that went unexplained. He felt he had to protect himself and I don't blame him. But all I know is what he said before everything went to hell--the things he felt for me and the future he saw us having. Maybe, maybe, maybe. I know it's fucked up but it's there, tiny and insistent at the back of my mind.

If I do this, I'll be making the best career choice AND also maybe the worst personal choice of my life. Thanks for reading-- any advice is greatly appreciated.",27Jun2020,0
1003," Excuse me as i'm going to be a bit selfish as I talk, as generalising my question to other creatives would mean that what the feelings I've created would also be pushed onto others when in reality were all different and I don't want to speak for others when I am i'll knowledge'd.

My question is how does a person learn to become motivated of their own backs instead of requiring others input and positive comments to keep them going? is such a thing possible? or are people just naturally internally and externally motivated without being about to switch.

I'm a person who greatly feeds of others incite, I want to be told my work is worth something, and i want to be able to keep churning stuff out even when no ones watching or cares because it means so much to me. But I find myself demotivated and sluggish when I find myself in these scenarios, leading to long amounts of time where I struggle to work.

if anyone has been through something similar and has come out the other end with a coping mechanism or come to some kind of conclusion with themselves about it, it would be greatly appreciated if they could share some info.

I hope you have a great day and thanks for reading :0

I’ve always had a lack of self control when it comes to drugs. Hell I was a pill addict in middle school &amp; high school. My biggest problem is it got to the point where I spend my whole check on coke, then started getting in debt with my dealers.

Well now we are open again, and she saw a new person in the store and asked her if we had more. My coworker told her yes and that we could bring more in. I was not aware that she was actually promised more in a bigger size.
She came in today during my shift and demanded her bigger bags. I told her we did not carry them and never had. She demanded I ask managment for the bags, said she would wait for a call and expected me to call her when it was sorted. She then said as she was promised the bags she would make sure we honoured our word or else she would complain everywhere she could and make us and left.
Managment confirmed the bags she wants do not exist.
The problem comes in with us being a very small business that struggles to afford rent some months and cannot afford a store phone. If I message her or call her it will be with my personal cellphone. I don't want an angry customer having my number.
The flip side is being a very small business most of our advertising comes from word of mouth and positive customer reviews.

First, I know this is long (i’m so sorry) but really I wanna get my feelings out. I’m 14f, I just came here because I thought it might be better maybe getting some advice from people who might of experienced the same as me. 

First thing, I feel useless, school is just making me become stressed 24/7. People always say to me “Oh it happens to everyone” but I’m constantly getting things wrong, failing tests, misunderstanding things etc. People around me aren’t. I try so so hard though. I’m failing.

It’s also so hard to continue to try and make things better for myself with really negative people around me. I try so hard to keep a good friendship with people but they never seem like they actually care. They make fun of the things i’m most insecure about, hang out without me, talk about me when I’m not there, and act completely fake. I’m done with people like this. I don’t see my friends when I’m not in school. I’m done.

Then I get home from feeling shit all day, I’ve heard people say “tell your parents how you’re feeling”. So I go and tell my parents. All I get from them is “we don’t wanna hear this sorry”. Then I say something like “please I really think it’s a good idea you understand”. All they say back is “your fine okay, just change the subject”. Then I sit there crying for 2-3 hours straight with no help.

I know people might think 14 is way too young to have a boyfriend but it felt like it was the only way I could find any happiness in my life. It felt like I had someone I could trust and would stay with me. We used to chat about things and we used to be there for each other. I was so happy to have someone there and we obviously loved each other so he became my boyfriend. I can’t hide my feelings for someone so that’s how we got together, we were in a relationship for 2 years. I was still alive because of him, he really helped me. Then he left me. I can’t really say much else other than I’m broken and I can’t trust anyone anymore.

It was literally just a week after he broke up with me, my great grandmother died. I was really close to her. She phoned me up to see how I was getting on with school. She helped me feel happy. She made me feel less sad and just gave me so much happiness. She brightened up my life. I bet she is looking down on me right now wishing she could be with me because i’m really struggling.

Looking back on it, it started around 2 years ago. I started skipping meals and in general didnt eat enough calories, i didnt think much of it at that time and from what i remembered is lasted nearly a year, but since i didnt loose any weight i thought it was fine. After that i started eating more and i guess it was better, but now i realized the decrease of food i was eating over a few months, i started noticing physical changes, not weight loss, but dizziness, severe headaches, fatigue, i was basically shaking for most of the day. I just started to track my calorie intake and the results are very shocking. I know that from the TDEE ive calculated i should be atleast taking in 1630 kcal a day, but what i normally get in a day is around 600 kcal ( if i only eat breakfast and a snack or 2) - 900 kcal ( breakfast, snacks and dinner).
Its very low and im concerned for my well being.

 Every attempt on trying to eat more didnt do anything, smelling foods i once loved makes me sick, i can eat them but its severely unpleasant. I hate the feeling of being hungry but also of being full. I dont know what to do, i would seek professional help, but my family is a pretty broke and i dont want to cause any issues, i figure why not give this a try?

1015,"This might be more of a rant than anything else, but I would like some advice if any. 

I’m a female INFJ who is 24. Currently lost my job due to coronavirus, I was a bartender at a late night bar. I had to stop going to school because my work was interfering with my studies and my job was essential to my growth in the future. Working there was starting to make me depressed since I was constantly surrounded by people and friends. I felt like I had to be acting 24/7. After I was furloughed, a weight was lifted off of my shoulders. 
This is just a bit of background, and not completely the reason for this post. 

My parents separated in February of 2019. They had been together for 24 years, and it was a bit of a shock for me and my family (two brothers, 18 and 15). We accepted it pretty quickly, but started to learn about the faults in our parents. My father has been cheating on my mother since I was born and is sexually addicted to the point where he would make us late for family functions and the like in the past. Aside from this he is a narcissist and would constantly starts projects just to stay away from the house. He “started” dating someone in March 2019 and introduced her to my brothers. I have yet to meet her. 
Our mother is an alcoholic and very passive with PTSD from her mother and her mother’s constant boyfriends/husbands. She only talked bad about our father in the beginning of the separation, but has since then let us form our own opinion. My brothers live with my mother, as do I since recent coronavirus and whatnot. 

The divorce is taking longer than usual, and my mother is asking (from what lawyers say) for very reasonable things. My dad keeps on fighting her left and right. He tried to move back in because he didn’t want an apartment anymore and the lawyers essentially kicked him out. He came in to pick up my brother one day and followed my mother into her room while recording and got up in her face. On both of these occasions, he accused my mother of hitting and kicking him. She doesn’t have a bone in her body to do something like that. 
Currently, I’ve told my dad to fuck off. There are a lot of other things that have happened that I’m not disclosing for personal and length purposes. 

My dilemma is that I’m not longer sexually attracted to anyone and consistently get bored (mentally) with potential partners even though they don’t seem boring at all. I’ve been celibate for at least one year so far even though I’m wanting physical contact. I’m not usually attracted to someone until I know them personally, which also makes all of this harder, but I can’t bring myself to continue to date someone. 

If you have any advice, I would love it, especially coming from this sub. Please and thank you!

Okay not to overthink but here’s the situation lol:

I used to be FWB with this guy. We were both usually drunk when we hooked up and he didn’t pay much attention to me outside of that. I was actually into him but it definitely wasn’t mutual. He cut things off one night after we I was REALLY wasted and apparently said some pretty fucked up things to him... it was a mess.

That was like 8 months ago. I’ve lost a bunch of weight since then and stopped drinking too much and overall am just a completely different person- a lot healthier and happier. He randomly texted me to hang out one night about a week ago (probs to hook up but who knows) and i said no because i was seeing someone. Well me and the guy broke up so I invited him out to the bar lastnight and we had a really good time! At close we still wanted to hang out so I invited him over and made it clear it didn’t mean I was gonna hook up with him. And he was like that’s not what I’m coming over for I can tell you’re not the same person blah blah blah. Well, we hung out and caught eachother up on life and stuff then we ended up hooking up anyway LOL🥴. 

The thing is, he’s always been sweet when he’s drunk. I can never read his intentions. He was sweet this morning but I can’t figure out if he’s just trying to sleep with me again or if he’s actually interested... I have no idea how I’d even begin to know😩",27Jun2020,1
1028,"I don't know, I just feel so frustrated by this situation. He already has varicose veins for example. He's 28 and they look like the legs of a 60 year old. But let's say that issue doesn't register as so directly impacted by smoking. 

He's had some trouble breathing lately and went to the doctor, who told him it seems likely he aspirated some stomach acid because of reflux (cause smoking and coffee on an empty stomach every day for 15 years). His airways were inflamed and he got some medicine and clear instructions to at least cut down on the smoking and coffee. He's *kind of* been doing that, but not cutting out the biggest negatives - smoking right after meals and smoking right before bed, when he complains most about breathing. 

He'd been doing better cause of the medicine he's taking and not smoking quite as much as usual, and today he smoked more, and was complaining he can't breathe well again. Followed by ""I'm gonna go have a smoke"". I tried to talk him out of it but as I learned, it's always futile. It's just..... It makes me wanna hit him! Even when a doctor told you your current health issue is *because of smoking*, you are clearly aware of it, it's made you feel bad, but then you go do the exact same thing WHILE you're feeling physically bad! 

I can not wrap my mind around it and I can not understand how I can help. I also don't know how to not get pissed off every time. I can't. Even if I don't show it, I'm pissed off. Because it's so selfish. Because I know the kind of crap my mom is dealing with because of my dad's smoking and drinking. His lungs are a mess, his legs are a mess because of veins barely holding together..... And this shit costs money, and time, and having to care because someone couldn't care themselves when they had the chance.

How do I navigate this? Can I help him in any way? He has pretty shit willpower so every attempt he's made at quitting has failed... 
I guess quitting is even harder in our country cause most people we know smoke, and a lot of them started at like 13. It's not like you go out and your friends will encourage you to not smoke. Cause your friends are all smoking in front of you. I know it's hard. But I don't know how to help.

1031,"We've recently moved as a family (still got a few projects to sort out with the new house so we are still renting at the moment) and due to schools reopening for some age groups, one of my children began attending their new school. 

My child has been getting on with this other child at school and they came out talking to each other recently. This prompted me to introduce myself to the mother of that child and she seemed really nice. The second time I went to collect my child, the mother of that child and I exchanged mobile numbers and we ended up meeting up at a park for a ""corona edition"" play date. Keeping 2m apart (although as you can imagine, children find this difficult but we encouraged sticking to the rules). 

Her child kept complaining they were hungry and so I suggested we get take out pizza and eat it outside together. She said she had not brought any money with her (and so that's perfectly normal), so I purchased a pizza for us all to share. I said it was my treat. We rarely spend money and are frugal in other areas so we have plenty of money for treats and stuff like that if we really want to. 

A little while later, we go out again and this time my other children had to come with me because my partner wasn't working from home that day and so we all sat outside in the sun and my eldest wanted an ice cream as the naughty ice cream truck screams it's music as loud as humanly possible to attract people to the side of the park. This mother again (still a really lovely person), had forgotten her purse. I didn't want to make a big fuss about anything, so I decided to buy us all an ice cream (and I was quite impressed with the ice cream truck because they had a contactless card processor for payment - however that works, I don't know) AND I said to her, she can pay me back. She didn't agree or disagree but she registered with what I said and looking back, maybe I should've spotted the clue then and there. 

Anyway, fast forward, the time has come for her to pay me back and she had ""lost"" her purse and can't pay me. Now, I really like her and my next step is kinda critical to the friendship. I don't want to be her bank account but in my mind she's clearly struggling for money and I'm wondering, should I just gently confront her about this and say it's absolutely fine if she can't pay me back? I don't want to make a big deal over a couple of quid and maybe in the future she can come round to our back garden and have a coffee instead. 

What is a way for me to gently prompt her to tell me she hasn't got any money or am I reading into this too much? 

My partner and I aren't poor by any means and even though I don't want a friend to leech off me, I also don't want her worrying about money if we choose to go out in the future. Thanks in advance.",27Jun2020,1

1036,"So I'm going to try to not let this post go on too long. I have a very close adult cousin who is really struggling to take control of their life and I'd like advice on how I can support them to move forward.

Here's the story. My cousin and I were born only a couple months apart. Though our parents were very close when we were growing up, we lived about an hour away from each other and our home situations were very different. My family was somewhat well off. Aside from my parents divorce when I was almost an adult, my upbringing was rather uncomplicated. Conversely, my cousin's parents were never married and he never had what you would consider a traditional or positive upbringing. Fast forward to adulthood, my cousin is now almost 30, but cannot take care of himself and seems to have no motivation to do anything. He spends day and night playing video games and can not hold a job. After our grandparents deaths, he moved in to their house and the situation has cause significant conflict among the family. On multiple occasions, various family members have visited the house to find it in terrible condition. There is garbage all throughout the house, clothing all over the floor and days/weeks old food on, near, and under all the furniture. At one point several years ago, I moved my cousin in to my home when he needed a place to live. His habits were similar at that time, so I am familiar with how he lives. Ultimately, this was one of the primary reasons we couldn't allow him to remain living with us. Both our parents(and their remaining siblings) and all of the cousins have gotten in to heated arguments over the past few weeks over the condition of the house and my cousin. To add to the situation, my cousin's mother (We are related through his father), who also can not take care of herself and has various habits and vices that are of extreme concern, tags along wherever my cousin goes and is a toxic influence.

The bottom line is this: I am concerned for my cousin. I regret not doing more when I had him living with me to help him begin to take care of himself. I believe he will never become a fully functioning adult and contributing member of society unless drastic measures are taken and he is removed from his current environment. However, he is an adult. I cannot force him to do anything. Are there resources out there that my benefit my cousin that I may recommend to him. One thought I had was perhaps an out-of-town hands-on vocational training program that can provide some structure, teach him a skill, while removing him from his current environment. However, I'm not sure such a program even exists. Secondly, how can I persuade my cousin to take the steps necessary to grow and begin living his own life. I'm not even sure how to approach the topic. One last complication: I do not live anywhere near him currently and cannot physically assist in any way. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!",27Jun2020,1
1038,"So this morning my best friend shared the sad news that his mother passed away. I told him im really sorry for his loss and that, if he needs something, he can text/call me even if its just for listening. But for some reason it doesn’t feel like enough.

Also I dont know if I should ask now how he is doing and stuff. I dont want to bother him/make him more upset. I thought if he wants to he will reach out, but i dont know if thats right. I never been in this kind of situation, but I want to be there for him as much as possible.

1040,"So I just graduated high school and I will be going to community college for a few reasons: I don't know what my major will be, I would not be able to afford going to a university especially if I don't know what I want to do, I'll have a better time getting into a university of my choice, and less debt. I'm including this because I want to give a little bit of background information on my life and what I will be expecting.

I wouldn't say that I am in a bad environment at all; I have a roof over my head, a great family who will support me, and I could have anything I want. Yet, as the oldest child in the family, I realized that I do not really need materialistic things which is why I never ask for anything — but that's besides the point. I want to get ahead in life and start early but I also feel like I should enjoy the rest of my childhood I have left. If I do decide to relax then I feel unproductive and I feel like I am not doing anything, so I am really torn between what I should be doing.

It's a bit hard to explain but if I try to do something, I don't know what I should do. Then I resort to the other mindset I have of relaxing at this age. But when I do *that*, I feel unproductive and I believe I should be doing something, or else I'm just wasting time. Going back to the question of this post, how can I improve myself? I tried learning new things: I read a lot of books on the stock market and invested but I just don't feel like worrying about money at this age. I tried practice my piano and violin and French speaking skills, but I'm finding little motivation to do so.

I am doing nothing besides watching YouTube everyday and I truly feel terrible.

Any advise is greatly appreciated!

1043,"I met this pretty nice guy nearly a decade ago and we kind of hit it off. He's autistic and leaves many people, well, bewildered with some of his behavior. I've got a couple of autistic friends and family though, am used to a few quirks, so we quickly became friends.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Now, my friend downloaded RPG Maker back in the day and started working on a game. This game has had multiple failed kickstarters, one successful kickstarter (with a goal of just a few hundred dollars), tables at comic conventions, etc.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Here's the problem: The game is bad. Really, really, REALLY bad. Like, one of the worst games I've ever played in my life. The gameplay is bad, the writing is ridiculous, and everything just looks... Horrifically bad. Like one of the Phillips CD-i Zelda games, but worse! Not in a fun way either.  
&amp;nbsp;  

I've helped him some with the game in the past because I have a lot of experience with RPG Maker. I fixed some bugs, fixed a lot of his graphics, etc. I did a lot of work under the hood, so to speak. He didn't understand a lot of my fixes and undid them back to their broken state though.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Recently he posted some kickstarter reward t-shirt designs on his facebook page that look like like they were made in MS Paint with super cringy text on them. They were painful to look at.  
&amp;nbsp;  

So folks, what do I do here? Do I ever tell him how bad it is? Do I just keep it to myself? What do I do?  
&amp;nbsp;  

I really like this guy and I try, really hard to be supportive and encouraging. I want to be a good friend. The game is a dumpster fire though and I don't know what, if anything, to do. I'm afraid I'll hurt him if I tell him the truth about it but I'm also afraid it'll crush him when he releases it (which is about to happen) and it bombs.",27Jun2020,2
1044,"Hi everyone. I’m an engineering student and there’s this girl. She’s basically the worst hahaha. She doesn’t attend classes and she fails exams but she somehow snakes her way through because her father is best friends with the Dean. 

In addition, she’s also famous for “creating” this “innovative product” her father basically made it but gave it to her so she memorizes this half-baked script. What’s more annoying is that she keeps on joining these competitions and through her connections, she “Wins” The local rounds and advances to international rounds. 

Again, I find it unfair cuz her product is related to engineering but she cant even do basic calculus and she barely made it through physics. Oh and by the way, she failed one of our classes which is a prerequisite to the field of her product (example her product is an aircon, but she failed the prerequisite to thermo and refrigeration; she failed thermodynamics too by the way) 

Anyways she joined a competition lately and I found out that she violated one of the rules. She joined this student-entrepreneur  competition  that requires a contestant to have an operational  company, but her “company” isn’t even operational. 

The competition also requires that your company has achieved at least a revenue of $500 but how can she do that when her product isn’t even in the market yet 

So should I email the organizers? She won the local round for some reason and she’s off to the semis.

I've been in a relationship for a little over 6 years. I love my boyfriend in every possible way, but i'll be honest, sex has always been difficult for me, in and out of the relationship. I have had hook ups in the past that were just that and sex had always seemed so off. 

I've also been in one other relationship that only lasted 1 month, (if it really was a relationship since I was kind of the rebound). Even during that time, I had trouble too even though I was attracted to him. There was nothing more than oral or hand jobs. We've had sex in my current relationship, but it always feels off, like I feel uncomfortable sometimes and even flat out refuse to do anything. Obviously, my boyfriend feels like shit and with good reason.

I really consider him my first relationship and we've had our ups and downs, but we always come back to each other. The other thing is that I am a sexual person. I don't hate sex, just feels weird in a loving or romantic scenario. TMI, but I do pleasure myself for the most part because it's the most comfortable for me, sometimes to porn that isn't always just simply sex. Sometimes its rough like torture or bondage. I have even told my boyfriend about this. Tried it, but it just doesn't feel good because of the love that I have for him and don't want to demean him that way.

Everyday has been some kind of crazy argument, everyday they break up and get back together and its escalated to physical abuse, using weapons, running into each others cars etc and last night I thought it would be fatal with the choking and all and the worst part is my friend is 29 and his bf he's abusing is 17 (he's mom is ok with it because she's on meth and his dad killed himself this year. Neither of us have the funds to get back to other side of the country again as covid kinda blasted what funds I did have saved and is part of why I said f it might as well come to Cali as it's not like I have anything to lose but I didnt know I'd be roped into being the third wheel and a horribly abusive relationship. Each time they fight and break up he goes out his way to be nice because he knows if the cops get involved he's screwed.

I have only met my father once, for 3 hours, when I turned 14. After that, he disappeared just as quickly as he appeared back then. I tried to keep in touch, but there was always some excuse not to get back to me so I threw in the towel and moved on. Back in November 2017, I found out I had a sister that was still in high school. She had been looking for me for years and finally found me. Come to find out, he also left her when she was a baby too. He was an alcoholic (still is? Idk...) that didn't take responsibility for the offspring he produced. Now all of a sudden, I receive a friend request from him on Facebook. Even though I don't care much about Facebook, this is a huge deal to me and I'm not sure what I want to do. I don't know if I want to accept it and allow him to peer into the little bit of life I post on Facebook. I resent him for abandoning me. I thought I grew out of this resentment, but this small action of his has evoked an anger in me that I thought was gone. I have questions for him, but I'm afraid of the way I'll come across when I ask them and I'm also afraid of the answers I'll receive from him. I just don't know what to do. I'm confused. I'm angry.

1067,"There's someone we know who had a travel trailer stored in a place with a known mold issue. She took it out of storage and is living in it now. My husband noticed that every time he's around her, his nose starts running and he starts coughing. We originally thought it was because of some product she uses. 

He gave her a ride in his car, and noticed that the car smelled like her afterwards. So he sprayed febreeze and aired it out. But the smell didn't go away. It wasn't BO or a bad smell, it actually smelled kind of sweet. But every time he smelled it he would start coughing. We aired it out more and put baking soda in the car, but the smell would always come back just as strong. 

We finally resorted to spraying vinegar in the car, and that seemed to help some. We were using the vinegar to get rid of what we still thought was just a smell, but vinegar does also kill mold. 

About this time, the yard around the car started smelling like it to. We joked about needing to perform an exorcism, because we had never encountered  a smell that was so difficult to get rid of. 

At the same time, our dog had begun to have respiratory issues. Initial tests at the vet didn't come up with anything, and we noticed that when she was at someone else's house she didn't cough. So we suspect that she's reacting to the same thing my husband is. But I don't react to it at all. 

The smell has spread through most of the yard now. It seems to be strongest in damp areas that don't get a lot of sunlight. And vinegar continues to be the only thing that seems to help. We also figured out that the smell in the vehicle seems to be in the ventilation  system. I didn't even know that mold could live in a car's ventilation system or in a yard until I looked it up. 

Our dog is staying with someone else for now, where she's doing much better. And we've been spraying everything that smells like that with vinegar. It seems to be helping. 

We have not been able to actually see the mold, but it's hard to even pin down exactly where the smell is coming from so it's hard to know exactly where to look for it. 

Our best theory is that the person was carrying mold spores from their travel trailer and the spores got into our vehicle's ventilation system, which is why the smell always seemed to come back so strong after we aired the car out. And it's been spreading from there. 

Could it be a mold issue? And if not, what else could it be? It's way too strong and stubborn to just be a lingering odor.",27Jun2020,2

She's on the older side of parenthood and is guilty of the ""all internet strangers are predators/rapists/murderers"" sort of mentality. There are valid concerns, of course, when you're nine, ten, or eleven making online friendships, but I've always had a good head on my shoulders and been careful about who I talk to and what I share with them.

I'm eighteen now and I feel really guilty for not filling my mom in on all that I'm doing. There are a lot of cool things going on that I'm really proud of. I want to be able to share that with her, but I'm afraid that since these communities are relics of a time when I was supposed to tell my mom about any and all social media I was on, her anger might outweigh her excitement.

I happen to run a fan Discord server for the band we were seeing and a friend I have from that server was standing directly in front of me for the whole show.

We live in a good neighbourhood but our street is kind of secluded from the rest( it isn't on any map, so you wouldn't know of it if you didn't live here or have friends here).Then he heard footsteps and saw a man looking through his bedroom window. I was woken up around 1:46 by my neighbour's dog barking and heard a male voice out in the street and a few minutes later I saw the car speed away, but didn't think much of it at the time(neither me or my brother saw the license plate). However, my parents were alarmed by this because they both work at our local jail and there's been a lot of ex-prisoners murdering some of the officers and their families (thankfully  none in my city but still...creepy). The following night I stayed awake till 3 in the morning and the guy didn't show up again. I also paid attention to all the cars that went through during the day and didn't see his car. I kept a metal bar next to my bed just in case. Also, I think I should mention that my neighbour's house got broken into during the day a year ago and no one saw anything.
What do you think we should do? We can't call the police because they won't take it serious. And we also have 3 useless dogs that don't bark at strangers.",27Jun2020,1

1078,"Turns out an old friend of mine got busted for looking at kiddie porn.  Sent to a minimal security prison for a couple of years- just got out a few months ago.

So, after not speaking to him for years, he emailed asking if I would be able to listen.  I imagine he was in some sort of therapy program in prison and they encouraged him to find supports.  That’s all well and good, but I don’t really know what to do or how to feel about it at this point.

On one hand: what he did is unforgivable.  It’s the worst of the worst, and I can in no way forgive him.  On the other: I’m not sure I need to forgive him to lend a little compassion and listen.  I don’t know- he was always a good guy and a good friend to me before all of this happened.  Not that this excuses anything, but a few years before all this happened, he had a young daughter suffocate and die in her crib after she was put to bed.  It’s fucked up considering what he did, but honestly - he was the best dad I known, and I know losing his daughter really messed him up.  

Anyway- what do I do with all of that?",27Jun2020,1
1081,"So, after two years at my company my boss decided it was time to expand the team I am a part of and add someone to support me with the workload. I’m very happy my boss recognizes we need more people in the team to get the work done and deliver quality. My new team member has been asked specifically to take up more practical tasks that used to be very time consuming for me, and while we are not a very hierarchical company I am supposed to manage him. I’m new to managing. 
While I am very happy with my new team member’s performance he insists on working different hours/days than me because he has to take care of his children on some days. My problem is he calls me all the time to discuss things he needs to do. And he calls me whenever he feels like it. Usually I am very clear on when he can reach me and when I am off work, and of course he calls me all the time outside of my working hours and does not seem to be progressing when I’m not available to offer round the clock feedback. Usually he calls to ask for reassurance about something he is already doing quite well. If I can’t pick up he texts me all his questions. 

I figured I need to instruct him better and try to set some boundaries with regards to the constant calling. I have tried a couple different things; setting a weekly meeting to instruct him about the tasks at hand, being very explicit about when I am available to call, letting him know that he can reach me between x and y hours if he has questions. How do I make sure he performs the job without having to call me multiple times a day?",27Jun2020,1

1085,"Ok so I'm a 24 M here with a Business Degree that opened a few doors but now seems a bit limited that Covid-19 has shut down my former workplace and many of the other places I was applying too. Initially, I wanted to enter into Public Policy (which is still in the realm of possibility) but I do like game design and tech in general, and I think cybersecurity is useful and fascinating. I'm also trying to get into a industry that can not only be easily worked remotely, but will also still have use in the potentially  changed economy in the next few years. I also love telling stories and designing things, and I feel that videogames may become the next great creative medium for fantastical storytelling, but that's just an opinion. 

On the other hand, I believe cybersecurity is terribly important in our day and age, and I would love to help small businesses and companies keep their data secure.

1090,"This girl from school has been speaking to me a lot on ig. I’ll admit I started it because she posted like quite an upsetting personal post about how she was feeling and I didn’t want to just view it and then say nothing so I asked if she was okay and everything and we just carried on messaging and I tried to help her as I’d been feeling the same a while before. We wasn’t that close at school not because of anything really we are just quite different like I’m quiet and she was quite outgoing and would just speak to anyone. My ex best friend hated her because of this and would try and force me to too and not even allow me to talk to her in lesson when we was next to each other and she needed help or I did etc. So I just was never that close with her even when I’d hang around with her close friends. 

Anyways we was speaking a lot on ig nothing like friendship wise just kinda like ah how are you how’s your new school. And then there was a party we both went to (way before lockdown obviously) and we spoke and was both kind of drunk and ended up just around each other all night like hugging pouring each other drinks just being drunk idk. 

The conversation on ig just kept kind of dying and would only start again when I’d ask if she was okay because a post or whatever. This whole time like I still don’t see us as that close or like friends friends if that makes sense. But she messaged me today saying she lowkey loves talking to me and doesn’t want the conversation to die and want to meet after lockdown and stuff. And I don’t want to do that and I feel bad. Honestly it’s because of things I’ve found out from my friend about how she’s treat her and also that she treated BLM as a trend for a day and said nothing since. I’m mixed so have been vocal and it kind of upset me knowing she has a lot of black friends and doesn’t care. I don’t want to ‘get political’ or whatever I just kind of view her differently now and have also seen through text that some things I’ve heard about her are true. I feel like she knows I’ve distanced because of her silence and said all this recently to try ‘win me back’ or like get me to still talk to her everyday idk.

1092,"I will dive right into it. I just finished high school and I realized for most of my 4 years I was attempting to be friends with people that were, excuse my french, assholes. I've been friends with some of them since grammar school but when high school started everything changed. I would sit at their lunch table and hang out with them during the school day but when the weekend came around I would either not get invited anywhere or when I attempted to hang out with them I was more often than not brushed off. I never classified myself as a mean person at all and never had any beef with them, and had a lot in common. 

\-

My first two years weren't the worst of it, as I could sometimes hang with them (usually asking, not invited). Though when my final 2 years came around, more people were throwing parties and they never seemed to invite me. For a short period of time I was actually accepted into their group and would be invited as a group to hang, but that was short lived. A couple weeks after a St. Patrick's Day party I found myself being slowly removed from them, like I was being tested for the group. I wish I could say I was acting out of pocket or just annoying, but that was never the case. I was always in a great mood around them and was down for whatever.

\-

 When I got my drivers license in the beginning of Junior year (3rd year) I was hanging out with them a lot, and while I knew it was because I was transportation we were actually bonding like it wasn't a forced hangout. Once other people started to get their licenses I was seen as obsolete and once again pushed to the side. Eventually by Senior year I found that it wasn't worth trying to hang out with people that didn't want to do the same for whatever reasons and started hanging out with another group. 

\-

That's when COVID hit and quarantine really halted me hanging with the new group, despite them being much more welcoming and literally saying they wanted me to be in their group. So fast forward to now there are graduation parties happening for the failed Senior year and I received a pity invite from one of my ""friends"" I knew since grammar school. I ultimately decided not to go because I haven't been invited, or hung out with any of these kids in months. It's hard to face the fact I was used for a short period of time and then kicked aside, especially when my family members ask why I'm not doing anything. A quick note at the end here: the group is mainly run by a few guys and they're clearly just not good friends for a number of reasons.

1095,"TL;DR :My boyfriend has a need to work way too many hours and The only time I see him is during the school year at school or once every 1-2 weeks in the summer .. just thought since quarantine was over I would actually get to spend time with him before he decided to go back to his workaholic ways. (He doesn’t work because he financially needs to) what can I possibly do about this as it’s quite frustrating for me(I still work as well but managed to carve out more time for him on top of my schooling as well.



My boyfriend has a need to work all the time even though he is very very financially sound to the point he could get a house. He’s raised in a very upper middle class home surrounded by that lifestyle of course and works a shit tone. 

It’s super frustrating for me who works 25 hours a week and goes to school as well (with him might I add) (during school he works only 25h)I love that he has the work ethic and I understand banking as much money as you possibly can. The only thing that really frustrates me is that he doesn’t understand that he’s not even 20 yet and I still want to spend time with him. 

He’s the kind of guy who would drop everything for his friends but doesn’t really seem to understand that sometimes he has to make sacrifices for his girlfriend too. It really bothers me that all I’m asking is that he go away with me for like four days camping and see me at least twice a week and I don’t think that that’s asking way too too much considering it’s the summer and we don’t have school until September.
It’s not like he’s actually mature and it’s not like he can handle anything maturely all he understands is to keep himself busy and not pay attention to anything else but his paycheque it’s super super frustrating and I’m not really sure what to do any advice would be appreciated",27Jun2020,0

Like I'll take any pieces of advice you got, but I'll boil my biggest issues down to a few questions:

1. Am I being paranoid about this? (I kind of feel like if I don't get a little paranoid about this, I'll just default back to never talking to people through my cellphone)
2. What does your conversation look like?
3. How do your conversations start?
