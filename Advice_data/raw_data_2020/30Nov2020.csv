0,"i've heard it's normal for teens to now know who they are, but for me it's deeper than not knowing who my friends are and my personal clothing style. i genuinely dont  know who i am.

 when i look in the mirror i see a stranger looking back at me. and i know that that's who everyone sees and it's what i look like. but it's not me?? idk if this makes sense. my face doesn't look real. my body doesn't look real. nothing about me looks real. i've told my parents about this and they just think im faking for attention, but im literally not. personality-wise i know who i am, but physically i don't. i hope this doesn't sound fake or anything because it's not. i'm at such a loss. i know who people see but i don't recognize her.

i've had this face for my whole life and for as long as i can remember i didn't relate to what i looked at. i need advice because i don't want to go my whole life looking at a stranger in the mirror. please.",30Nov2020,1

For online school my teachers have been giving me an insane amount of homework and I have talked to a lot of other people in the same thing Is happening to them too. I work at Macys currently and I haven‚Äôt been there for very long. This is my third job in total. I‚Äôm usually always working because my parents aren‚Äôt the best and I need money to buy myself necessities and such. I might lose my job or I might have to quit it because of school but I don‚Äôt know what to do because like I said I need necessities like for hygiene, clothes and such. My parents always say I can ask them for things but whenever I do they never get it done. For instance I‚Äôve been telling them for a year now that I need my phone fixed and they never did it but instead got my brother a laptop for his birthday another day. It‚Äôs really frustrating but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know how to make money without a job. I‚Äôm very good at digital art and Or in general I‚Äôm trying to get myself out there but it‚Äôs so hard and no one wants to look at my stuff. I just dont lmow what to do",30Nov2020,1

7,"I (M25) recently moved to a new city about 3 hours from my single mom(48). This year had been hard on her. She‚Äôs taking care of my grandparents who are not doing so well. Her support system where she is, are her sister, my god sister, and my grandparents. Her sister is an alcoholic and has gotten worse sense my uncle commuted suicide. My grandma(hanging on by a thread due to smoking and blood clot issues.) Grandad (heart attack survivor has gone a steep decline in health.) Then my god sister (a girl unrelated she practically adopted that left my life to go do drugs but got clean after having a baby.) 

Now today she messages me saying she can‚Äôt do it anymore she‚Äôs tired of doing all the work of taking care of my grandparents. Taking care of her sister and she just can‚Äôt do it all anymore. I assure her I‚Äôm sorry I moved away, but I‚Äôm only a call away. I could be there for her to vent or do anything she needs. She replies again that she just can‚Äôt do it and that it‚Äôs not fair. I reply again that I didn‚Äôt even know she felt that way and I‚Äôd love to be the person she talks to. I‚Äôd visit on the weekends if she wants or whatever. She then replies again that she does ‚Äúall the work constantly and she‚Äôs tired‚Äù I didn‚Äôt reply this time. 

I‚Äôm at wits end she has this god daughter she raves about and how she‚Äôs going to give half of her stuff to them. I don‚Äôt get upset that she adds all this pressure to my relationship to have children. I don‚Äôt complain that my god sister chose drugs and partying over going to school like she engraved into me. I‚Äôm just at wits end like what does she want from me?

10,"In the past couple months my mum has made home life hell for me and my step dad. She is constantly angry, she has mood swings like you wouldn't believe, you don't know if when you wake up in the morning if she will be in a good mood or bad mood. Spoiler alert it is almost always bad mood. I've changed a lot I've done to try and help her mood. Like do extra jobs around the house, not argue with her, ask if she ever needs help etc. But alas nothing helps. She does suffer with depression but she refuses to take medication for it. She is bringing this on herself in my opinion, she does hate her job and she is constantly bringing that hate home with her at night. Talking to her is like talking to a brick wall, she will say what she think I wanna hear just to shut me up but I always keep going in saying what I need to say anyways. She hated her life so much and it's made life for my step dad and me miserable. It's gotten to the point that I get scared when she pulls into the drive way at night. I need help. Please. My mental health is already bad and my stepdads isn't great either. Please give me some way to fix this.",30Nov2020,1
12,"In my teenage years I (16 then) had a relationship, where I felt anxious that my partner would cheat on me. So I would check up every time when she said ""goodnight"" if she went offline. Most of the time she would still appear online later on the evening. One night she left her Skype logged in on my PC, so I checked some of her chats. Turned out she did cheat on me with multiple guys.....Ouch! Heart broken.

So yea my first relationship gave me trust issues.... and I dont know how to fix this.

So after a while I gave it a go again, because I thought I was ready. It felt right atleast in my heart, but my mind still wants to check every now and then. 

At the moment I can control myself from not doing it, but I dont know for how long...

I also get jealous whenever my partner has fun with other people, when I deep inside me know that I will have fun with her too...



I guess long story short.
I am too fixated on my partner rather then my personal life. Because of trust issues in the past....",30Nov2020,1

One of his friends knows my friend so somehow he found out that I'm still hooking up with my ex so now he's going around telling people that we couldn't have sex because I wouldn't stop talking about my ex, I should say that my friend and I do talk about our exes a lot and his other friend, the one in common, is his housemate, so he has probably heard us talking before.

What should I do about this?, I've honestly never dealt with such an immature man in this kind of interaction so I don't know exactly how to react. I told my friends what happened and they laughed but I'm a bit annoyed about this.",30Nov2020,1

15,"I'm not going to write a huge long backstory. I have some hangups from how i was raised and have realized that much what I was taught was incorrect. Women like sex not just men, not all men are animals who just want to fuck everything, there is nothing wrong with watching porn or masturbating, not all nudity is porn, ect. On a mental level I believe everything i just said, however there is still this emotional resistance which shows its head at times.

Sometimes I'll watch porn and just feel like there is a dark cloud hanging over me, sometimes I'll just kinda decide ""you know.... i don't think I'm going to masturbate for a while"" instead of the usual once every day or so (even though I want to).

Despite being in my 20's having a sex drive still feels like a dark secret, I never had a lot of luck with romance when younger and things just never ""happened naturally"". I put up the pretense that I was a good person who wouldn't ever have sex outside marriage much less look at that dirty porn stuff. The result is sexual desires have a hidden secret tinge to them in my mind and I so wish I could openly talk about and experience them with someone.

I wish I could find a community (especially online) where I would be accepted, where sexual behavior was encouraged and I would be accepted without judgement for my lack of experience, huge desire, and just general nervousness would be accepted. This subreddit is great for information but its personal interactions that will help me move past this weird emotional hangup.

I can't help but remember when I was younger. I was scared of heights and so I learned to rock climb in order to overcome my fear. When I went to the gym there were people there who had been doing it a long time and saw that I was new, and they helped show me the ropes. When would get nervous about being up really high they would encourage me and remind me they were holding the rope and I literally couldn't fall, and just all around encouraged me and congratulated me when I climbed that hard route and finally nailed it. we would hangout and talk about climbing, and really got to know each other. Its silly but, damn I wish I had that type of environment to explore sex in, where I could be open about my struggles, but explore them in an understanding community full of emotional support. Of course that doesn't exist and its just a daydream but I can't help but wish it, I'm not really sure what to do at this point.",30Nov2020,1
16,"I work in a nursing home and ill try to keep it vague cause patient privacy. Basically every single resident in my house tested positive except for two. So, 10/12.

I was curious because a professor of mine made the following statement of "" The most significant change in our society has been the advancement towards a more inclusive society in the greater acceptance of African Americans, of Hispanics and of LGBTQs community.¬† This has been more important, say, than advances in space exploration, or the need to respond to threat of climate change, or even the advances in medicine.¬†"" It is our duty as students, to get a response from somebody who is willing to answer these four simple questions based on this statement.   Questions: 1. What two factors to led to your response? 2. What revolutions would you NOT support? 3. How would you explain this to anybody else? 4. What is your plan to keep that change flowing.  Good luck and thank you so much in advance. God bless.  Psalms 100:5-9",30Nov2020,1
21,"Three months ago my dad told me that he wanted to get a divorce from my mom because she had been having a 20 year affair with another man. My brother told me that my dad told him this a year ago. So, he brought this up to my mom for the first time last year. She say's she tried to prove her innocence. She even went to the school she had gone to 20 years ago to ask them for video cameras and documentation. She told my dad to take out whatever money he needed to hire a PI, a cop, anyone to investigate. My dad did end up hiring a PI to investigate. My dad says he has proof but won't show it to us. First he would say he wouldn't share it just because, then he would share it when he was ready, then he wouldn't share it because he didn't want to, and now he won't share it because he doesn't trust us. 

He told me that I can't trust my mom and I need to be careful because she's going to try and introduce this man (I'm a girl). He told my brother he's worried about my mom taking me to this man and what they may do. He's said that my mom is doing this to steal all of our money. He's said that my mom has been trying to kill him for the past year, so he won't eat any of her cooking. My brother and I have been eating her cooking and we're fine, so I doubt that. 

Two days ago he walked in a showed me a bullet and said that this guy had left it on the window of his car. When we said to call the police he refused. He said he absolutely would not. When my brother and I said that we would call the cops he told us to do whatever but he wasn't going to give us the bullet and we had no proof. He's said multiple times that he's going to report my mom to the police for different things. Whenever my brother and I have told him to do so, he's always changed his mind and said no. He wouldn't even let us call them. 

My mom has denied the whole thing. I'm inclined to believe my mom because she's never had the opportunity. My parents are immigrants and came here when they were old so they grew up with a very old fashioned mentality. My mom doesn't go out without my dad. My dad calls to check on her. He calls me and my brother to check on her. He calls my brother and I and asks us to call her if she doesn't pick up when he's called her. He's driven by her work to make sure she's there. He constantly checks their bills and bank accounts and wants her to account for what she's spent. She spends all of her time at home cooking and cleaning. The only times she would go out in the winter was to savers which is a thrift store. In the summer she spends her whole time gardening in the yard. She doesn't visit her parents without my dad. She doesn't have girlfriends she goes out with because my dad doesn't like it. He would check her phone every single night and she wouldn't care. They share the same email and bank account. I don't know how she would be able the opportunity to have an affair let alone have one. 

A month after he told me for the first time he apologized to my mom the night they signed the divorce papers and wrote a separation agreement. But he still acted angry for a month. Then his anger seemed to disappear and everything went back to normal. It was like nothing had ever happened. Then a few weeks ago he snuck up into my room and took the separation agreement from my drawer without telling me. A few days after that he told my mom he was leaving her and told my brother and I that he had decided to leave my mom. I told him that was perfectly fine. He still hasn't filled the paperwork. He's still talking about finding proof. He still won't show it to us. 

I don't know what to believe anymore. Whenever I think about it on my own I realize that my dad sounds paranoid without any hard evidence to back up his claims. His stories are constantly changing within minutes. He keeps asking my brother and I to talk to my mom for him. First it was to tell her to get rid of the separation agreement, then it was to convince her not to get an attorney because they could solve it themselves, and then today it was to ask her to right a document saying if she's lying my brother, my dad, and I get everything and if she's not lying then it's the reserve. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father and I have fought over his refusal to show us proof or to proceed with the divorce so many times. At one point he was even saying he's going to pretend it's all good and not proceed with the divorce so he can find proof. At another point he asked me to hire a PI. He told my brother and I that if we were basically mature children we would investigate and find out the truth. Every conversation I leave with my dad I feel guilty, angry, sad, and so confused. It's like I don't know up or down anymore. He's good at making himself the victim and everyone else the bad guy. In the middle of writing this he had my brother and I come down to type out a paper of a conversation he had with my mom where he basically asked her about knowing this guy and her saying no. Then he had everyone, including my brother and I, sign it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just hoping for an outsiders perspective on the whole situation. Either way writing this out made me feel a little better.",30Nov2020,1

23,"Me and my partner have a very close family friend (almost like an uncle) who has been given weeks to live, we‚Äôre not sure if he will be around by Christmas but we still want to get him something because we don‚Äôt want to assume the worst and then come Christmas he could (hopefully) still be here and we‚Äôve got him nothing, but on the other hand he‚Äôs already started organising where all of his belongings will go when he does pass away so we don‚Äôt want to get him more to worry about in that respect. He‚Äôs really special to us and usually we would buy him a few presents between us but since getting ill he is unable to get his upper body wet and is mostly unable to eat solid foods (he occasionally eats chocolate and weetabix and other softer foods) he is a huge formula one and car enthusiast and usually we would buy him car accessories, some nice Christmassy food and some more expensive shower products but this year all of those things aren‚Äôt really possible.

24,"I posted an ad on Craigslist for our new addition to our family (domestic long hair mix) to be adopted to a good home for $100. This will include her current food, up to date shots, paperwork, carrier, and food bowls.

She is so uncomfortable around our current cat after a gradual introduction (smelling each other eating through the same door, screened viewing of each other). Our first cat just follows her around out of curiosity. If we aren‚Äôt around them to separate them, she seems intimidated to go to her food bowls and box, though she‚Äôll make a dash for it when she has to eat or go. All the while she will hiss at him if he is close to her because he is 3x bigger. They have not physically fought, but it has been two weeks of those kind of interactions since we have had her.

Otherwise she sleeps all day (she‚Äôs a senior cat) and plays at night with me when she is more awake, by chasing feathers. 

A woman said she is interested in adopting, after I stated all this in the post: ‚ÄúShe is loving, and she needs to be the center of affection and attention in her new home. Has lived with both cats and dogs in the past, but has become uncomfortable around and fearful of other cats (hisses and avoids). That is why she needs to be preferably the only pet for someone who can give her a safe, comfortable place to live. You must be gentle with her, and she will warm right up to you. She loves napping by the sunlight in the day time, and playing with feathers. Particular to hard food, and she is litter box trained. Serious inquiries only. She is extremely lovely and has received many compliments, and I can send photos upon request.‚Äù

Any recommendations on if you think (from experience) if she‚Äôll ever come around or warm up to our first cat? My husband would love for her to stay and thinks it will just take time, but I had posted the ad when it was at the peak of tension between the cats. 
The lady seems really nice and is a nurse practitioner so I think it gives me hope that she‚Äôll provide her a good home. I‚Äôm having second thoughts because I want it to work out with us, but still want what is best for her.",30Nov2020,1
25,"For context, I developed feelings for him however our relationship remained completely platonic. There was and is no chance we could ever be together for reasons I will not get into. I poured my heart out to this guy (all except for my feelings). I told him myself that I was afraid to open up to him because I was afraid he was going to leave, just like every one else has. He looked me in the eyes and said that would not happen. About a year later he gets a girlfriend and I slowly started losing him. I sent him an angry letter summer 2019 explaining my hurt and never heard from him again. I messaged him and called him multiple times and heard nothing. 

Every time I was put in the position of opening up and being vulnerable, he would pop into my head and Most of the time I would keep to myself. This might not seem like much, but it‚Äôs been such a mental toll on me. Luckily I started therapy and I have healed a lot, and now I‚Äôm in a loving relationship. I have fought with myself so hard in trusting my boyfriend and I‚Äôve made so much progress. 

But today he reached out to me. He said that he‚Äôs sorry it took so long to reach out, he‚Äôs had a lot of ups and downs. And now he‚Äôs asking about how I am, my family, and things I‚Äôm involved in. I was really excited at first and I was so ready to talk to him and apologize and rekindle and catch up. I even asked him if he could call because I want to apologize. He said that we can go get food and both of us can apologize then. 

Now, few hours later, I‚Äôm feeling very apprehensive. First off, I‚Äôm afraid of being hurt again. But mostly, I‚Äôm afraid that I am going to get attached to him again and it‚Äôs going to effect my relationship. Which I do not want at all.

26,"It was a very tight road, a parked car on the left, another vehicle trying to get through on the right. The moving car on the right stopped to let me through, and in my attempt, I heard a scraping noise. My driving instructor and the other driver got out to inspect the damage, of which there was none, and we drove off. 

I keep having thoughts like what if there was damage and the other driver didn't see it? What if the scraping noise was actually hitting the parked car? It didn't help that the owner of the parked car came out of the house right after, whom I knew. I just feel embarrassed mostly, but stressed at possible further consequences. 

I'm trying to think of ways I could have avoided this incident, but the only way I can think would be to avoid the situation entirely. I don't think there was any way I could have made it through without scraping somebody, and I feel slightly upset that the other driver didn't make any attempt to prevent it by reversing or something, especially since I am still trying to learn.",30Nov2020,1

After my father‚Äôs parents died he began hoarding, this has been going on for around 5 years and my life has been hell, its not as bad as the TV show Hoarders but my house is embarrassing to be in or have my friends in. My mother snapped when my grandfather died, having her family break apart she would take all of her stresses out on me in my brother(21) in any way she could, she would body shame us, threaten to stop paying for my music lessons, hold our private education about our heads when we never asked for it.

So, my parents always break up, ever since I was like a toddler, it's been on going for... ever. It used to really bother me when I was a younger ( I'm 15 now ) but eventually I stopped caring, and I tried convincing my mom to break up with my dad because of how he acted, for example: He is a very jealous person, he shouts a lot, he uses people for money/steals, he shouts at people who doesn't do what he wants, he gets upset if he and my mom doesn't have intercourse ( his words ), he accuse my mom of incest with her nephew, he is homophobic and called james charles ( a ytuber i watch ) a faggot and my sister is gay so he called her it too, she's our half sister, different dad so he always wanted her to leave because she interfered with their relationship apparently, and he used her to be a deal him weed from her friends, he speeds with us in the car, laugh whenever he hurt us too hard, hit our dogs The list goes on and on, honestly. So basically ( sorry this is dragging I have a thing with worrying about missing details lol sorry ) eventually they broke up and my mom is with a new guy from america lol, so... everything was fine, he was being ok like... it was ok. He moved out. But soon after we started going to see him like day trips out with him, and he complained about my mom, called himself the victim, etc etc more shitty things, but it was enough to handle, I was able to handle it. My little brother tagged along and he was able to handle it too because we were used to it ( He did it to us when they broke up when we were young ) so, one night my mom and I had an argument, a very normal one may I add and my mom stayed in complete control, ( my mom isn't bad, she definitely isn't perfect but she does her best ) and I went to my dads, BAD IDEA FYI. Ok, so I told him what happened and he basically told me that 1. She's a narcissist ( he says that because my mom called him it all the time ) 2. She doesn't love me and that she only loves my sister 3. That she's a manipulative liar 4. She used to sleep with men cause she was a whore 5. She used to flirt with other men ( Idk why he would tell me that ) 6. She only cares about herself. Blah blah blah, basically saying she hates me, she lies to me and that she's a whore. He also said he would love to hit her right now and showed me like 3 hours of bad liar mother trait videos shit like that  in which I realized my mom had none of the traits.  After this he continues to call my mom crazy, a bitch, stupid for leaving him, like overtime he continues to. Whenever we see him he would complain and complain about how lonely he is and how we should think about him and how we need to love him more and that mom was crazy for leaving him because he is the best she would ever have ( He calls himself an amazing person really often, like 10 times a day which I find kinda weird but ok ) Ok, so I think you got an idea. But, the thing is I still love my dad and I don't know what to do. He helps my mom out with money just calls her names behind her back, he says he loves us me and my brother so much he would kill himself without us, idk I feel so stuck because I don't know how to reply to him anymore, he won't stop. I don't want him to kill himself, I don't want him to feel alone and worthless but I also can't stand around and act like he is a victim and like he has done nothing wrong and is "" such an nice guy "" when he clearly has not been. I'm so confused. Is this seriously how dads are supposed to be because if so then I don't want one.",30Nov2020,1

33,"Well, the plan for tomorrow is I will meet with my two of my friends because I need to sign on an updated agreement on my insurance plan. Aside from meeting them, my parents agreed for a short hangout with them despite the covid season. The problem is, my friend forgot the papers and its a holiday tomorrow in my country, so he can't get the papers in the insurance company.

So one of my friend propose for a short hangout with me tomorrow then by Tuesday, my friend will drop by to my house and let me sign the updated papers. So I asked my parents permission and even though the agenda changed, they still agreed. But they propose a new meeting time. Instead of original 10am, it will be 11am instead.

Then one of my friend did not respect it when I told him we will meet around 11 am. He told me he will drop by to my house around 10:30am even though I told him the first time it will be by 11am meeting time instead. Then I made it clear to him that I am allowed by 11am already, not 10:30am. He said ok

Sometimes, some of my friends does not respect what I have told them especially what my parents told me despite this covid season. I mean frankly, they are the one who forgot the papers for me to sign on and it my parents graciously allowed me to hangout with them still even if it is just a short one. Then they act like they did not appreciate it. They even try to change the meeting time and did not even respect my parents.

34,"I don't have a specific problem that makes me this way, I'm just a weird and awkward person in general. I think it's mainly because I don't understand people's emotions and can't relate to them. 

The only thing keeping people from perceiving me as a complete weirdo is that I'm good looking. If it weren't for that, then people would probably think i'm some sort of school shooter based on their stereotypes.

I've watched some of Mo1stKr1t1kal's videos on how he was a weirdo in college, and I realized that I'm not that far off.

I don't have any friends, I don't share similar interests with anyone, and I don't like being around other people due to fear or laziness. I feel torn between not wanting to talk to anyone and not wanting to feel lonely.

40,"This just happened today.

I had something to do and woke up much earlier than usual and went out. Came home around 1 or 2 pm and for some reason there was a candle lit and an overpowering aroma of what can only be described as air fresheners lingering throughout the apartment. I thought it was a little strange, but not too unusual. Both of my roommates are generally clean and occasionally light one nice smelling candle.

Used to computer for a bit and then had to use the bathroom. It's a small bathroom and as I was peeing my eyes shifted to notice a small brown clump on the floor in the shower. I thought it was a large cockroach at first because it wasn't huge, but I kept looking and I horrifying thought to myself ""...is that... shit...?"" I stupidly looked closer when I finished peeing and instantly got a whiff of the unmistakable scent of shit through my nostrils even overpowering the 'air freshener smell' that had clearly been used in the bathroom recently.

To be fair, it wasn't a bad looking shit. It was small and looked like the poop of a healthy dog rather than a human sized chunk, but I still gagged a little, washed my hands thoroughly in the kitchen instead of the bathroom and went to my room. I was tired, and although the thought of the evil shower poo hung in my mind, I slowly drifted off to sleep.   


I woke up about a two hours ago from a very long nap and knew I needed to pee. I carefully opened my bedroom door and warily slunk towards the bathroom. I hesitated at the door, but mustered the courage and stepped inside. My eyes instantly shifted towards the shower, which now had the curtain fully drawn closed. Like in a horror film, I cautiously drew back the curtain, but was relieved to see the offending poo no where in sight and no lingering odious odors.

My question now is, how do I move past this? I feel like I just got PTSD from the shower. I'm sure I won't be comfortable using it tomorrow. Secondly, do I bring this up with my roommates? They are generally clean and good guys normally, but we aren't really close. I do wonder what might be going through their minds. Is it possible the offending roommate left the poo, then my other roommate saw it as well? Maybe my other roommate suspects me rather than the true offender? Also, what does the offender think? Surely he must have realized when he cleaned the poo that it's possible one or both of us might have seen his dirty little secret. Maybe he is worried about it himself and wondering what is going through our minds?",30Nov2020,1

42,"So I wont talk about where he gambles because its in a video game and it will just add confusion. Overall, my online friend (21M) is in a bad routine that is making him very depressed. He works, gets paid, and gambles away his whole check. Usually he loses it all, but sometimes he does well for a few days but in the end he always loses it and gets super sad. His relationship with his family is horrible over it. All I know is that his family tries to take his money and spend it before he can but I dont think that happens much anymore because he still gambles a lot.

I want to help him but Idk how. He has told me that he sees a therapist but idk if thats actually helping. He's at the point where he has sold almost everything valuable he has, and even begs his friends for money to gamble (which includes me). You dont understand, he has described winning as a ""high"" like he gets so happy when he wins. Gambling changes him. He can be super happy but when its over he gets super sad and begs and talks about suicide.

48,"I know the title is a bit cryptic and I'm sorry about that, but I'm trying to keep this as brief as I can. 

I'll call him Kenny.

Kenny and I are friends,been talking for a month I think? almost everyday until around the start of the month, friends only because I'm not really ready for a relationship and my feelings are...a bit confusing, but we talked and even though we technically like each other, we can't really be in a relationship. We talked normally for a few days afterwards and out of nowhere he ghosts me, leaves me on delivered for 3 weeks. Since november 8th. And I know it sounds really stupid, this is my first experience with someone that likes me and I like back and we haven't talked for a long time at all, but we have had such a strong conection, I feel like we have known eachother for years and I just need a bit of advice right now...

At first I was angry, he did this before, left me on delivered for a day, but always messaged me back after a while and apologised, happened 2 times before,and those 2 times I didn't mind and instantly moved on, but he promised he wouldn't anymore and would communicate with me when he needed some time by himself. But he just...ghosted me. 3 weeks have passed amd I'm not even angry anymore, I'm just.... confused, and disappointed, and sad.

 I knew from the moment I saw him that i liked him, and from the moment we started talking I knew that nothing is gonna come out of it and to not get my hopes up,not because of him, but because I'm pretty young and this is my first experience with relationships so I didn't expect this to go anywhere, but I wanted to give him a chance, I wanted to be hopeful and optimistic and have expectations, which backfired, because now I'm a sore loser who can't get their mind off of it. 

I keep thinking if I did something wrong, but I did everything right, I really thought he...y'know, wanted my company? Appreciated it? But I guess he didn't, and I'm just...I'm mad at myself, for letting people close, for not minding my own bussines. I play tough, I always have the upper hand, but when it comes to relationship I'm just so...clueless? So awkward and weird and all i try to do is communicate and be there for people, and it works! 

But then things like these happen which leave me so dumbfounded, because they are so sudden and out of place, and what hurts most is the fact that I have no clue about it, he just ditched me like that, and whats funnier is that I AM the one who let it happen.

So, I guess what I'm asking is, my curiousity is eating me from the inside out, I really wanna message him and ask ""Why did you ghost me like that? You broke your promise"", but at the same time I just want to wait and wait for the moment he either messages me back or we see each other face to face and I can get the chance to tell him ""Why did you message me? Quite the nerve for someone who can't keep a promise"" . 

I wanna be cold and tough but I'm also curious and hurt. I...I was always cold,  y'know? I always tried to let people see only a mere surface level of me, only see what i wanted them to see and to mold myself and my approach depending on who I was talking to, but I was honest with him, because I liked him, I opened up and he did too, but he just pushed me away, just like that, and as much as I hate to admit it, it broke my heart.

I'm sorry for the long text, there is really no one I can talk to about this and I just felt like pouring my heart out here. Should i message him?",30Nov2020,1
49,"Hi,

Basically, my dog has stopped breastfeeding her puppies and the puppies can eat regular food now. The thing is that when I feed the puppies, my dog comes and takes their food because she is hungry and I don't feed her much now that she stopped breastfeeding. Well, I made it to where she can't get their food. 

Honestly, I'm kind of disappointed in how selfish she is. I'm prioritizing feeding the puppies over her, and due to the fact there is little dog food, so she gets almost nothing. It sucks but the puppies are more important.

Will there be any repercussions for the puppies if their mother is hungry? Do they still need her if she stopped breastfeeding?

Okay so I‚Äôve (26) have always had some emotional problems. My youth wasn‚Äôt easy. And my parents dealing with their own issues just let me cope with material items instead of therapy. Story of every millennial‚Äôs life. 
Well now it‚Äôs starting to cause some serious issues. I had to recently come off oral contraceptive due to the symptoms becoming unbearable. Well now I‚Äôm off birth control to find my ‚Äúnatural‚Äù mind state. And it still sucks. Iv been very angry and have had no motivation. And not fun to be around as people have told me but I feel like I‚Äôm normal. But if I can‚Äôt communicate with other how can that be normal? 

It does effect my relationship at home to the point my husband (25) starts feeling the same way and amplifies my mood. So I just really want something to help me on the bad days. I have gone thought different holistic certifications that have touched on ways to control this mind state but these methods have not been beneficial to me on my own.

Prior my doctor recommended mild SSRIs and for a while I wasn‚Äôt interested in them thinking I‚Äôm going to do this the natural way! I‚Äôll eat right and exercise and everything will fall into place. But it hasn‚Äôt.

Any advice on experiences while taking SSRIs or other items for mood disorders would be sick. 

Also here the catch, my husband is not happy with the idea of me taking a pharmaceutical. He has negative experiences with them as a a kid and from that point in will not think otherwise about them. 
But I‚Äôm so worried about my mental state. I have already quit my job and I constantly embellished the negatives in my relationships to the point where I accidentally push people away because I‚Äôm ashamed.

60,"hi! i have just had a long conversation about my sisters self-harming around an hour ago and i made a post about it. im not here to say to you 'please stop, you're destroying your body' or make you feel bad about this. im guessing you use SH as a way of coping with something? a punishment? an addiction? etc. and its hard for you to just stop, and it will take time.

telling your parents will be really hard and may make you feel even worse, or it may feel like a weight being lifted off your shoulder. with that being said, if your mother being angry will make you feel even worse then dont tell her, only tell her if she will actually help you (maybe being sent away will help in some ways). im not saying keep this to yourself because it will just get worse, but please tell someone you trust and that you know will understand you. theres nothing worse than telling someone something and them making you feel worse about your problem or even making it to do with themselves. sometimes you may feel like you have no one to tell but trust me when i say this, there are people out there who will help you and understand everything youre going through. no one really understands unless they have been through it themselves but they can try to understand.

i suggest taking positive advice from people off here and see how that works but in general, getting a therapist who knows what they're doing will be helpful. maybe go onto 'kooth' and talk to a therapist online if you find it hard to find someone in real life without your mother knowing. will telling friend help you, or do you have anyone else in your family that can help you? talking to someone about this is the best option instead of keeping it to yourself.

71,"14f. this ended up being long as fuck. sorry in advance. 

So I've been wondering about my sexuality for a couple of months now. 

 I'd basically accepted that I'm ace by this point. I'd never felt any attraction or crushes. (I told everyone I liked 2 people because my perception of what 'liking' someone is was different. it's most definitely not forcing yourself to think about them enough to the point of crushing anxiety because people would think badly of you if you had never crushed on anyone.) 

so at this stage my denial phase of being ace was kind of receding. I didn't want to deal with the romantic repercussions of admittance, however I'd never felt shit similar to everybody else so there wasn't much to bounce off of anymore.

 I wasn't ready to go anywhere near aro despite not having romantic feelings either, so that was for the future.

 I assumed that, or just late bloomer status. whatever felt right each day. 

then last month I had the briefest attraction to a woman online. she was a terrible person but very pretty. so I quickly got out of her insta because no way no way am I gay nope absolutely not. 

it didn't leave my brain for days. that little second where my heart jumped at her photo was all it took to crash the wall of 'demisexual/romantic/all of the above' to the ground. it never happened again at her photos (they weren't sexual or anything. it's one of those conservative people.) and im almost disgusted looking at them now. it's obvious the person panders so incels, so I'm indifferent. 

So that was the only attraction I've felt in my entire life, and it lasted for about half a second before being shut down. also ruined the barriers that were in my head, but I chalked it up to just finding her really pretty in the end. calmed down after a few weeks and figured I was still ace as long as that didn't happen again. a fluke, that's all it was. 


and then one day last week on my phone I was on snap and a meme page had one of those models at the end, to get clicks. I stared because there wasn't anything else to look at before the stories switched. 

for the very briefest, quarter second, I felt sexually attracted to her. that has never happened before.  it hasn't happened again despite there being those ladies on the person's story every day. I don't know what the fuck that blip was. 

it sent me spiraling. I'm so confused because now this technically means I've felt romantic and sexual attraction to anotjer woman but theres no fucking way I'm gay. it lasted for less than a second. it can't count. i dont get the nervous feeling in my chest looking at a girl unless I think for a second what I find pretty about her. I don't find anything cute about the opposite sex. 

 my mind races thinking about the implications but my chest isn't panicking. it's completely calm like this has already been accepted for some reason when I say no. I don't wanna have to deal with all this. it's too much but my brain won't let go anymore. 

Im sorry this was so long. it's most of my thoughts laid out to dry. I'll try to answer any questions if there's one. I just don't know what the fuck is happening. my brain has rolled 50 miles an hour for like 4 years but never steered in this direction. I'm just. eggh.",30Nov2020,1

i‚Äôve always had a deep shame about my body, even when i was at a normal weight. it might‚Äôve had something to do with the fact that i‚Äôm a trans guy, but i‚Äôve always just hated it. i felt like i was too curvy, too feminine. i was known as the weird girl with huge tits.

i always say that my binge eating developed from the same beginning as anorexia; i feel the same way they do, but it‚Äôs especially difficult because i lack self-discipline and it‚Äôs not like people can tell me i‚Äôm not fat. i definitely am.

i feel like an abomination.

this past wednesday, i got a call from my doctor on my way to work. my blood tests came back showing i had high cholesterol, fatty liver, and dangerously low vitamin d. she then told me to see her in 3 months followed by a very awkward ‚Äúhappy thanksgiving.‚Äù

i was completely crushed, and the cycle began again. i started starving myself again, and i would just binge later, right? well, i did binge a couple days later, yesterday in fact. however, this time it was different. i grabbed a toothbrush while my parents weren‚Äôt home and threw everything up. my throat still fucking burns.

i‚Äôve been eating about 1300 calories a day in total, so i‚Äôm not exactly starving myself. my main problem is once i start eating, i can‚Äôt stop, so i don‚Äôt really eat in the morning.

i know i should probably be worried, but honestly? i‚Äôm not. i‚Äôm morbidly obese, maybe i should just wait until i‚Äôm at a lower weight to recover. it sounds fucked up, but it‚Äôs not like anyone will care. people love to see fat people losing weight.

anyway, idk what to do. i‚Äôve already managed to lose some weight and it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs ever worked for me. i just need some guidance because i feel like i‚Äôm the only person who‚Äôs ever been in this situation and i feel like no one else knows what to do.",30Nov2020,1

75,"I (16 M) am transgender and have pretty bad anxiety and depression. Lately, there's been a lot of talk of colleges and I am supposed to start applying to schools fall of next year. I kind of want a service dog (or other service-trained animal) to take to college so that I can have a pet with me in my dorm room. I have never lived without a pet, specifically dogs, and get very anxious when away from my dogs for the day. I'm terrified of being alone and if all goes to plan, I'll be going to college in New York, which is a large, loud city. 

My parents, however, do *not* want me to get a service dog. They are firm in their belief that if I got a service dog, everyone around me would immediately judge me and I would have less opportunities than my colleagues. I don't know if I would call my anxiety and depression *debilitating*, but I've also never been so far from my support network (I would be 5+ hours away from parents and friends, 30 or so minutes from nearest family, but I don't know them well).

76,"I'll spare you the booring details.

The important things are:
Im a relaxed, calm, composed person that gets along with everyone. I never scream or get into fights.

Moral of the story is that I tend to date alot of people with autism. Idk why but due to shit that's been happening im thinking about this.

I met... let's call them j at a institution in my youth. J was interested and cute and I enjoyed the company. J offered good and services which I declined because j was a little to high energy crazy for my liking.

Fast forward 3 years and we meet up, trade bodily fluids, end up dating.

So here I am kind of content but seeing the issues. J is super socially awkward like they will openly make themselves the center of the conversation with their sad life story while we're all talking about diner. Makes you kind of want to smack j. As a result everyone in my life hates and doesen't want to be around j because j is rather anoying whenever in proximity to other people. Hence i live kind of 2 lives a social one and a romantic one.

J also generally seems to have maybe age regression arround me which makes it feel like I'm seeing a child sometimes. Js personality just gets me down sometimes.

I feel like I might be in it for the benefits of being in a relationship. Honestly I do like j and maybe a key thing here is that we are both into bdsm. Its kinda hard to find a parter like that.

I suppose I just feel like shit because I'm not really sure if I want to keep this as a permanent settup. I plan to enlist in the next year and I suppose this would be the time to end it if i was going to. But im not one to use people.

I know this is long and I dont really expect any advice just wanted to see what other people think.

Other than j's personality we dont ever fight or anything they are just generally alot to handle and its just too draining sometime to deal with such high energy.",30Nov2020,1

89,"So, this'll be a long one. A lot of it is me venting. I might be overreacting, but I want to be prepared with what to say tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

To begin, I started my job as a Dental Processor Technician about two and a half months ago. Prior to this I had experience making custom trays and bite rims, but little else, so aside from knowing how to work a lathe and a handpiece I was virtually new to this job.

In addition to my expected role of pouring models, trimming and articulating them, then processing waxed-up dentures, I've also been learning how to do some waxing myself, as well as finishing. This is largely due to me being the only other person in the lab beside my manager, so it's become apparent that it's necessary I learn how to do more than my hired role in order to help her out. Which is...odd, in a way. Don't get my wrong, I love gaining more experience, but I'm baffled as to why they hired on a Processor Technician with little experience when they really needed an experienced Full Dental Technician.

My manager. Let's call her Tammy. She's one great big negative bubble. She talks horribly about people behind their backs, treats her kids horribly (even boasts about smacking them around), and flat out ignores me at times when I have questions. She can be nice, but it's fleeting. And she's very, very accusatory. When I make a mistake, rather than teaching me how NOT to do it again, or even how to fix it, she'll accuse me of not knowing what I'm doing. I mean...yeah? I don't know what I'm doing, I'm new at this.

Anyway.

2 and a half months. That's how long I've been at this. I've had to learn a lot, and there's still a lot for me to learn.

I make mistakes.

Not a lot, but given I'm new, they're bound to happen, and I do what I can to prevent them. But they happen. The fact of the matter is, if I mess up, it usually falls to Tammy to fix things. I'm not given much opportunity to FIX my mistakes as Tammy tends to take things onto herself and not let me help her out. I observe, but am not allowed to put it into practice. 

So, if I mess up, it creates more work for Tammy. And I can't do anything to help out when it happens. I don't feel like she trusts me to help. Doesn't matter how apologetic I am.

Last Tuesday I made two mistakes. One was due to the delicate process that, well, processing is, and the other was a total human error. In neither case was I given a chance to fix them, despite being capable of it. Tammy either told me no or ignored my offers to help.

That night after work I got a text from her not to come in the next day. Long story short, she had talked to the dentist and they agreed that my mistakes create more work for Tammy. I was not to come in that Wednesday. That just makes me think they feel like I cause more trouble than I'm worth. Or, it was because it was a short day as the dentist would be leaving after lunch. I tend to think of the worst.

Obviously last week was Thanksgiving so what should've been a 4 day weekend became 5. I was told we would talk about it on Monday. Tomorrow.

The dentist and Tammy are fairly tight knit. The whole office is, really. I've felt like an outsider since day one.

I have no idea what all Tammy told the dentist, but she HAS thrown me under the bus in the past (claiming she'd told me to do something, then blaming me when it never got done. Or when a machine needed to be cleaned more often, but I only learned about it when she berated me for not doing it).

I fully expect to either get fired, or at the very least, threatened with being fired. I've already been threated with it once (when I was there about a month and a half) for not being proficient in what really is delicate work. I broke down crying that day to the dentist and poured my heart out, wondering why I was even there when they really needed a veteran Technician. Why did they hire me, with little experience, then turn around expecting me to not only pick up this role in a month, but be also perfectly proficient at it AND the things I was NOT hired to do?

Nothing changed.

**What I would like to know is...what to say?** Especially if I am on my way out? Should I document this meeting? I've really tried my best with this job. I don't think it's reasonable for me to be expected to not make mistakes when I've only being doing this for two and a half months. Nevermind the fact that I'm having to learn things that aren't part of my hired role, and quickly too. I can do them, but I'm not very quick, or even that great at it, and those facts plague me as well.

I need this job. I lost my original Dental Technician job due to Covid and was jobless for near half a year. I don't want to have to go through that again. I just barely made it and am still recovering. I have no savings. I am job hunting. I don't want to trade my sanity for my career. But I can't exactly afford to leave this job, nevermind get fired from it.

90,"Hi there! My name is Chris, I'm 33 and I'm starting to realize that being alone is a very real possibility for me. I feel like I should give some context here, though. 

I've been hearing impaired since I was 7 due to cytomegalovirus, and as I've learned recently, one of the unfortunate side affects of this is being somewhat antisocial. I'm not blaming this entirely on my hearing impairment, but I think it's definitely a factor. I'm deaf in my left ear. 

I was bullied a lot in my later years of elementary school and in junior high, but that had mostly stopped by high school. I was under the naive impression at the time that if I ignored it, it would go away. Obviously, this is not the case. I never had a very large friend circle although there were a few close friends, one who I've been friends with since I was 13, and we're still friends. But I find as I get older, we started hanging out less and less. 

But the real crux of the issue for me has been personal relationships. I never had a girlfriend in high school, although there were a few I was interested in and they were interested in me, although I never asked them out I guess out of sheer anxiety, and the one girl who was interested in me that I did finally ask out, she had already started dating someone else. I know high school relationships aren't everything, but I feel like there were things I missed out on that I could have learned from them. Even in college, I didn't try to date anyone. I was so focused on the work I didn't think I really had time for that. It wasn't until I was in my mid 20s after I got out of college that I started doing online dating, which has been hit or miss for me since then, mostly miss. I had the longest relationship of my life thanks to tinder, which started in October last year but ended after 5 months. I think what happened was after we got out of the honeymoon phase there was this real awkwardness and anxiety present, because I wasn't sure what to do, because I had never made it that far before! I knew the last few weeks of the relationship something was wrong. She was acting strange, but I ignored it because I didn't want to ruin things. She texted me one day shortly after and had me meet her at a coffee shop and she dumped me. Since then, online dating has not gone well. Once I get past the initial getting to know someone, there's this very real anxiety about what to say next. I feel like I'm overanalyzing everything I should say or do next. 

Socializing is not an easy or fun activity for me. Even with some members of my family, socializing with them is not something I feel comfortable doing. Obviously, close family, like my parents, grandparents and sister and some aunts and uncles I do just fine with, but anything beyond that tends not to be enjoyable for me.  Am I missing something here? Do I need to be seeking some kind of professional help or do I just need to put myself out there? Should I force myself to be more sociable with people? 

It probably doesn't help that I've turned myself into a shut in when I'm not working, pretty much. I work 10 hours a day and come home to my gaming pc and play among us with people from the among us subreddit discord, as well as Valorant. I work for an airline which gives my opportunities to travel for free, and I thought this would give me a chance to meet new people, but this has not been the case. Especially this year with COVID going around. 

Apologies, that was a lot I know, but I'm just looking for some kind of helpful advice on what to do now to help solve some of my antisocial behavior and my anxiety. Any advice would be deeply appreciated. Thanks!",30Nov2020,1

96,"I'm sorry if this is not the right place to post this. 
This'll be a bit long.

So me and my mom have never had the greatest relationship but we're close but not really close at the same time. She's lost two children and I can understand some of the reasons why she's the way she is, but, personally, I don't think that gives her the right to constantly be a dick and say she's had the worst life ever. Yes, I know she's lost two children and it's a very horrible thing to go to and you never get over the fact of a part of you being gone. But when I was younger, she started doing drugs and ran off to a different city and at the time, I was too young to understand what was happening but I remember being angry because she left my grandma to raise me and my sister all by herself for long periods of time throughout the first 10 or 11 years of my life. She'd occasionally come back but only for a few months or half a year. Anyways, as I got older and got into my teenage years, i started to understand and realize what was going on with her drug use and other things and I judged her for it until I was about 16. I started to understand why she did what she did but I was still angry with her because of everything she did to me and my sister as a child. (Me and my sister used to be everything to her. We were her world basically. But when she started doing drugs and other things, we weren't as important anymore) now that I'm a legal adult, I'm really really really really pissed with her because of how she treats me and my grandma. My mom will go on about how my grandma is a asshole because she won't give her money because she'll probably buy drugs or cigarettes with it and she claims my grandma is showing signs of dementia  (even though she's not) etc. But the thing is, my grandma pays for EVERYTHING in this house. The Bill's, the food, the heating, and she makes sure we have a roof over our heads at the end of the night. But somehow, my grandma is the dick? My mom doesn't contribute very much. She cleans furiously and claims that there's viruses everywhere and that there's bacteria growing in her skin. I know this is a sign of meth usage because I've seen it for too many years with her... she also occasionally argues with me for no reason when I call her out on her drug usage. She'll deny, deny, deny that she's on drugs even though my whole family knows she is. There's also a million uncapped syringes in her room and they're literally everywhere but she doesn't care. She'll treat me like I'm the worst person ever just because I call her out on it and try to convince her to get help (she won't go to a doctor unless she's dying because she was admitted to a psychiatric clinic a couple years ago because she claimed there were bugs in her hands and basically she cut her self up. They tried to help but she just bullshitted her way out of it) as of tonight, she's acting like she's going to kill herself or something because my grandma won't give her money. She also took my grandmas money card and is threatening to cut it up and cancel it if she or I try to get it back (that card is what pays our Bill's and gives us everything we have) and she's boreded herself up in her room and left a note on her door that suggests she's going to kill herself (she also said something that suggested this earlier as well) I don't know if I should call the police or wait because my grandma is telling me to wait until tomorrow and we'll figure it out. I'm thinking of writing her a text telling her that I'm just going to go live somewhere else (like with different family) and calling her out on her toxicity and manipulative behaviors. There's also a lot I didn't add because of personal reasons. I'm also sick with either food poisoning or something and I'm being thrown around like a puppet by my mom and that doesn't help. Is there anything law enforcement can do to help at least get her into a mental hospital for a screening or something? She'll obviously refuse to go but if she's threatening to kill herself, wouldn't they be able to do something?

TL;DR: my mom is basically holding my grandma, me, and my sister hostage (not actually holding us hostage) because she's not getting her way and is threatening to destroy all of my grandmas money card and we can't do anything because she'll cut it up if we try to get it back and she's threatening to kill herself. Can law enforcement do anything?",30Nov2020,1

100,"**Trigger Warning: Physical Assault**

I'm nearly 24(F). I was in a relationship with my childhood friend for 2 years, after knowing each other for 11. The relationship ended with assault (from him). 

We were engaged. 

I feel like knowing someone for eleven years and never knowing that side of him is a solid indication that marriage isn't a good idea. What if we HAD been married? A divorce is a hell of a lot trickier than a breakup, and I'm scared I'll never feel like I know someone well enough to marry them after this. 

I'm just curious if anyone has any similar experience or can point me to resources on healing from this kinda thing. I was already childfree before this, so that's not an issue, but I know that assuming the worst of everyone from one bad experience probably isn't fair or reasonable. I just don't know how to not feel like marriage is a terrible idea moving forward in relationships. 

I also want to mention that I am in therapy for this, and therapy is awesome, but I'm just curious to see if anyone has any input on this. 

Tl;dr: had a very bad relationship experience with someone I've known forever, and feel like that is a strong indication that marriage is bad due to the trapped nature of it all. Curious to hear input and gather resources if anyone has em!",30Nov2020,1

107,"So I'll admit I'm scared to even ask this because it's embarrassing and really uncomfortable, but I'm already concerned and don't know how to approach this topic with an adult so... Anon Advice. Not sure it's the greatest idea in the world but... how much scarier can it be than seeing that it might be rectal cancer on webMD? Ok, I'm sorry for stalling, I'm nervous, but here we go.

Yesterday I decided I wanted to see if I liked things in my ass. Girlfriend had once put a finger up there and it wasn't bad, I wanted to know if I'd actually like things up there, I used what I considered to be a lot of lube to give it a fair chance and I dove into it. I'd rather not do it again, and today solidifies that regardless of whether that's a related instance or not. Afterwards, I didn't poop for the rest of the day, and when I woke up this morning I had a morning before needing to poop a few hours into my day. When I did it would've scared the crap out of me. The morning's artwork was unlike any I had ever seen in my life. The bowl had blood in it, and a good amount. I immediately dove into google trying to find what was wrong, and I saw the usual culprits lined the wall citing fissures and hemorrhoids as a an easy out to not be concerned yet, and went on my day, hoping beyond hope that the next movement would be tomorrow's finest. However a few hours later, whether it be a malady of anxiety or ab discomfort, I felt I needed to go to the restroom again. So I go to the restroom. But All I can do is fart, and then blood splatters into the toilet. And it starts dripping. It drips every time I fart for a few farts and then the feeling stops I don't have to fart anymore, that's not great, but... maybe it's a sizable fissure thing, I did just shove a good sized dildo up my ass yesterday in the name of science. But then 3 hours later, I'm at the toilet again, and the same thing happens, and my logic is failing to the primal fear drive of holy shit I've now gone to the toilet three times, yet actually gone to the restroom only once, and every time, I have dropped a good amount of blood into the toilet. The online descriptions paint fissures and hemorrhoids as a bit of blood with poop, not going to the toilet because you're going to expel a blood fart, and so I try to calm down again, but my abdomen is uncomfortable, and those cancer possibilities play at some of my bigger fears. Last year I had a colonoscopy because of IBS and despite the fact that I am in my early 20s, the doctor found polyps. He removed them, but suggested that I get colonoscopies every 5 years from now on for the sake of monitoring me and creating a baseline, and as I'm thinking about how I've run to the restroom now multiple times, I remember that and the fear drive kicks in again. I'm not supposed to have polyps until I'm much older yet I already had them what could that mean? I begin to spiral, and I reach for the phone to call someone to talk to anyone, but I'm scared. I don't want to make a big thing out of it, because if it turns out that shoving something too big into ones barely experienced posterior, even with lube and feeling nothing more than discomfort during the act, is the culprit here, then that's going to be a nightmare to explain. But if there's something of real concern then I need to go to a doctor right? This is day 1, I'm a barely experienced young adult who feels like they can't talk to anyone out of shame, and r/advice seems to give people legit advice. What should I do? Right now, I think I should try to ride out the discomfort and see if things clear up, but I know regardless of whether I know that webMD tells me I'm going to see blood in my poop for a few days, if I see it in the toilet tomorrow my panic is only going to grow. I'm not asking anyone to out themselves as pegging aficionados, but if you've ever experienced remotely similar, or you know something about what I'm going through please help.",30Nov2020,1
108,"Since I was like 9 it made me uncomfortable. My parents are not super fit. That's fine. I do not care. But like when we are driving around together they laugh at people who are overweight and scoff at people who are underweight. It is so mean. It makes me so sad because I know on some occasions the people they are making fun of can hear them. I am embarrassed to be out in public with them sometimes.

 My step father will comment on my families weight/body type a lot after any social gathering as well. Mostly the women in my family. For instance my auntie, she had a baby. After the baby was born and even still- all he talks about is how shes put on weight.  Same with any actor he sees on TV, if they look slightly different his immediate thing is to laugh and talk about how fat they are. Or try to encourage me or my mom to look at their body. It makes me uncomfortable. It also makes my brother uncomfortable.

 I personally have an odd relationship with food. I was fairly under weight for a while. I'm at a healthy weight now though! But these comments really hurt, and totally make me question if I'm fat or ugly. Especially when I know the person they are laughing at can hear them. 

I don't know if I'm being too sensitive. I've brought it up with my mom. She agreed in the past but didnt change.  I brought it up again last year and she told me to get off my high horse. So I dont know. I might just need to stop being sensitive or something.",30Nov2020,1

111,"My younger brother has lost four friends this year alone and just today one killed himself. The cops are still on location and my brother is texting and calling with friends to stay updated. He killed himself at a friend's house and I assume the whole family was there and heard it which makes things more complicated and painful for everyone. This friend has said they were going to kill themselves for a while and friends tried to help him, but it happened still and he didn't want to seek help. Since my brother sort of expected it to eventually happen, I'm not sure how he is taking it but he is crying and of course hurt. The previous person who died was his best friend who overdosed. The other two weren't such close friends. But one died while drunk driving. I'm not sure of the last death, but all of them are very harsh.

My brother is not suicidal and knows it isn't his fault and he did what he could to help them, but the pain of losing another friend is really hurting him. After his best friend died at the beginning of this year he is definitely at least a little depressed and frustrated with everything. We live in the US and he doesn't have health insurance. His work did have a phone number to call to speak with a therapist, but the calls would never go through and he gave up. He also wasn't too interested in getting help before but eventually gave in and I think he will be willing to seek help again.

How can I help my brother deal with the death of his 4 friends and eventually end up in a better place mentally? I'm not a very touchy sympathetic helpful person who gives good advice because of how we were raised and I just don't even know what to do.

114,My girlfriend of 2 1/2 years recently broke up with me (3 months ago) and I‚Äôve been struggling with it quite a bit lately. Some back story is we met in college and for the first year of our relationship we lived close and were able to see each other whenever we wanted. Then she transferred schools (same state) and we had a long distance relationship which was fine. Well long story short she felt like there was a loss of connection and wanted to break up. I can‚Äôt say I was totally blindsided by this but it hurt all the same. The part that has me frustrated and confused is that about a week before we broke up she expressed her concerns and said she wants to work things out and after talking she said she‚Äôs glad she got everything off her chest and she‚Äôs glad to have me in her life. Ok at that point I‚Äôm thinking we are all good and we can work things out. Then a week later she calls me and tells me she wants to break up and she said that she still loves me and wants to be friends and tell me I‚Äôve done nothing wrong etc. but that she needs time before we can just be friends again and is giving me the cold shoulder and ignoring me/ internationally avoiding me. This all makes me feel like I‚Äôve done something wrong and it really hurts to think that someone I loved more than anything (somewhat) suddenly just refuses to talk to me.

First of all, I need to fix my sleep schedule. Currently it's awful, I can't fall asleep until 12-1:30 am and I have to get online for school at 7:30. Ideally I want to be able to go to bed by 11.

Next, I need to think about when and if I should quit my job. I work in fast food for minimum wage because it was the only job that would hire under 16 within walking distance. But the work is very demanding and pretty stressful. The money really helps me though.

And finally, I'm considering quitting student council next year. I only joined last year as a freshman because I knew nobody else. This year it is kind of starting to feel like a burden. Plus I also am not really the type to be very ""active"" in the community and find joy in planning events, which don't even happen anymore since we're online. I can't step down this year, but I can choose to not run again for next year. The only thing keeping me in is student council could look good on a college application.",30Nov2020,1

My friend, let‚Äôs call her P has been struggling with her body image/ self esteem for a very long time. And me being me, I could tell it was effecting her badly as she started starving herself and wishing she didn‚Äôt exist. I emailed our school councilor a few times and I‚Äôm glad to say she is getting the help she needs:)

137,"i apologize if this is not the place to post this. also this is kinda lengthy. bare with me. 

before this job, i was working in a call center. i was miserable but making decent money. my friend knew how much i hated the call center &amp; scored me a position at the job she is currently at. 
i did a phone interview with the owner &amp; she told me on the spot i was hired. she made this job seem to be the best. i got a $.50 hourly pay raise working 9-5 monday-friday with paid time off, holiday pay, &amp; quarterly bonuses. this is a small, family owned company. there are about 15 people that work here, all of them being family or friends, excluding me. my friend has known the owner since she was a child &amp; has watched her grow up. 

but i‚Äôve noticed lately that i don‚Äôt get treated the same as everyone else. 

whenever i quit my last job &amp; got to this one, it‚Äôs like everything she told me to get me to come here was thrown out the window. i trained for one day &amp; then the second day she threw in not only the work i needed to do but other people‚Äôs work too &amp; it seems the longer i stay here, the more work she keeps putting on me. she sends out passive aggressive emails, tells me that i‚Äôm constantly making mistakes &amp; that i‚Äôm not working fast enough. we are salary pay so we get paid the same amount each paycheck but she expects us to come in early everyday &amp; stay late every night. i don‚Äôt do either because i‚Äôm not getting paid for that. after she realized i left at 5 everyday, she sent out an email saying that people who don‚Äôt stay late or come in early will not be getting a bonus. she lets other people have time off but when i asked to leave early one day for an orthodontist appointment, she told me we don‚Äôt get paid time off here &amp; i will need to come in early or stay late to make up time missed. 

the last straw that has really had me constantly applying for jobs was just this past week. i went to the doctor with a sore throat &amp; the doctor suggested i be tested for covid but advised me i will need to quarantine until my results come back. other people at my work have had this happen too &amp; she never made a deal about it. actually, one employee is currently out right now due to testing positive. she threatened that i wouldn‚Äôt get paid for thanksgiving since i didn‚Äôt work the day before or day after the holiday. after questioning her, because we are exempt salary, she stopped replying to my messages. i sent her a picture of my doctors note showing i was there &amp; i was excused for the next few days. the note did not mention covid. she told me she would not except that doctors note unless it mentioned my covid testing. so i had to call my doctor &amp; have them give me a new doctors excuse mentioning my covid test. (side note: she doesn‚Äôt believe covid is any worse than a common cold. her exact words.) 

i‚Äôve been at this job for almost 3 months &amp; my friend keeps telling me she doesn‚Äôt always act like this &amp; to please stick it out &amp; not leave her there. i‚Äôm miserable working for this bully &amp; i don‚Äôt want to be apart of this company anymore but my friend is making me feel guilty for wanting to leave. i‚Äôm not sure what i should do.",30Nov2020,1

144,"I hknow a girl and she is truely admirable and I have somewhat of a crush on her. But I know that even besides of my romantic feelings there are many things I want to adopt in my own personality. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is so cool. she is amazing. she doesn't even care that she is beautiful. she is so smart that she is still depressive. she knows if someone would be interested in her it is because of her looks. How can she be so humble even though she could have plastic love? Its because she sees through it. at the same time she is unpredictable. however throughout the last years she is unfortunately getting girlier. She is such an idol I want to be like her. We study together and  she is always hangs up her coat and fixes her hair and then she starts to work. Wow it looks so great. However she is not working because it looks aesthetic like those instagrum thots hanging about the libary studying ""businesscomunication -  how to climb the ladder like a woman"". I know she would immediately see through my fragile ego, there is no mistake about it. I dont even really exist in her world. I think I have figgured it out, you have to be good-looking and smart to be as graceful as she is. The thing is she is graceful without trying, she has no ulterior motive, it is all natural. I cannot see a single flaw in this girl

Okay I am done simping but as you can maybe see I have lots of trouble with my sef esteem and I sometimes believe that I don't deserve things and self sabotage, things like ""grace"" or""class"". I also don t believe that I would ever have  a chance with her. I think I am not worthy but at the same time I really admire her. What can I learn from her? Should I act like her in certain things? If so what can I do about my self doubts? I think she is really making me a better person but at the same time I realize that I am not really independent like her.

146,"I have gotten into a rather serious relationship with a woman.

I have done my best to get where I am with him as my drive and inspiration, if not for his kindness I might not be who I am now. I told her that if I ever have a son, I want to name them after that man.

The issue that comes up is this when he passed away from lung cancer it was during a very bad time in my life. I was devastated at the news of his passing and I withdrew. I didn't speak to his wife, who was nothing but kind to me, nor his children who I had never really gotten to know during the time I knew him. I feel like because I was not there to help them grieve, because I was so separate from them, that to respect and honor his memory I need their blessing to name my son after him.

I can't find them, though. I have looked as best as I can and sent out some messages, but it is very hard to contact someone you don't know through almost any platform these days. I love the man as a father and wish I could go back and connect with his family, but that time has passed.

My sister, call her Dee, is adopted, she knows and has relationships with both of her biological parents. She was a drug baby, and as a result, has executive function disorder. She has made my mom's life a living hell with her behavioral issues and simply doesn't listen to my mom's rules. Dee works, is finishing her senior year of high school online, and is big into horses. So, she has structure but hangs out with an awful crew of people who are all under 21 and drink/smoke/do drugs/have unprotected sex/etc., a parent's worst nightmare. I only know because my mom gave me her snapchat login in to check in on her from time to time and saw a snapchat from inside of her truck with at least a grams worth of coke. 

My family lost my father, unexpectedly this year and my mom is now left to deal with the estate, as my brother (21M) and I are living our own lives and working full time. I am in NYC but my brother lives 20 minutes from my family home in Oregon. As shitty as this may sound, I am unwilling to let my adopted sister ruin the rest of my family. She has been a problem child since my family fostered her and has only gotten incrementally better with dealing with her learning and behavioral issues. Also, she knows damn well that she is predisposed to have an addictive personality but still continues to drink, smoke weed, and obviously try other drugs. She has tried xanax and molly before.  


Just looking for advice on how to proceed, ideally without the involvement of my mom who is already emotionally fried and still dealing/coping with the death of her husband.

149,"My ex understood that I had OCD and one of those things is the urge to confess hurtfult things. All my friends are telling me not to say sorry to her and wait for her to get back to me. I wasn't able to give her space and time when she needed me which led to our break-up

We last talked on Whatsapp and she told me we end on good terms but if she ever changes her mind she could contact me. I told her that if I ever contact her she can block me, a couple days after she proceeds to follow me on IG.

Here are the things I did to hurt her:

I had a bad urge to confess something bad due to my OCD. One of those things I confessed, I told her that her mom cheated on her dad which scared me because I read online that a girl that grew up in a broken home and with daddy issues is more likely to cheat where cheating was normalized in their childhood.

I also had a compulsion to tell the truth. I told her about small white lies to lies, now she branded me as a liar.

I had a bad intrusive thought of spreading her nudes which I told to her which I will never do.





I'm not a bad person, I just have a tendency to confess hurtful things because of my OCD and I am seeking therapy now. I just wanted to let you know how bad my situation is but she did have the courage to follow me on instagram but I don't know.",30Nov2020,1

Both of us have moderate health issues that put us in a higher risk category if we were to contract COVID.

Either me or my brother would check the window sill for the half that we left and when it wasn‚Äôt there, we‚Äôd ask the other if they had smoked it. 4 times seemed like too many for it to be a strong gust of wind picking it up and blowing it away.  

We were already suspicious of our new crackhead neighbors and one day I caught my him red handed standing in my porch looking for any leftover roaches. I told him to stay the fuck away from my shit and some other stuff to make him feel stupid for stooping to the point of stealing roaches. He‚Äôs a pretty young guy (mid 20s) and seemed like he was immediately scared and sorry. From what it looked like we weren‚Äôt gonna be having any more issues and we also just stopped leaving the roaches outside. 

Fast forward to about a week later and I catch this kid leaving my porch (probably checking for roaches again) and this time he has the nerve to ask me for a weed connect and he has money this time. I told him I‚Äôm trying not to make this uncomfortable seeing as we live right across from each other, but that‚Äôs not how it fucking works when you‚Äôre stealing and if he was fiending that bad he can pick the shit that we throw on the ground up and try to see if he gets anything out of that. 

I don‚Äôt give a shit about the weed that he has already stolen before me catching him, but the fact that he‚Äôs still trying after I caught him is blatantly disrespectful. I don‚Äôt wanna have to fight him cause I don‚Äôt want him to do some unpredictable crackhead shit like pull out a weapon, but I‚Äôm also not gonna let him think it‚Äôs alright to keep trying to catch me lacking.

My question is: If and when I see him being sketchy on my porch again, what‚Äôs the move?",30Nov2020,1

178,"I am  17f So I'm going to college this January, and I got accepted in 2 different universities in different degrees. (Lets be clear, I live in a different country that does not have a lot of public universities and they're pretty bad, so private universities have better educational level)

 the amount of money my family has to pay is HUGE in both of them. The first one in which I chose international relations and economy is cheaper than the second one in which I chose modern languages and culture, the difference is pretty visible. the first university is doing some good discounts in the enrollment, but in the second one they're not. 

The problem is that the second university is one of the best in my country and it and the option of doing another degree simultaneously with the same price. And I prefer the second degree rather than the first one. My parents think the first degree is better (price and what I would learn) which I think the same. But I don't see myself studying that.

 I think is selfish making my parents pay that much money just for me. And you guys may be thinking why tomorrow? It's because the enrollment of the first university closes tomorrow and I need to choose tonight. My thoughts right now are: why would I even need to choose at 17? Any advice would help me a lot.",30Nov2020,1
180,"Hi all,

it's me again. Sorry this might be long, hopefully you won't be too tired of me... I just needed some advice on how to find the confidence to ask for help for pretty much anything? I don't know. Maybe I just to vent. I don't mind if this gets buried...

Anyways, I've been feeling pretty down lately, mainly due to my lack of accomplishment with my college work. I know what's wrong, but at the same time I don't since it's all new to me. It's my first year and everything just shattered because of COVid, I just want it it end, I just want everything to go back to normal and maybe I could feel a little bit better. I don't know. 

I haven't gotten any major work done yet, and in about two to three weeks, there are the finals coming very fast, I have two presentations I haven't worked on yet next week (It's coming very fast), I also have two projects that I was supposed to work on four weeks ago, but never did and both are due in two weeks. 

I am almost completely clueless to all my classes since I never really wrote any kinds of notes, only screenshots but I never take a look at them ever. I will very likely fail this semester since I procrastinated **a lot**. I even have suicidal thoughts (**I will not end myself. But I do have thoughts of me dying, or ending myself. I was wondering if that was bad? I am confused about it all. I just need to know if that's what being suicidal is.**) or self-harm thoughts.

But I never asked for help, because I never learned how to ask for help, because I was always socially anxious and never really knew how to properly interact with people except of being the ""funny"" one and going with the flow people give me. But I never really had a ""serious"" talk with anyone. I never really shared my thoughts and feelings with anyone. No one in my family ever points out the *why* of things when I cried, was angry, etc., they just threw what I threw at them instead of asking why. And probably I reciprocated that ""way"" of interacting; that I learned how to keep everything to myself without ever saying a word about it, to be quiet about my own person, that I learned how to stay stuck in myself.

But you know what? I'm finally asking for help on how to ask around for help! Deep down, I want to change, but never had the confidence to, nor to even reach out to people unless there is a good reason and most are just college related, finances, groceries, never anything like friendship, family, how people are doing, etc.

I'm very socially anxious and I guess I can say I'm a shy person? Even though if you talk to me, I will stutter a bit, but I will never really feel embarrassed. I'm just never the type to start conversations. I'm the kind of person to be left behind (I don't wish this to even my worst enemy -- not that I have one, heh).

I want to change that. I want to change myself as a whole. I want to work out, I want to get a driver license, I want to get a job for a while, I want to boost up my confidence, I want to have fun in life and just quit being down nearly all the time, and I want some advices on how to find the courage to ask for help.

190,"I (20f) recently visited my grandma's house to dog sit for her. While I was there, i noticed this jar of $5 she keeps to save up. I was in pretty dire need of cash for gas and groceries and without really even thinking I reached in and grabbed like $50. I know i should've asked, she wasn't home but I could have easily called her cell. I don't know why I didn't. But I planned on slipping the same amount of money back in the jar from my next paycheck. Well, literally the next day she noticed it was gone and called me early in the morning. I was half asleep when I answered and honestly completely forgot that I'd taken the money, so I defended myself when she said I had stolen from her and I told her I hadn't. She didn't believe me because I was the last person in the house before she noticed. Anyways, she was understandably upset and said I'm no longer welcome to her house and that I need to pay her back. Again, she's understandably upset. But she thinks I took $200, because the jar I guess had like $500 and now it only has $300 and this was money she was saving for Christmas so this makes her even more upset, along with the accidental lying. Like I said, I planned on paying her back the $50, but I honestly did not take any more than $50. I can't afford to give her $200 and she doesn't believe I didn't steal more. I know I'm a POS and this is totally karma for taking money in the first place, no need to tell me that. But I love my grandma with my whole heart and she literally raised me and I don't want this to be what ruins our relationship. I want to apologize sincerely I just can't find the right words I guess... How do I admit my wrong and apologize but make her understand I didn't take any more than $50?

I didn‚Äôt believe him  about his age at first and asked him for some selfies. He sent them and he looked eighteen. Then I made him send some in weird poses for I would know it was actually him and he wasn‚Äôt cat-fishing. For example, I asked him for one with his finger on his nose and he did it. I believed him. We kept talking and I think I fell in love with him, he loved me as well. He would say it all the time. I was enjoying it and then Tay started pressuring me to send nudes. I said no and he kept asking and asking and I caved and sent some. These few weeks, we‚Äôve been fighting and making up. Today, we had another fight. He blocked me and deleted our main messaging app. I emailed him and he wouldn‚Äôt reply. I decided to look for his Facebook and send him a message. I didn‚Äôt know his full name so I went on a website that tells you information after you give it an email address. I typed in the address and a name popped up. It wasn‚Äôt Tay.

I‚Äôm a 23 year old male. And even though I hate that every day of my life in my opinion is full of pain and suffering, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs worse than I deal with.
I was diagnosed with multiple progressive chronic illnesses at 14 years old. It‚Äôs affected my physical and mental health substantially over the course of the last 9 years. I‚Äôve had ups and downs with trying to manage it for a long time now, but I ultimately am in a bad position currently. 

My situation here involves a few different things - 

My physical health is currently suffering due to working one job(30-40 hours per week). I work as a certified pharmacy technician in a retail pharmacy. What I mean exactly by my health suffering is that my physical symptoms are really overwhelming me to the point that I just want to quit.

The problem is that I can‚Äôt quit because I am financially not able to. I am actually far from being able to and it frustrates me and drives me insane every single day -

Financially, I have literally ZERO savings. I am in debt with bad credit. I am upside-down on my car finance. And I don‚Äôt make much per hour. 

Finances/Debt -

Car payment/month - $377(Behind on payments)
Car insurance/month - $285(Behind on payments) 
Medical Bill in collections - $1516.00
Medical Bill in collections - $1358.00
Federal student loans - $4218.00/$58.00 per month
My car loan/finance - $19,182.87 balance/$377.00 per month &amp; at least $2300.00 worth of damage to be repaired 
Credit card collection account - $806.35 balance
Credit card(Active) balance - $495.89
Credit card collection account - $1439.88
State unemployment balance due - $555.00
Credit card account(to hit collections anytime now) - $695.00
Community college Bill - $1713.00
Medical Bill(active) - $225.00
Medical Bill collections account - $200.00
Bank account overdue - Negative -$138.36
Online credit card past due - $643.15
Payday personal loan - $4,000.00 - approximately

Misc. - Medications/Copays - at least $80.00/month


So as you guys can see I‚Äôm nowhere even relatively close to being financially stable. I never have money, ever...
I don‚Äôt know what I should be doing whether it‚Äôs a debt management program/plan; filing for bankruptcy(which I truly don‚Äôt want to do at all); etc. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do overall because I feel trapped with feeling terrible everyday and trying to kill my self by going to work - Should I look into Social security income or something similar? I have no clue where to even start. 

Any advice here would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!",30Nov2020,1
195,"I started working for a large company about a month ago as a seasonal worker. I was told a lot of stuff at orientation and at the interview, and now it seems every single detail was a lie. I was told:

* 5-6 hours a day and often 8 around mid-to-late November when it gets much busier. 
* Work at \[x\] location at \[y\] time.
* \[Z\] pay per hour.

Now a month later while working for them and jumping through their hoops, they:

* Changed the location and hours on me twice without telling me, forcing me to wait an hour before having to give up and go home to give them a call to find out what was going on, missing an entire day of work and being told I have a new location/time MUCH worse than the original.
* Cut the hours drastically from 5-8 to 3-4, even going as far to tell me they can't give me more than 4 hours in my position, despite working 5 and a half the first week. 

Because of quarantine and how long it took me to get this job, I just sucked it up and went with it for the experience that I need and the decent pay. Now, I just found out the whole time they cut my pay by $3.35 an hour and I have been working for the reduced pay the whole time.

What do I do now? Do I just quit and pray I have enough hours for EI while searching for another job?

196,"Hey everyone, I'm 17 and recently I was interested in buying some clothes because of Black Friday. I had always liked clothing from a brand that sells street-wear and they're doing a sale on almost everything they got. Having no personal money left to spend I asked my mom I she could buy it for me, but said it would look would look weird with my skinny calves. I talked to her about it a little more and said that we could talk about it with dad later. I asked him about it and he laughed a bit saying they look weird and my mom ensued by saying they look like a drug dealer's fit. Also remarked that if I wore that out in public, no job scouts would care to even talk to me because of my outfit, or even my friends would make fun of me to no end. Even said that the people that manage the scholarship I apply to would criticize it to the point of not giving me the scholarship. In the end the decision was no since it was her money I was asking for, which I understood. The thing I argued about was about the heavy stereotyping on her end. What hurt me the most was her saying that she was disappointed in my tastes in clothing since she thought more of me. She got pissed and said she had to work (which she always is and I admire that) but I can hardly talk to her about stuff without her being busy. Do we really live in a society where we can't dress or be who we are because of what others say? My mom has a point but at the same time doesn't sit right with me. Of course what she considers normal is different from my normal. She said that I could dress like that when I'm financially stable and not living with her, but not in her house or in front of her.",30Nov2020,1

I was thinking about what excuse to tell him, so I went on invisible and told him i gtg do my hw (but I was actually planning on what I should tell him to nicely block or unfriend him). 

I asked my Friends, they told me to tell him ""I'm so sry but my mom is so strict and she told me to remove all the online friends i have in my contacts"". So I thought that was a good excuse, so when I came off online he said ""heyy -blushes-"" I was so mad- I just ignored that and said what i need to say. 

So I told him all the things but then he said: ""Just secretly don't remove me, please??"". I didn't know what to tell him so I just said ""Im sorry"" and then blocked him.

202,"Throwaway because my regular profile is linked to my identity. Tl;dr at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a large family. Pre-covid we had parties all the time since it was always someone's birthday, anniversary, or other milestone. We usually got together, celebrate, and go home, nothing else happens. However, I have one family member (mid-30s F) who will ""*graciously*"" offer to throw a party for someone in her own home. She gets the headcount, buys decorations, and figures out the menu, which is where my issues with her begin.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on who is coming, she assigns a specific dish or two from the menu she has written up to each guest, in addition to a bottle of wine or other alcohol. Sometimes there's negotiating the menu, but she's so set in what she wants that there's rarely any leeway there. Fine. We usually all chip in for the work to make the dinner parties happen, but within a couple days of it ending, she will send a message to all guests to find out how much everyone spent on their dish, she includes her own decorations and costs, and charges all guests a payment back to her. This usually ranges $30-50, which on top of what people buy at the grocery store, ultimately adds up to \~$100 per person, at which point I would rather just go to a restaurant (pre-covid).

&amp;#x200B;

This charge always comes as a surprise to me because it's never mentioned beforehand, only ever after the party is well and done with. As someone who hosts friends for dinner, I recognize that I've invited people into my home to entertain them and never expect them to pay me back for it. I usually don't even ask for wine or alcohol in return, but will suggest something if someone offers to bring a bottle. I know she doesn't have a lot of money, but the general consensus with people I talk to is that **if you can't afford to eat the cost of a party you offer to throw, don't throw the party**.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue with this family member has gotten to the point that my partner won't go to events at her home anymore because they don't want surprise charges, I don't want to invite any of my own friends to these events because I don't want the embarrassment of having to send them charges on her behalf, those friends who know about this tendency have asked me never to invite them to a gathering at her house, and I rarely want to go see our mutual friends and my own family at these events because I don't want to go through the effort of preparing food and then being charged more as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Covid has allowed me to pass on nearly every event she's thrown together this year, often with groups larger than 10 from multiple households, but that's a separate issue I've addressed with her and the family already, with no sign of deterring her at all, so you can tell what kind of stubborn person she is. However, I recently decided to say OK and attend a post-Thanksgiving indoor, non-distanced, unmasked gathering of 7 people outside of my social bubble for a birthday, which I was already rather uncomfortable with, but everyone claims they were tested within the last week (probably a stupid decision, I know). Lo and behold, the next day on the text thread minus the birthday person, we were asked how much we spent on food. After a few minutes, we were told to send her nearly $40 to balance out what she had spent on food and decorations. Again, no one asked her to host this little party, no one asked her to decorate for it, and money was never discussed beforehand. We all pay, but no one has ever brought this up with her and I honestly don't know how other family members feel about this.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner skipped this one and can continue to skip all these gatherings for the rest of their life for all I care, but I can't always say no to seeing my family. They always ask me what my partner is doing instead of attending the gathering and I make up an excuse that they have other plans. Is there anything I can say to this family member to let her know that we don't appreciate these surprises from a host and would rather not attend if she's going to keep doing this? She likes to act like a socialite, but this is tacky AF. I'm at the point of never wanting to spend time there ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Family member offers to host events in her home, no one ever asks her to host
2. She assigns dishes for people to make/bring based on her own drawn up menu ideas
3. After the event, she calculates how much everyone has spent (including herself) and ends up charging guests for her own hosting costs bringing the cost for guests up to \~$100

Anything I can say or do to get her to stop? Or do I just stop going?",30Nov2020,1

204,"Just to give some background, my sister (15f) and I (21f) have always had a strong bond and been extremely close. We've obviously had fights but we usually move past them very quickly. She is genuinely the person I love the most and our relationship has been really important to me. I never thought any situation could turn this ugly but apparently I was wrong. 

My sister has anger issues that have just gotten worse. A few days ago my mom and her got into a fight about her not cleaning some stuff. She obviously got extremely angry and started yelling and throwing a tantrum and mishandling the things she was supposed to clean. In the process she dropped some heavy stuff on my laptop that really pissed me off. I started telling her how there's no need for her to get mad at everything and the like. We went back and forth a couple times after which my mom came upstairs and started yelling at her more. After a while my mom was asking my sister something in a normal tone and she kept responding in an extremely disrespectful tone and manner. I usually try to stay out of their arguments because it's mostly yelling and so counterproductive. But I was so tired of my sister's behavior. I intervened and told my sister she needs to stop talking that way. She said something back of course. After a point I lost my cool and started yelling at her about how disrespectful and ungrateful she is. I have always been soft with her which I feel like lead her to not taking me seriously and walking all over me. I mentioned a person we know and said how she should've gotten them as her sibling (Obviously that person's a bad sibling). She then said something that I would've never expected. She said ""Oh, thank you for doing the bare minimum as a sibling"" in a very sarcastic tone. I can't put into words how much that hurt me. I felt like something inside me just broke. I then reacted in a way that I am not proud of. I started pushing her and yelling at her and crying. I left off saying something along the lines that she would regret saying this and she should just die. 

Now, to address my thoughts on the situation. First off I was absolutely shattered about two things. Number one being my reaction. I was so disappointed and feel like I just went back on all the progress I've made. I realized a long time ago that while I love my family we're pretty toxic in how we deal with stuff. I vowed to change myself, unlearn and learn and be better. Since I've been off at college in another country for the past 3 years, I've changed and grown a lot. There, I've dealt with conflicts by communicating in a very healthy way. So when I come back home it's really hard for me when my parents and sister are the same. I try to keep my calm and stay true to myself but I have my saturation point too. I know I was absolutely wrong to physically push her and also to yell back and say mean things that didn't help solve the problem in any way. I wish I could take it back because I was wrong to do that and I can't imagine how that must've hurt her. The second thing I'm obviously upset about is what she said. It breaks my heart to think that that's how she's felt about me all these years, but I'm also keeping in mind it could be something she said in the heat of the moment. But you need to understand, all these years she's been the center of my life and I cannot stress that enough. I tried to introspect and understand why what she said hurt me so much and I concluded that maybe I put too much into the relationship over the years and I assumed and expected she felt the same way about me that I felt about her. So I decided to stop being so over the top and move mountains for her and keep our relationship just functional. So since then I've been only talking to her if I absolutely need to or if she's asked me something. She'll say something here and there if we're watching a show or randomly. But I've spoken a total of 10 words to her maybe. And I just want to clarify I'm not doing this because I want to be petty or salty or rude to make her feel bad. I just feel like if she considered our entire relationship as me doing the bare minimum, while I was putting my everything into it, I should just do the bare minimum moving forward. It's been normal but it's also extremely weird because usually we're together the entire day almost. Like we're always on about something together.

I obviously don't want it to be this way forever. I want to fix this but what's stopping me is the fact that she hasn't seemed to care one bit or be bothered by what's happened with us and hasn't even made an effort to talk about what happened, let alone apologize. I would like to apologize for what I did while making it clear how she hurt me too. But I don't think she's mature enough for a healthy conversation. For the first time I'm clueless as to what to do or how to deal with this situation. I feel so sad. I would appreciate any thoughts or advice on this situation. Any advice on how I can improve myself in general for the future is also welcome.",30Nov2020,1
205,"Tldr: I‚Äôm hard to shop for and hubby doesn‚Äôt put much thought (sometimes,) into gifts. How do I make it easier for him? And for me? 

Sorry in advance for rambling. 

I never realized how hard I am to shop for. Question never changes. ‚ÄúWhat do you want for Christmas/birthday/anniversary/etc?‚Äù

In a way, I feel like my mom. Not in a bad way. Growing up, she would give dad a list of a couple items, and he would work at making it happen. So, she always knew what she was gonna get. 

I hate surprises. But I hate not being surprised. Does that make sense? 

Yes, I made an Amazon wishlist. But it‚Äôs just really stuff for the home or for my hobby turning business. 

There‚Äôs nothing I need nor want outside of home or hobby. 

So, so here‚Äôs the no thought part. He bought me this beautiful locket one year before we were married. We were struggling. So funds were really tight. I get that. I absolutely love the locket he got me. The locket company had several levels. The straight locket. A locket where the pictures are already in place. Where they were etched, etc. he got me the straight locket. (Again, I love it!) I wanted to put our wedding photo in their after we got married. But every year he gets on me saying that I haven‚Äôt gotten a picture made to put into the locket. Ummm hello! We have wedding photos now. You pick one, and get the picture made. Wrap the necklace back up and gift it to me. No. He won‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs my job. So he says. 

This one time is where I felt like my mom. Best Buy had their Kitchenaid mixers on Black Friday sale. I wanted one. So, we go there and buy one. It sits in the closet, until Christmas morning. Lol some odd months later, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you ever give that thing a rest?‚Äù Lol 

Gift cards are too impersonal. Plus there‚Äôs no guarantee the store would have what I need when I need a certain item. 

This year has been a tight year. I get that. So when he asks, I respond with, your love. I told him there‚Äôs nothing I need. Maybe, want, not need. It‚Äôs also part of the business. But he jokes and says I can afford that when he‚Äôs dead and I collect his insurance policy. Lol it‚Äôs a 10 needle embroidery unit. I don‚Äôt need it. I have a 5x7 that works just fine. And anyways, it‚Äôs not like he can buy it for me. It would have to be purchased under the business. 

I‚Äôve purposely been avoiding the question. Because I realize I‚Äôm hard to shop for. 

I‚Äôm not a jewelry person. I only wear my engagement ring. I wear my locket on special occasions or when we go out. The actual locket doesn‚Äôt lock like it used to. So I‚Äôm afraid of it breaking all the way. 

For example: my purse has seen better days. But he knows I‚Äôm in the middle of making my own purse. Same with clothes. I make my own. 

I have to say this. So one year I created an amazon wishlist. Just for Christmas. Let me say, it was a mistake. NOT on their part. On mine. I put stuff that I thought was cute or I would really enjoy. Yeah. I can‚Äôt wear the jewelry because I‚Äôm allergic to just about every known metal out there. I knew I was sensitive to some. Not as many as confirmed. (Was confirmed this year before my c5c6 cervical fusion surgery.) The outfits, the material was so crappy. And the rest didn‚Äôt look at all like the picture. I felt horrible! Because they legit tried. They meaning my son and husband. That‚Äôs why I will never do an amazon wishlist. 

My son. Is just like me. ‚ÄúWhat do you want for Christmas? ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù Ugh. This kid. Lol 

Just for arguments sake, if money wasn‚Äôt an issue. The one thing I would like, you know, There‚Äôs nothing. Okay, I know he would like it, too. Each have our own office space. Lol right now we share an office. 

What I got him, well made him, is, his favorite color is blue. So, I got him blue towels and I embroidered, ‚Äúthis is your towel.‚Äù On one. And ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù With golf balls. On the other.",30Nov2020,1

218,"*First, I would like to clarify that I understand nothing here should be or will be taken as medical advice  without the aid and approval of my physician. I'm just looking to understand my situation better by hearing any input or stories. It can be incredibly helpful to talk things out and to hear others, and I thank you for reading and/or participating in the discussion if you choose to.*

Long story short: I'm a relatively healthy male in his 30s with lifelong severe anxiety and panic disorders. I've been diagnosed everything from having nearly every generalized anxiety-related disorder, all the way up to manic depression (specifically, Bipolar II). I took meds for several years in my early twenties but ceased all prescriptions for about a decade. Two years ago it became too much to tolerate on my own, so I went back to my doctor again. After many, MANY different trial-and-errors, we finally landed on a regimen of Buspirone, a beta blocker (for essential tremor) and 1mg of clonazepam up to 3x daily. Most days, I'd average just one clonazepam. However, it wasn't uncommon to have a bad enough day to warrant the second or third dose, sometimes taking my full daily prescription's worth.

Naturally, the clonazepam's potency decreased drastically throughout the past two years and it led to taking more of it, more often. The classic story! After falling into abusive patterns from time-to-time (including sometimes foolishly mixing it with alcohol), I realized I had fallen into a vicious loop and was on a scary entrance ramp to a highway I did not want to merge onto. I was experiencing bouts of amnesia from time to time, I said and did things EXTREMELY unlike myself, and realized I wasn't too deep in where I could still change things on my own volition. So. I cold-turkey stopped taking the clonazepam (I know the taper method is the proper way to get off, but I felt disgusted and disappointed in myself and just wanted to stop ASAP).

It's been ten days today since I last took it, and it's been a horrendously horrible ride. All the hallmarks of withdrawal - impossibly awful sleep loss/disturbances, physiological effects, rebound anxiety/depression, the works. I've been able to muscle through it until this evening when I experienced one of the worst panic attacks I've had in YEARS. My wife and I agreed I should take 0.75mg of her Xanax as the attack was incredibly acute and needed to be addressed with something at least. My physician was unavailable this evening and still isn't aware that I cold-turkey stopped. I've improved a bit, but still recovering just trying to strong-arm the rest of the night and hopefully can just get some rest soon.

All in all, I know there's a LOT of issues with my story and my game plan on getting off of it. After tonight's attack, I fully plan on talking to my doctor when they're available this week and figure out a better way to treat these issues with something less spooky, but I'm also curious if those who have gone through this sort of thing before with benzodiazepines have any stories, advice, or general knowledge you could share about your own experiences.

First of all, I did make a similair post on a different sub-reddit and didn't get much input.  However, im posting something similair here as im getting desperate!

I know this is a long-shot but I have to ask.  I have to believe there is a better way.

I hate working full-time.  Anytime after work is spent recovering and preparing for the next day.  I want to live life! All my life is work, commute, housework, prep for work, decompress and sleep.

I know they say follow your passions as a career - but no one is gonna pay me to rock climb, snowboard, be with my friends, hike and play guitar.  Sure, I could teach these things - but im passionate about these activities, im not passionate about teaching them!

I have degree in social sciences and years experience in the social service, but im willing to get more education if it gives me less work hours!

223,"14f here. I've always had a group of 5 other friends I talked to. They were pretty chill and we'd hang out outside of school sometimes. I always thought they were great but sometimes I'd see signs that I was not enjoying myself with them as much as they were with me. For example we all have different interests but they seem to like a lot of one thing while I'm all alone interested in some other thing. 

Fast forward to when quarantine started.. everything felt off with my friends. Nobody texted anymore and the amount of social interaction I was getting went down a lot. I would always be the only one to reach out to them but never the other way around. It made me really sad realizing that I was the only one who cared about the relationship with all my friends. My friendship with each one of the people in the group seemed very one sided. 

Today, I haven't hung out in person with any of the girls for two months because I decided I was done always reaching out to them while they just forgot about me. I am really scared/nervous for highschool now because I have lost a lot of social interaction skills and I fear I'll have no friends in highschool because not a single one of my friends from the friendgroup are planning on going to the same school as I am.

Does anyone have any advice for the situation I'm in? It's gotten me really sad but lately I've just been playing online games and meeting friends online. They have all brought my mood up a lot but I still miss having real life friends.

I am friends with a few of Jane‚Äôs friends, and through them I have heard that at the beginning of their relationship (and before they dated), Jane‚Äôs BF would be physically and sexually abusive towards her. I learned this about 4 months  into their relationship, and according to Jane it had stopped‚Äîand she was happy with him. I wasn‚Äôt directly talking to Jane at this time, just hearing stuff from her friends. 

Fast forward again to April of 2020. Jane and I started talking as friends, just as a way to catch up on the missed time between high school and now. As we begin to talk more frequently, I start growing a crush on her. We match perfectly in every regard, but she still has a boyfriend. Jane and I would FaceTime for 5ish hours every other night talking about pretty much everything. It was so seamless. When her relationship was brought up, she would tell me how ‚Äúme and her would match better‚Äù than him. Obviously I feel like that‚Äôs a huge hint‚Äîbut I just kept thinking it would be disrespectful to tell her that I‚Äôm into her. 

Fast forward again to October, we still talk but I stopped responding to her as I was tired of waiting for her to break things off with her BF. I read that ‚Äúwaiting for something that may never come is a fools game‚Äù, and made my decision. Now in November I still have heavy feelings for her, and was wondering if you guys would think it would be worth it to let her know how I feel? She‚Äôs still together with her BF, but it‚Äôs eating me alive waiting, and I want to be able to move on completely. Thoughts? 

TL;DR - I like a girl who has a BF, BF used to be abusive to her. She hinted that she liked me. Wtf do I do?",30Nov2020,1
226,"TLDR: Insecure in a poly relationship but working on myself. Have never been in such a supportive and open relationship. When I‚Äôm happy it all makes sense when I‚Äôm sad everything feels like a lie. I feel like a burden. I remember all the negative events that occurred with those people to convince myself that they deserve better and don‚Äôt need me. I finally decided to let my partner know these thoughts I had in regards to them. I wrote it drunk and thought I used I statements and explained it but they felt like it was pointed. It hurt them to read and it felt like I held it against them. That truly wasn‚Äôt my intention. I didn‚Äôt see it like that but now they are hurt and I don‚Äôt think they want to be around me. Can I fix this? What kind of therapy do I need? I said sorry too many times I just want them to know I didn‚Äôt mean it like that even if it can‚Äôt be forgiven. 



I am in a poly relationship. I struggle with jealousy and insecurity. I‚Äôm working hard though and my partner is truly amazing. Like no other I‚Äôve ever had... it feels to good to be true when I‚Äôm sad. I struggle with anxiety and depression and I go to therapy but haven‚Äôt found the right meds and my therapist isn‚Äôt helping. In my head when I get into a severely depressed state I can recall negative things only basically in my interactions with people. Friends family everyone. I wrote a stupid fucking drunk notes app letter to my partner about how I felt and why I was so quiet and about the like things that just replay in my head that make me think they could never love someone like me. I showed them bc these feelings have been eating me alive. I don‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt let go of those moments but I use them to limit myself in understanding how they love me. I tried to explain what was happening in my head but I made them feel like shit. They said it felt pointed and like I was holding it against them but that truly wasn‚Äôt my intention. I tried to use only I statements bc i know my interpretation of these events and my holding onto them is my fault and I just wanted to explain to them why it was so hard for me to believe them, not because I held them against them but because I‚Äôm a stupid insecure idiot and can‚Äôt sort out the truth from my warped view. Negative things just magnify so much more so I always assume people could never love me. They just look so sad now. I feel a little better because we did talk about it and they do love me and I‚Äôm going to find a better therapist bc I hate that I can‚Äôt communicate like a regular person. They explained how it made them feel and they said we were ok and I kept apologizing bc I didn‚Äôt know what else to say, I didn‚Äôt know it would read that way it didn‚Äôt sound like that in my head. But they seem sad and keep crying and I don‚Äôt think they want to be around me. I love them so much, they are the first person to ever love me like this and be patient with me and literally hold me through anxiety attacks. I don‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt let go of those moments and just stfu. I don‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt and can‚Äôt believe they love me after a while. Now it feels like they will never see me the same. I hurt them. Bc i can‚Äôt just not be a ducking insecure crybaby I ruined the one god thing I had going in my life. I love them so much, I just have never been treated this way before or had someone want to build a future with me. I couldn‚Äôt believe it and now it feels like it will never happen. I want to punish myself. I want to stomp on my own ribs. I hate being like this. Does the dialogue in anyone else‚Äôs head convince you that the people you love don‚Äôt love you and just pity you? How do I fix this? What kind of therapist do I ask for? I just need fucking help. I want to get on a plane and disappear but that also feels cowardly and all about me again. I feel so ashamed and guilty and I can‚Äôt handle it. I just didn‚Äôt know how else to say it and I wanted to address the things I said when they came up but I got scared but it was getting unbearable in my head bc I see them everyday we share a bed. I just stopped seeing my friends and the thoughts about my friends not needing me stopped. I was the problem and I removed myself and I fixed it. I think my friends were just tired of my depression. My partner has such a positive outlook for me and when I feel good everything is perfect and feels nice and I‚Äôm capable and deserving of love. Then days literally turn Gray and I feel like it must be some sick joke to love me. My parents don‚Äôt so why would anyone else. I finally fucked it up like I thought I would. What do I do now? Where do I go? Should I just leave and just seal the deal and be a complete dick and disappear so I can let them find peace and someone who won‚Äôt hurt them. I don‚Äôt know what to do. How do I fix myself? How do I sincerely apologize without saying I‚Äôm sorry. Sorry will not cut it at this point. I just want them to know I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt them even if the outcome is what I was worried about. I never want them to hurt again. I don‚Äôt ever want to hurt them again. How do I go on? 
I feel psychotic because of how different my moods can be. How people in my perception can just shift so quickly. I just want normal thoughts and to not be like this.",30Nov2020,1

I dont want to fuck up our friendship but I need to get it out. but I dont even want a relationship, and I know he's uncomfortable with intimacy and he only has sex when he's hammered so there's no overlap anyway like it straight up would only make shit awkward and I dont wanna lose him",30Nov2020,1

I got divorced this year, so obviously I‚Äôm not rushing myself to get married or anything. I‚Äôm happy for my friends, but at the same time there feels like a clock on me. My family has already begun to ask ‚Äúhow‚Äôs dating?‚Äù Even though it hasn‚Äôt even been a year since I got divorced. 

My friends start talking about how planning process is going and then ask me the same thing my family asks. I‚Äôm not completely over what happened, but it‚Äôs hard to open up to other guys and say Im not ready emotionally to date. 

Therapy has been wonderful, but from time to time thoughts creep in about meeting a timeline. My parents married young and are still really happy. This really affected my perception on love and I thought my ex would be like that with me. So subconsciously, I felt like I wanted to be like my parents married young and long lasting love. Obviously, every love story is different, so pushing away the idea of some kind of timeline has taken some work.

229,"Third time's the charm, not gonna rewrite even if it's not the charm.

Freshman year of highschool, I did very stupid lazy things. Ended up getting a grade behind. Not that much of a biggy when I say it like that but I feel absolutely crappy, I'll elaborate.

During freshman year I had like no friends in school, or more accurately didn't feel like anyone wanted to be my friend. To be honest I'm not sure why. I had so many people rooting for me, and I failed them. I've kinda moved on from that a bit, never gonna make the same mistakes, don't think they hold any grudges. I was able to finish 9th grade although it took like two school years. Now I'm in 10th grade, should've been in 11th. I'm doing online school and it's going pretty good so far. I get my work tuned it fast, and good grades. And when I say fast I do mean it, I have a lot of time left in the day. 

I've know people for just about my whole life and never really connected to them, which has kinda got me skeptical about getting a job. That said I've gotten better with socializing over this year which is kinda funny because this year has been so, anti social. I really want to get a part time job but I don't wanna make a commitment that I can't keep.

 Would it be foolish if I apply for a job, worried that I might crash like on freshman year, but I've also changed. I might not crash and it might be okay. Dont know if I should risk it or if it will be that big of a risk. Should also probably mention I don't have a driver's license, my parents would have to drive me to work everyday which I would be grateful for but they've already done so much for me idk if I should ask for me. I'm going to get my license in about a year but it seems like a while to wait.

I'm thinking about working at Chick-fil-A so if anyone has tips for application on that or what hours look like, it would be greatly appreciated. Or even if working there is good or not.",30Nov2020,1
230," Ever since I was a child my father has openly told me I was his favorite child and he loves me more than he's ever loved anyone. My entire life whenever I wanted he would take me out of school, take me to his work, buy me almost anything I wanted. He used to take me out with him when he bought alchohol and made me promise I wouldn't tell if he bought me snacks and as a kid I thought it was the best deal ever. We were very close when I was young, in fact we slept in the same bed up until I was 13. I dont remember anything inappropriate happening aside from cuddling, for a long time my mom would sleep in the living room and it would just be my father and I in their room. My mom had openly said she was jealous because he would never cuddle her and he always wanted to sleep with me. My mom and I were distant because of my father's closeness to me and my older siblings resented me because I never got in trouble and always received gifts and special privileges. My father was an alcoholic around this time and had abusive tendencies, the punishments my siblings endured were never given to me, I remember one time when I was around 6 he even let me choose their punishment. Right before I entered middle school things started to change and I became more distant towards him and wanted more privacy. I stopped sleeping  in his bed because I began to feel uncomfortable. Around this time my mom took trips to California a lot to help my aunt take care of her mother, I was always scared for her to leave because my father would always drink and harrass me when she left. He would try to convince me to hang out with him and ask my why I never sleep with him anymore, eventually when I wouldn't give in he would become angry. I felt extremely uncomfortable with him, he made me feel unsafe and I could never quite figure out why entirely. A few years go by and he's now sober but his behavior to me compared to my siblings still concerns me. Almost everyday he'll let something slip that makes me extremely uncomfortable. Last year I moved states with my boyfriend (as a legal adult) for a few months and he told me if I lose my innocence our relationship will be ruined and I wont be his baby anymore.

  A little backstory. My son, 18, and his gf 16, had been together for about a year. Right before his 18th birthday, his gf mom called me. She had some concerns about the age difference, and since my son graduated, and her daughter has a couple years left in school, she wanted them to separate.

249,"***Trigger warning: mental illness, self-harm, anorexia(?)***

So I am in my teens and it's been a few years since I've been wanting to see a therapist.

I've felt this way for a pretty long time but only really realised how bad it is during quarantine. I am depressed, used to get a lot of panic attacks (long period of time, always when I woke up and at night but pretty much throughout the day too. I now think they are phases of dissociation, but my reaction to it is pretty similar to panic attacks. It is better now, but I still experience them). I would also self-harm as a way to cope which I haven't done for a month or 2. I'm also always exhausted. I can sleep for 9 hours and still nap during the day.

During online school, I even nap for every 10 minutes I have free because I don't know if ill be able to be awake during the classes if I don't. The worst with all of this is that I don't feel my feelings are valid because I have a BAD memory and always feel like I'm exaggerating how I feel. Which I know isn't true, but I just can't stop thinking this.

I also am really anxious all the time and I don't know the reason. Now all of this is probably the result of one thing and I have ADHD, which can cause episods of dissociation. The problem is: it is affecting my life.

During quarantine, as I'm overweight, I used to see a nutritionist so I could lose some fat. I know I'm young, but that was my choice. I had lost about 50 lbs before but gained it all back so I wanted to do it again. This was done healthily with exercise and healthy food. I had meetings with that woman once a month and I guess it was too much pression on me to have something to tell her. It really is not her fault, she was absolutely supportive.

I started to force myself to throw up for about 2 months. I was hiding it from everyone, especially the nutritionist. I would do it even if I only drank something which was an easy thing to be done during quarantine as I was always at home. My mom saw me and asked me if I needed to see a therapist. I said no. Not because I didn't want to, but because I literally was physically unable to say anything else.

As for now, anytime I think about asking her, nothing comes out. I honestly don't feel comfortable talking to her about my problems, not because of her, I just don't want to talk about it to her. She also regularly asks me if I'm alright and I say yes before I can even think about it.

Now what I would like to have advice for: I know I can't tell her directly. How could I tell her in a way that I wouldn't have to say it directly to her and also avoid a conversation about it?

251,"Note: my ADHD meds wore off a few hours ago, so this *might* be confusing and repetitive.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I watch a lot of porn. A few months over a year ago one of my friends introduced me to hentai, specifically loli. So for the past year I've been watching/reading a lot of loli. Since Febuary-ish, I've been watching/reading *only* loli. For a while, I was unbothered by it, but recently I read something that said loli was literal child porn.   
I honestly didn't *watch* porn that much, my attention span is too short to watch videos. I don't think the videos I watched had underage kids though. (Besides like teacher/student stuff, which I thought was fine because regular porn has teacher/student stuff. But now I feel like its fucked up because with regular porn, it's two adults, its just one of them role-playing as underage. But with hentai, the character is literally a minor).   
But for the stuff I read... it's anyone's guess. At least it was. I use nhentai, and often I read things in a language I don't know. Usually because i can't find it in English. But after reading the thing about a lot of loli being CP, I used google translate to translate one hentai manga for one I had seen and been planning to read. Basically... it ended up being about a like 40 yr old and a 4th grader.... i wanted to throw up and I spent the rest of the day laying in bed trying to convince myself that I'm not real and that I never read any of that shit. 

I've tried to stop, though a few months ago I realized I have a porn addiction, and it's been so hard for me. Like it's not just stopping an unhealthy addiction to porn in general, it's also stopping something that's morally wrong and illegal. 

One time I tried to do it w/o porn yk. But like after I finished, I realized that part way through I had replaced the normal porn stuff with images from hentai that I had read regularly/repeatedly. I also translated the stuff I had read regularly and almost all of it had kids that were underage. So I basically got off to CP. And I mean before at least I hadn't known, yk? Because now I know and I still ended up getting off to it. I can't get off w/o those images popping into my head. I either manage to just stop completely when they pop into my head, or I try to ignore them and they just come back more aggressively until I can't push them away and they swarm my head and I can't think and afterwards I realize what just happened. (The sentences I translated always come hand in hand with the images. Like in the back of my brain there's something going ""Uh, *no* you dumbass. loli is bad remember?"". But it's just in the back of my head, and I'm barely aware of it. And afterwards I realize that I had the thoughts while I was getting off and I feel like I got off while being fully awae of it. Not just that, but it feels like the knowing that it's pretty much CP is what I actually got off to. Like I'm a fucking pedo. I actually just realized this while I was typing this out. This is actually very relieving, to realize that I'm not getting off to the fact that it's CP.)   
I end up crying every time I realize it's happened again. I've even tried punishing myself. Like hitting myself if it happens, digging my nails into my skin as hard as I can without drawing blood (because then my parents will start asking questions), not letting myself sleep, making myself listen to sounds that I hate, or touch things that have textures that always make me want to cry for some reason. But none of it has worked. 

I don't want to be like this anymore. It gross and bad. One of the things I hate the most is that if pedophilia or child human trafficking is mentioned, I always think about how the stuff I used to watch/read  turned out to be CP and from there my brain defaults to 'that manga is hot' bc it was my default for so long (though the trigger was *not* pedophilia/child sexual abuse/children, I feel the need to point out). 

It's so gross and I feel bad all the time and I feel sick 24/7 and there's always a voice in the back of my head saying 'you got off to CP' and I feel dirty just knowing that and I just want to stop thinking about it. I'm scared that I'm a pedo now because I used to watch it. I haven't used any porn sites since I realized the stuff about loli, because I'm scared that I'll end up watching loli again, either out of habit or because I don't care. It makes me so diguested with myself and I want to drink bleach so much. 

Any advice, about intrusive thoughts or porn addiction or whatever, would be super helpful.

**Note: My parents are very anti-porn and anti-sexbeforemarriage. They're religious (duh). They also make me sign that paper that says my therapist can tell them stuff. If possible, I want to get better w/o having to talk to my therapist because my parents will never trust me again if they find out I've been watching porn. (I'm not even joking. They deadass almost took my phone because they went through it and saw a text from my friend from like 4 months prior in which my friend said 'damn'. They look for reasons to ostrasize me. I'm already an almost friendless loner.) But if it really seems like the right move... then idek ig I'll try.**",30Nov2020,1
252,I feel really annoyed by their eating habits. I do about 80% of the meal cooking in the house so normally there's left over for everyone to have 1 more portion. So i put them in a container after for a meal the next day. Every night my youngest brother goes into the kitchen at about 11 pm and eats 3/4 of the leftovers right out of the container. It's gotten to the point where if i pack my lunch for work 2 hours before I leave with a note on top he still eats it. A gallon of milk lasts 1 day in our house. Then he leaves the empty dishes in his room for at least 3 days after. Honestly I'm not upset he's eating late but i wish he would just not eat all of the leftovers right out of the container or food i pack specifically for work. My mom has tried to tell him but she can't really police him if she's asleep or at work. I've asked him to stop but he just doesn't care. What can I do? I've tried hiding it.,30Nov2020,1

I grew up pretty poor and lived in a house with a lot of family members. We had to sell the house because of family disputes. So my parent aren‚Äôt really well off, I think the money from selling the house is in some savings/trust that is held by my aunt. We have been living in a rental home. I mostly take care of the rent. I have been given talks by other family members and they have been trying to get me to buy a house. Trying to paint it as them doing me a favor by getting tax breaks and whatnot.

He‚Äôs never held a conversation with me, never really taught me anything, never really interacted with me growing up, etc. He‚Äôs just there. He‚Äôs a typical narcissist where he does no wrong and blames others for his issues. 

I have been wrongfully blamed for his taking his money and medicine. Everything he loses/forgets/misplaces, he blames it on the rest of the family and berates everyone. Painting himself as the victim in every scenario. There have been times where I could have easily snapped on him and messed him up really bad, but I held back. I feel like if I were to take that route, things would get really ugly.

256,"My total sounds so weird but that's how I feel.
Recently I got kicked out of my boyfriend's parents house because I didn't like how entitled my boyfriends mom was and spoke out about it, but maybe I'll post about it some other day.
I recently moved into a friends house. A lovely couple who were some of the kindest people I've known since the foster system. They have a daughter and two sons.the daughter is the bio daughter of the mom and I will call the daughter L the mom D the dad A one of the sons AJR and the other son T. AJR is the bio kid of A and T is an adopted kid of A. Since moving in I've come to know that L literally doesn't do anything when it comes to school. She would barely attend her zoom classes and never get any schoolwork done. So I started helping her. I got her a notebook to write notes and ask questions she did that for a couple days but as she had no consequence she dropped it. I told her that I'd buy her $30 worth of stuff for each A on her report card but she still doesn't care. I had to literally watch over her computer screen for 3 days to make sure she did a month of late homework bringing one of her classes to a D. I've tried telling her parents to implement a reward system and A is all for it but behind A's back when L is in trouble ,D will reward her. Its making it difficult to implement a reward system for the girl who is 12 years old as she gets basically everything she wants. Another problem is that I was asked to make a chore plan for the house. It took me a couple weeks to do so as they didn't tell me how they did certain things or when others are normally not home. After making it I had A and D look over it and they said it was fine. Literally one week in and it wasn't fine. They weren't even following the plan which is easy enough that even a child could get everything done. But as the kids have no reward system they dont do anything and there is clear disrespect towards A and D by AJR and L just goes behind the back of A to get what she wants because A and D are not on the same plan when it comes to parenting.  

What can I say to help them as they have helped me so that I dont sound like a dick. I have offered incentives for good grades and even said I'll do something like pizza night once a month if they never go a day without doing their chores. And I know certain days people are too busy so I've taken that into account but I don't know what to do",30Nov2020,1

259,"All my life I was pampered by my mom and because of that, I have not a care in the world with problems. Basically from what I was when I was a teenager, this is the same mindset I have.

Since I was a kid and up until now, My mom does all the work at home. She does all the laundry, she's the one who cooks food, basically she does everything and it makes me feel guilty and useless. Up until now this is the case and I haven‚Äôt improved.

By this time I should have been helping with the laundry, the dishes, the cooking, cleaning the house and everything else housekeeping related. I should have learned how to do ‚Äúmanly‚Äù stuff like fixing the sink, changing a car tire, going on adventures, learned to overcome my fear of heights, etc. Instead, I stay at home all day doing nothing but playing games, not talking with people, or hiding when people come to our house.

I am a picky eater and eat mostly unhealthy food. I only eat soft or comfort food which in turn didn‚Äôt make me any leaner and more muscular. I have a body of that of a frail little boy. I don‚Äôt have strong hands, arms or legs, I can‚Äôt run that fast and sweat easily. This is because I don‚Äôt exercise and don‚Äôt have a healthy lifestyle.

I spent my whole life just playing video games, watching too much anime, movies, Netflix, I had no goals in life, no direction, not thinking about the future. Because of that, It took me very long to finish a single course which took me 8 years. Gaming, Anime and Movies became my life instead.

I am not a people person at all. I hide when visitors come to our house. And because I have made this a habit, I am awkward when trying to approach a person and ask questions. I always get bullied and can become the laughing stock of the group.

I was lucky enough to land a job related to my career which was an electrician and but it involved heights and my fear of heights wasn‚Äôt helping, it also required some muscle like carrying big things and doing troubleshooting things and like I said, I have a frail body so basically I was useless.

Since I suck at being an electrician, they placed me over to do admin stuff related paperworks at the same company. Again, I had difficulty because all of there are so many variables to work with and I kept doing wrong things. The manager got so mad at me and I had to get tutored so many times by the staff and they started to hate me.

They put up with me until the end of my contract and were relieved that I was finally gone and replaced with someone with actual skill and someone who had the muscle and the brain.

Then I went freelance. I was able to manage it because they are mostly small businesses, not a lot of variables and was thinking this could be a good career. Then COVID happened and the instability of freelance affected me. I lost a client and then I started to panic and worry that we won‚Äôt be having any money left.

Now at this point I began to panic, all of this overthinking, my anxiety and depression was triggered and regrets and worries began to flood my mind.

I am experiencing:

\-heartbreak

\-palpitation of the heart

\-cannot sleep due to heartbreak and the palpitation

\-loss of appetite

\-slight chills

\-loss of passion to do the things I want and love

I keep asking myself what if I finished school earlier? What if I just developed my manhood instead of staying what I was when I was just a kid? Maybe I could have earned a lot more money and did not have to worry about our finances, my parents medication because they are now too old,

And then I just told myself: I should have grown up.",30Nov2020,1
260,"**TL;DR Boyfriend (22M), of 6 years, broke up with me over a Reddit post and now his friends and family are saying mean things about me and hate me.**

This is an update to my previous post ""My boyfriend (22M), of 6 years, broke up with me over a Reddit post"".

To summarize my last post I have another Reddit account that I have asked personal questions on specifically having to do with my boyfriend's mental health (he's been suicidal) and his behavior in our relationship which many were alarmed and viewed as abusive. He found out about the post and read the comments (specifically calling out his emotionally abusive/ toxic traits) and he was offended, to say the least. He broke up with me that night.

Since that night he has told all his friends and family about this post and they have all started saying mean things about me. I was mainly really shocked when I heard that his mom was saying these things just as much as his friends. His friends called me a slut, a waste of his time, no good for him, telling him that he can find a better ""bitch"" and so on.

His mother has been saying how her son didn't deserve this, and other really nasty things about me. It really confuses me because his mom used to always witness our fights and has seen me cry and breakdown and comforted me. She was even the one to call our relationship toxic in the recent past. When I had reached out to her one night where my partner was having suicidal thoughts she ignored me and apparently now makes fun of him for being suicidal now.

I feel so hurt. I feel so angry. I was told I made these posts for attention and for pity but that isn't the case at all. I made the post on whether his behaviors were normal or abusive because I felt blinded by his love and accepted all of those things even while I felt stressed about them. I thought I was being ungrateful all while he was spoiling me with gifts and things. I couldn't talk to my boyfriend about it because it was always one-sided, I couldn't talk to my family because I didn't want them to hate him, he didn't like me talking to my friend about things between us, I felt hopeless and this was my last resort.

He gets so upset when I speak to my one and only friend about our relationship when it revolves around something serious, but he spoke to all of his friends and his family and I'm supposed to be ok with that? He justifies it because a lot of people commented on those posts but they don't know him, none of our information, location, or real ages were used. I needed advice and an opinion from an outside point of view. Now his friends and family see me as a monster.

I made those posts out of good intentions especially to get advice on his mental health. Everyone on his side is saying it was an invasion of privacy and I understand why, but no one was trying to help me to help him get better and I couldn't just leave him in that state of mind. I didn't want people to hurt his feelings on the ""toxic boyfriend post"", I really didn't. I felt crazy at one point and as if I had no voice or say in the relationship. That those behaviors I had to accept to make it work. I thought his love for me outweighed those behaviors.

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to feel. I haven't stopped crying. I really do feel like the monster they say I am. What should I do about this situation?",30Nov2020,1
261,"So, two things to consider before I begin: One, I have a lot of mental health issues. A big one is PTSD and one of my bigger triggers is things happening to my bed (it's a long story). Two, I recently started a physically intensive factory job and today was my third twelve-hour shift in a row.  
&amp;nbsp;  

So, I came home from work today and my roommate (who is also my ex) was blackout drunk. She was being pleasant enough so I made sure to get some food and water into her then head off to take a shower. I went into my bedroom to grab my towel and noticed that my bed (which I'd made that morning) was all kinds of fucked up. My my flat sheet and thin blanket were half on the floor, a bunch of my (clean? did she do some of my laundry?) clothes were strewn all over the bed, and my comforter was straight up missing.  


I asked my roommate about it and she had no idea... Except her and I discovered my comforter... On her bed... Looking like she'd nested up in it or something.  


So... My instant reaction was absolute fury on the inside because, well, I had intended to go straight to bed after I showered. Now I would now have to wash my comforter before I could use it (I have OCD and it really sucks). That meant I couldn't go to bed for over two hours.  
I tried to stay calm and ask her what happened but she claims she doesn't remember. She acted sheepish about it and ran off to bed though.  
&amp;nbsp;  

So here I sit, trying to decide how to feel and react about this whole thing. I mean, not only did she inconvenience me but that's really creepy, isn't it?  It's certainly an invasion of my space but seriously, grabbing your ex's blanket to snuggle up with? Eh...

263,"Insurance policy #1: (current plan)
(Individual health Insurance)

$273 per month paid soley by me
$7,800 yearly deductible
Covers yearly exams only in full
$30 co pay for other specialty visits like therapy, which I go about 2x per month.
Co-pay does not go towards deductible. 
Side Note: Customer care has been phenomenal through them.

Insurance policy #2:
(Insurance provided by employer)

1/2 paid by employer; $286 paid per month paid by me. 
$2,800 yearly deductible.
Covers yearly exams.
No copays.
All visits are paid by me, but goes toward the yearly deductible. 

Where I'm stuck at is, option 2 would be great in case of unforseen medical complication or if I were planning on having a child. However since I go to the therapist 2x a month instead of paying $60 for my copays for the month I would then be paying $320 per month. Which of course would be applied to the deductible and I would meet my deductible around September of next year, but that's a lot of money. However, I do know a low deductible is good to have. I am hoping to get an IUD placed early next year, so maybe it would be worth it to have insurance #2 for that reason as well. I'm hoping to call for an estimate of placement for one tomorrow. 

If anyone could provide any insight on my options it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",30Nov2020,1

This friend I'm particularly fond of because he's very non-judgemental and always offers great advice.

He was already going through a rough time when things started going in a downward spiral and our lives turned into anxiety ridden dumpster fires and we're both to blame. I get the feeling he now prefers not to talk to me because I probably cause stress/anxiety. Even though talking to him anxiety-inducing for me now too, losing one of the few people I trust is worse. I can't stop worrying about it! I'm even having nightmares at this point.

269,"So obvious alt acc here, I sent an image of myself on some rate me subreddit since I was feeling insecure, then suddenly, a throwaway account messages me saying ""16f here, ur hot asf"". I didn't really believe it at first, but we chatted more and decided to move to kik.

On kik, she started asking for more photos of me, I was really confused because ""why would anyone want these"", but I gave some anyways. Slowly, the mood of the conversation started slowly going to a more ""horny"" conversation (and my dumbass didn't realise it). She started asking for more photos of me, shirtless, saying ""I'll send some back"" with a bunch of emojis. I was still nervous and confused but with enough convincing from her, I ended up doing it. (I didn't refuse so I admit it was really my fault, also, we both knew I was still 16, I should've ended it there)

After all that, she started asking for more, photos of me in just my underwear, (I was so stupid for not realising she wanted me to go slowly strip myself down), and she sent me her shirtless photo, I got so shaky during that, I kind of wanted to end it there but at the same time, this voice kept telling me (this is what you wanted right? What you fantasised about for so long),,, I fucked up and gave in.

We started trading nudes. Something I've never done before and never thought I would do before, one thing I should have done here was ask her to do a very specific pose, but other than that, I should have said no from the very start.

Then it progressed to her asking vids of me masturbating, I know it's fucked because we're both minors (or claim we are), but of course being the idiot that I am, I gave some.

After I came from that, she asked for one more pic, then I still wanted a video from her (my sex drive is really messed up) so I asked her for one, then after that, she ended up ghosting me.

It's been 1 day and there's still no response, I feel like I was ""manipulated"" or some bullshit but I'm sure I just fucked up. This situation really showed me that fantasy is so different from reality (I have a fetish of being used), I felt like I was only used for sexual pleasure, when I really wanted to know each other more before doing things like that, it sucks. One theory from my friend is that the account was a fake account who got nudes from other people (I tried reverse searching and nothing similar came up), and that I'm part of the whole nudes scheme or whatever.

272,"Hello. I am struggling because I relied on her too much for everything. My entire crutch was pulled out beneath me. I realize it's my own fault. We dated for almost a year and she was my best friend. She felt like my only friend.

&amp;nbsp; 

I'm struggling to do anything. I feel like all I can think about is how I ruined our relationship and set myself up for disaster. I have friends, and some of them marginally close, but none that I actually feel comfortable talking to like I do her. None that I really open up to. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like nobody wants to talk to me, nobody wants to hang out with me. I don't want to wake up, do school, apply to college. I feel like I'm being dramatic but I've just been going through a lot and she has gotten me through all of it. I'm trying to face it all on my own and I can't. 

&amp;nbsp;

She made me feel secure, like I didn't have to worry who I was around her. She motivated me to work and get shit done because it meant that I could spend time with her later. She was my social life. I know I fucked up by doing this but I've never been able to make close friends because I'm so fucked up. I just need something to fill this big gap in my life. I'm afraid",30Nov2020,1

I could tell that some flavors were my citrusy than others. As for smell, its not there. Things that smell good, like perfume, smell weird to me and vinegar just burns my nose. If it‚Äôs a super strong smell, I can smell it for a second and then it goes away again.",30Nov2020,1
274,"I just don't know what to do. I'm a 22 year old, 5'6 guy at 280 pounds, and I want to make a gradual plan to lose weight over the next 2 and a half years. My goal is 160-170 pounds, probably more when I reach that. I want to use the CICO method, but I'm confused on how to keep that progressing, especially gradually. I don't know how much I eat on average each day, but I know I've easily reached over 3,500 calories quite a few times whenever I took the moment to calculate all that I ate. 

Today, I did two things: firstly, I intentionally didn't eat anything until after 12:00pm, so for the first 12 hours, I was sleeping for 8, and not eating anything for the other 4. Secondly, I didn't eat any more than 2,200 calories, and that was with overestimating how much I ate. I tend to bump up the calorie counts of many foods because I don't trust that the people selling them are giving an accurate estimation, so as to make selling said food easier to people conscious about how much they eat. For example, if something says it's 170 calories for x amount, and I eat x amount, I bump it up to 200 calories. Trusting the calorie counts, it was 2,100 calories. That was probably too little today, so I'll make sure to eat more than that tomorrow, perhaps a limit of 3,000 calories for now. And then after a while, 2,500? And etc.?

But how do I progress from that? I know eventually my body will get used to it, so how do I keep losing weight gradually while not reducing calorie intake too low? I'm all over the place with this, and I don't even know if what I did today was the right step, I'm just so confused. If someone would be willing to help me iron this out, I'd be very thankful.",30Nov2020,1
275,"So the other night my ex girlfriend started texting me late at night. It went from texting to a phone call and then to FaceTime for a couple of hours. She was telling me about how her new relationship is ‚Äúthe worst thing she‚Äôs ever gotten into‚Äù and also that‚Äôs she still loves me and misses me everyday. To top it off, at one point she starts talking about her boobs and how they have grown and then proceeded to show me them. The way I saw it at the time maybe she wanted to break up with him and get back to me, I mean I still love her too. 

Fast forward to the next day and I find that I have been blocked. I then reach out to her through a friend and we end up talking again and she says stuff that is quite the opposite of the night before. Such as mine and her previous relationship was actually worse than her current one, and that she loves her boyfriend. 

This hit me like a truck because I was extremely excited to talk to her again. Also it made me sick that she would cheat on him like that if she wasn‚Äôt even fully devoted to ending the relationship already, which is something she made me believe. 

I really want to tell her now that if she doesn‚Äôt tell him about this than I will. I believe he has a right to know and I don‚Äôt want her to get away with this. Not to mention that we broke up about 3-4 months ago and we dated for 3 years before that.

To clarify, this is when two people hold either end of the Thanksgiving turkeys wishbone and pull it apart at the count of three.

This year we pulled as usual and our remaining bone pieces were the exact same size. However, my sisters piece was still connected to the bone apex by a single thread of ""meat string"" not bone. She contends this is a win. I argue the bone is the binding factor for being granted the wish. I declared a draw. She has indicated the intent to file appeals.

281,"My mom is absolutely convinced I'm about to snap and kill myself/spiral into a deep depression. As a result, she's been so nice that it's making me guilty. She admitted part of this is irrational and due to things thatve happened in the past that make her tear up and feel inadequate as a human being, even though I've forgiven her years ago, and have told her so many times since. Recently I've actually gotten out of depression, and according to her, my personality did a 180 and she's not used to it. I know how worried she is though, because a lot of her searches are mental health-related (Warning signs of suicide, how to parent autistic child, etc.) and she's been showing a stupid amount of favouritism towards me, which is fucking my brother up emotionally, since he's the one who needs the support the most as he went through some hardships. 

She's spending a stupid amount of money on things to convince me that life is worth living, that I'm loved, has been encouraging me to get a boyfriend (but it's fine if I'm a lesbian, she'll do her best to accept it, even though it might break her heart a bit according to her), dye my hair, small tattoos, etc. This comes as a huge shock because she used to be really conservative, and would strictly monitor everything such as food intake, grades, who I'm friends with, flush my pet down the toilet, the like. But now she's buying me junk food and fast food pretty much every day, splurges on my pets, and trying to set me up with good looking guys she thinks I might like rather than traditional, kind and educated ones.

282,"Hi. I don't post a lot I hope I am doing this right. 

I (18F) live in a 3 bedroom 1 bath house. There are 6 of us. That means there are two people to every room in the house. I share a room with my sister(12F). My two brothers (24M and 21M) share a room and my parents share a room of course. This was fine when I was younger but I am now an adult. Until I move out completely, I do not have privacy. Everyone walks into rooms without asking and everything I do my sister can walk in and get in my business because after all it is her room too. 

About two or three years ago I started to get into moods. I would not want to get out of bed, not want to leave my room or be bothered at all. My sister especially bothered me and she doesn't do anything wrong. She'll ask me if I want food or talk to me and she completely puts up with the moods which just makes me feel bad because I'd want nothing more than for her to just go away. 

I didn't know what was causing it until I left for college. Usually there are tears or sadness or something but I was completely over the moon for the fact that I have space. I have privacy (when my roommate leaves). I can decide when I want to be around people. In my house there is not a room I can go to where I can be alone. I share every single space with another person. In college I can go hide in my room and spend a few hours alone and surround myself with other people when I please. But at home it is not a choice. I HAVE to be around other people CONSTANTLY. It really bothers me because I am such an independent person and in college I often spend several hours in the day alone. At home I only get time to be alone when everybody goes to bed or if I leave the house (which is hard because I don't have a car and it's getting cold out).

I am just visiting right now and going back up to college in a month but I have no idea how I am going to survive and to make matters worst, I hate taking it out on my family, however I can't help it because I get extremely stressed every time my space is invaded. I have been irritable and crabby all day because I cannot get a moment to myself. I tried to explain to them the way I was feeling and my dad responded: ""Well I won't be here tomorrow if that makes you happy"" and my mom said: ""Well you're just going to have to get used to it."". Neither of which helped too much.

Does anybody have any advice on how I can get some space? I can't  go visit friends at the moment, I don't really have people to talk to on the phone, and I cannot currently drive. I have no idea how I can get away from my family just for a while. And I don't want to go insane. Or lose it on them (because my dad's comments on the situation are especially annoying and I am bad at keeping my mouth shut).

To conclude, please help.",30Nov2020,1

Friday night I let him know I‚Äôm back and ask what he‚Äôs up to. he says he‚Äôs not doing anything so I ask if he wants to hang and he never responds. So I‚Äôm annoyed obvs but guess maybe he found someone else or just didn‚Äôt wanna hang.

TONIGHT he hits ME Up and apologizes and says he didn‚Äôt see it then and asks what I‚Äôm doing.

\-My last period ended November 2nd

\-I had unprotected sex Nov. 9 ( Cycle day #12) for a couple of seconds (around 8 secs) i know that the amount of time doesn't matter bc when it is unprotected there is always a risk, however I am saying this so you know he pulled out waaaaay before he was ever close to ejaculating. He then used a condom and finished. Still, I freaked out and took Plan B the morning after. Since this happened on the 12th day of my cycle and my ovulation was scheduled to happen 3 days later November 12th, I guess Plan B delayed ovulation by idk how many days.

\-The thing is, on Nov 17 (cycle day 20) it happened again for a couple of seconds and now I am so mad at myself. He put it in and after 8 seconds he pulled out and said he was not in the mood so he never ejaculated that night. I didn't take Plan B after that bc I thought ovulation could have already occurred.

\-Now I am on cycle day 32 and I am super scared of being pregnant bc of precum even though both times it was literally for a max of 8 seconds and round 1.

\- considering that plan b delayed my ovulation day, when could I take a test? I am more worried about the second time (nov 17) bc I didnt take any emergency pill afterwards. Could it be accurate to test 14 days after Nov.17 without knowing my ovulation day?",30Nov2020,1
289,"All of my life I have been labeled smart: I took 10+ AP tests in high school, scored a 1590 on the SATs, won some local math competitions. According to my parents, I haven‚Äôt put in as much effort as other people. For math tests, I would only do the required problems and that would be enough for me to obtain an A in high school, although admittedly I did not attend a super rigorous high school. Also, luckily, I was admitted into a super prestigious university in the United States. I don‚Äôt want to brag but just want to give some context to my situation. 

Now that I‚Äôve finished the first semester of college, I‚Äôve never felt so confused in my life.

Basically, the comments have been hinting at that although I might be labeled smart, I‚Äôm also silly and naive.

I feel super confused. Are others jealous of me? Do I have a serious problem? And if so, how do I fix it? 

Maybe I project an image of innocence, but in reality I think I do struggle and I do put in effort. But I guess maybe not so much so as others?

I became friends with this girl back in high school. I didn‚Äôt think that we‚Äôd ever become best friends but we did. She went to the local community college and I went off to a 4 year university. After getting her initial credits she applied at my uni and got in. I was so excited and she was too. When she moved here we hung out almost every single day. I was so happy she was here. It felt great to have someone that I trusted and could be open with. It wasn‚Äôt anything romantic, she was just a great platonic friend. We were both super bummed out when COVID made her lose her job and she had to return home. This was the beginning of the downfall of our friendship. 

I had just started a new job and she was focusing on transitioning to online classes. We‚Äôd text only a few days out of the week and it‚Äôd be dry. Then we started going a whole week between talking to each other. At that same time I had a lot of bad things happening in my family, not directly to me but stuff that needed my attention and ppl that needed my support. This led to me not talking to most of my friends for an entire month. I actually suck out counseling following this month bc I couldn‚Äôt deal with the things happening in my life. 

I did feel happy knowing that my best friend was moving back before the start of school, and that gave me some hope. When she came back we decided to go out to eat, but something was different. She was upset with me bc I forgot her birthday, but I had already apologized and tried my best to make up for it. The entire conversation she seemed annoyed with me and looked at me as though it was a chore to eat lunch with me. After lunch I asked her if she wanted to go to the mall or someplace and she simply said ‚ÄúI wanna go home‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt give a reason or anything, very unlike her. I thought maybe she was having a bad day and that I should give her space. 

A few days later I texted her asking if she wanted to get lunch. She told me no, and then left me on read. Fast forward 3 months to the present and she texts me occasionally to say ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù but we haven‚Äôt hung out since that day. It makes me wonder if that was the day she got tired of being my friend. I don‚Äôt know if it was my personality or the fact I‚Äôm not the best looking guy. Maybe she was ashamed to be my friend, idk but I have no closure and it bothers me. 

Ik as a guy I‚Äôm expected to not care and move on with my life but I genuinely cared about her as a friend and trusted her with some personal information that I‚Äôve never told anyone else so it hurts that she has kind of abandoned our friendship. To make it all worse she lives right across the street from me. I‚Äôm sorry for typing so much but as I type this im tearing up bc I never saw this coming.

Last there's my wife. She's an immigrant from Angola (in Africa). We met in college, I was a math major and she was studying nursing. Then graduate school together, then we left our college town in the Rust Belt and moved out to Texas (jobs). Got married, then careers, then kids.

My wife is a highfalutin nurse manager for a large health system &amp; works as a fill-in at any of maybe 11 different hospitals. The work itself is a lot of desk work, mostly. She also teaches nursing online. In her off time she drinks, eats compulsively and watches trash TV on Bravo. (I'm a non drinker.)

As her career took off, I got downsized from a Texas college teaching position (dept. closed down, it wasn't a ""for cause"" thing). I collected some unemployment (this was before the pandemic), wound up teaching our kids at home &amp; being a house husband.

I'm broke. All our money goes into wife's personal accounts, which I'm locked out of. She doles out some money here or there when we have to pay bills or buy groceries, but she hoards her earnings like Scrooge McDuck. She sends a lot of it back to Angola to her siblings &amp; elderly parents.

But the thing about my wife is her anger, temper, threats and verbal abuse. It's a combination of home sickness (Africa is far away), the 3 ish jobs she works, the kids and all of their energy, and what I consider to be a possible anger management or other problem she may be dealing with. Her anger is vitriolic, she never hesitates to put me in my place. ""You're a loser. A man in Angola would be working and supporting his family."" ""You're stupid."" ""Why did I marry you."" And on and on.

She refuses to consider that she may be overworking or have a problem dealing with anger. She calls me the crazy one.

Between getting screwed out of my dad's money (which would've helped get a divorce or make other big life changes), my mom's crud that won't stop, and my wife's problems... I don't know what to do. Some of my friends say... hang in there for the kids... but I know with wife's money they'll be taken care of no matter what.

I dream of just leaving this all and going somewhere new. Starting over. Let the wife do whatever she's gonna do legally, sign anything she puts in front of me, and just get the F out of Texas and start over. I know there's a million practical reasons not to do that, but that's where my heart is.

Like a classic abuser, when times are good, the wife says she's sorry, doesn't mean the insults, doesn't want to get divorced. But, of course that's all out the window as soon as she has another mood swing.

The abuse here from the wife is verbal... not physical... but how much can one person take? I don't go after her verbally or otherwise, at least not like she doss me, but I do defend myself and call her on her hypocrisy a lot.

I got squeezed out of an inheritance, my mother hates me, and my wife hates and demeans me.

316,"I (21f) have recently begun talking again to a (22m) past love interest/date/people who use to like each other. We went to high school together. Never really spoke much. In college we kind of reconnected, back when I was 18 and he was 19. I should say my first year in college, he went to trade school to become an electrician. We are from Georgia, he stayed in our hometown. However, I go to college in Michigan. We spoke off and on my freshman year of college via text/social media, nothing serious ever really happened with it as I was busy with my life in Michigan and him with his back home in Georgia. Over that summer, 2019, I took and internship in Michigan for the summer. I was honestly pretty lonely as all my college friends went back home for the summer and I was up in Michigan working my first professional/office job. I began talking to him more during this time. We got to know each other a little better and he asked if I wanted to hang out when I came home in October for fall break. I said yes and we agreed to go to the beach. 

Honestly, I was very unsure with what he wanted. I didn‚Äôt know if he was coming over hoping for us to casually hook up or coming over because he liked me and wanted something more serious. He never asked for nudes or anything like that- it was very much entirely us talking to each other with no focus on the sexual aspect. I do not do casual hook ups. I would like to, but I can‚Äôt, I get way too attached way too easy and it destroys me emotionally. I just can‚Äôt handle it. I really don‚Äôt have a problem with kissing or getting fingered by someone I am interest in but that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs as far as it goes. At that point I need to put it to a stop and kind of figure out where I stand with a dude. Anyway, that being said, at this pint I have also not had sex in two years/since I was with my last boyfriend. Like I said, I cannot do casual, it leads me into an emotional train wreck, so my choice is to just not have sex. 

Anyway- we live about 45 minutes away from each other so the plan was for him to pick me up and then go over to the beach- about a 5 minutes drive from my house. He rings my door bell, I answer the door, give him a hug, and let him come him in because I still have to grab my towel and sunblock. He comes inside, and to my surprise, says ‚Äúwhen do I get to meet your parents?‚Äù Which was an incredibly shocking statement to me. Anyway, I told him my mom was at work, because she was, and my dad was in his office on a conference call, because he was.

Anyway, we get in his truck and go to the beach. We have a fun time. We like a lot of the same things. We both are more the type to go in the water and goof off as opposed to sit on the shore. So we dug a hole and buried me in it and then dug more holes and I think we both had a really really good time. 

We then left and went to Chick fil A because it was about dinner time and took it back to my house and ate it at the table and watched hydraulic pressure videos on YouTube which was also a lot of fun. My dad came out of his office and said Hello and he met him. Then he asked if he could take a shower and I said of course. So he took a shower and while he was in the shower I vacuumed the sand out of his car because I think it‚Äôs a polite thing to do. We then lit a bunch of candles and poured the wax together and put it in the microwave for a very long time. Which is also, probably really strange, but we both had a lot of fun doing it. 

My mom then got home from work, and was a little surprised because I didn‚Äôt tell her I was having a boy over. It wasn‚Äôt a secret, my dad knew, I just assumed he would probably be gone by the time she left so there wasn‚Äôt really a point in bringing it up beforehand. Anyway, we all talked for like an hour and had pretty good conversation and it wasn‚Äôt awkward. My mom then left the room and he said Can I come back tomorrow? Again, I was a little shocked because typically people don‚Äôt ask for a second ‚Äúhang out‚Äù while still in the first one. However, I very much wanted him to come back too so I said yes. But before he left for the day we decided to go to Publix (grocery store) to get a pumpkin because we were gonna carve it the next day when he came back. I said I will drive, because I know where the closest publix is, and so we got in my car. When we get in the car he looks me in the eyes and says ‚ÄúI really wanted to eat you out today.‚Äù And I just laughed and started driving. 

Like ??? now I‚Äôm back to not knowing what this is. Is this a date or hook up? Like I get that I go to school 1,000 miles away so there has to be some facilitation of a relationship virtually but there has also been no mention of anything sex related up until this point. So what is going on that on the first date you‚Äôre going to look me eyes and say you want to eat me out? 

Anyway, we get to Publix, pick a pumpkin, and go home. We leave the pumpkin at my house. We hug goodbye. And he leaves. 

The next morning he texts me and tells me he forgot he had to work today would it be okay if he came the next day (a Friday). I said yes. It‚Äôs not a problem at all- totally normal thing to happen. 

I assumed again that my parents would be there, and liked that because it kind of prevents things from going to a place of too sexual too soon, for my personal taste. However, on Thursday my Mom texts me that she will not be coming home Friday, she‚Äôs leaving for a business trip. My brother, I just have one sibling, is going to be out of town for a baseball tournament, and he‚Äôs leaving Thursday morning. My dad says he‚Äôs going to watch the tournament, and he‚Äôs leaving Thursday night. So now, I am going to be alone at the house on Friday. I wasn‚Äôt going to cancel, because I need be able to handle the situation myself. 

Friday comes, he comes over at like 2. We carve the pumpkin. Well mainly he does because it‚Äôs hard for two people to carve a singular pumpkin. Anyway, after the pumpkin we go inside and decide to play a game and we end playing Guess Who. We play for a little while and he asks if I want to drink. I said okay, because I do enjoy drinking. He asked if it was okay if sleepover if we drink. I said yes because obviously I am not going to encourage drunk driving. So, we go to the store and get two four lokos, per my request. 

On our drive to the store we talked about normal things. He asked me why my last boyfriend and I broke up. Which is fine, I don‚Äôt mind the question at all. He also said to me ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell if you like me or not‚Äù. I had no idea what he meant by that. Like in general? Or like like? So I said well if I didn‚Äôt I wouldn‚Äôt have let you come over. Which in hindsight was a pretty stupid answer and I should have just said yes. But. What‚Äôs done is done. 

We come home, order a pizza, are drinking and continue to play Guess Who. We then get tired of that and move to watching TV. He starts playing with my hair and then asks if can kiss me. I said yes and we start making out. He then takes my shirt off and his off. Then my pants and starts fingering me and then eating me out. I became a little uncomfortable, because I think he wanted it to go further than this and this was the maximum amount I was comfortable we with for now but I think he got the message and stopped. We both enjoy a pretty rough time sexually which is also very excellent. I don‚Äôt want someone who will be rough for me because I like it but because we both like it, and this checks that box. However, I am again unsure whether he‚Äôs here for a hookup or because he likes me. Anyway, he carries me to my room and puts me in my bed and says to me he can sleep on the couch if I want him to. I said no he can sleep in my bed. So he slept in my bed and there was no cuddling or anything. For me, I did not want to initiate any cuddling because I don‚Äôt want to give some sort of mixed signal that I want things to go further. I can‚Äôt speak for him, but I assume he didn‚Äôt initiate anything because he didn‚Äôt want to make it seem like he was trying to push things further after I had indicated that I wanted to stop. 

We wake up in the morning and he asks if I want to go in my pool. I said yes and get up to get dressed and put on my bathing suit. We go in my kitchen and stand around and he then asks if I want to ‚Äúfinish what we started last night.‚Äù I did not say anything and just stood there like a fence post. Honestly I was thinking it was finished. He comes over. Picks me up and takes me to my room. We make out again, takes my top off, he takes his off shirt off, takes my pants off. Starts fingering me and eating me out. I am just laying there thinking oh god I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm gonna have to just tell him to stop again. 

Like I feel bad because this is somebody I am interested in. However, I have no idea what the situation is? Does he like me or is this a hook up? I need time to think about my emotions and how I‚Äôm feeling. I also have an IUD, if you get an STD with an IUD you can get infections that cause all your eggs to go sterile. So it‚Äôs important to me that my partner and I have an STD test done before we have sex. 

Anyway, he‚Äôs eating me out and looks up and says did you cum. And I said no. Because I didn‚Äôt. And like, I don‚Äôt care at all. I still had a good time with someone I like. I also find it incredibly hard to orgasm the very first time with a new person. I think a lot of it, for girls at least, is being in the right headspace and being very comfortable with your partner. I would honestly prefer to not orgasm the first time because it‚Äôs just too much emotions for someone I‚Äôm not that familiar with yet. 

Anyway, I think he was a bit bummed out that I‚Äôd didn‚Äôt orgasm. He got back in top of me and said ‚Äúdo you want to have sex?‚Äù And I said ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought, do you want to suck my dick?‚Äù And I said ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought.‚Äù After that we put our clothes back on and went back into the kitchen and sat in there for about 5 minutes and then he said he was going to leave because he had work later. So I told him goodbye at the door and gave him a hug. 

That was a pretty hurtful sequence of events for me. I do not think he knows that but it was. I a lot of times lead myself down a path of thought of ‚Äúif you liked someone why would you say that to them?‚Äù I think he must not realize how hurtful that was for me? I don‚Äôt know. But that was pretty hurtful to me. 

We continued to talk per usual. I went back to school 2 days later because break was over. I thought a lot about what had happened. It is hard for me to have sex so easily with a new person. However, I also think sex is a really big part of what makes a relationship work. So I decided that I kind of needed to be willing to make some progress on that. Especially since I spend most of my time in Michigan, it can be hard to make that work. I agreed to send him some nudes and it wasn‚Äôt anything expansive. Just 1 or 2 here and there. It was something I was comfortable with doing and something that he liked so I thought it was some good common ground to work with. I came home in December and decided it was probably my turn to ask him to hang out so I asked and he said ‚ÄúI am busy.‚Äù I was disappointed, but decided it is very fair for people to be busy. So a week later I asked if he wanted to hang out soon and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy.‚Äù Neither time was it a I‚Äôm busy what about next week? Just I‚Äôm busy. So, to me, that‚Äôs a pretty clear message. If you ask someone to hang out twice and both times they give an empty I‚Äôm busy with not attempt to reschedule, they don‚Äôt want to hang out. I was upset. I was angry with him. I felt kind of played. I continued to still speak to him but much less and kept him at bay and eventually go back to school in early January. 

In early February (2020), he messages me and asks me, kind of out of the blue if back in October when he came over if I had feelings for him. I said I did but didn‚Äôt really feel they were reciprocated, as I then asked him multiple times after that if he wanted to hang out and he declined both times. He said that makes sense and asked why when he ate me out I didn‚Äôt reciprocate that to him. I told him I wasn‚Äôt comfortable doing that because I felt like I didn‚Äôt know him enough for that yet. He said okay. I then asked him what‚Äôs wrong (as he seemed sad) and he told me he feels like he will never have a girlfriend that likes him as much as he likes her. I had no idea what to do with that information as I do not ever think that I was formally his girlfriend so I was like I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. Anyway, I took from this conversation that things were going to get better. I thought this was an acknowledgement of what we need to do to fix this. We started talking more again, and the general this and that. Things got a little more in depth. I asked him to send me dick pics and I continue to send him nudes. It got a little more in depth talking wise as well as he told me we could make this work. I started to get excited to come home and see him. 

I came home in March for spring break and he didn‚Äôt ask me to hang out so I said I thought we were going to hang out. He said I can Friday and I said I can‚Äôt I‚Äôll be out of town and then I go back to Michigan but I think school is going to get shutdown because of COVID so I think I will be here longer. He said okay sounds good. Nothing really happens. I again feel upset because I thought this had been fixed and things were going to get better. In late March I decided to tell him this. I told him I was unhappy and thought things were going to get better. He told me that he thought we agreed to be friends. So, essentially, the conversation we had in february we both took two extremely different ways. Anyway, I was a little irritated because at this point I felt pretty dragged. I asked him for more of an explanation. He eventually told me that he had met someone else he was interested in. He said he wanted to be friends and was sorry that I was upset and thought we had agreed to be friends and didn‚Äôt want me to feel upset. 

I don‚Äôt ever stay friends with any of exes. Ever. Ex anything. Ex boyfriend, ex dude I use to talk to. If it‚Äôs done let it be done. 

However, for some reason, I agreed to try to remain friends. I did have a good time together. I also tried to focus on all the reasons why us being together would have never really worked out anyway. 

Anyway, a week of this goes bye and he tells me the girl he was into broke it off with him. I said ‚Äúokay.‚Äù Because what am I supposed to do with this information. At this point in time I hated his guts. 

Summer goes bye, I intentionally barely talk to him. I go back to Michigan for the summer for another internship. The summer passes. I go back to school for the year and I meet this other guy. I have a lot of fun with him, he‚Äôs a nice dude and smart, it never went beyond kissing. I broke it off with him because our personalities just do not match in my opinion. We don‚Äôt really good along on more than a surface level so I end it there- this is around end of October 2020. 

The same week the original guy messages me again and is nonetheless drunk and asks me if I remember the day that he came over in October, which is now a year ago. He asks me ‚Äúbefore I started eating you out, when we were just playing guess who, were you having a good time? It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt remember it. You don‚Äôt have to pretend‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes. I had a really good time.‚Äù And he said ‚Äúme too‚Äù And we now talk all the time again. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
I am at a point where I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have had more fun with this guy than any other guy I have ever met and I think he feels the same way vice versus. I also feel at the same time that this has been exhausted. And I am stuck between two polar ends of I have had more fun with this person than anyone else and that we have also given each other the run around 5 times over. We have an incredible horrible lack of communication. When we do communicate, it‚Äôs horrible, and not direct. Neither of us put our entire selves out on the line ever. It‚Äôs always one foot out the door on both ends. 

We have spoke every single day for 2.5 years. It is at the point where it either needs to happen or needs to be finished. 

In all other instances, with men I have dated, or interacted with, once it is done, it is done forever. If we break up or stop talking it is gone. I have always chosen to never stay friends with my exes. I feel kind of burned by him sometimes because I look back and think what do you mean you like somebody else now? Are you kidding me? Other times, I look back on the conversation we had and realize that very well
also sounds like a ‚Äúwe gave it a good tryü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äù conversation. 

Anyway, as I mentioned, we began talking more again. I am not sure what to do. I have never felt more compatible with anyone in my life but also
feel that this is just beating a dead horse. 

My friends and I are going down to Daytona to go to the beach in December. I am debating whether I ask him to come with us or not. I feel kind of embarrassed by the whole concept. I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. One way or the other I want to lay this to rest and move on, with him or without. 

I like like him and want it to work. But if it isn‚Äôt reciprocated I need find other things to invest my energy in.",30Nov2020,1
317,"Hey! I originally posted this on r/FriendshipAdvice but figured posting here as well may get me more advice.

I‚Äôve texted him probably twenty times and gone to see him at work a handful of times since May and I‚Äôve gotten two texts back.

I haven‚Äôt hung out with him in over a year. 

Should I ask him why he never responds? My parents have told me sometimes you just get busy, and my dad told me how he once went a couple years without talking to his best friend.

At the beginning of this year,a new girl (14F) moved to my school from a very small town in Georgia. I (15F) didn't really ask to many questions about her to friends,but something they said was that her mom passed away this past February. Parents passing away at my school and even in my class isn't a very foreign thing,i could name at least three people off of the top of my head whose parents have passed away. As the school yea began,i started to talk to the girl more and we became very good friends,expressing how much i care about her and how i love her,but she never seems to say it back because she ""has been hurt too much"" and the people who say that love her,have hurt her at some point in time. I slowly noticed that she started to talk to a boy in my class who is not shy about the substances he (15M) uses and the adult activities he has engaged in ever since he was 12. He even told some of his friends (i was sitting close,so i overheard everything) about how his body count is 11 people and how he lost his virginity to a prostitute when he was 12. I have a very large disliking towards this boy,mainly because he bullied me very heavily in 7th and 8th grade,and told me to kill myself in multiple instances. He slowly started to pick on her because of her appearance,and she laughed at him and told him to stop in a playful manner. I saw their relationship progress and i was so confused since he was so mean to her. I'll give a small backstory on this boy,but to keep in short,when him and his brother were kids,his mother heavily used drugs and that eventually led for them to get taken away and placed in the care of his great aunt,who doesn't do a good job of disciplining them. While his mother got better and started a new life for herself,his dad disappeared and i don't think they keep in contact. A while ago i was talking to the girl and i asked her what is the worst thing that she's ever done and i said something small like taking a sip of wine from my mom's drink when she wasn't looking,but her answer caught me so off guard i didn't know what to say to her.She told me about how she's done opioids and was addicted to oxycodone for three months. Fast forward to 3/4 weeks later we were hanging out together in the library at my school,and i was asking her if she wanted to have a sleepover at my house and how my other friends would come,and she agreed that it would be super fun. Then walks in the boy,he sits across from us and he gives the girl a look. She asks him if he has the ""candy"" and she asked if she could have it. I soon saw him take out a vape and give it to her and she soon when to go to the bathroom so she could smoke. I was obviously take aback. someone i thought was so innocent and pure wasn't,and i was so confused about why she would want to kill herself like that and be like him,someone who is throwing his entire life away and being like his mother and father. I wouldn't even have a problem with it if she was 18,even though that is not the legal age to buy cigarettes and things like that,but technically you are an adult. My problem is that she is 14,so young and decides to do this to herself,i'm aware that it isn't my business but i'm very concerned for her if she continues to do it. I refused to talk to her for the rest of the day,since i thought that i shouldn't be friends with someone who is willing to associate themselves with someone with such a bad reputation. I went to a therapy appointment that following week and i told my therapist all about it. She heavily encouraged that i should tell someone and inform the guidance counselor about what these kids are doing. I told her how i didn't want to get her in trouble,since her and he dad's relationship is super bad (he has called her a whore,he sleeps with a new woman every night,and expects her to do everything for him) and i knew that if she got in trouble then her dad would send her to boarding school,which is what he did when he found out about the opioids and the oxycodone. She told me that i should probably try to stop it so it doesn't expand to even worse things. We had the sleepover and it was good,but i am still debating on if i should turn her in, I really am not the type of person to do this,but when its someone i care about and i don't want them to ruin their life,i'll do anything to steer them down a good path.

322,"Almost every single time I walk into the bathroom, there is toilet paper in the toilet along with pee, usually. I have tried multiple times to find the culprit but all my siblings, who are all 12+ and definitely mature and capable enough to flush the fucking toilet, deny it. It got to a point where I had to put a sign up saying ""flush the toilet.""

323,"I (20F) and my fiance (20M) have been basically homeless for about a year. We don't have an address. We live in a camper on his stepdad's property. I am the breadwinner but they always tell me I'm not making the right choices. I lost my home a year ago when my mom stole a credit card and moved across the country, leaving all my belongings and loved ones, so my fiance wouldn't be homeless. He refused to leave me. Now we're here.

We pay our bills on time, buy food and gas, and really only buy necessities. Save for one thing. They don't know we paid $900 to bring what remains of my family here. My fiance told them a friend brought them for free. A friend did bring them. But I paid for it, saving up over 11 months for it.

No matter what I do it'd not good enough. I worry, ""oh you'll be prettier if you smile and forget about it"". I buy a $20 pair of work shoes, ""why are you wasting your money on this?"". Three times, they have given us a choice on where to go with our next step (camper vs apartment, for example), and every time we tell them our choice they say ""no wrong you're doing what I want and you're paying for it"".

I have nothing. We barely have what we need. I started this year with 13 animals. I lost everything and saved 5 of them through friends. We're finally reunited. Now I'm losing them again.

I got them last week, before Thanksgiving. We didn't tell them then because we didn't want to worry them on the holiday. I told his stepdad today. He was okay with it, just wanted us to pick up after them and still save up for a permanent place to live. I told him the truth, that I am, I'm paying student debts and we're saving up for a townhouse deposit while trying to fix our shitbox truck that we're forced to keep by them even though it's ours. He seemed okay with it. A little bothered, but okay. We thought he would be the angry one. Nope.

We got a text 2 hours ago from his mom ""you have until the end of the week to get rid of them or get out. Your girlfriend and HER animals go back to AZ if they don't and I'll remove them myself.""

They're going to separate me and my fiance and they never indicated I wasn't allowed to have them. I was told I would have no help, that's fine. I did it on my own. But even so, it's not good enough. I would rather live in my truck with the 5 of them alone than give them away to who knows what kind of life. My mom is on their side. My family ostracized me years ago for unrelated reasons.

My friends are gonna ask their mom if I can do a rent to own on a mobile home they have in AZ, but if that doesn't work out, then what? I have a stable job, I can afford my pets, we were finally back on track. It's all already gone.

His family even knows how much they mean to me. One of these animals that aren't acceptable is service dog. I have never been without pets before this. I haven't coped well. I want to be a veterinarian and own a farm and surround myself in animals. They've known all this is my 20-year plan. I don't know why they're acting surprised that I'd want my babies here now.

What do I do? I really don't want to have to lose more than I already have. They told me I haven't sacrificed anything, but what counts as sacrifice then? I'm in FL if it makes any difference. Help?",30Nov2020,1

326,"I grew up with my mom in a different state to my father after they divorced when I was 3. My dad met my step mom a few months after and they had 3 children together. At times mom and I went without housing and food and had to seek charity of extended family or friends. Mom worked several jobs to try and keep a roof over our heads, but she had limited education and employment was insecure. Dad generally refused to help my mom as she had moved us back to our home state. It appeared he had the financial means- they went on international family holidays, kids went to private school at once stage and kids did extracurricular activities etc. Every few years I would fly over to see them for a week or so of the holidays. We spoke on the phone a few times a year and I would get a phone call for my birthdays most years. 

I'm now in my late 20's and the younger siblings are in their early 20's. I left home before graduating and worked night fill before getting a job in a call centre, where I still work nearly 15 years later. I didn't have much contact with my Dad over the years, but I did send my younger siblings presents for their birthdays and Christmas and I went over to visit them a few times over the past decade. After I was married to my husband, I decided to go to University so I could get a better career. We struggled financially while I studied the first half and I considered dropping out more than once. As a last grab at a better future I thought of asking my dad for help. Him and step mom have a few properties. They live in the city with their youngest child, who is studying to be a lawyer. One property is an old house on some rural land. The house is not in a liveable condition for them to commercially rent out. They were using it as a storage place for excess belongings and rodents have moved in etc. The place has been burgled a few times. One day they want to knock it down and build their dream retirement home. I asked if I could live in the property while I get my education providing it was going to be vacant and none of my younger siblings wanted to live there. They agreed and said they would help us. We sold most of our belongings and relocated interstate. I have made sure since being here that I pay my way with everything. We worked hard to paint up the place and make it cosy when we arrived. The house would still be considered illegal to live in and there are many things that are in disrepair, but it suits us just fine for now. I maintain the land and pay for extra costs that they would have had otherwise. We have been here over a year and there have been some conflicts along the way about money. My step mom has mentioned that it could be unfair on the other children that we are living on the property rent free seen as her eldest have now moved out of home and have rent to pay (they moved out once they turned around 20). She thinks my position could be seen as privileged. I have offered to pay any costs associated with the land, such as all the rates and taxes. My dad and step mom want me to pay some rent on top of this amount as they believe this will make it more fair for the other children. I have asked to get something in writing as verbal agreements seem to change. They won't put this in writing as they don't want to declare the income and also it is not legal to live here. We cannot afford to leave the property at the moment, so we will need to pay to keep the peace. Once we leave, the house will be vacant and they will again need to pay the costs of rates and taxes and any utilities they want to keep connected. 

Am I being unfair to my siblings? Is my position privileged? I don't want to hurt my siblings at all because I love them. How much is reasonable to pay on top of covering all the expenses?",30Nov2020,1
327,"So I (17F) have been pretty depressed and lonely for a long time. I never had any friends and was often too depressed to get out of bed. Until recently, when I joined a new group thing and met this group of girls who are just amazing. they included me right away and I love hanging out with them. My mental health improved tenfold just by having someone in my life who liked me, and I finally had people who cared about me (which I never thought I was worthy of). Everything was going great until a few days ago when I majorly embarrassed myself in front of them. I won't go into specific details, but know that it was 100% humiliating and ended with me breaking down and sobbing in front of them. I have been awake ever since, playing the moment over and over again in my mind. I can't even think about that group without feeling like I am going to barf and feeling dizzy. I know it's so dramatic, but it's how i feel. However, I am terrified to lose the only good relationships I have, and it's killing me to keep thinking about this so much.

330,"So I have a bad family who sabotaged my studies on purpose. 
Long story, I was able to enter a uni now at 20. I study tourism management but I always had a passion for computer science. I entered tourism cause it has job opportunities and the grades required to enter are low. 

To enter uni here we give Sat / A level equivalent exams and you can take them every June, once a year.

So my current uni is far and I will be away from my family while studying, even though now we are at home doing online classes due to covid. And this will make me happy that I will be away once lock down is over, I will also try my best to get a job to pay rent and bills. 

However, I live in a country that heavily depends on tourism BUT it mainly offers seasonal jobs, e.g. for 5-7 months a year and they are temporary, you do have the chance to become a manager but it rarely happens and I'm also on the autism spectrum and my social skills aren't the best. You live off walfare the rest of the year, which is 400 bucks per month, oops. Also when you work for those 5 months, you forget what it means to have days off and you may work for 12 hours a day, (depends on the place though.)The pay per month is kinda good but idk if it's worth it, considering all the rest. 
. 
Most people weren't able to move out and they stayed with their parents forever. I don't want to study away for a few years and then come back at home. I want to get distant from my family cause they don't have good intentions and they use me as their punching bag. 

__So I'm thinking of switching majors to a uni near my house, I live in the capital and the best unis are here and I want to get into computer science here.__

This means, I'll graduate at 25 while the average student here graduates at 23 and this makes me stressed and also I'll stay with my bad family for 5 more years!! But I will move out easily after that cause computing is on demand here and worldwide. 


And it's better than going away for uni for 4 years and then moving back. 

__In short__

Tourism industry: seasonal temporary jobs, good pay, a bit tiring, may not be able to move out, I'm already enrolled in a class, uni is far away and for as long as I'm studying I'll be away, I'll also be working away in islands with food and stay provided by the employer, many job opportunities . 

Computing science: I will have to give exams to get enrolled in 2021, good pay, many job opportunities, I will need to stay 5 more years at home until I graduate, I will move out certainly after that, it's my passion since I was like 10.

334,"I‚Äôm(24F) currently debating if I should reintroduce? Rekindle? An old friendship with a really good friend from high school. In all honesty I have been on and off debating for almost a year. However the reason for me even considering to start talking to her is not quite simple. 

During my senior year I had moved back to my home state. But shortly after high school I had slowly started to spiral out of control and became addicted to alcohol and drugs. As years went by I was also dealing with loss of few loved ones back to back; either due to illness, old age and even murder. The last family member that was killed, I was really close to and even though I was steadily drinking and starting to ease off drugs I quickly spiraled out of control. Also from a young age I have always dealt with depression and even suicidal thoughts. So as I dove deep into my addictions again this time I did not find myself strong enough to physically or mentally keep myself from fighting against the thoughts of taking my life. All I remember from that day was crying  and holding on to something so tight because I felt as if my life was already hanging by a tread and at that point I was ready for it to snap and just jump in front of the next train that was coming. I also remember forcing myself to see my family in my mind hoping that their faces would calm me and help me not jump. But none them were helping if anything it made me have more survivors guilt. But suddenly an image of my friend from high school came to mind, and I have not thought much about her up until that point. I had this strange flash back to the moment we first became  acquainted and someone telling me that her father had recently that year died of an illness. I remember seeing her the first time that day after I heard that and feeling a mix of empathy and slight envy. She was always cheerful and nice since day one. And for the longest ever since I was a child all I felt was angst and sadness.

So after this flash back I started to finally calm down and stop myself from jumping. I guess the envious feeling of, if a 13 year old child can be strong and continue to brighten up a room after a heavy loss, what does that say for me a 22 year old.

Idk. I often wonder if I didn‚Äôt see that flash back would I even be here? After that day I slowly started to sober up and for the past almost 2 years, I‚Äôve been clean. And honestly I don‚Äôt have a desire to fall back to being that person I once was. I‚Äôve been steadily getting my life on track. Working a physically demanding job because  the constant exercise helps with old cravings. Making my own future life decisions where before I didn‚Äôt even consider planning for any future cause I did not care for my life. I‚Äôve been more open with my family and myself because I would usually bury my emotions and just sink back into constant depression.

All in all, my life has improved significantly in just almost 2 years I‚Äôm still not where I want to be but I‚Äôm a lot further than I thought I could ever be. I‚Äôve seen my old friends page but idk how to even say hi. I‚Äôve always been afraid of having any relationship with people so when I left I didn‚Äôt stay in touch and while we were friends I always had a hard time being, affectionate? She would be patient with me but I always felt like I would let her down not being able to have as much emotions as her. I‚Äôm not planning on telling her about my battles but I feel terrible whenever she comes to mind and she doesn‚Äôt even know that her kindness helped save a life. I feel like the least I can do is say hi and maybe if she remembers we can talk about our high school days.

336,"TL;DR:  
There are some people I talk to that interpret things differently than I say them. Not in a wrong way, just different, and sometimes it can cause feelings to be hurt or just unnecessary problems.  
If I say something, and someone interprets it in a way I didn't intend and it hurts their feelings, who is in the wrong? Who should apologize to who? (if any apologizing is necessary at all) And what is the best way to accommodate those situations?  


Long version:  
Okay, so I have noticed over the years that most people I talk to I can communicate with very well and I can easily get points across. But then there are some people that I guess their brains are just wired differently and they interpret things in a different way than the way I intended. This ratio is probably like 90/10ish

A quick example of the \*concept\* I am talking about. \*\*This is just an example, and I do not need help with this specific scenario\*\*  
Example; Person A says: ""you look good today"" and Person B interprets it as ""You look bad most days.""  
Except person B is interpreting it as clearly as if Person A flat out said ""You're ugly."" \[yada yada yada\] ""That's not how I ment it."" and Person B thinks ""What do you mean that's not how you ment it? It was a very clear direct statement. What else could that have ment?""

I'm not saying they are interpreting it wrong or anything. For them, what they interpreted was a clear direct statement  
I am just wondering what the best way to handle those situations is?

Like, looking back at the example, should person A have to apologize? They didn't really say anything wrong. But I don't feel like person B's feelings should be ignored either.  
Nobody is in the wrong, it is just a communication issue that comes up kinda frequently with some people I talk to, and I would like to know how to handle it better when it happens.

I grew up in a town that was huge on high school athletics. Pretty much every boy was expected to play something or else they were treated as weird. I‚Äôll be the first to admit I was a ‚Äòjock‚Äô. I played 3 sports and was the ladies man throughout my teen years. 

Each year, my school would hold a massive pep rally a month into the school year. The pep rallys were an all day thing that would feature multiple events. The biggest event of them all was the athletic competition. Hundreds of students would compete in multiple activities and would be eliminated one by on

I had won the competition during my freshman, sophomore, and junior year. In the 50+ year history of the event, I was the only student who had ever won three straight competitions. I was fully prepared to win a fourth straight and complete the ‚Äòdynasty‚Äô. The athletic director had told me the school would gift me a scholarship fund if I was able to win it all one more time. 

As usual, I breezed through the competition early and comfortably secured my spot in the final round yet again. This time my finals opponent would, for the first time, be a girl who just happened to be a freshman. She was tall and lanky and posed no real threat to me off the naked eye. The final round would consist of a basketball shootout, first to 10 wins. Basketball is my best sport and I felt as if they were almost gifting the championship to me. I took an early 5-0 lead but she ended up getting into a lucky hot streak and won 10-7. She defeated me and became the champion. I was humiliated and went into a massive depression. I know that I deserved to be the one holding that trophy and seeing her hoist it up killed me. The rest of my senior year remains a blur to me. To put even more salt in the wound, the same girl that defeated me would go on to win the competition in her 10th/11th/12th grade years. She got the dynasty that she denied me of. 

Last week, I came across the Instagram account of the girl who defeated me. I found out that she came out as gay and is now married to a beautiful woman who‚Äôs pregnant with their first child. Both of them have a ton of followers and she appears to have a high paying job that allows them to live a luxurious lifestyle. I thought I had it good but she‚Äôs really living an amazing life. 

I‚Äôm extremely jealous of this woman and I can‚Äôt help but to think what my life could have been if I had just beaten her in that high school competition 9 years ago. I know it‚Äôs silly because I‚Äôm 26 and she‚Äôs 23 now but I just can‚Äôt seem to let go of the past. I know it‚Äôs unhealthy to be this envious of a person, but I can‚Äôt help but think about it each night. I toss and turn thinking about how she‚Äôs better at life than me in pretty much everything and how it could have been prevented had I just won.",30Nov2020,1
339,I don‚Äôt know how to help my friend . I met her in college and we have been friends for a little over a year. College was two hours away from our home and we both came home in the middle of the second semester freshman year because elf COVID. After moving back home I moved out my house in with my bf and she moved back into her parents house with her bf. Now I love her and we had gotten really close since college like almost sisters close. She got into a relationship in college with this guy she use to go to high school with. At first he was like a brother to me and we had a great time all hanging out together. Sometimes me and her and her boyfriend sometimes double dates with my bf. Since we came back to home from college her boyfriend started to seem off to me . And something in my gut just didn‚Äôt like him. We all started working together at the same place or nearby and even went on minivactions together and hung out a lot. She developed a crush on me and we slept together .... which made things weird . We both had conversations about it with each other and our boyfriends . Even though my bf was angry he forgave me and we moved past it . Hers on the other hand told her he was okay that he didn‚Äôt care that she did that ... keep in mind that they have been looking for a third person to add to the relationship.. he expressed to her that he found me attractive and wanted to have sex with me too and I politely decline for A LOT of reasons lol. So time goes by and we all continue to hang out and be friends . She start to say things to me like he is breaking her heart and tell me how she told him that she wants to stop looking for a third person because she wanted them to be stable and not argue as much  as they did . He continues to go behind  her back and talk to other girls and went to meet one over night in another state! She called me and was angry about it but still didn‚Äôt want to do any bring about it .. it has made me distant myself from her but I feel bad cause I know he is just using her . That is only one of many incidents where he has clearly disregarded her feelings and disrespected her and she can‚Äôt see it . She is going to get her heart broken and I feel like I don‚Äôt want to be around her anymore because it infuriates me to see her let him take her for granted. My bf says it‚Äôs none of my business but I do care about her and I am struggling rather to say anything or just leave it be . Either way I‚Äôm sure there is a high chance of loosing my friend but I don‚Äôt want to see her hurt ..,30Nov2020,1

349,"Backstory: I work at a facility that specializes in caring for elderly. I work overnights, midnight to 8am. On our unit &amp; our shift, depending on how many patients we have, there's a minimum of 3 employees (charge nurse, LPN/med nurse and me, nursing assistant/CNA). 

Recently we got a new LPN. No one likes her on ANY shift, not even the head nurse for the unit. She's lazy, takes long breaks multiple times throughout the shift. Tries to pawn off her work on the charge nurse (a sweetheart of a woman) or myself. She's also not so nice to the charge nurse, tries to undermine her. This charge nurse has no problems with considering another way of doing things if you come at it in an appropriate way.

She likes fish, whatever works for her. I HATE the smell of fish because it makes me sick. Seriously, I hold my breath walking by the seafood department of the grocery store. She KNOWS how the smell bothers me and continues to heat up fish in the microwave. 

She was about to heat some more fish up tonight and I started talking. All I was going to ask her was if she would mind waiting until report was done and I was out of the office. I didn't really get to speak before she started talking about my smoking bothers her. For the record I don't smoke inside (obviously). This is the first time she's said anything. She also started saying that commenting about peoples food choices was racist. I asked her if she was seriously calling me a racist but she didn't answer, just went on and on about it (complaining about peoples food, which I was doing, was racist). I told her that the difference between the two situations is that if I were told I can't smoke while at work then I wouldn't but she, knowing that her fish makes me physically sick, still will not refrain from heating it up in the microwave. I also told her it's much like someone who wears too much perfume or cologne and it bothers someone else. I then finished by saying this conversation is going no where and I refuse to discuss it anymore. 

Any advice?",30Nov2020,1
350,"Backstory: I'm an only child and was very sheltered growing up.

I just recently turned 18 (two months ago) and for the first time in my life my dad said that I'm free to just go out there and do what I want and date whoever.

Since I was very sheltered growing up, hearing this was a little weird. My dad is the same man who screamed his head off when I kissed a boy for the very first time in my life at 15 years old (true story), but now that I'm 18 my dad is practically pushing me out of the nest. Absolutely no smooth transition whatsoever. There was no gradually ""unlocking freedoms"" as I got older.... It was just like ""Oh you're 18 now have at it.""

The thing that's starting to get on my nerves is that my parents seem to be worried and shocked that I'm not dating anyone this year. They keep saying things like ""You're 18 now you can date."" or they ask ""Why don't you have a boyfriend?"" 

They also start bringing up the topic of grandchildren extremely often nowadays. They start talking about how important it is for me to have kids at the dinner table.

It's very weird. It's almost like they thought that once I turned 18 that I would just have men flocking to me and life would just fall into place.

No, what actually ended up happening was I had to say no whenever a guy would ask me out. Or I had to sneak around in order to have a boyfriend which ended in the relationship not lasting long. So now that I'm 18 all the guys that were once after me when I was 16 and 17 gave up and are now in commited relationships with other girls. Some are even engaged now (crazy, I know.) 

And I've already accepted that I'm way too late to the dating scene in this town and won't have much luck. 

So at this point I'm just embracing single life and trying to end my senior year with straight A's. I hang out with friends sometimes and I play with my dog. I play piano and like to bake and play video games sometimes. Life is good. I'm not rushing anything. I'm just trying to enjoy my last year of highschool as best as I can.

I've talked to my parents about how I'll just wait till college for a relationship but for some reason they're still worried about my love life (or lack thereof.) I don't know if it's the pandemic making them anxious or what.

I don't know what to do. In all honesty it doesn't really feel too good to have them breathing down my neck reminding me that I'm single all the time. Of course I would love to have a highschool sweetheart but it's not going to happen so I'm enjoying senior year and trying to relax. 

I feel a little bit frustrated and stressed out because they were the reason I was single all these years, and now that I'm 18 and all the guys I wanted to date in this town are taken NOW they want me to have a boyfriend. Plus they keep bringing my non-existant love life up almost every day. It's having an impact on my mental health.

I don't think that being single at 18 is a serious problem. I also don't understand why they're so worried about it.

Anyone have any advice on how to get them to chill out? I'm getting more and more stressed out as the weeks pass.",30Nov2020,1

357,"So I‚Äôve been depressed for about 5 years now. At some points I‚Äôm happy, some points it‚Äôs not that bad, and some points I feel like ending it all. I tried once but failed.

My friends don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm going through. I‚Äôve asked them for advice but it never helps. Which isn't their fault as they just don‚Äôt understand.

So during the summer I was extremely depressed. I thought like ending it was the best option. Being alone without anyone in quarantine made my depression so much worse. It all got better however when I started talking to this girl. We talked for 2 weeks or so and then I said that I liked her and she felt the same way. I was super happy. It was one of the only times when I felt like there wasn‚Äôt an ounce of sadness in my body.¬†

That sadly changed when I asked her to hangout with me. She genuinely wanted to but couldn‚Äôt because her mom got cancer meaning she‚Äôs at risk for cancer. However she said that when she got her car we could hangout which was great cause it was only 2 weeks away from her birthday. Her birthday passed and she didn‚Äôt get her car. I asked her why and she said that her mom was getting chemo meaning she was super at risk and she can‚Äôt hangout with anyone.

 It‚Äôs been a few weeks since this happened and honestly I don‚Äôt know what I should do. I really, really like this girl but I feel like she‚Äôs losing interest in me. I‚Äôve been super depressed about it lately and I know if I lost her I might take my own life. There‚Äôs nothing I can really do about it too as I can‚Äôt see her until COVID is gone.¬†

I guess I‚Äôm asking how I could not ruin things with her. Although I feel she‚Äôs losing interest. I still think she‚Äôs likes me just not as much but In a few weeks that could change to not liking me at all.¬†

I don‚Äôt really flirt with her all that much as I‚Äôm too scared too. My anxiety gets the best of me. I haven‚Äôt told her how I‚Äôve been feeling too.

362,"This all happened on the night of the 20th of November and in the early hours next morning, until about 7am

Like the title explained, my gf is addicted to crack, which was introduced to her by her mother at a young age. At first, when I met her, she wasn't using as much as she did last week, and she was a clear recreational user, smoking less than once a month.

In the end of september was her father's 1 year death anniversary, as well as his would-be birthday. Since those 2 days, she wasn't the same. She started meeting up at her mom's more often to smoke (maybe 1-2 times a week) until it became daily in the end of october. When I told her she might want to check herself, she denied she was addicted and was simply ""spending time with her mother""... I was there, I knew that she was smoking for 6 hours straight, so no, she wasn't just doing that.

Before moving to the next part, I must note that infidelity is one of the worst things for me. I feel like it is simply inhuman and it angers me to know people could be so cold.

Around 9:30pm on November 20th, my gf took 5 xanax and proceeded to smoke for about 100$ CAD worth of crack (1.2g), I wasn't there at the time. During the whole night, she told her mother how much she loved me, what a great guy I was and how much I meant to her. Then around 5am the next day, she took pictures and videos of herself to post on an escort service website, so she could sell her body (I knew she had done it in the past, I was cool with it since she was young and we didn't know each other) (and yes, she was a minor and still is). She never posted that ad, but still texted she ""wanted to fuck"" and sent 4 video snaps of her playing with her vagina over her leggings to a guy we both know. The guy was fortunately not interested since he's 27 and she's 16. 30m later, she texted her ""guy friend"" which she had fucked in the past before (yes I know, yikes) that she ""wanted to smoke crack and fuck"". The guy only answered the next day, and acted like he didn't know what she was talking about.

In the end, she didn't technically ""cheat on me"" but I still feel mad knowing she wanted to fuck someone else, twice. Yes, her mind was greatly altered because of what she took, but she could still remember who I was since I had spoken to her on the phone at 11pm and she texted me the next morning. She is incredibly remorseful today and we are totally cool, but I feel like a part of me is boiling whenever I see the pictures she took (knowing they weren't meant for me), or when I just think about her sending suggestive snaps to another guy, while I have scarcely recieved ""content"" in the past. No videos, nothing screaming ""I'm horny"", but somewhat meaningless pictures (or so I feel like they are) that are really just there to ""make me happy"".

Don't get me wrong, I am really greatful to be with her and I love her a lot. She changed a lot since that day and quit smoking crack, and I constantly see the efforts she does to be better. But I don't know what to do on my side, because whenever I mention that day and what she ""did to me"", she gets awkward and wants to change the subject or just stop talking to me.

What do you guys think? What should I do to make sure our relationship gets be stronger, and a similar event doesn't happen?",30Nov2020,1

365,"First and foremost I‚Äôm a college freshman and I live off campus in a state several thousand miles away from my home.

Secondly my roommate isn‚Äôt exactly great to me or anyone else for that matter. When I wrote this the first time I tried to be impartial but I want to be clear about how stressful it was to be in this environment. Anyways, my roommate has the strong selfish streak. She‚Äôll have parties without letting me know in advance. She‚Äôll invite random guys over all the time even though she knows I‚Äôm prone to panic attacks around new men because I was sexually assaulted. She gets blackout drunk and I‚Äôm forced to take care of her or whoever else she invited over. Which means somewhat regularly being prepared to clean vomit out of carpets we don‚Äôt own. I also do a lot of the cleaning. Like the general mopping,sweeping, dishes, sanitizing surfaces etc. I know I wrote that all in present tense but that lasted for about a month. Into the school year and I virtually put my foot down and said no more crazy parties, I can‚Äôt take it. Also can you help me clean more often. The cleaning but became a big deal and she fought me on it for awhile. And then she started ignoring me. Almost entirely. The parties stopped. She‚Äôd still drink heavily and invite a friend or two over but it was nowhere near as bad. But unfortunately those parties were the only form of social interaction I had between studying and overall trying to master online learning. And with her freezing me out. (Ignoring me, refusing to take me grocery shopping because she ‚Äúnever had time‚Äù and than suddenly making time for all her friends, continuing to not help clean etc.) I was effectively isolated. I tried making friends but as the weeks went on, it only got harder to generate an organic relationship and if I did happen to catch one of my roommate guests in passing I was giddy and lowkey scared them off from being trapped in my own head for days or weeks at a time while pulling all nighters several days in a row. My roommate did start talking to me again for about a week or two but I brought up cleaning again as something we could work on and I was shut out yet again. All in all outside of random bits when she or a friend passing through needed something from me, I was completely and utterly isolated. 
Buuuut, just about a week or two? Ago she started talking to me again. And for the first time in our months of living together we actually had full conversations. It was crazy I was finally in her favor, and we cleaned together. We actually worked together, for the first time we saw eye to eye and it blew me away. Throughout all this time I‚Äôd done my best to be kind. Greet her in the mornings, Say goodnight, Listen if she just decided to vent and I‚Äôd never gotten any of that in return but I was just stupidly hoping she‚Äôd come around and we‚Äôd find some common ground. But all this social interaction, this genuine conversation it made me feel like a person again. But lo, one morning after a failed all-nighter she woke me up with a bunch of texts and calls, it was an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù I get out of bed, go to the living room and she gives me the low down. She found a dog he‚Äôs living out of a van with his current family, they‚Äôre traveling the world and want to get rid of him. They‚Äôll be leaving our area in about 24 hours. And she asked me if I was cool with getting him. Like an idiot I said yes but of course within an hour of processing I was already regretting what I was saying. Our landlord has a strict no dog or cats policy and we‚Äôd be breaking contract. I was already panicked but at the time I was thinking that I had put in so much work to resolve our relationship and I didn‚Äôt know how to explain to her that I didn‚Äôt wanna get a dog without destroying our new found bond. So the day passes she splurges at petco. I go to bed with a stress migraine. When I wake up the dog is already there. Not a surprise but I felt worse. I was sick. Yesterday she‚Äôd spent the whole day telling me I couldn‚Äôt tell my parents or the landlord because then we‚Äôd get caught. And I was stressed as heck. The dog was well trained which was nice he was just really loud and really big, and he wasn‚Äôt fixed. But also to no ones surprise I told my mom as soon as I worked up the courage. Which took about four hours of psyching myself up. Fortunately my mom was upset and was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling the landlord you tell your roommate she has 24 hours to do it herself before I do‚Äù I told my roommate and made up some lie about my mom finding out just by chance. Because I still wanted her to believe we were on good terms. And she told the landlord (huzzah) the landlord was furious. But not at me which was good. But I also made sure to send a text like ‚ÄúI know this isn‚Äôt technically my fault but I coulda stepped up and firmly said no and I didn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù but I was forgiven pretty fast which was so nice. But here‚Äôs the kicker. I‚Äôm home for the holidays. I‚Äôm finally with people who support me. I‚Äôm not trapped in a little apartment with no allies to support me through school or anything. I‚Äôm able to sleep, my space isn‚Äôt being invaded by strangers. All the comforts of home tbh but honestly the access to emotional support was absolutely eye opening. I‚Äôm no psychologist but I‚Äôm pretty darn confident that I was a victim to that environment. The way that I just retreated into myself when my boundaries weren‚Äôt respected and I was the one constantly having to back down or being the agreeable one and it made me so heckin weak. I was able to finally be clear and tell my roommate that while I‚Äôd used my parents as a shield initially I was also unhappy with the situation and I didn‚Äôt want the dog to be there. For a myriad of reasons she kept insisting the her lease finishes in like three months so it would be fine keeping him and I actually stood my ground. Also since my parents are paying rent I can‚Äôt really just make a decision on my own because she‚Äôs not just convincing me, she‚Äôs convincing my parents. ANYWAYS I digress. What brought me here was that during that confrontation she said that I pressured her to get the dog. I mean... I don‚Äôt think I did. I wouldn‚Äôt even say she pressured me to say yes like all of my family, and old friends seem to think. I think I wasn‚Äôt in a place to be mentally strong and she inadvertently took advantage of that. At the same time, I‚Äôve watched her manipulate friends and situations in her favor over stupid, simple stuff so I can‚Äôt exactly say she isn‚Äôt capable of that. So yea, I‚Äôm at a loss. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs gonna happen to her, the landlords are still in council but she‚Äôs pissed them off quite a bit. I‚Äôm just overwhelmed at the thought of having to deal with this situation any further. If she does get kicked out.... than I truly have no one waiting for me back at college :/",30Nov2020,1
367,"I‚Äôm extremely disappointed right now. My best friend (of 6 years) had moved to Texas about 3 years ago- let‚Äôs call her Ava. My two other close friends and I still keep in touch with her, and whenever she visits California, we hang out with her. Ava and I had a point where we would facetime every night just to check up on each other. I‚Äôm the closest to her of us 4. Or so I thought... Recently we had stopped talking as much because of online classes and being busy with life. I didn‚Äôt think we had drifted apart. Usually when we hang out it feels like we had never stopped talking. But this past week Ava decided to visit her family here in California for the holidays. Today Ava and our two close friends hung out at the mall before she leaves in a few days. She would constantly ignore me or decide to start a conversation with my two other friends instead. It didn‚Äôt seem intentional, as if she was mad at me, but I definitely felt excluded. Our relationship didn‚Äôt feel the same. It didn‚Äôt feel like she was as happy as I was to see her. Not to mention, whenever she comes to visit me in California, we greet each other with screams and hugs because of how enthusiastic we are to see each other. This time, she barely said hello. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just really sad. I thought she was my person and I was hers. It doesn‚Äôt feel that way anymore. I thought we were fine? It‚Äôs like she got closer to my other friends and drifted away from me.",30Nov2020,1
368,"My younger brother (18) is taking an honors college course that is very difficult (think philosophy meets history meets literature).

I (23) have taken the class previously and being an English major, offered to help him edit the paper. Unfortunately, it was mostly unfinished and he was still writing it minutes before the deadline so there wasn't much I could do.

Unfortunately, a combination of my editing and realizing the final had to be turned in as a doc and not a pdf led to him turning it in a minute past the deadline. As such, he's very distraught and says that he likely failed the class because of the late assignment.

As his older sister / paper editor, I feel somewhat responsible and want to help him feel better. I know that acting as a third parent will be unhelpful, especially since he is already feeling down.

However, I'm also concerned about his work ethic; he's a STEM major and I know writing essays is not his strong suit, but leaving an assignment this late (especially when he went on a socially distanced hike with friends earlier this morning) makes me wonder if I should talk about it with him.

This is not the first time he asked me to edit an essay hours / minutes before a deadline and I'm worried about what will happen if this trend continues, especially since he previously asked me about how I deal with burnout.

Should I stay silent and let him come to me? Approach him and risk coming off as a third parent? Suggest he talk to therapist / advisor?",30Nov2020,1
369,"I kinda wanna vomit... with how sickening it is.

So this girl I've been flirting with and she's been flirting with me... I confessed to her and got rejected.  

And only after getting rejected I know she played me. Took screenshits of my confession. 

And momentarily after she did a white lie.. I thought this girl had high morals and preaches how she'd rather have the truth that hurts, than be told lies.

So while we were talking or texting, she was in a call with others actually watching a movie. Now she always gets annoyed when I reply slow, so this one time I tease her back.

She tells me she's just on call with them, not focusing and on what they say and that THEY are watching a movie.

[Now this is the part I need help on]


After confessing, failing, and then talking chill and laughs I said she was watching a movie with them earlier. And she calls me out saying


Woah I said THEY were not me.
To which I then said oh I must've just assumed. But then after a bit of poking she says she did watch it actually.

Would this be a white lie?

Or considered a lie at all? When she did admit she did actually watched  it and What not. 

And coming from someone who says they don't accept any form of lies.

We had an argument that she never lied.


And I'm afraid our friendship may end and she'll use the confession against me as an excuse.

She already tried covering it up by ignoring me calling her out for lying by saying ""fight me"" jokingly
And we do this thing were we call eachother names jokingly but only she was doing it.

I was genuinley scared cus she sounded like a whole different person.

The girl is 20 and I'm 23m. If she makes a difference on people's mentality.

372,"Sorry for the long post.

Last Wednesday my boyfriend went on a business trip which was for 3 days. He got back on Friday night and I had classes in the morning but had the rest of the day off from work. I cleaned around, cleaned our bedroom and decorated it a bit since it's holiday season. I was excited for him to be home. Yes it was only 3 nights but he's been my world since 19. 

I made dinner around 5 and waited for him to be home. I opened the door and went in for a kiss because he took his mask off but he immediately said ""can't you see I just got back"" and I was like ""oh shit yeah covid"" and he went straight to shower. I got kinda sad that he talked like that because he never does but I thought maybe it's cause he's tired and I shouldn't have just gone in for a kiss because of covid. 

That night after dinner I went straight into our office downstairs to do some work and then to our bedroom. He came and said ""babe I'm so sorry for earlier"" and kissed me a few times. Well I tried to initiate sex. I had just touched his chest and ran my fingers through his hair and he moaned so obviously I thought it was ok (yes consent is important but we've been together for 3 years so we're at the stage where we know it's ok). I tried to take off his shirt and he said ""what are you doing?"" I  kinda went speechless and said ""oh um I'm sorry, I thought.."" and he said ""I'm tired, can we not tonight"" so I just said ""yeah yeah I'm sorry, goodnight."" 

In the middle of the night I went into the living room area. I was sad and confused but also understood he's tired. But this was not the first time he's gone. He's never acted this way before. I told myself to let it go and went back to the room.


Yesterday night I made dinner. It was already 7. I waited till 8:30 and finally gave him a call asking where he was. He said ""oh my god dude I forgot to tell you I had to go dinner with a client."" I was like ""oh ok, well I would've appreciated if you told me earlier because I made dinner and I was waiting for you."" At this point I was sorta mad because I wasted all that time waiting when I could've studied for my exam which is coming up soon. I ate and went to bed. Woke up around 11 and he was taking off his coat. He saw me up and came to kiss goodnight. That's it.

Today were both getting ready. We both had virtual meetings. I decided I was gonna talk to him about what was going on after my meeting so that my anxiety doesn't kick in, even though I was already very anxious. Meeting finished and I went to talk to him and hugged him from behind and went to kiss his cheek. He got upset saying ""babe I'm wearing a white dress shirt can you not."" I was like ""I know I'm not 5 I won't ruin your shirt."" 

I tried so hard not cry but I broke down crying and he hugged me and asked what was wrong. I was hyperventilating and I just couldn't speak so he just held me but I didn't wanna be held by him. I ran the room and locked myself. He came after me and I told him I wanted to be alone. He got the other key and got himself in and asked me what was wrong. In that moment I just felt alone. I didn't want him there. 


It took me awhile to calm down but I was finally ready to talk to him. I asked him why he's avoiding me and why he doesn't want me to have sex with him. He said ""sorry I've just been tired with work and I'm not in the mood. I asked why the dinner took so long. He said there was traffic and that they were gone to this restaurant an hour away.

I gave in. I listened. I said I need space. 

But

For the first time ever, I don't believe him. I don't think he's mine anymore. I didn't wanna be in bed with him. I was getting chills. It's almost 11. I'm sitting outside right now crying while typing this. I feel like I've lost him. I don't think I'm overthinking. Yesterday was the first time he didn't call me babe when I called him during his dinner. Yes he could be tired but I don't understand why he came home at 11. Restaurants here close by 9 due to restrictions.


I don't wanna imagine what he was possibly doing or who he was with. I'm hurt. I feel lonely. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I did something. I don't know how someone changes in 3 nights. Everything has always been good between us. I'm scared he found someone else. It hurts.


TLDR: My boyfriend is acting distant ever since he got back. I tried to initiate sex and he said he's not in the mood. Came home late other night and I just don't believe him.",30Nov2020,1

375,"So about a year ago a co worker was fired due to screenshots of a private Facebook messenger group chat being forwarded onto management. As there was only 5 of us in the group chat, process of elimination meant we knew who was responsible for taking the screenshot. The guy that was fired said a few derogatory things about the supervisor, nothing out of the ordinary really though for the industry I work in. At the time I asked the supervisor and the worker suspected of taking the screenshot what had happened as I wasnt comfortable with private group chats being forwarded on. Both denied knowing what happened.

Fast forward to a couple of months ago. The suspect left his email open one day and went home. I couldn't resist the urge to scroll through and found the smoking gun where he got the other guy fired. Now he also named myself and another guy in an underhanded way for some reason, which I believe would have tarnished my rep with management, although no one ever said anything to me about it.  

So I know it's not my finest moment, but I took a photo of the email and I have been sitting on it trying to figure out the best way to forward it on to the affected people and let them know the truth. But I dont want to incriminate myself for going through another person's emails. I also want the confirmed suspect to know that I know he tried to throw me under the bus. I've had this guy round for dinners and have even given him a free car, so it's a slap in the face.

But to get to the story... its quite a long one so I'll try to shorten it a bit, my friend (who I'll call Marie) a while back became best friends with this girl (I'll call her Ana) and ever since then I've watched who used to be the best person i know (Marie) destroy herself. Like I said I want to keep this short so I'll skip over the things that make this a LONG story but the first of it and the worst of it is Ana got Marie on drugs. Painkillers, weed, alcohol, possibly Vape and/or Cigs, it's been really hard to watch Marie who used to be this amazing, intelligent, &amp; kind young lady turn into a juvenile delinquent, her personality is changed and she's began to hate me as it seems but either way she doesn't talk to me anymore. They've snuck out together &amp; I belive somehow gotten Tattooed (I forgot to mention we are young High Schoolers) and I realize some of you growing up might have been the exact same way and I dont mean to offend... but the way that under the influence of Ana shes become an addict and delinquent is truly saddening. 

Im not sure what I'm asking for, maybe its advice I want on how to handle it, or how to try and move on(which I dont think is happening) or maybe I just wanna hear an outsider's opinion on the situation I dont know I just decided to post it too reddit and see what people say.

377,"My partner is getting prepared to tell his family he isn‚Äôt coming up for Christmas. His family are located a few states away and Christmas is a big deal for them. This will be the first time he won‚Äôt be home but also that one of the children won‚Äôt be there. He is one of six children. He hasn‚Äôt seen his family in nearly a year and is understandably sad that despite us doing the right thing this whole time, it‚Äôs just not safe to go up.

I don‚Äôt really think they ever really grasped the pandemic. They‚Äôve been exposed a bunch of times over, may have gotten sick with it, have been hosting family gatherings, some of them are deniers, just not really all putting the dots together. An example of this is his best friend hasn‚Äôt gone over to my partner‚Äôs parents‚Äô home visit as usual in a while because he wants to follow guidelines since he‚Äôs a teacher and had to go into school for a while and two of his siblings asked how his mental health was doing since they hadn‚Äôt seen him, not even think or considering that the pandemic may have been part of it. 

His mom started discussing Christmas plans in September with us. Despite our saying it‚Äôs too soon, she was trying to convince us to buy a ticket and not really telling us the truth about how it was all going to be okay for us to come up. For example, she told us the ticket was completely refundable for cash and it wasn‚Äôt and that we wouldn‚Äôt need to test coming up or back down which wasn‚Äôt true at the time and there was no way to tell if that would be necessary next month. We started saying ‚Äújust in case we can‚Äôt come‚Äù and got called out and asked why we wouldn‚Äôt be able to come. So again, not really getting it.

He has a sister who lives close to us and has gone out multiple times to visit this year and will most likely be going up for Christmas. This caused some tension over the summer since we chose to stay home for major family events. He considered talking to his sister about staying here but ultimately decided that wasn‚Äôt going to be beneficial. She‚Äôs a major follower and her boyfriend is ultra-conservative so as you can probably imagine that bodes better than our own beliefs and know this will cause a lot of tension when we have this conversation.

The truth really is that it‚Äôs just not safe to travel. Despite the pain they‚Äôve caused this year from dismissing trauma related to the pandemic, our decision not to go is not rooted in that pain. He doesn‚Äôt want to bring up that I‚Äôm high risk because they will hold it over me and against me for the rest of our lives. We also need to try to make sure they don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs nothing on a personal level or that I‚Äôm keeping him behind because they love a good conspiracy theory. It is simply unsafe to travel and that‚Äôs it. He doesn‚Äôt want to say anything that would insinuating that his sister, who most likely will be traveling, is stupid because that will probably not lend well. Is there a diplomatic way to tell them we aren‚Äôt coming in a way that can minimize the impending argument?",30Nov2020,1
378,"I am Chilean and I am 18, and throughout my life, I could never maintain a healthy life as I wanted.

380,"Apparently, we're really close to losing the house. I get money for my mental disabilities, and it's been upped to ¬£430, whereas before it was ¬£300. I haven't seen a single bit of that money for two months.


I'm entitled to it, like, it's legally mine, but it goes into my mum's account.


I pay her ¬£200 of it, and keep ¬£100, but now she wants to keep all of it until she gets a job.


Keep in mind, I'm paying more than my older brother, and he's an adult! (I'm sixteen, he's twenty)


Which is not fair, she's relying on her minor son's money to pay her bills.


I'll be getting a bank account soon, and redirecting the money to my account, however, she wants me to forget about the money she owes me, and let her keep all the money for the next few months, and then I can just pay her ¬£100 a month after she's gotten a financially stable job.


I wouldn't mind doing that, so long as she pays me back by the time I move out. I have some very expensive hopes and dreams (university and moving to Japan to be an English teacher for a bit) but she complains that she ""doesn't want a massive debt"".


Well I don't want a massive financial loss.


And, I mean, I won't fair too well if we end up losing the house by taking all of the money to myself, and my mum said that my nan wouldn't let any of us live with her, but I have to check that, though it's definitely believable.


Like, I'm willing to lend her money, but not gift her money, and I will not pay her anymore""rent"" money than I already have, I am not ever going higher than ¬£200, and it would be ideal if it could be as low as my older brother's.


She keeps trying to make me feel bad for it, but I think I'm being pretty reasonable. I don't really see her as family after all of the abuse I've went through under her roof, so when she plays the ""but I'm family"" card, I really can't empathise.


I am being incredibly generous, but it's not enough for her. I'll be getting a proper job when I turn seventeen (I'm focused on volunteer work at the moment), so maybe it'll be different then. But I can't even pay for my damn eye tests and glasses, it's truly not fair, I'm willing to buy my own food and clothes, and pay my own phone bill, and give her ¬£100 as rent, but it's not enough for her!

382,"I always feel like I'm not doing enough. I'm 20 and I feel like I haven't achieved anything in life. For example let me take you to a time before COVID hit. 

I was working at 2 restaurants and still attending college full time (4 classes) 

My day looked a little like this. Wake up at 7 and get to classes by 8:30 (40 minute commute) Have classes from 8:30 to 2:30 with a 30 minute break somewhere in the middle depending of what day it was. Be at work by 4. My commute to work was around 40 minutes or 1 hour depending on if the busses were on time. Of course bus rides were never dead time, I would always read books for my classes/write essays/catch up on shows. If I had 30 minutes or 1 hour free I would go to a library that was 5 minutes from my job and do schoolwork until it was close to 4. From 4 to 10/11 I would work my shift. From there it was a 1 hour commute from my job home. Most days I would get home at 12am because late at night buses don't run as frequently and if I missed a bus I would get there at 1 am. on the luckiest days where schoolwork was light I would sleep at 1am or 2 am. On the days where school work was pretty heavy I would sleep at 3am-4 am and on days I was absolutely swamped with work it was at 5-6 am. On those days I would just set my alarm to take a 1-2 hour nap and then head off to my classes. Monster Energy drinks and microwavable burritos got me through those days. This was my schedule from Monday to Thursday. Friday was a bit more relaxed. I had a class at 9 and it ended at 10. From Friday to Sunday I worked at another restaurant that was closer to my house (around a 30 minute bus/train ride) My shift started at 12 and since it was a pretty busy restaurant I would do 10-11 hour shifts. On the weekends I would have to help my dad with his party supply business. Sometimes we would get up at 6am and I would stop helping him around 10 so I could get ready and eat breakfast before heading off to work...... even after all this I still felt like I wasn't doing enough. I felt like I couldn't take breaks. Any hour spent doing nothing or resting could of had been used to study or work. I absolutely hated that feeling. After COVID hit I lost both my jobs. I barely scraped by in my classes. The feeling of not doing enough started to intensify. I would spend the whole day in my bed. Why would I get up and be productive  if it wasn't going to take this feeling away. 3-4 months in the future and they called me back to work. Now I was working 30-40 hours but I absolutely ignored my classes. But it made me feel a bit better that I was bringing in a paycheck. As the COVID cases started to rise where I live they closed down restaurants once again, only open for takeout and of course the dishwasher was the first one to get his days cut. Now I only have 2 days of work... coupled with my 4 college classes that I failed I'm absolutely sure that same feeling of not doin enough is going to come back soon.

He has other female friends I am 100% cool with and although this online friend has a boyfriend, she has crossed the line with some of her messages.

Over the last few weeks every time I see him I get upset over this and he shows me their conversations and explains they are just a friend and will never be anything more. Last week he even sent them a message setting boundaries with them so it would help make me feel less uncomfortable. 

The things he lied about were small, but still lies.

Every night I'm awake for the longest time replaying that day in my head. If only i wasn't so gullible and blind to his pain.

 My most cherished possession is now a teddy bear. 
It's a small teddy bear yet it feels the largest object in my room. I'll always cherish it. 

Weeks prior to his death he walked into my room and told me that he loved me. I was playing a game online and blanked and didn't respond to him. A few days later he walks into my room again and places a small teddy bear on my desk. He doesn't say anything.. He just smiles at me and walks out. 

He walked out our backdoor that day and he was smiling and laughing. I should have known.

397," 

This all happened on the night of the 20th of November and in the early hours next morning, until about 7am

I am 18 and my gf is 16

Like the title explained, my gf is addicted to crack, which was introduced to her by her mother at a young age. At first, when I met her, she wasn't using as much as she did last week, and she was a clear recreational user, smoking less than once a month.

In the end of september was her father's 1 year death anniversary, as well as his would-be birthday. Since those 2 days, she wasn't the same. She started meeting up at her mom's more often to smoke (maybe 1-2 times a week) until it became daily in the end of october. When I told her she might want to check herself, she denied she was addicted and was simply ""spending time with her mother""... I was there, I knew that she was smoking for 6 hours straight, so no, she wasn't just doing that.

Before moving to the next part, I must note that infidelity is one of the worst things for me. I feel like it is simply inhuman and it angers me to know people could be so cold.

Around 9:30pm on November 20th, my gf took 5 xanax and proceeded to smoke for about 100$ CAD worth of crack (1.2g), I wasn't there at the time. During the whole night, she told her mother how much she loved me, what a great guy I was and how much I meant to her. Then around 5am the next day, she took pictures and videos of herself to post on an escort service website, so she could sell her body (I knew she had done it in the past, I was cool with it since she was young and we didn't know each other). She never posted that ad, but still texted she ""wanted to fuck"" and sent 4 video snaps of her playing with her vagina over her leggings to a guy we both know. The guy was fortunately not interested since he's 27. 30m later, she texted her ""guy friend"" which she had fucked in the past before (yes I know, yikes) that she ""wanted to smoke crack and fuck"". The guy only answered the next day, and acted like he didn't know what she was talking about.

In the end, she didn't technically ""cheat on me"" but I still feel mad knowing she wanted to fuck someone else, twice. Yes, her mind was greatly altered because of what she took, but she could still remember who I was since I had spoken to her on the phone at 11pm and she texted me the next morning. She is incredibly remorseful today and we are totally cool, but I feel like a part of me is boiling whenever I see the pictures she took (knowing they weren't meant for me), or when I just think about her sending suggestive snaps to another guy, while I have scarcely recieved ""content"" in the past. No videos, nothing screaming ""I'm horny"", but somewhat meaningless pictures (or so I feel like they are) that are really just there to ""make me happy"".

Don't get me wrong, I am really greatful to be with her and I love her a lot. She changed a lot since that day and she quit smoking crack, and I constantly see the efforts she does to be better. But I don't know what to do on my side, because whenever I mention that day and what she ""did to me"", she gets awkward and wants to change the subject or just stop talking to me.

What do you guys think? What should I do to make sure our relationship gets stronger, and a similar event doesn't happen again?",30Nov2020,1

399,"Hello, so i have a situation- I have a friend who easily gets offended. As in like hes blocked me multiple times over petty things I say thatll trigger him. Now yes, I admit I can be a bit raw or say some daring things. But its literally small shit. For example, 

-a few days ago i told him a joke that he didnt get
-he gets upset and confused because its ""so stupid""
- i tell him its from a youtube video i saw, and that ill share the link with him
- Right after i send the link to the video, he says ""no, i dont want to see that you obviously don't listen when i say that i dont care about this joke"" and then goes on a whole rant about how i dont listen to people.

A week-month or two later, hell randomly text me out of the blue saying ""hey"" as if nothing happened. A few days later, i say something that triggers him, he goes off and then blocks me. The cycle continues. If I don't text back for 2 days (we were friends in person until I moved away and now we just talk via text) hell get angry and go off on me. Ive made an attempt to block him, and then hell spam me via dm on my social media, and then go off on me. I just want to know, am i being a bad friend here?

Throughout my whole life I have had trouble saving money but it doesn't pay well. I've been out of college for two years so some of it can be added up to paying for school. After I graduated I hoped to be able to find a job that supported me financially but since then I have never made any ground in my savings. As soon as I get a check it's gone due to bills and rent and my second check is gone because something always happens every month that is out of my control and requires me to spend money.

I can't afford to live like this. I try to be optimistic though since it could be worse. I have a loving family, a loving and understanding gf and a job during a pandemic.

404,"My family has had some drama over the last few years with my middle sister, ‚ÄúLynne‚Äù, acting selfishly and pushing away both me and my youngest sister, ‚ÄúTaylor‚Äù. It started about four years ago when Lynne started prioritizing her friends over her sisters and would constantly flake on plans. I figured she was just being a normal teenager but then she started pulling some shady stuff like lying to us about where she was, blocking us on social media, sneaking out at 3am, and then crying to our parents that we never hung out with her anymore (even though she never asked either of us to hang out and declined every invitation she got). She‚Äôs also become the type of person that refuses to talk through any disagreement or conflict and goes straight to crying and playing the victim until she gets her way. 

I was done dealing with her drama so I distanced myself, which was easier since I was in college and then living on my own as an adult. My youngest sister, Taylor, had to go to high school with Lynne who didn‚Äôt want to share her friends with her little sister so Lynne spread fake rumors about Taylor being a tattletale and about her sexuality/gender identity. After that, Taylor didn‚Äôt want to have any kind of relationship with Lynne, who is now in college.

Lynne decided in the past year that she wanted her little sister back and has been trying to make everything go back to how it was before by just being superficially nice when she‚Äôs at home. She hasn‚Äôt actually changed her attitude, put effort into genuinely getting to know Taylor again, or tried to make up for what she did. The holidays lately have reopened all of the old wounds with them being stuck together at home with my parents and Taylor isn‚Äôt ready to forgive Lynne or be close again. 

My parents though just will not accept that as an option. They are constantly berating Taylor for not wanting a relationship with Lynne. They bend over backwards to accommodate Lynne like forcing Taylor to let Lynne use her car to hang out with a friend (during our state‚Äôs COVID shutdown). They let Lynne get away with things that they would never let Taylor do and they enable Lynne‚Äôs entitled, selfish attitude. Any time there‚Äôs a fight between the two of them they yell at Taylor and tell her she‚Äôs ruining things. My dad thinks that because Lynne has ‚Äúmade an effort‚Äù that Taylor needs to just get over it, and Taylor thinks our dad dislikes her now because of it. My mom never says no to Lynne but is extremely strict with Taylor. 

I‚Äôve tried pointing out the disparities and tried to explain Taylor‚Äôs point of view to my parents but they just don‚Äôt see it. I‚Äôm concerned about the long term psychological impact this could have on Taylor, who‚Äôs already dealing with depression, anxiety, and chronic pain medical issues, and I just don‚Äôt know how to help her or help fix this. Right now I just try to listen, mediate where I can, and have an open door for whoever needs it. What else can I be doing? Am I wrong for being concerned?",30Nov2020,1
405,"Hear me out. I love animals, so much so that I wanted to be a Veterinarian growing up (though for unrelated reasons this did not happen). To start, my family had three fish that we had to give away when we moved states. Then, as my parents didn't allow me to have any other pets afterwards, I could only dream of owning one. Fast forward a bit to elementary school, there were five incidents with animals that looking back, make me think I'm cursed. 

1. I found an injured bunny in our yard. Naturally, I wanted to save it. I put it in a box and watched over it for a few hours until it died. 

2. There was a squirrel struggling to climb up a tree, so I picked it up by it's tail (not realizing how awful that would have been for the squirrel at the time) and set it down in a soft patch of grass. I came back a few hours later to see that it was still there, but it was dead. 

3. We had a family of birds nesting in our gutter. I was playing outside one day, bored. I hadn't heard the baby birds chirping that day, so I had the wild idea to try and see if they were still there. I poked the nest with a broom to see if they would make noise, but the broom handle just got stuck in between the house and the gutter instead. I had to pull hard to get it out, accidentally destroying the bird's nest. It toppled to the ground. The baby birds were strewn across the yard. I picked them up and put them in a bucket with some straw, but they died shortly after. 

4. My elementary school's biology teacher was going out of town and needed someone to look after the class' birds. I volunteered. Everything was going well until the second day when I tried to feed them; they flew out of the cage and my Mom and I had to chase them around the house to catch them. I think this might've traumatized them, because only a few days after returning them to my biology teacher, they both died. 

5. My elementary school's biology teacher was handing out minnows from the class' fish tank before summer vacation. I was able to get one. And I was determined to let this little minnow live. And he did! But then, and this is actually/conclusively my fault, I forgot to fill his fishbowl with filtered water one day and he died. I did hold a funeral for him in the backyard though.

Now, moving onto high school. I haven't had a pet since the tragic passing of Mr. Minnow. At the time my parents had recently divorced and I had moved in with my Mom who thought it'd be a good idea to take in two barnyard kittens from a friend of hers. We raised them together for about two years and I bonded heavily with one of them. But, as always, something bad happens. My mom developed allergies to them (to be fair, they were long-haired cats), so we had to rehome them.

A year or so passes and my Mom finds two hypoallergenic cats for sale. We adopt them and they fit right into our little home! We ended up loving them unconditionally up until last year (around the 6 year mark of ownership). With a change in living situations, we decided to rehome them as well. But it was more of a happy goodbye.

A few months later, I decide to buy a hamster. I actually did my research and bought a proper cage and everything to ensure that it'd live the expected lifespan. The first one only lived about three months. I was so heartbroken that I went straight back to the pet store and bought another one, and WITHIN 12 HOURS IT DIED. I bawled my eyes out for days, truly feeling like I was cursed. Still, I went back to the pet store and bought my third and final hamster which only lived about two weeks. I become numb to it all, having dealt with this all my life, I could barely cry.

Finally, at present, I purchased a puppy. We clicked right away; however, only a week into taking her in, she became violently ill. I'm on the verge of breaking down. Although I can't do my memories and emotions justice through writing alone, everyday the reality of this ""everything I touch dies/gets hurt"" becomes more and more vivid. I'm currently doing my best in nursing my puppy back to health along with the aid of a Veterinarian, but I almost want to give up given my track record (even though I know it wouldn't be fair to my puppy or my wallet since I've already invested so much time and money into her).

Any comments or words of advice? I'm in dire need of some guidance.",30Nov2020,1

407,"My sister met a guy on a dating app a little more than two months ago and fell head over heels. I've met him a few times and he's not a bad guy by any means. I'm just concerned with how quickly they're moving. She has been seeing him for several hours a day (when she's not working, all day) almost every day of the week since they met. I understand honeymoon phase, but this just isn't stopping. They said they loved each other two weeks in. I thought, ""everyone has unique timing!"" Then she told me tonight that they were verbally engaged and plan on getting rings soon.

She thinks they're going to spend the rest of their lives together and that he's the first person who understands her, but I *know* her. She's fresh out of college and still figuring out her career path. This is her first relationship. The person she was before him would never approve of what she's doing now. I know she's not ready to be married soon and I told her (maybe a little rashly) that if she gains a fiance, she's going to lose her sister.

420,"My landlord has fucked me over and I want to move out but my contract lasts another 10 months. For context, it is a 7 bedroom house where each bedroom is let individually, and this is in the UK so apologies if my lingo doesn't match yours.

It started soon after I moved in. I was assured that only professionals who were upstanding, nice people would be allowed to rent a room in the house. I arrived and was told that a student was living here, and that there were lots of complaints about a few of the housemates. Furthermore, after both of the problem people moved out, another person moved in who was worse than either of them. Every word that comes out of his mouth makes me angrier and angrier, and I have been avoiding the house precisely because he lives in it. I was promised a quiet environment but one housemate has a party until about 5am every weekend. It seems to me that they lied about the property when they were showing me round...

When I tried to sign a contract for the house, places were flying off the shelves - I didn't have any other options available to me, and I felt forced to agree to their terms. I asked for a 6 month contract but they bumped it up to a 12 month contract, locking me in for a long time at a very uncertain point in time. As I said, I felt I didn't have a choice and just had to take whatever they enforced.

The landlord is also a big problem - we received one noise complaint (unrelated to me, thankfully) and he threatened people with legal action, not just eviction but criminal records and a range of other things that we, the house, do not believe would be legal. (I can't remember them at present, they're on my housemate's phone, not mine).

It is a legal requirement in the UK that landlords must give 24 hours notice before entering the property, or permitting others to enter the property. Over the last 2 months, we have had perhaps 10 viewings, none of which have been communicated to us in advance.

So now I need your advice - do you think I have any grounds to try to shorten my contract? I wouldn't be trying to break the contract altogether, just shorten it to 4 months (which is not unreasonable since my other housemates managed to get 3 month contracts).",30Nov2020,1

422,"I downloaded this app to say this. Ive literally been starving for someone‚Äôs opinion and view on this situation.

Lets say her name is Ken. I was 17 and she was 18.Me and Ken have know each other since we were both children, toddlers to be more specific. She was my bestfriend as a kid and her little brother as well. My mom was good friends with Ken‚Äôs mom for a long time. Over time, Ken‚Äôs mom starting taking pills more often and she was kind of starting to fall out of line. My mom stopped taking me to see ken because of that reason but i never really thought much about it, as i was still so young and innocent. Well, fast forward over a decade later in 2019. Im in a toxic relationship with a girl who didnt care much about me and she was abusive too. I never opened up to my family about it because i wanted her to stick around and everyone not think bad about her. Shit got worse and i bursted open to my family and let her know who she really was, no one liked her anymore after that. One day while i was at her house, my sister texted me, ‚Äúdo you remember ken? I was visiting her and she said u were cute‚Äù. I smiled and didnt think much about it. I hadn‚Äôt heard from ken in years and to hear that made me happy. As time went on, ken actually wanted to start talking to me. I remember her first ever text to me after years, it was one of those shitpost memes and it said ‚Äúi heely like you‚Äù with a pair of heelys in the picture. I replied ‚Äúi heely like you too‚Äù and thats where it all blasted off. We went on texting day after day, it got juicer by the day and hearts started coming in to the messages, things were great. She pulled me out the toxic relationship i was in, and she treated me so well. She was precious, long brunette hair, a pretty smile, tall and slender, curvy, dressed like a mom, and smelt amazing. The way she would hold me and speak to me in her soft-angelic voice in my ear. Everything about her was perfect, she was an angel in a beautiful body. At the time, i was a piece of shit kid still in highschool, playing video games and acting a fool, i was still childish. Ken on the other hand, has just graduated earlier that year. She was working and trying to move out of her moms house. She was in a toxic relationship herself. Her ex was abusive and very controlling. Similar to what i was going though. July 4th, 2019, is when i asked ken to be my girlfriend. I layed her down on the bed and layed next to her, and i asked her to be my gf, ofc She said yes with a big smile. As time went on, the happiness and kens texts, body language, and voice slowly started to fade away. She always told me nothing was wrong, but i always made sure to ask when she was off. She stopped coming to see me as often. When she came, my mom thought she was sleeping with my sister, but really she snuck into my room to lay with me. All of the good things just started slipping away, and i didnt know what to do, i was just a kid and i was inexperienced still. The day before the first day of school, i got the message on my phone. The message said ‚Äú im sorry, i just dont think this is going to work anymore‚Äù. My ass was already damaged from my past so my first instinct, was to not kiss her ass and beg her to stay. So as time went on, i was hurting so bad. I started drinking heavy and having sex with someone i didnt even care about. This girl was slutty and i knew it too. No girl was the same as Ken, so i never put effort in anyone. It was bad. Ken had gotten back with her ex. I never understood why it happened to me, why did i deserve this? I thought. Earlier this year, in December , Ken slowly started making her back into mine and my sister‚Äôs life. Her and her ex broke up, what a surprise. But this time she came as a friend, And made peace with my sister. But things were still weird between us. Ken and her brother ended up coming to the house for New Years Eve. Ken and I got along for the most part. We started drinking and my sister even blacked out drunk. It was a good time in all. Ken got drunk and went to the bathroom to only end up on the floor. I went in there and i told her she should get up and go lay with my sister, she was being hardheaded and kept saying no. But then I offered her to come to the room with me and her brother, and without hesitation she said yes in a drunk voice. I picked her up and she was really close to my face and kept laying her head on my chest. I helped her walk to my room and i layed her on the bed. So I decided to sit on the bed next to her, but she kept getting closer , almost like she wanted to lay with me. I didnt dare hold her or get close to her, I didn‚Äôt want ken to think i was taking advantage of her the next day, so i played it safe. The next morning we all woke up, it was the first of January. My sister came to me while i was in the restroom and she said, ‚Äúken said she still misses you, and that (the slutty girl) wasnt good for me‚Äù my sister also mentioned that Ken wanted me to hold her, and that it would have just been a long hug. After this situation, me and Ken speak to each other everyonce in a blue moon. This whole year my mind has been racing about her. Ive thought about babies, marriage, an apartment, etc. i tried to get back with her twice but she politely turned me down both times. She‚Äôll randomly text the groupchat were in together. She just never texts me personally. She pulled me out of hell literally, treated me like an absolute angel, then abandoned me. Why would anyone want to hurt me like this? Why wont she come back, or just text or call? My sister even wants me back with her. I just know i can do 100x better than i did the first time, but she doesnt know. I just wish she knew how i felt about her and how often i daydream about her. Thank you if you actually read this, and please feel free to reply what you think. I really needed to get this off my mind.",30Nov2020,1

433,"I (m 24) just broke up with someone. It wasn't super far along, it just hurt when they said they didn't want to waste their energy on me. Understandable given the circumstances but whatever. I really want to just get into a relationship/dating not hook ups and not leading to no where.

Since my work keeps me kinda isolated to a small area, my state basically shut down nearly everything, and my dating profiles are clearly in need of work, what are some suggestions?

I use tindr, hinge, and okcupid since I have been recommended all three for potential relationships. What should I throw out on my profile to help me get there? I plan on updating my profiles with more recent pictures but I feel among the flood of other guys my profile may just be a subconscious swipe left. Not being negative on myself, just how things can go (I sometimes do the same thing if I see something that I wouldn't like such as their personality is based around mudding or hiking when I don't frequently do or want to do those things)

I would prefer to meet people in person though righy now that feels out the window. I am fine with video and voice chats on discord or a phone call. I'm just not the best with texting.

Rught now I include: I love all types of humor and love to make people laugh, I am a gamer and casual game developer, I love music as well as play and write music (I was in a band), I lost 90 pounds even though I'm not the most proactive person and would love someone who cares at least a little bit about health, and I am open to adventures.

Sometimes I add little jokes in there, I try to keep it short and sweet, I mention weight loss and how I want to start climbing, and how I stream/make videos on twitch/YouTube.

Just wondering if someone can either give any advice on how to find some common ground to start conversation for actual intimate dating or how to build a profile to help me get them clicks so I can try to start getting to know people who I think would actually work well with me.

At this point I just really want a relationship again. It's been a long time since I had something I truly cared about and I want to move toward something serious since I have never really had a serious relationship and want to get married at some point.

Sorry if this was long just not sure where to turn to. Maybe not the best place but hey my friends either got married or ditched me for their personal stuff so I don't really have anywhere else I can go for actual advice beyond ""keep trying and be yourself!""",30Nov2020,1
434,"I'm an nonbinary person (assigned female at birth) and I like girls.

I think they will be accepting at the end but will think of me as a failure at one point. They grew up as Christians (although they're not now) and they likely viewed homosexuality as a sin at one point of their lives.

Korean SAT is coming up for me, so I'm currently thinking of going 'Hey, I'm going to a sleepover at my friend's. It'll be a long one since we haven't met each other for a long time. Read this after I'm gone.' the day after SAT, and leaving them a note saying that I like girls, I left to give them some time to think, I'll go back home when they text me to, and if they're confused or have any questions they can always text or call me. I'm scared that if I did it face-to-face they would get angry, and with this method they would have time to settle their anger.

We had our daughter two months ago. He‚Äôs a great father, he truly is. Because of the pandemic he works atleast full time and usually over that weekly. He pays all the bills while I stay home and watch our kids (4f and 2month old). He always thanks me for cooking and cleaning and if he feels up to it will help pick up and stuff. 


Now what I am frustrated with is that with our newborn, he‚Äôll say ‚Äúlet me give you a break‚Äù and then hold the baby for five minutes then hand her back because she‚Äôs crying and he doesn‚Äôt know how to calm her down. Because he gives her back after five minutes each time is the reason he doesn‚Äôt know how to calm her down. I‚Äôve shown him how she likes to be rocked, some moves I know that put her to sleep, tricks and such etc. but he just like refuses to try. So now whenever I go to pick her up for the millionth time, or feed her again, take her out of the room to soothe her, etc. he says ‚Äúsorry babe‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt do anything to help. It feels insanely empty because he says it practically every time she cries but doesn‚Äôt do anything with her.

Even though 2 of my sisters are barely 2 years younger than me. I was bullied senselessly for 13 years because of my condition, and I had basically no one on my side. I had maybe 2 friends and 1 teacher on my side during those 13 years. The bullying became physical in 7th grade, head slammed into lockers, not shot, stabbed with forks not hard enough to break the skin but hard enough to hurt pretty bad, head slammed into ground, punched in face. The one person who could actually do anything was my 9th grade English teacher. This has even happened to me by my 2 blood related siblings, if I try to fight back, my parents turn the whole thing against me. There gave been so many times where I have wanted to kill myself because they bullying from people and my sisters had become too much. My parents never offer to spend time with me and would rather spend time with their other kids or would rather be working outside. 

My one and only way to cope was through my video games and online friends. With Covid 19, I had to switch to online classes, which made some class exponentially harder. Last night I had 2 F's because one teacher wouldn't grade anything from her class,, even though everything was in before the November 20th deadline. The other class was because something got marked missing a few days early, not the first time it happened. 

My parents had threatened to destroy/sell my consoles multiple times before, but this one hit different because it wasn't my fault this time. I had asked my teacher multiple times to grade the stuff and it hadn't been yet. Once the told me that they were going to sell my stuff, I snapped.

 I told them how I really feel, how they never spent time with me, how they treated my sisters miles better than I get treated, how many times I had wanted to kill myself because of how much I was being bullied because of something I couldn't fucking control. I told them that if they were to sell/destroy my shit, I would cut contact with them after High School. 

Did I over react, or was this completely justified?",30Nov2020,1
440,"I‚Äôm 35F. Hubby 37M. Husband‚Äôs close friend, 48M. Girls he has dated in the last year: 24, 25, 25. He‚Äôs rich &amp; talks about being rich a lot. Girls are always thin, blonde and broke.

To me it‚Äôs a clear pattern: sex for money transaction. However he continually talks about how he needs to find his wife, is looking for true love &amp; time isn‚Äôt on his side (running out of time to have a family). He insists he wants a relationship and hates modern dating.

I‚Äôm slowly starting to have a problem with this. Mostly because as his best friend‚Äôs wife, I‚Äôm basically being forced to go on double dates with sexual prey. The girls are often annoying/dumb, if not outright gold digger and manipulative. My husband and I make fun of them all, and if my husband doesn‚Äôt like the girl enough to be ‚Äúok‚Äù with her, he actually outright avoids any hangouts with him where he wants to bring her along. The latest girl is the least annoying and my husband‚Äôs repeatedly expressed his relief that we can hangout with them and not have to avoid it, like the others. He tells all of this to his friend‚Äôs face too, btw. 

There is a feminist? part of me that also feels offended by all this. He clearly has major age bias when it comes to women, and thinks when women are in their 30s+, they somehow become psycho baby-crazy. He CLEARLY sees youth as a major criteria in a woman‚Äôs desirability. So here I am, 13 years younger than him, and he‚Äôs talking about women of my cohort like we‚Äôre old ?!?!

This friend is a great old friend and awesome in all ways but this one. He‚Äôs also my husband‚Äôs ONLY close male friend near our town so there‚Äôs no way I can nix him or anything. I‚Äôm just wondering if there‚Äôs anything I can do here. He often will just include a girl in a hangout between the three of us as we‚Äôre in the middle of hanging out, so I find it impossible to just say, oops gotta go now, hate who you choose to date. To his credit, he may also do it because he doesn‚Äôt like being third wheel? Any thoughts?",30Nov2020,1
441,"Got tinder 2 days ago and im already talking to some people, for some reason my mom is acting weird af 

I woke up early today for some reason, couldnt sleep i think, and am sending messages to my friends(not even tinder related) and going on twitter, bruh for some reason now shes having a problem with that and saying i spend too much time on my phone. Literally never had this issue with her

442,"im mainly aiming this question towards parents. 

so im 21, living at home while in uni. i mostly mind my own business. do my own laundry, help with chores, pay my own bills, buy my own food. im really only living at home still to avoid hella pricey rent in town. my parents havent brought up me moving out much at all. its almost always me doing it, saying i think i should leave the nest soon. 

im asking for advice bc nearly DAILY, my mom will mention something about my lifestyle and how she thinks i should change it. its almost always about my sleep schedule. then today out of the blue she said she decided to take my ps4 and switch from dec 1 until christmas. this confused me because i didn't play ps4 for a solid 2 months bc i was so busy with school. i just finished finals last week and FINALLY got on to play a few days ago, and now shes saying shes going to take it. 

she hasn't taken my things since i was like 12. i also don't plan to give her shit since i paid for my ps4 and switch with my own earned money. 

shes planning to take not just my gaming consoles, but my other three siblings' as well. i just simply dont understand WHY? i make great grades, i pay my own things, i help around the house, and i dont use a mic when i do rarely play games so its not like im being loud or something? im not going to let her take my own property, but when she takes my younger siblings things, it'll just result in anger and fighting around the house, especially since she hasn't given us the reason why tf she wants to do this.

so parents, what is the goal for punishing a kid who hasn't done anything wrong? my family isn't terribly close, we all sort of do our own thing, so this random ""month of no games"" is just an out of the blue fight-starter which will solve nothing. is she just bored in lockdown? why is she still SO invested in how much time i spend on hobbies or how often i sleep? why is she STILL trying to take my things? especially when she works from home and spends eight hours a day in front of her own pc?? is the only way to get some independence is to move out? 

i just want to understand WHY, so when i wake up and the inevitable argument starts, maybe i can talk her out of this random bs.",30Nov2020,1

444,"Stupid, funny problem? Maybe. But a very real one. Embarrassing too.

So, no matter how well put or stupid the counter reply/argument is, if I know that the person is outright wrong, I have to reply with another counter-argument. If I don't, it keeps bothering me and I cannot stop thinking about it. Deep down I know I shouldn't waste time further engaging with these arguments and waste my time. I try my hardest to reason with myself not to continue. But having to let the one in the wrong have the last words and have it there for the whole world to see makes it not sit right with me in some way. I feel a sense of defeat and anxiety. 

Every argument I have online, I try to engage in as rationally as possible. All my points are rooted in logic and I try my best to watch out from using fallacious reasoning in my arguments, proofreading everything I type, and double-checking everything the opposition wrote. I am very critical of myself when it comes to online discourse. I am always ready to admit when I'm in the wrong, and change my stance, even if the opposition isn't as courteous. 

The stupider the counter argument is, the more detested and frustrated I feel about it, and the more passionate itch I garner to reply. Only if I had this much passion for doing things that actually matter to me more IRL than fucking online word battles.

446,"Please forgive any format errors &amp;etc, this is my first post to Reddit. I‚Äôll try to keep it brief.

Husband and I recently bought a cafe (yes we‚Äôre crazy, but no - no COVID in our greater area for an extended period, we did go in well informed). We essentially run the place ourselves plus a few staff, who are all fantastic in their own way as far as we‚Äôre concerned. 

George(not his real name) started working for us a couple months ago in a part time role. Without giving too much about him away, he is a bit older than us, a bit of an oddball, but in general his personality is delightful to be around. He, like everyone on our small team, is integral and very much cared about. 

I first suspected G of drinking on shift a few weeks ago, when he walked past me in close proximity and I noticed a familiar smell that to me was like some sort of alcohol. 

I quietly mentioned this to my H, not wanting to cause an issue because I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure at that time, but I needed to bring it to his attention (and also because that same day G happened to mess up what should have been a basic order, which in my mind was like ‚ÄòI need to at least mention this to H, at least so there is a record between us of this possible concern.‚Äô) It was discussed &amp; we decided leave it for the moment and just keep an eye out. 

Which brings me to today, when again I caught the same scent from G, and noticed his water bottle. A common theory among alcoholics is that vodka has no scent - and as it‚Äôs clear, you can drink it from a plain bottle and no one would know. For the most part this is true, it doesn‚Äôt carry the same heavy smell as other spirits like rum or whiskey. But when you‚Äôve spent half your life with a chronic alcoholic, and also been one as I have, a part of you just knows the patterns. 

A short time later, I noticed G from the corner of my eye pouring some clear liquid from a clear glass bottle out of his backpack, into his water bottle. I pretended I hadn‚Äôt seen it, but then I knew. His bubbly personality, the alcohol scent, the order mess-up &amp; the bottles all fell into place. 

It felt horrible - I knew I couldn‚Äôt simply call him out on the spot and dismiss him. I don‚Äôt know why he is drinking heavily at work, but I knew that being fired on the spot could mean the tipping point for him. We cannot have staff drinking on shift - this can cost us our trading license - but we care about G, and don‚Äôt want to let him go without at least trying to help somehow.

So, people of Reddit, your advice please? How do we approach this?

449,"Hi, So i'm a 17 year old from Australia who has been working in finance for the last several months for the experience. I was offered a career in doing this but I have decided its not right for me. I made the decision today to leave once the Christmas holidays begin so they can start looking for a replacement early. I hadn't told my parents yet as I felt like it was a decision up to me to make and nothing involving them. I finally told them tonight that I was going to take a few weeks just to rebuild myself a bit since I lost a lot of my confidence during the job and that I would start figuring out what I want to do with my life. They were both extremely disappointed in me and started telling me off for wasting their time these last few months. I have a plan in mind and I feel like I know what I need to do for my future happiness but they just kept saying I would end up like a failure. I tried to explain to them that it wasn't worth me being so sad for the next few years just to get a solid job but they wouldn't listen.

In short I'm just looking for ways to cope with this sort of stress from your parents to just rush getting another job, I'd like to take some time to discover who I am as a person but they are already putting pressure on me.

Every weekend I usually take a stroll around my neighbourhood in the evening to calm myself and get some fresh air.

As I was walking through the carpark in front of a large hospital, I notice something in the corner of my eye. As I look over I see a silhouette of someone pointing a red light/laser at me. All I could make out was their vague body shape and legs that were bent like they were stealthily crouching around the premises. I freaked out because they're movement looked like they had a firearm and I ran all the way home where I told my parents.

456,"I (28f) have no obligation to this lady (30f) in my neighborhood, but I offered to help her out one day, and it's spiraled into her being dependent on me. She just had a baby and was having a rough time, as a new mom myself, I thought I could help her by hanging out, reassuring, and helping her get out of the house a little. The first time, she had me take her to the doctor and then the hospital, my husband had my baby and I didn't mind helping, even if it was weird that I had never met her before. Now she only texts me when she needs a ride somewhere, like the doctor or pediatrician. My son despises his car seat, and I don't want to take him out of his routine by packing him up and waiting for this person to do their business.

Her husband is her real issue. He is a ‚Äùgamer‚Äù and does nothing else. He's in the military, but they gave him an extended leave to help with the baby, but he's not. They have a car, but refuse to get it registered. She claims he spends all his money on gaming stuff. He refuses to put her on the account, she has no access to any form of income. She is unable to just buy stuff for the baby. She is constantly asking for diapers and formula on a mom group. I know she's being financially abused, and I've told her and provided resources to help her report him to his chain of command or get help. She doesn't want to disrupt her home setup at all. I feel for her and know she needs help, but she doesn't seem to want to correct the problem.

I am running out of ways to say no. I don't want to be taken advantage of, but it feels wrong leaving this person out on a limb.

464,"After going through some heartbreak over a boy, I tried to make myself less lonely during quarantine and decided to post on r/teensmeetteens to get some new friends. I met a lot of cool people, and only kept talking to a handful of them. One person in particular was one of the better people who was funny and not very dry. Since we had a large time difference, I would voice chat with him everyday until about 7am on school nights lmao. (Online school was really bad and so school was only about an hour so it wasn‚Äôt so bad). I honestly think staying up so long and not giving a fuck was a side effect of my depression. 

As I felt really bad about myself and even more depressed as time went on, I found lots of the conversations I had w people that I met on reddit a lot more mundane and just didn‚Äôt have the energy to keep the conversations going. This led me to ghosting some of the people who I‚Äôve talked to more ig, but I wouldn‚Äôt say that any of those people were even remotely close to being a best friend. 

That one person in particular was pretty concerned during the period of me ghosting him even though we‚Äôve only been talking for about two months. He texted me on all social media apps asking about what happened and stuff like that. It honestly sounds pretty sad for what I did, but I honestly didn‚Äôt feel that close with him in the first place. I mean, we were friends and all, but it was only for about two months and never talked about anything deeper than laughing about memes together. 

After about a month of ghosting I finally felt like connecting back with other people again, mainly because well‚ÄîI felt bad for treating them that way. I just thought that I should work on myself first instead of focusing my energy on reddit friends. I know it sounds harsh and I honestly am questioning my actions at this point. 

But anyways, after reconnecting w my friend and stuff, we were chill and jus went back to how we used to talk. Although, it‚Äôs been kinda hard because for some reason I just find him a bit unfunny and annoying. For example, the memes he sends me are kinda just stale in general and the conversations are mundane. He also texts me every day multiple times, and it just feels like a chore to reply. He also wants to voice chat really often, and I just don‚Äôt have the energy to do so. I really don‚Äôt wanna stay up till 7am again since I‚Äôm trying my best to work hard on my grades. The lack of concern for how late I was staying up before was also something that irked me a bit. 

He even suggested meeting up bc we travel to the same place often, and I just agreed un confidently. I dunno, he just keeps texting and texting and I just don‚Äôt feel like having a long term friendship with him anymore. I‚Äôm fine w just keeping him as a follower on insta but to just keep having daily convos is just kinda draining for me. I know I‚Äôm being selfish and all of this is my fault, but I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. I regret making that post on teens meet teens. Any advice would be appreciated.

So, 3 days ago when I brushed my teeth, I also used my toothbrush too clean my tongue üëÖ (that was accidental lol) I have my tongue scraper (or if that's how it's called) which I forgot to use, and I cut my tongue, the tip of my tongue hurts me so bad and it bothers me, I can't talk, lol I feel like I created a new English accent, I sound like I'm drunk, jk...

I thought I was acquainted with death,always thought it was ultimately relieving,and when my grandpa had a heart attack me and my grandma tried to save him while my mom was having a panic attack.
I still remember checking for a pulse while looking at his rolled eyes and foaming mouth,then helping the paramedics put him onto a gourney.

After he died this paranoia started to grow,I remember waking up at 2am because I heard some weird noise and running to my grandmas room thinking of whats the ambulance number,then finding her snoring,sometimes choking on her dry throat.

Only more recently I've realised,im not ready. Im not thinking she'll die any day now,but when every other day she has something,pain in the chest,tension acting up,feeling like shit because of the diabetes,its hard not to.

I had an argument with my grandpa and went into the bathroom, and I was washing my hands when this round blue dude came up to me and introduced himself as mr. Jellybean. He made me feel a bit better and just as I was about to leave, he grabbed my shoulders and things escalated.

He shoved me into a bathroom stall and started licking me and calling me names, but I somehow managed to free myself of his grip and I smashed his head with the toilet seat. I thought he was dead and was in full panick mode

I went to my grandpa holding back tears and told him I wanted to go home,  but he was being nicer and bought us a ride down the stairs.

473,"I‚Äôm a 1st year engineering student and I‚Äôm so far behind on work. I have over 50 tasks to do because I struggle to concentrate, but that‚Äôs my fault.

Honestly I don‚Äôt like my course. I‚Äôm close to hating it. And there aren‚Äôt any other courses at this university or other universities that interest me. The reasons why I went to university is to both gain confidence in myself (which hasn‚Äôt happened so far)to make my family proud of me, and to somehow graduate and get into a well-paying job.

I feel ashamed of having constantly have these thoughts about dropping about. Fair enough if I was talented or skilful at something else, but I‚Äôm pretty much talentless and have nothing to fall back on.

My family keep reminding me how my degree will lead to a good paying job in the future. But it only leads to it, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee it. And there‚Äôs no guarantee I‚Äôll enjoy it if I don‚Äôt enjoy my course now anyway.

People will likely say ‚Äújust work in retail‚Äù or ‚Äújoin the army‚Äù if someone was considering dropped out. But is it bad I want a well-paying job in the future? Is it bad I want financial independence later in life? I have no clue what to do.

I‚Äôve reached out to a therapist at my university, as well as their mental health services, but I only spoke to them once and have ignored them since because I felt like I‚Äôm not going to progress by talking to them, and so I‚Äôve been so rude by my lack of communication and (if you can call it?) ghosting.

TL:DR I have little to zero interest in my course, I want to drop out, but I will be seen as a failure by my family because they constantly assume things are going well. I have nothing to fall back on and I don‚Äôt want to work in retail or join the army. I‚Äôm probably an asshole for thinking this way too",30Nov2020,1
474,"I found my cat under my car 10 years ago. Until I moved in with my wife (girlfriend at the time) I lived alone. Just me and my Cat. We are together, hung out on the couch every day, he slept on the foot of my bed, etc. Best buds. During that time I also unfortunately went through some emotional/intense stuff and my cat was the one constant source of emotional support I had. 

Now I have two kids, a dog and a very demanding job. By the nature of life with two kids and having my job my cat always seems to be lower priority than everything else going on. I go what feels like weeks without even petting him. Not because I don‚Äôt care about him, I just have too much going on. In addition to that my dog chases him out of any room they are in together (playfully not aggressively) and my kids chase him out of any room they are in together (immigrating the dog). Because of this my cat ends up staying in our tiny laundry room for 90% of his day. Only really coming out when we are sleeping. My wife has tolerated but never really liked my cat so she doesn‚Äôt really give him attention/affection either.

I love my cat and it kills me to even think this but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I should find him a new home. I‚Äôm not happy with the quality of his current life. He deserves affection, attention and at bare minimum to not be stuck in one room all day. I don‚Äôt see a way to make changes to my life that would result in meaningful improvements to his life. I just don‚Äôt have the time. That being said, he is my pet, my responsibility. I chose to be his owner. He was also there for me during hard times in my life so I feel like I ‚Äúowe him.‚Äù 

I keep going back and forth on this. On one hand the ‚Äúright thing to do‚Äù would be to find him a new home where he‚Äôd get the life he deserves. On the other hand if I did that I‚Äôd be a horrible cat owner who abandoned one of his best friends. Im not sure I‚Äôd be able to forgive myself if I gave him up but it also kills me that his life is what it is.

475,"I broke up with my LDR Ex, I put her through tough and hurtful times because of my OCD. 

Here are the things I did to unintentionally hurt her:


I had a bad urge to confess something bad due to my OCD. One of those things I confessed, I told her that her mom cheated on her dad which scared me because I read online that a girl that grew up in a broken home and with daddy issues is more likely to cheat where cheating was normalized in their childhood.

I also had a compulsion to tell the truth. I told her about small white lies to lies, now she branded me as a liar.

I had a bad intrusive thought of spreading her nudes which I told to her which I will never do.




Anyways, she followed me on IG a couple of days ago and I started therapy for my OCD, a week ago. I am trying to figure out what I should do with her, apart of me is telling me that through therapy she'll come to forgive me and another part is telling me that she is only doing this to add more pain into my life knowing that we are no longer together.


I never had the chance to explain to her about the 1st confession that indeed it was my OCD and I didn't use that to hurt her. She also told me that we are never going to talk again only to follow me back on Instagram days later.",30Nov2020,1

Those words hurt the most, because I just don't get it. We were doing so good too I even got her a necklace and wrote her a letter a week or two before we broke up.

Her unemployed boyfriend also stays in our home often and eats with us all the time, they both discuss all the time and make problems. It really infuriates me since i have aggression-problems and the whole situation is really starting to make me depressed again.

2 days after this happened, I (19F) ended up confessing to my (at the time ex) boyfriend (20M) because although I didn‚Äôt cheat on him, I felt like I at least owed him the honestly. If there was or is any chance of our relationship working out as we‚Äôve always hoped, I needed to be transparent &amp; his best friend, we‚Äôll call him Tanner (20M,) has been a piece of shit to him. He at the very least deserved to know, I thought. 
I expected him to be extremely upset, which he was, but his immediate reaction was to ask for me back. I thought i‚Äôd have to walk home. He said that he‚Äôs mad at me but he can forgive me and he just wants to work things out. Ultimately, I do too but I couldn‚Äôt think for myself, that was one hell of a stressful conversation and I have an awful problem of doing everything for everyone else in my life but myself. If I didn‚Äôt take him back then I felt like he would tell everyone what I did and things would be ruined forever, no chance of revival if I gave up then. So we got back together. But of course I was given the ultimatum, he guilted me into blocking Tanner on everything. No contact. He told Tanner if he ever talked to me again he would beat his ass. He even wanted me to delete every photo of him I have. I didn‚Äôt because it fucking hurts. He‚Äôs one of my best friends. Understandable given the circumstances, but the control?? I just wanted to find myself and get these fucking shackles off my ankles, but I let my heart and what I hope for get the best of me. I feel like I owe him this even though I didn‚Äôt cheat on him. 
I want so bad to want things again, but no matter what we do it just doesn‚Äôt fucking feel right and it‚Äôs eating my alive. I can‚Äôt even have sex with him, I just don‚Äôt want it. At all. I really really want to want it... But I‚Äôm so scared to give up, especially at this point because I‚Äôm worried I will be giving up something that I won‚Äôt ever be able to get back again. I just am not emotionally available for him, no matter how much I lie to myself. It sucks so fucking bad. 

I‚Äôve been struggling so bad not talking to Tanner, boyfriend hates him of course. I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot aloud‚Äù to talk to him, is that okay given the circumstances? Is that an exception to his control because what Tanner and I did while my boyfriend and I were separated?? 
I feel like I‚Äôm not aloud to be sad about missing our friendship/whatever the fuck it is, because my boyfriend is so hurt. But the truth is I can‚Äôt get Tanner off of my mind, I dream about him. It just fucking sucks. 
I reached out to Tanner tonight when I shouldn‚Äôt have because I have something of his I should give back, my boyfriend told me just to burn it. We talked a little and sounds like he‚Äôs feeling the same exact way. I don‚Äôt want to not talk to him, but I don‚Äôt want to betray my boyfriend. But Is it ok for my boyfriend to make me not talk to him given the situation? Is that a healthy ultimatum? 
I wish I could go back to when everything was easier. I know I just need to leave my boyfriend but I want so bad for things to work and everyone will fucking hate me for talking to Tanner again, and that‚Äôs what I want. I‚Äôm terrified to be alone. I just want to find myself.

In short, my partner and I (both 17) have virtually no sexual experience, but are at the point in our relationship where we would like to start experimenting in that regard.

Currently, I am not in a position to get a prescription for birth control pills and we are wondering how exactly we can be safest to avoid any risk of pregnancy.

We have access to male condoms, and have tried them out a few times, but neither of us are 100% sure how to use them safely and if we should be using more protection as well (we both are aware female condoms also exist but know little about them, etc.). Because of our lack of confidence in such methods, the experience is becoming more stressful than enjoyable. For instance, most recently, we bought the TakeAction pill afterwards because we realized we didn't know how risky cuddling before/after sex (no condom) or if semen can work its way around the condom somehow or if fingering with residue on his fingers can lead to fertilization...

I'm aware this post probably comes off as ignorant, but we both planning on not engaging in any sort of activities until we are positive we are being as safe as we can.

I started working a new job a few months ago. Immediately since I joined, one of my coworkers took an interest in me. (f, early twenties).

Whenever I‚Äôm on my lunch break he seems to make excuses to ‚Äòneed a break‚Äô, such as a headache, and comes and sits/ stands next to me during my lunch almost everyday. 

He added me on Facebook a few weeks into my job, and since then me messages me ALOT when I am not at work. He often says empty things, like

‚ÄòHey how are you doing?xxx miss work?‚Äô

I reply sometimes, but I usually don‚Äôt, because when I reply I get HUGE messages in return. I mean huge as in, the messages don‚Äôt even fit on my screen!

I found how he has autism recently, so I understand perhaps he doesn‚Äôt realise I am not interested in him, but I am finding it quite frustrating. He is constantly bragging to me about his life, expensive things he is buying, his rich family etc. It is quite irritating t lo receive messages so often.

He is also quite possessive and clingy over me.  I am single, but I once said ‚Äòboyfriend‚Äô in conversation to someone else, an he immediately came over and asked me what I said, and only went away when I said I did not have a boyfriend. (Has done similar in other times I have mentioned relationships etc)

I am going to be working here for another year, and I feel quite uncomfortable when I have to work with him. He is a nice guy, but I am not interested in a relationship with him, I have done my best to show this but I guess due to his autism he probably doesn‚Äôt get the many obvious hints. 

But he has never actually mentioned to me that he wants to go on a date or anything, so perhaps I am wrong and he isn‚Äôt interested in me. I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this !

Even in the good times,encountering a trigger would make me to live a moment from my childhood for example which wasn't necessarily bad or traumatic,but I will associate it with loneliness,monotony and sadness.It hurts,it hurts a lot because mentally it feels very real.Those ""triggered"" memories brings me a cascade of bad emotion and thoughts.

Another example is linked to the road to home.Seeing some old buildings immediately would make me to remember how lonely I felt while walking in that place and how no one is at home.Or if I walk beside those buildings and an abandoned apartement will appear,I will immediately imagine myself as an old guy sitting in the apartment being lonely and unhappy.

Hell,even practicing my hobbies became somewhat awfull. As a electronics enthusiast,everytime when I work,I feel as a boring human being who would end up alone with his stupid circuits,devices and ideas.Imagining a weird scientist who died alone in his old lab.

I have an awesome Gf,I love her very much,we are living together(but the emptiness and loneliness still persists).I don't consider my childhood very bad,even if it had it's unpleasant moments.

The thought of her leaving me plagues me to the bone because I remember how alone I was before being with her and how bad everything it felt.

I don't know if this is a real condition or if is linked to my probable depression or it's normal.

TL:DR:I live in some kind of weird,easy to trigger scenarios were I imagine myself miserable and it brings me a cascade of bad thoughts and feels.",30Nov2020,1

505,"this is kind of long, so please bear with me.

Also, we go to a private school, so the girls wear dresses.

As the title says, I recently got into a fight with my friend. It was over something really stupid, to be honest, and I have no idea what to do about it. For context, we were at lunch at our school with our group of friends, which is around six people (including me and her). She had been bullying (it's a bit of a harsh word, but it's the only one I can think of) one of the nicer friends in the group for a week or two now. The nicer kid wasn't the smartest person in the world, so she would ask a lot of questions to my friend. The problem is, whenever she would ask a question, my friend would get upset and instead of encouraging the nicer friend and helping her, she would make fun of her and get angry when the nicer friend didn't get an answer right to a question.

so we were sitting in our group and once again, my friend was making fun of the nicer friend. The nicer friend had wanted to get into drawing for a while, so our artistic friend gave her some tips and drew some references on the nicer friend's sketchbook. I was sitting behind my friend when she started pestering the nicer friend. She kept telling her to ""let me draw in your sketchbook"" and ""you let Artistic Friend draw in your sketchbook, why can't I?"" at this point, I was getting annoyed with her bothering and without thinking, grabbing a small handful of bark from the garden behind me and dropped it in her lap. I guess I thought this would distract her from bullying the nicer friend, as we had always jokingly thrown bark at each other for god knows what reason.

She stood up and reached behind me to grab a fistful of bark and thinking this was a small retaliation, I ran a few steps away and laughed. But she wasn't laughing. She ran after me and grabbed the neck part of my dress and tried to drop the bark down my shirt. I slapped her hand away and was honestly kind of confused and uncomfortable.

She reached back into the garden and got another handful of bark, before backing me into a wall and roughly grabbing the neck of my dress again. she was pulling it so hard that the zip at the front of my clothing started unzipping. I grabbed her hands in an attempt to stop her, but she threw the bark at me, grabbed another handful, and then threw it onto my head. I was scared and confused and overall uncomfortable as shit. I didn't think putting bark in her skirt would get such an aggressive reaction like that, but apparently, it did.

I pushed her away and asked her what the hell she was doing. she told me that I put bark down her shirt. I told her it wasn't my intention and apologized for it and told her that I wanted to put it in her skirt to distract her from bullying the nicer friend. I asked for an apology for her backing me into a wall and scaring the crap out of me just so she could throw handfuls of bark down my shirt, but she refused. I apologized again and at this point was starting to get more annoyed than I was before. this caused a back and forth, with her being immature and refusing to apologize back, even though I had said I was sorry multiple times before. She, again, refused to apologize and I started to get really mad, so I told her something I probably should have kept to myself. I said i ""feel bad for the person who had to raise you."" I admit that was too far. I have no excuse for what I said. it was rude and uncalled for.

The bell went for the end of lunch and she left.

I honestly don't know what to do in this situation. This was the fourth fight I had with someone close to me in the past month, and I'm starting to think all of this is all my fault. It's seriously been bugging me all day, and I'm not sure whether to message her and apologize again, but knowing her she would try and start another argument that I honestly don't have the energy for right now.

I know she's a good person, she was just raised in a way where doing stuff like this was okay, I guess. I just don't know what to do. we have disagreed on stuff in the past (case in point: whether white people should say the n-word for informational purposes. She was for, I was against.) but never to this extent. I know this is probably ""bullshit teenage drama"" but I'm really confused and have no idea how to approach this in a way where we both benefit.

Can someone please tell me what I should do?

515,"Hi r/Advice, me again.
This year has been tough, a lot of emotion, experiences and news in so short spaces of time while I try to assume my place in this trip and find a way to accomplish my goals and projects. One of the biggest problems that I found is organizing myself; through my day I have long periods of free time that I commonly waste in watching media, having not happy thoughts or both (crap, I just realized that the year almost end and I still in this f*cking hole... Anyway). So, these months I repeatedly tried to organize myself for developing my personal projects (studying for university's admission test is the principal one) as a way to fight against these bad emotions. 
About my bad emotions: Basically, anxiety. I have gone to the therapist for approximately two months, and even if we don't have a conclusive diagnosis, my medical chart (nervousness, some times tachycardia and fast-breathing, dizziness, muscular pain) match with anxiety's one.
The problem is that every time that I try to organize my schedule there is always something that is happening around me that I need to put some attention in; going to market with my mother, attending occasional tasks on the home, helping with something, or just waiting my family for doing things. Let me explain this last part: while I and my mother try to wake up early like a normal person (6:00-7:00 am), the rest of my family (other 3 persons) is more of these people that sleep at 3:00 am and wake up until 9:00 am, not being efficient until the middle day. Commonly I have to wait until the 11:00 for having breakfast, thing that steals a lot of time. I try to do those things alone in my own times, but the scoldings due to the ""noise that I cause"" are common. Other times, the problem is mine. As I said, I am going to therapy, but some times do what I'm supposed to do is impossible because one time that the anxiety starts, well, I need to turn off my head with some entertaining shit, and until I don't feel calm, I can't work in anything. 
I think that the last topic I need to solve with the professional, but I have no clue about how to deal with the first one; I know there are more people with situations and issues similar to me that have success organizing their time and life, so, Is there any tip or advice for this situation?",30Nov2020,1

3 years ago I started university (computer science) and I still have to pass a lot of exams, basically in all those years I've passed about 4 exams out of 16, I want to give up and drop the university since the second year but I still didn't because of my mom, she really wants me to succeed and be proud of me and I feel like if I drop out she's gonna be sad and disappointed because I didn't make it.

I tried sending my CV around to some companies near me in hope to maybe find a part-time software developer job (i have an IT diploma) so I wouldn't waste my parents money anymore, but they either didn't reply or just didn't call me back after the interview.

On the other I really lost interest in studying and would probably prefer trying to find a full-time job with the diploma.

518,"Ever since my sister finished high school with an average of 88/100 points, she really wanted to major in Dentistry, at first we thought that granting her a seat in dentistry school would be no issue.

However as it would turn out, the minimum high school average at the 2020-2021 academic year is no lower than 96/100 which is insane! As a result my sister was forced majored in Pharmaceutical sciences instead(since this was the best option she had).

We knew that my sister would not find the idea of studying anything other than her passion exactly great, and indeed she isn't keen about her current major, she is studying hard but really despising everything about her studies.

My sister intends on repeating her high school final exams in hopes of raising her grades to major in Dentistry, it would be difficult to her due to the following reasons:

1. She has good grades already in her high school final exams score, and doing the exams again would grant her little to no raise in points.
2. while studying again for her high school finals she has to keep up with studying her current college subjects which would be a huge load to bear.

We have considered sending her to study abroad in a Turkish private university for example(where the entrance high school grades for Dentistry would be lower than here in Jordan), but the tuition fees are way too expensive and we cannot afford such fees.

At this point I really have no clue on how I can help my sister, she hates the current major she signed up for, and I am concerned her since she is bearing a huge load on her shoulders and wants nothing but Dentistry, if you have any ideas on how I can help her please let me know I need it.",30Nov2020,1

The hardest part is not getting my hopes up as I see her often and we are good friends.

There are other girls I will meet, I know this, but at this point in time it's not happening and it's been really difficult for me.

It's gotten to the point where I need this to just stop but I can't force my feelings off. Perhaps it's just a case of me needing to be more disciplined and not even entertaining the idea of us ever being together again. I get angry at myself when I get my hopes up only to be pushed down again.

Please give me advice on how to deal with this, it's messing me up quite a lot. I do just want her to be happy, regardless of where I am but at the same time it's caused me a lot of pain.

A couple weeks ago she brought up getting a dog, and I thought she was joking, given our lack of space and 2 cats already. Then eventually she told me she applied for a puppy and I freaked out. I told her through many conversations it makes me uncomfortable, I would feel so cramped in our apartment, the space is starting to feel not like mine with all the animals and stuff, and I‚Äôm not ready to give up my quiet free time to entertain a puppy. Plus I don‚Äôt want to live in a zoo...

531,"So, today we had a family get-together where my Mum's side families spent time together. I was taking care of my younger cousin brother, who's thirteen while I'm sixteen. We were cuddling together like usual and were watching Tv together when things got a bit creepy.

 He snaked his arms from my back to my breast and squeezed them. Not knowing how to react, I just playfully pulled myself out of his grip and smacked his arm. He showed his adorable grin and gave a babyish laugh, then asked me to lie on his arm again. I thought he would not repeat that move so I let him hug me again. He is stronger as well as taller than me, so his grip was strong. Then he squeezed them again, folded with them, and even tried to slip his hand into my shirt, but luckily it just touched the fabric of my bra, not my breast. He then moved my hair back and rested his head on my shoulder while nuzzling my neck, simultaneously playing with my breast. He stopped when someone came into the room, then started again as they left. He even got a bit hard. 

When his mother came to check, he leapt away from me and naively focused on his cartoons. His mom said something weird that raised a doubt in me that she already knew about this behaviour. Her exact words were, ""Why are you not with the boys? Didn't I tell you to be with them only?"" He just replied he wants to spend time with his sister (me) instead.

 I did not stop him, neither did I tell our parents, thinking it was out of curiosity. At his age, I was curious about these things too. I never touched anyone though but my another cousin (my dad's side) would always try to check my underwear and even touched me down them once when I was 10/11 and he was 14 or 15. I didn't tell my parents since he stopped as he grew older. I don't know what should I do. How should I get him to stop touching others? Don't get me wrong, I don't want to tell his parents yet because his mother is weak-hearted and innocent to take a step against her son, and his father is overly strict already, and the consequences will be dangerous if I tell him about this.",30Nov2020,1

My skin is almost 100% cleared after a few days of simple treatment and my question is, should I tell this dude how unethical his treatment has been? I literally cried at every appointment because I have been so STRESSED as these infections can be chronic if they aren't dealt with throughout the household. He added unnecessary stress in the middle of a pandemic by not taking me seriously and telling me to stay off the internet. 

One of the most offensive things he went to was when I started tearing up because he was literally gaslighting me he turned around and said he's doubling my spironolactone to try to adjust my hormones.

536,"I didn't recieve any sort of intervention nor childhood assistance to help, or any socialization with other children with autism, so I can't draw from past experiences or professional help. 

As an adult, I come across as awkward, focused, disorganized, or shy. I mask relatively well and am able to integrate moderately with abled folks. Any traits that I do display obviously can be brushed off as me being an anxious millennial. I can work through my sensory issues pretty well, and when I can't, I know to separate myself from others to deal with it. I've been navigating ASD pretty much alone for thirty years.

I want to start sharing my experiences with ASD but every time I go to do so, I stop myself. What if other folks think I'm faking or seeking attention? What if I'm entirely brushed off? 

My mom, who passed a few years ago, disciplined me into being afraid of sharing. She was deeply ashamed of having a less than ideal child and instilled that shame in me using unpleasant methods. 

I don't even tell psychiatrists because I start to feel very legitimate fear whenever I even think about bringing it up. Only my siblings and my husband know.

538,"For the longest time, I thought this was something only I did, until I stumbled across a comedian who talked about something almost identical to what I experience in his stand up routine. It gives me hope that others out there who experience this might be able to help me cope.

Throughout the day (most commonly when i'm alone or not doing anything or merit as that provides my mind time to wonder) I think about embarrassing/regretful stuff i've done in the past and believe me...there's a lot of it!

I wasted the last 2 years of my life: pining over someone when my feelings were unrequited and a political thing that scared me to the point of constantly being on edge; one friend even pointed out that I was rocking back and forth about it once. I regret waiting those 2 years on stuff that in the end meant nothing, but worse still was that I needed to confide about it in friends and family to the point of them not wanting to talk about it anymore; I think i've genuinely pushed people away with my behavior on these issues.

Thinking back on the things I did randomly throughout the day makes me feel so stupid, I physically clench and if it's really bad: smack my head or hold back a yell. And these are only a few examples:

A more recent example was seeing a movie in cinemas with friends. We were there because we knew the film would be bad and wanted to take the piss, but I got too carried away and it wasn't until a friend told me after the movie ended how loud i'd been. I felt awful not only for the people watching the movie, but some of my friends; this was the first time they'd seen a movie with me; the terrible first impression i'd made. 

You get the idea: I do a lot of stupid shit and it haunts me. Even if I try to be better going forward, i'm still taunted by my old fuck ups...What can I do?",30Nov2020,1
539,"My worst nightmare came true. He cheated on me. 

I got up early because I couldn't sleep. I went down to the office to do my work. He was still sleeping since it's quite early. I was at my desk but his work iPad kept going off. I wasn't going to get up and look, but when it happened the 5th time, it got annoying. I got up and saw the messages. It was some girl. I don't know who. I've never heard of her or seen her before. I saw pictures..which I wish I didn't. 

My heart shattered. 

I got flashbacks of my past and started to cry. 

I took pictures of his messages and left the house. I called my best friend from my car. Told her what was going on. I then called my parents. This house we live in was a gift from my parents when I moved out. I decided I was going to kick him out and move into the spare apartment my parents own for the time being. 

I confronted him when I went back in. I woke him up and showed him what I had seen. He tried denying it. After a bunch of times me not listening, he said ""you would've left one day anyway who cares"" ""every man wants you, you can go find someone else and fall in love with him, it's not that hard"" 

this broke my heart. I couldn't believe what he said. I don't know what changed him this fast. I don't know why he did this. 

I held myself together and told him to leave within 2 hours or I'm calling the cops. 

Goodbye and thank you to everyone who responded.

542,"I‚Äôm 25 and have never hade any experience with a women. Its kinda of a long story so i will briefly explain why. I went to a small privet school and there weren‚Äôt a lot of options and after dropping out in the 11th grand to chase my career i got completely consumed with working and didn‚Äôt go out much and worked with all men. Around this time i started suffering from pretty bad depression and other mental issues like OCD, anxiety. After dealing with this for a while my career fell apart and i cut ties to all my friends and now i don‚Äôt go out much except for errands. I don‚Äôt bother asking people out because i know people aren‚Äôt going to be very interested in a virgin thats pretty much unemployed and is depressed most of the time. If you want to know more you can read some of my other posts I‚Äôve made about my situation. 

Recently I‚Äôve finally decided to get my metal heath in a better place and once i do that I want to finally try dating but i don‚Äôt know were to start or what women are going to think about me. 

I don‚Äôt know what women are going to think of a 25 year old kissless virgin. I‚Äôm not sure if i should tell them or keep it a secret even though I‚Äôm sure there going to be able to tell if we start getting intimate haha. I assume this Is something i should tell them in person not through text or online. 

I have a eating disorder related to my OCD. So one of my biggest concerns Is that getting in the way of dating. I cant just go to any restaurant and this is probably getting a head of my self but they idea of going to there parents house and me not being able to eat what they‚Äôve cooked and them thinking I‚Äôm wired gives me anxiety just thinking about it lol. I‚Äôm also concerned what most girls are going think about it. I do like to cook and I‚Äôm willing to cook what ever they would want even if i don‚Äôt eat it. Would you think that would make up for my eating disorder being a burden to them?

I‚Äôm also a introvert with some social anxiety so going to bars or other crowded things isn‚Äôt going to work for me (plus Covid). So I think my best chance is online but i have no idea what to post on online dating websites. I also don‚Äôt know any good date ideas that don‚Äôt involve eating or crowded places beside getting tea/coffee or going for a walk. Which I feel like is going to be boring for most women my age. I generally don‚Äôt have a problem making friends but until i get to know someone a little I‚Äôm not the most talkative person unless there asking a lot of questions. I also have a pretty good since of humor i typically don‚Äôt have a problem making people laugh but i feel like if the date is centered around use just talking the hole time there is going to be a lot of pressure especially if it my first time and I feel like i would just mess it up. I‚Äôm probably over thinking it though. 

I‚Äôm not sure when i should start trying to date either. Like when i have my life completely back together which might take awhile or just start trying when i start to get the depression better managed. I know confidence is key and fitness is part of my plane to get better mental heath ( I have a bit of a dad bod right now lol) and i think that will boost my confidence or I‚Äôm pretty sure i can just learn to fake it haha. 

Sorry for this being so long and rambley but if you read all of this I appreciate it. If you dont want to comment feel free to chat or send a pm. Oh and I‚Äôm dyslexic so forgive any mistakes.

i tried not to overthink it because i don't think he feels the same way but i can't, i stopped going home with him for 2 weeks now but i still can't stop thinking about him. it can't get to more than friends it will ruin everything, and be overall weird because he's so different than me, we're practically polar opposites so i don't really think that my friends see anything so i didn't wanna tell anyone about it because it would seem weird. i know ive blabbed a lot of nonsense but i really wanna know if there 1% a chance with him how can i know if he's interested that way, and in case (which is very likely) he only does that because he's my friend, how do i stop my feelings for him from growing, i feel like im overwhelmed.",30Nov2020,1

I notice I take it off a lot. To do dishes, to shower, to do chores. And I think it's simply because I'm just not used to wearing it. So does anyone have any advice on how to wear my ring all the time without feeling weird or worrying that I'm gonna ruin it?",30Nov2020,1

553,"How do I accept that my boobs are not ideal.

My boyfriend (M18) and I (F17) have been together for 2 years. He has never done or said anything on purpose that has made me insecure. He is always reassuring me that be loves my body and would not change me.

For starters I just want to paint the picture. My boobs have always been saggy. They have absolutely zero lift and are uneven and overall ugly.

Everyday I cry at least once or multiple times due to my insecurities. I wake up and instantly think about all the girls he has seen via porn or lewd pictures on twitter that have nice boobs. He stopped watching porn due to issues it caused but the occasional lewd picture comes on his twitter timeline. It‚Äôs not like he is following people who post these things, it just shows on his TL because other people like/retweet it. Later I will go to the tweets and analyze how different my body is to theirs.

I know that porn isnt real and it has everything to do with lighting and angles. However the people on twitter are just everyday people. 

I don‚Äôt know why my brain cannot just believe what he tells me. These are my own problems and insecurities but I am pushing them onto him. They are causing problems in the relationship as I am sad most of the day and overall cranky.

It‚Äôs also important to add that I have lost a significant amount of weight. So far I‚Äôm down 120lbs. This also causes many other insecurities due to lose/saggy skin. All of my insecurities cannot be fixed without surgery. Which is most likely out of my reach for a long time. I would do absolutely anything to stop feeling this way everyday.

Usually, I'm a happy person, my friends are great and we have a laugh, and I'd always be there for them if they wanted to talk about anything that is troubling them. I'd make time for them, just to get them in a better place, cause in my mind, it was the right thing to do for my friends, and I'd never expect anything back, just them being happy would be enough.

561,"Ever since I came to learn of NoFap's existence which was about.. 2 years ago or so, I've always had conflicting thoughts about my usage of pornography and I've felt I did myself bad rather than actually doing myself a favour. I'm not addicted to pornography, I tend to use it everyday or every other day only once a day.

I've seen arguments from both people who argue against NoFap and those that are for it, and I didn't want to post there because I know extreme bias would be present. I feel that people on there blame porn for all the problems that they have encountered in the world rather than actually blaming themselves and taking the initiative to alleviate the problems and obviously getting rid of porn for them would help, but it's the propaganda type stuff that's being pushed out and the elitism that annoys me about it.

At the same time I've seen articles on YourBrainOnPorn that pull me into the thought process of ""Okay, maybe this is really bad"" but then I realized that the person who had gathered all these articles and these studies isn't someone who studied neuroscience and majority of the articles on there are reports on **addicts** rather than people who use it on a **moderate** basis. I have HOCD (Homosexual OCD) and I have gay sexual thoughts only when I'm using pornography. I can go without pornography for a while, I went without it for 2 months and I didn't feel any different except that I didn't fantasize or have gay sexual thoughts, but intense desire to have sex with women and/or have relationships with women.

With all this being said, I am a virgin myself, I haven't really experienced sex yet despite being 26 years old but that's due to my anxiety problems rather than the fear of rejection and just depression that had plagued me but I have been going through therapy and my depressions pretty much almost entirely gone, I just need to get my life together in a financial sense and obviously in a general sense.

Am i better off without using pornography or doesn't it really matter? On one hand I feel like I should because I fantasize about doing sexual things with men while watching pornography but don't when i am not even when aroused, but on the other hand I find it to be harmless fun as long as it doesn't get in the way of anything else in my life.

I'm literally obsessed with him and I know not good me as well as him but I'm now finding myself helpless. Have texted him many times since last night and few msg were seen but he didn't replied so I texted him again saying atlest you can reply on whatsapp as said by you and those texts are still is unseen. And I'm really getting mad because of this. I don't understand what to do should convince him to talk or should try to git him off my head. I saying that it won't be possible to talk again is breaking me from inside like anything. I need a advice on how to convince him to talk and if it doesn't help how to get him off my head. Because I need to protect my mental helath. Does this happens with everyone or its just me going through all this. I don't know how I'm going to stay without talking to him. 
For last few days I was not in my sense I was much frustrated and irritated and was diagnosed with clinical depression and vent on him many a time in my frustration. I know I have hurted him a lot and last night I had apologized for the same. But I really want him in my life. If anybody can guide me through this I would we glad and thankful.",30Nov2020,1

She tried to convince me to sign a roommate release form so that she would be absolved from any responsibility from break the lease and I would have to take the burden and live there for another half year. I told her I couldn‚Äôt do that as I can‚Äôt live there anymore as it gives me pain. She then started attacking me about all the things her parents did for me and that I‚Äôm an asshole and cheap but I told her she agreed to pay half the rent half the lease when we moved in together. She lost her job and for months I was paying rent by myself. She‚Äôs resorted to attacking me personally because she now has to also pay half of the breaking of the lease.

568," A close friend was diagnosed with adhd today. I just got off a long video call with him. He tried to downplay it initially by laughing and joking about how everything made perfect sense now. But he couldn't keep it up and then completely broke down. I could feel the fear and the anxiety in his voice. He was panicking.  
People somehow just tell me stuff, so I did what I usually do - listened closely, tried not to analyse too much. But I didn't know what else to do . He lives in a different state. I know he really needed a warm hug then. He feels so alone.   
But I haven't been doing well the past few months myself, so I'd gotten myself working on as much as I could. Made time in my day for college classes, exam prep, working out, driving classes and two completely unrelated (but both very important) side projects that I'm doing a lot of reading/learning for. I feel exhausted and burnt out. I feel like I'm drowning, but I have no other options. I shut down completely when I don't force myself to get off my bed and work.   
His call caught me off guard and now I can't stop thinking about it. The last time I opened up to someone didn't work out that well for me. They got weird when I told them that what they'd said affected me a bit.  
Is there any way I can help him without turning into more of a wreck myself? Please help he trusts me so much.",30Nov2020,1

574,"Apologies if the format is a little off, I don't really post anything. I'm using a throwaway. (Also, sorry ahead of time if there's a better sub for this. :/)

I'm 14, I'm on my first year of highschool, and where I live some scholarships are only available for certain grades. I know that I have a college fund so I should be able to go to college, but my mom and dad don't really know how many years of college that will support me for. (I want to go to vet school, so I know I'm in for the long haul) My siblings went to college through the military, so they've said they need to do some research on it because they haven't really had to do this before.

My concern is that I've brought it up a few times now and he still hasn't done any research or looked into the fund, and I have absolutely no clue how to do that myself. I know it seems like I'm being impatient and I shouldn't be worrying about this when I'm not even done with my first year. But as I said, all of these scholarships are only available at certain times and there a few I can only apply for in 9th grade. I can't make a decision on whether or not to apply for them unless I know what the deal is with my fund; I want to make sure that if there isn't enough to concretely support me for my years in college I have scholarships to back me up. (I also want to apply to a good university, and I've already set myself up for it with AP classes, planned dual enrollment, honors classes since middle school, and a vet class that should let me be a certified vet tech by the time I'm out of high school, so this is not unusual for me.)

I also recognize how privileged I am to even have a college fund in a first place. I know I am extremely lucky, and I appreciate it so so so much. I've just heard the horror stories of student loans and the crippling debt way too many times now, and I'm just scared and worried that I'll end up the same way. I want to cover my ass, but I don't know how much I need to. I want to know that I can afford it, but I don't know how to do any of this and I really need my parents to sit down with me and talk this stuff through. 

They are loving parents and amazing people, but they have a bad habit of putting things off. (I've been trying to get them to sit down and have a real talk about making my tortoise an enclosure for a year now) Everything just gets put to the side if it's not something with an immediate effect, and then it gets forgotten until I bring it up again. It's also really unusual to get them to sit down with me on the couch or whatever and have a serious conversation where we plan or figure out logistics of something. Like I said, they only really do that when it NEEDS to get done soon or at the last minute.

If I need those scholarships so I can go to college, I need to know sooner rather than later so that I don't miss them. What am I supposed to do?",30Nov2020,1

so guys lately i see one of my friends taking me and my other friend for granted and his words sometimes hurt.

this friend of mine is very close and we have been friends for about 16 months now.

I lately have noticed him being not giving importance. so it happened that this guy organized a trip all of my other friends refused to go. i went bcoz i did nt see the place. there were around 35 people. I was left all alone by myself in about 80% of the trip. there was another guy who came alone, we both talked a little and he gave company to me, thanks to him otherwise i wouldn't even have enjoyed the place even a little bit.

but my friend, come in the beginning , sits along with me for 20 mins , and that's it we didnt talk much after that , he went to all the places with his lady friends and i was left alone.he even though apologized to me saying that he had to give priority to the job and those friends. i felt very low.

 note -\[the trip took 12 hours to complete .

then , this guys tells my other friend that I am not that worthy of taking a picture with him. he says that he did not come to the trip to take  picture with me .he will only take pictures with others on the trip. now , i am person who wants to make memories and take pictures with friends atleast at unique places , i dont like to take pics with strangers. i honestly didnt like this reply from him, i kept quite and some how managed to escape that convo.

moreover, if there is a statement , this guy always speaks like he is always right and he knows most of it.he is quite older than me, so i get it that he has seen more of life than me , but it doesnt mean that he knows everything.  and keeps on advicing to me , which i dont listen to ;

then i am an international student, and he says that i have wasted all my opportunities and  which is some what true but as a friend you should encourage ur friend like say go out and learn something new, or go and volunteer instead he says that you have wasted 2.5 years of your uni life,  you missed on all the opportunities and then talks about his accomplishments . which i don't even care even a little bit . but somehow , sometimes i feel small .

then he sometimes , shows anger on me , when i would even have done anything wrong .

guys , i want you all to give advice on what should i do , so that i am not being respected less than others. first of all , i need to stop bing a pushover , always saying a fu\*king yes all the time.",30Nov2020,1
580,"TL:DR bought a van, havent told family, now we're having s reunion... what to do?

So I'm one of those people who wants to live in a van
No, not for instagram and no not for the a e s t h e t I c, i want to live in a van because i want to travel and be nomadic. I always have been nomadic and as a result my friends and family are all over the place. I'm also getting worried about the general society crumbling situation going on, so being mobile is best for me right now. 

A few weeks ago I bought a van! Finally! I had been saving for months and working my butt off to pay for everything and I finally did it! Bought her on the other side of the country and drove 8 hours round trip to get her - was totally worth it! So far I've been clearing her out because there was a bunch of crap in the back from the previous owner.

I haven't told many people about it because I honestly just dont want to hear it. I've also been worried about money etc so wasn't even sure if i could even afford this venture but it's all worked out smoothly. Namely I haven't told my family, we're not that close so that's not so weird but the main worry is my mum. She's very discouraging and unsupportive, every time we talk about me living in a van, we argue and generally disagree so keeping it from her was something I was fine to do for a bit while I got things set up (insurance, tax, budgeting etc).

So this weekend we're having a bit of a reunion, its someone's 90th birthday so we're meeting up (distanced) and that's going to be somewhat dramatic but nice nonetheless. I would love to drive the van down for this (it's a few hours, would also save me money on an airbnb since I cant stay with family), I'm low on cash anyway because of the van so buying tickets is not something I want to or need to do.... so I'm thinking about driving down in the van

My issue is if I drive the van down and announce this at said birthday, would I not be taking attention from someone else? It's their 90th so I think its nicer to put all attention on them and not interrupt with my van business? I'm pretty sure my mum will kick off... even at a family gathering so... what should I do?

I am a senior in college and I will be graduating this year. I always go back and forth on law school and I don't know whether I to go or not. I am currently in real estate and having a law degree will be extremely beneficial to me in the real estate field.

Another thing I should address is finances. I come from a very wealthy family myself and my father died last month. He left my sisters and I a very good inheritance so I am covered there. My boyfriend also said that he would be open to paying any remaining costs if the program is online.

Most times I naturally response (loudly!) with ""NO I'M NOT SHORT-TEMPERED, I'VE BEEN PATIENT WITH YOU."" Then this gives the person the perfect opportunity to say ""See? You're being short-tempered right now!""

It seems like the only thing that can truly trigger me is when someone calls me short-tempered when I'm not. If I respond aggressively in my defense they would immediately cite my response as evidence for short-temperedness.

588," Hi everyone,

I'm looking for advice on an unfortunate situation I've come to be in after living with my brother for almost a year. For reference, my brother is 10 years older than me. I own my own house, and have a career, serious boyfriend and pets. When he moved in it was initially to help him get back on his feet in order to find his own place. Fast forward 6 months, and I plan on having my boyfriend move in in February - I told my brother a month ago that I would like for him to find his own place by February. I think giving 3 months notice, it's more than reasonable after allowing him to live with me for this long. I'm an adult and want privacy with my boyfriend.

My brother has taken this information, and has since decided to stop talking to me altogether. He leaves the house when I get home from work, and avoids me any other time. He will not respond to my texts asking him to sit down to discuss why he is so mad at me. He has stopped doing anything around the house.

589,"Because I‚Äôve recently got back into work after lockdown, I‚Äôm getting tired a lot easier and sleeping a lot more. Also little things stress me out a lot easier, so that just makes me want to take myself away. There is no deep rooted issue, just me trying to get back into the swing.

591,"Had a dream that there was a shooter at my school, and it was around 7:30 in the morning. Guy came in with a shotgun through the office and stormed into the main hallway. I was hiding in a duffle bag in the student union (caf√©) and then he turned the corner into the next hallway from what i could see while laying on the floor. 

This was the very vivid part for me: He turned the corner, and he would go to every classroom, swing open the door from what it sounded like and start killing everyone while they were screaming. Suddenly, a list would appear in my hands telling me who in the current classroom just got killed. The pictures and names of the students and/or teachers would fade onto the list in front of me. Only 2 or so friends died and people i knew did, which actually was quite sad. 

Before the lockdown, they instructed us to hide in the ceiling because they thought hiding in the corner of the room would not be an option. But instead i just ran off, and found the duffle bag i could hide in which was fairly large. But everyone else never got the chance to leave before they locked the doors to the classrooms, so they were stuck in there until the shooter busted in.  So yeah, here‚Äôs me on Monday morning.

594,"Wrote this for r /amitheasshole and found out they don't take posts about suicide, so I'm moving it here.

My sister and I have always been close and have been dealing with similar mental illnesses for a long time. Around two months ago, she broke up with her boyfriend of five years and hasn't been taking it well in the slightest. She's been fully ready and willing to throw her life away, drop out of college and go live in her car, stuff like that. They shared an apartment together and now have to cancel the lease and everything. Her bf reached out to me in the initial stages of this (though they had broken up, he's a really good guy and wanted to make sure she was taken care of) and him, our mom and I helped organize a place for her to stay and tried to see how she could get into therapy. It was really difficult for me if I'm honest- I've made myself responsible for the mental health and well being of others in the past and it consistently drains me of any energy and motivation and frequently, it gives me bad suicidal ideation. Pulling my hair out over trying to push my sister out of her own inertia made me extremely suicidal, so much so that when I wrote something private about how I was feeling, it was flagged by my school's monitoring system and they sent the police to my house. (I'm okay, I went with the cops to a place that gave me some resources, I'm doing a bit better now. ) I admit that taking on that responsibility wasn't the best idea because I already knew it was going to make me feel this way, but I was one of the few people my sister was even talking to at the time and so I felt that us few alone had the power to make sure she didn't die, and backing off was a risk I wasn't willing to take.

Cut to about two weeks ago, my sister blows me up telling me to call her ex because she really needs to talk to him. I do, and he tells me that she basically called him and ranted off about what a terrible person he is and that he's not helping her out of her situation (which is just objectively untrue,) and when he said he wasn't going to let her yell at him and hung up, she began calling and texting him incessantly, demanding to speak to him. He had to block her. To me, that totally makes sense, she isn't entitled to his attention especially if it's just to berate him. When I circled back to my sister and told her what he said, she went off on me, telling me that she was about to kill herself and that he was the only person who could talk her out of it so she needed me to get them in contact. I understand where she was at, but I literally don't have the power to make him talk to her, so I tried to offer alternatives. She wasn't taking them. She was genuinely angry with me for not being able to make him speak to her. I was texting her ex in the middle of all this, and he kept telling me to get my mom or call 911 if she was truly going to kill herself. My mom unavailable, I told my sister I'm going to have to call the police. She said that if she was committed to a mental hospital that she'd lose her job, so she didn't want me to do it. But I was worried for her life over her job, so even though she was angry with me, I called 911.

On the phone I mentioned to them her fear of being committed, and they told me there are laws in place where her job shouldn't necessarily find out, and if they did, being fired for it would be against the law. (I believe my sister was more worried about ""missing work and getting fired"" than ""being fired for being mentally ill"", so this wasn't super helpful, but I was so emotional during this phone call I just sputtered out an ""okay."") I called back the police department a few hours later to ask how it went, and it sounded like they did a wellness check on her very similar to what they did with me weeks prior: they came to her door and spoke for about ten minutes or so, and gave her the option to go to the mental health center where they took me (which is NOT a mental hospital. You fill out some insurance paperwork and speak to a mental health professional for as long as you need, they give you resources and send you home.) The officer told me she passed on going, but he gave me his assurance that he wouldn't have left had he felt she was a danger to herself.

Here's the thing: my sister and I both... aren't big fans of cops. I can 100% imagine my sister under emphasizing her crisis just to get them off her porch and not go with them anywhere. However, I'm reminded of a post I saw on tumblr once where a black user spoke of their therapist calling the police to their door during a mental health crisis, and having to pretend everything was okay to get them to go away, and chewing out their therapist afterward. The operative thing in that situation is that they were black, and they were worried about the officer killing them. My sister and I are both blonde young white women who any cop would, at first glance, bend their asses over backward to help during a mental health crisis. I know my sister knows this. That's why I cooperated with the police when they came to my door, because it's a one on one situation where no one is at risk and not cooperating with them wasn't going to cause any favorable outcome.

I bring this up because the last I heard from her was my mom telling me about a text she sent her about how pissed she was that I called the police to her house. I haven't heard from my sister since, and it's been two or three weeks now when we normally talk at least every few days or so. (I know she hasn't disappeared or died or anything as she's talking to my mom and my younger brother, just not to me it seems.) She didn't have me help with her move at all when we had asked me to before. She came over to drop off a fish tank a few days ago and we spoke a little about the fish, and it all seemed like everything was okay, but I still get the sense she's giving me the silent treatment. I can't really figure out whether I pulled an asshole move by calling the police instead of begging her ex to unblock her that night or doing something different. Hell, I even offered to go over there myself but she really didn't want it. 

Frankly, I'd like her to apologize for all the times since her breakup that she's called me a terrible person for not giving her the help she wants and telling me that I was leaving her to die, when I had texted a dozen people asking them if she could move in with them (all information I passed onto her.) She's treated me and her ex like this since the breakup (until she stopped talking to me) and it's frustrating because I just barely became an adult while she's a grown woman who refuses to take responsibility for her actions and mental health. While I know intimately that mental illness can make people lash out, I'm of the belief that it doesn't give you a free pass to treat people however you want and never apologize for it. However, I can't really see this situation from an objective perspective and I'm not 100% sure that expecting an apology from my sister is fair here, especially when it seems my sister is waiting for an apology from me instead. With her lashing out, I'm really getting the vibe that she's doing it to isolate herself from the people who care about her, to justify her depression's idea that she's all alone and no one is even bothering to help her. I know that impulse. But, again, it's a dick thing to do and it doesn't absolve you of having to apologize afterward. 

Am I the asshole? What should I do?",30Nov2020,1
595,"I have only two and a half weeks left in undergrad but I have a bunch of assignments left just because that's how the end of the semester always is. A paper, A presentation, 5 assignments and 3 exams. I've obviously been stressed before during college but this time it feels worse than ever and it feels like its growing exponentially. How do I control my stress-related anxiety these next few weeks?

I've been getting shortness of breath and a general feeling of anxiety within an hour or two of waking up every morning and it makes doing my work so much harder to do but I can't stop thinking about my work. But then the anxious feeling makes me unable to sit down at my computer and the cycle continues. I think there is some added stress because there are two classes I currently have C's in and I already locked in a job for once I graduate and I'm afraid if I fail I'll lose the job which I know is likely not true but the though keeps popping into my head.

597,"I am about to enter the latter half of my junior year of college.

However, my academic advisor said in order to stay on track I would need to take 3 classes or I'd risk falling behind and not graduating on time.  For me (out-of-state student), 3 classes that will most likely be online will cost us $14,000.

598,"Hello!
I (18F) have been working at a fast food place for around 5-6 months already. There‚Äôs this female coworker (17) who was upgraded to a shift leader position over a month and a half ago. Her position seemed to of gone to her head as she constantly has an attitude or a face with me. Today it just seemed to get worse. I came in this morning and there was no issue until around 11 am where she addressed me and my coworker that we left dishes yesterday that we didn‚Äôt wash and the later shift had to deal with them. I would totally understand if we were cooks but we‚Äôre not and usually if we do use some dishes we always wash them so I told her if she‚Äôs going to tell us from the morning she should tell the afternoon shift as they always leave messes for the morning shift. Later in when I went to my 30 minute break and it was busy all morning and when my break was done I had to urgently go to the bathroom in which I let my other coworker know and I took 5-6 minutes tops and I came back. She began telling me In front of everyone that I should‚Äôve gone to the bathroom on my 30 and that‚Äôs why I get breaks for and I told her I was on my monthly and I had to go and my break ended so I wasn‚Äôt gonna wait.( By the time I came back it wasn‚Äôt busy). She began saying that she still needed another break and that it was getting late she leaves at 3 this happened at 12:26 and I told her to go to her break then.

599,"So I‚Äôm currently 16f am dealing with a lot of things right now. My home life is dysfunctional and is ruining my mental health. 

Background information. I have three sisters two are special needs and one is semi normal aside from being a brat. My parents are horrible, they scream, throw tantrums and even blame me for everything wrong in this house. I usually spend most of my time with my boyfriend and he is so lovely and special. 

Back in December before quarantine happened I was sexually assaulted from my step uncle on my moms side. She blamed me for it and I didn‚Äôt tell her, I told a few of my friends at that time but after how she reacted earlier that year I didn‚Äôt feel the need to talk to her because I didn‚Äôt want anything else to happen. Though one person called cps and I got interviewed about it which my mom found out and went ballistic about how I could not tell her. This is What happened earlier that year.  I was in a deep depression because one of my friends passed away that summer and I was also harassed right after. During the summer my parents found out that I was sexting a few people (curiosity got the better of me) and took away my phone and my support system. My mother called me a slut repeatedly, my older sister a whore and my dad would call me a bitch and make degrading comments towards me whenever there was an argument. This led my depression down a deeper path and I lost myself more than I ever had before. My grades crashed and all I got in most of my classes were 50‚Äôs. I was so lost and I made a lot of bad decisions. I used sex as a coping mechanism so I could feel something again. And in return My best friend slut shamed me and just started making rumours that I was flirting with her crush. 

This all made me realize that the people who I once loved were dead to me now. After everything that they had put me through. I cut my friends off after I started to talk to my now boyfriend at the beginning of quarantine. My friend and I just reconnected and she apologized for being immature about everything that happened. I forgive her wholeheartedly but I can‚Äôt forgive my parents. What they did to me when I was going through all of that hurt me and left scars deeper than any other. I don‚Äôt have any love for them anymore. 

My mental health is currently stable Ish but I need advice on how to keep it this way? How can I cut out the toxicity in my life? Is there any options that I can view to deal with my parents?

But this kept going on and he was not pooping either. I brought him to the local vet who gave him an enema because they felt backed up stool. He passed some but they could still feel something up there. They did bloodwork and radiographs as well. The blood work showed mildly elevated white blood cells and his radio graph was inconclusive because it was hard to see, they didnt know why, possibly fluid. They told me to see if the appetite stimulants and anti nausea medicine they gave him helped that night and then take him to the hospital tmmrw (today) and get an ultrasound if no improvement. So I'm going there now. I'm so scared this is my baby. I would do anything for him. But costs are racking up.

601,"I‚Äôve been working at the same place for a few years now, I‚Äôm really burned out and honestly not happy at all working there - it‚Äôs minimum wage full time service job. The pandemic has definitely made this worse.

I left school at 18 with pretty poor grades and knew I didn‚Äôt want to go into further education at that time anyway because I didn‚Äôt have the motivation/work ethic for it to be worth it. I‚Äôve been working full time since, leading me to now and I‚Äôve saved quite a bit of money because that was pretty much the plan - save as much as I can so when I figure out where I want to go I‚Äôll be ready. 

The difficult part now is deciding whether to accept I‚Äôm not happy and stop working, maybe so I can have some time to work on myself and figure out where I want to go next - the other option being to continue working while I save more money and plan something while I work. The problem with this is its hard for me to find time to work on myself/think about a plan outside of work hours because I‚Äôm always so burnt out.

Some other problems I think I‚Äôll have with just quitting now are that I feel like I haven‚Äôt saved enough money yet and feel even more that I‚Äôll find myself lost or unmotivated. At the moment we are in lockdown so I‚Äôve been off work for a month and I‚Äôve been pretty depressed and unmotivated to do anything.

609,I'm[F] on a work trip with my coworkers and staying in a room in a villa. The rooms have huge windows and they have 2 layers of curtains and I was only using the first thin layer.

612,"I‚Äôve been struggling with my mental health for a long time. I went to a therapist last year (a bit taboo in the UK, there‚Äôs an associated stigma) and he made me realise it wasn‚Äôt my weight that was causing me depression, it was other stuff I‚Äôd been burying.

I have a history of (multiple) sexual assault and rapes, from when I was 14 up until I was around 19ish, and it gave me an unhealthy attitude towards relationships, so I‚Äôve been pretty independent for the most part, have concentrated on my career etc.

Recently I‚Äôve really struggled with my mental health, depression, and anxiety, so I took the first steps to see my Doctor (phone appts only, we are in lockdown) and after prescribing some meds, she told me I needed to get back into counselling. 

Today was my 1st counselling appt (phone) and during the call, a couple of questions got me, the first being what‚Äôs you‚Äôre sexual orientation (straight) so I asked why that was important (to ensure fair treatment, I was told). The second question was a biggie. I was asked: who was it that assaulted you, and I replied ‚Äúfriends/acquaintances and or my boyfriends‚Äù. I was told ‚Äúno, I need names‚Äù.

I said I wasn‚Äôt comfortable giving names, and said I wasn‚Äôt, and I asked why do you want names? I‚Äôm not interested in going after them, I don‚Äôt want anything leaving this confidential talk‚Äù. I was asked if I thought any of them were a threat to others, I said ‚Äúno‚Äù and she responded that they wouldn‚Äôt pass the names on if they weren‚Äôt a threat anymore. So I told her the names. Reiterating that I want nothing to be done. 

After the 1hr+ long call, I‚Äôm massively drained, because the stuff I had to answer was hard, and upsetting, and I was sobbing through most of the last 30 mins of the call, but I carry on doing stuff (it‚Äôs a day off).

Then I get a call back. They are passing the names on, because ‚Äúthey could still be a threat, unless they‚Äôre dead.‚Äù.

I then asked if anything was found that correlates to other rapes or crimes, would I be in anyway contacted in the future, or was anything else needed from me?

I was told they would want details of the attacks. I said I was in no way willing to go into any sort of detail and that I really felt this was a breach of trust. 

I‚Äôm confused and upset, I really need counselling, but I can‚Äôt afford to go private anymore (this is a free service) and my doctor refuses to prescribe antidepressants unless I‚Äôm in touch with this service.

I have been suicidal in the past few months (never with any plans to act on it) so I‚Äôve been waiting for this like a lifeline, but now I feel like if I say anything, that it might be passed on without my permission. Has anyone got any advice, please?",30Nov2020,1

He disappeared on the morning of my birthday, he then rolled in at 4am the next day, blind drunk and stinking of perfume. He didn‚Äôt deny cheating on me, but he lied about the person involved. 

He told me it was a random girl, but I recently found out it was one of his work colleagues, and it was the second time he‚Äôd slept with her. Each time he has cheated on me he has begged for my forgiveness, and I have taken him back.

 Since the start of our relationship I have been on several different prescriptions as I struggle with panic attacks and anxiety. He says that my anxiety puts pressure on him and is stressful for him and he finds my anxiety a turn off and that's why he cheats.

630,"I've been struggling lately with trying to help support my mom emotionally and I'm afraid there's not much left in the tank. 

Here's a quick backstory on her - she's been a single parent her entire life, extremely hard working, self less, caring, just an overall wonderful person. She's struggled with depression and anxiety all of my life and has been on medication. About 7 years ago, she moved in with another family member to save money and to avoid another ridiculous rent increase. This situation was supposed to last a year, maybe two. Fast forward to 5 years later, she's still living there. During this time her mentality completely changed. She went from frugal to spending money like crazy, avoiding social gatherings with family and then was dating a co-worker (more like FWB...). When she was with him, she would avoid everyone, never return calls and it got to the point where we would call hospitals trying to find her because she wouldn't come home. The family member who she was living with would call me to vent and I was struggling with trying to figure out why my mom was acting this way, or doing these things. During this whole time, I was her emotional support ""person"", through all of the ups and downs, trying to be her cheerleader. 

Last year, she landed a job closer to where my husband and I live and we offered to have her live with us until a rental property opened up. This past January, we moved her into  a rental home near us. Her new job was bumpy, I would hear the same excuses she would say at her last company when something would go wrong and after 10 months (this past May), she was let go. Thankfully, she was given unemployment, so that's been a huge help during the pandemic. She's loved crafts, so she's been talking since this summer about making and selling things locally. She's purchased tons of items for ""projects"", but in the seven months she's been unemployed, she hasn't completed or sold anything. I'm worried that she's turning into a hoarder. She hasn't applied for jobs because she's terrified of making a mistake and getting let go again. I'm concerned about her depression as she just primarily sleeps and doesn't seem like herself anymore. She's gone to the doctors multiple times and is on medication, but she seems like a shell of the ""mom I remember"". I keep trying to help motivate her and give her advice whenever she asks, but I'm emotionally spent when nothing comes to fruition. She just realized her unemployment runs out soon and now I'm panicking trying to figure out how we'll be able to keep her afloat. I struggle with anxiety and depression myself and while I take my medication every day, it's getting harder to always be her support system. I've recommended therapy, seeing a psychologist, you name it. I've always been the strong one in my family, but what am I supposed to do when I'm tired to supporting someone who won't help themselves? I love her, but my heart is breaking every day and I feel helpless (and exhausted).",30Nov2020,1
631,"So, I started using my they/them pronouns I just don't know how to tell my mom. My mom isn't homophobic but she is transphobic. I'm not trans or non-binary. I still identify as a girl but I just wanna use they/them pronouns because the pronouns fit me better. 

The reason why I'm afraid to tell her is because there was this one time  I was in sixth grade, I told her that I wanted to be a boy. She looked at me with a dead serious face and said ""If you become a boy, I am going to disown you."" 

Because of that, I am afraid to come out to her about my pronouns. I know that pronouns and gender are different, but my mom thinks it is the same thing. I am still her daughter, I just want her to use my proper pronouns. 

When I came out to her about my sexuality, I have scared out of my mind that she wouldn't accept me for who I was. But to my surprise, she was very accepting of me. I'm just afraid that she wo';t accept my pronouns and continue calling me by she/her.

637,"When I(22nb) was 14 I met a girl (12) over facebook, because I didn't really make friends irl at the time. Let's call her B. Shortly after we started talking, she told me she was going through a breakup and I felt like I should help her. I did. I made her feel okay. All of our talking ended up leading to us figuring out we like each other. We talked and talked, pretty much getting to the point of saying ""I love you."" 

Unfortunately she wasn't completely honest with me, and I found out she was talking to another guy as well. He ended up asking her out on Christmas. She said yes. However, when I tried to leave, she told me to stay or else she would commit suicide. 

Over the next year or so, we'd go back and forth with ""I love you""s, ""I hate you""s, and just bad arguments. This all unfolded with the other boy dumping her. I (now 15) went to meet her (now 13) in person the first time(yes, first time) because she had basically said no before because of her parents. When we met, I held her. We made plans to hangout at my house. We talked a lot before she had come over, and that day ended with cuddling, kissing, and ultimately sex. 

I *never* saw her again after this. The reality of me never seeing her again did not kick in until about a year later. Within that year, we still had a pretty decent relationship, even with the toxic arguments. At this point, we still were not official and she refused to let me come meet her parents. She was afraid for some reason so I stopped questioning her. Due to us not being exactly official, I started talking to another girl. Just talking. We took pictures together on Halloween, and she indicated on instagram that she liked me when she posted the pictures. This angered B a lot. She questioned me about it and I was honest. This is when it went downhill. She started to date other guys. Like, actually date them. I guess she did this to get back at me. This went on for a good while. 

I would question her about these guys when I found out and she would make excuse after excuse, so I started to do the same. I would also try to constantly leave, and she'd threaten suicide if I did. So I stayed. I told her whatever, I'm done with this playing games crap. If you want me, tell me. This ended up as her meddling with other relationships, and telling girls I dated that I was still with her(we were NEVER official). This affected at least 5 different relationships before I made her stop. I was 17 at the time, and I was done. I told her I no longer want anything to do with her, and I blocked her and carried on with the current relationship she was about to ruin. 

3-4 years of emotional torment, over. Relief. Or so I thought..

Flash forward to 2020. I already posted about this on r/legaladvice, however it has been deleted due to legal reasons. I find myself not only in one battle, but now a battle against B. Unlike the other being adult, this is only juvenile. And it turns out the police never took my statement about the emotional abuse, or toxic relationship we had. She is claiming the consensual sex we had, was actually non-consentual. However, I am only being charged with distribution, because I sent pictures to her mother that included censored nudes in an attempt to make her leave me, which did not work. 

What do I do? I have a lawyer and he said he'd handle this but I am trying to have peace of mind. Do you think she has a case? Do I have a case? I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and mild bipolar. And I know for a fact I have PTSD(I was abused during childhood by my stepmother, and after being forced to have dinner with her, I had a 2 hour panic attack.)

My sister isn't super well off and can't afford to pay a regular babysitter's hourly wage. My nephew is on the autistic spectrum so she'd need one trained to deal with that. However, if she can't get a regular one, she definitely can't get a special needs babysitter. 

She and her husband make too much in a year to qualify for food stamps but struggle to pay certain bills so I'm not sure if government assistance is even an option.

Back in 2017 me and my husband moved into our first apartment together after we got engaged. We were living there for a few months before his cousin 30M let‚Äôs say Mike had an unstable living situation and moved in with us. In 2018 we decided to all 3 move into a house together (renting) because it helps us all out financially. Jim and Mike split the rent while I pay utilities and mostly for all the groceries and household items, it seems to even out for the most part. The operation we had seemed to work fine until the chaos of 2020 was released. Mike was traveling for work a week or two on/off for the past couple years until he got laid off back in May. Now he has been unemployed for the past 8 months and of course there‚Äôs a pandemic going on so he‚Äôs home 24/7. I know, not much to do about that, but I‚Äôm going crazy. My husband and his cousin are very close and we all get along but lately I find i‚Äôm really struggling on setting boundaries and adapting to being around each other constantly. I‚Äôm finding he is a bit of a manchild. The arrangement isn‚Äôt working for me any more. Now I would rather pay a portion of rent than cook for my husbands cousin all of the time. I just want to cook for Jim and myself and enjoy dinner with just the two of us. Keep in mind mike can help himself to the groceries I get and feed himself. We just got married and I want to enjoy doing wifely things but not for mike!! I feel so obligated to share everything I make with him because he contributes more to rent and I hate it. I also get mad at Jim for constantly offering our food to him but I don‚Äôt want to come off as greedy. I‚Äôve complained about it to Jim in the past and he‚Äôll give mike subtle comments about a date night once in a while but it‚Äôs not enough for me. I know my husband is a lot more giving than I am.

643,"Here I am, back on my throwaway account as I'm scared to post this on my normal account.

So here we go.

Backstory of which you need to know:

***The source of my anxiety and what this revolves around from the past. (This person doesn't impact me anymore dw about it. I don't know them IRL.)***

So back in 2018 I made a friend who I will call carl. I met him online and we became friends pretty quickly. We began recording youtube videos together and talked about what any other person would, games, shows, what hobbies we liked doing, whatever came to mind. It came to the point in the friendship where I started facing problems IRL and I needed someone to talk to; so I turned to my friend. They said they were there for me. **Big mistake**. I took that as an excuse to let my anxiety take control over me and start doing things I wouldn't usually do.

I allowed myself to start venting almost every day, asking if I could talk about something and it soon turned into him somewhat becoming a ""therapist."" Which I was blind to see. My friend didn't have the heart to tell me no and to stop doing what I was doing. 

During the friendship I kept saying how I thought the friendship is going downhill and that I thought he hated me. Despite him saying that he didn't hate me and that he didn't feel like the friendship was going downhill. So This continued for 3 months, followed by jealousy (by me) and some other things. It came to the point where we had an argument where he called me a sociopath and delusional. Only the delusional part was true (because I couldn't see what I was doing was wrong) but I eventually saw it over the months. 

So after the argument and talking to crisis lines for advice, I eventually waited for 2 months where I made an apology to him and he too apologised for being so harsh during the argument. We both agreed to try and be friends again, but it didn't feel like how it was before. So we went on and off over the months. 

But now we're fine now, we still sometimes talk, but not as much as we use to.

\-----------------------

After knowing that backstory and my mistake (I have changed a lot and many people agree I am a much different and kinder person. Have always been but that year was not a good year for me or my friend.), this lead to some anxiety while talking to new friends. 

What I tend to do is, when I first meet new people, and get attached easily and after speaking with them for a while, I trust them and unexpectedly dump a bunch of my problems onto them. And this is what happened last week. I have made a post on here about it, but decided to redo it as I have more information and need more help. 

So last week I made a voice message for two of my friends in college (I'll get to them in a sec) who I trusted, explaining my previous friendships and why I don't trust people very easily. I accidentally made it 20 minutes long but I knew they didn't really mind, or so I assumed. 

My female friend said she couldn't respond to it but will the next day (Which she did) and then my other friend read it, but didn't respond. 

I met these two friends when I first started my online course 4 months ago I believe and they were the only ones who were bothered to get to know me better. But now I kinda think it was a mistake. 

Whenever I'm in college I get very anxious around new people, especially males after feeling like the 2018 situation will happen again. Nobody knows about it apart from one friend online who said it wasn't my fault that thing happened as I didn't know any better and that I shouldn't let it control me and determine how I am in the future. 

Anyway, as I said, whenever I get anxious I end up going quiet, feeling like I'll say the wrong thing. Or if I want to speak to someone, I physically can't or mentally get myself to do it in fear I'll make things worse. It's basically like selective mutism? that's like the only way I can explain it.

And most of this is around a guy who is in my friend group. Lets name him Ash. He was  the friend I mentioned who read the message, but didn't respond.

For more context, I'm a pretty selfless person, I've helped a lot of people with mental health problems and even helped someone through their depression. I've seen all sorts, self-harm, panic attacks and anxiety attacks and my friend screaming she wanted her life to end. She's doing much better than 5 years ago, but yeah. 

From that, I have managed to learn how to read people and pick up when someone doesn't want to talk or when someone is not doing okay. 

So I mentioned my friend didn't respond and how I tend to lay a lot of things on someone a few months after a meet them, right?  


I ended up overthinking for the next day, wondering if I made him feel like shit or if that made him uncomfortable. Then I realised, ""oh... maybe I should apologise for that and see what he says."" 

Then I get a response saying ""I don't mind reading it, talk about whatever."" or something along those lines. 

This was after I mentioned to my two friends ""Thanks for being there and talking to me. For being really nice and good friends.""

&amp;#x200B;

So why am I making this post?

Ever since I sent that message about my old friends, I've noticed he hadn't really spoken much. We've spoken a few times on his discord server where he talks with his friends (and I join in) and ever since I joined his discord, he slowly stopped talking with me in message.

Messages started to get more spread out.

Not to mention how when I sent a message saying ""hey can we call about something?"" it was COMPLETELY ignored. Plus myy ""hey you doing okay?"" message on snapchat.

*I already know* that:

* Men struggle to express mental health due to society things. (If he had something going on).
* He may have seen the message and been like ""oh that's not urgent, I'll get back to it later"" and probably forgot.
* He may not have been in the mood to respond.
* He had better things to do
* He didn't know how to process it
* He may not have anything to talk about so he didn't want to talk.
* It may have came off as a bit rude or a but pushy.

I've already gotten some advice of what to do for communication, but Idk what to do about messages.

I've mentioned how I know him in college and that he's slowly stopped talking in messages. I was told my someone to give it a few days or when I next see him, speak to him in private to ask about what's going on.

I know for a fact this time I've barely done anything wrong. I haven't forced him to respond, I haven't been nasty.

I want to ask him if I've done something wrong. But this is like what I said earlier.

When It comes to confrontation or starting convos, I just got quiet and just not talk at all.

So what should I do? 

Should I make a note explaining things? Or send another message and call him out of the blue?

What things can I say which don't sound pushy, and tell him I'm there if he needs to speak, but taking into consideration, he may be perfectly fine and not want to talk?

I'll admit, I do have a slight crush on this guy (as he loves my artwork and he's been really bloody nice) but lately, I can't help but feel like I've done something wrong.

the first time it happened was in public , and she forced me to kiss her by holding my head down while we were both laying down . through this i was constantly saying ‚Äòno‚Äô and that i didn‚Äôt want to ,, while trying to get up , but she ignored this ‚Äì i felt scared to bring it up until i had gone home . her response to me telling her what she did was to cry and tell me how much of a terrible person she is ,, with no meaningful apology imo . since we were still together , i ignored all my friends saying what a red flag this was , and told her i was just being silly and i must have wanted it

the second time was during a lonely weekend over the phone , we were having phone sex ,, which halfway through i felt hugely uncomfortable with . i stopped and asked her to stop also ,, which she ignored and continued asking me to do even More things that i was getting more than extremely uncomfortable doing . i ended up having to sit on the phone in silence while she continued , as every time i said no to her or that i didn‚Äôt want this to continue , she ignored me . her response to this was the same as before , and made me feel as if again , it was my fault .

she afterward began telling me to stop seeing one of my best friends , because they didn‚Äôt get along and the ex felt as if this friend was stealing me away . this escalated to the point of ex asking me to ditch said friend on her birthday ,, because i should choose to see her instead . she asked me to choose who i value more out of the two of them , to which i told her that my friends mean more to me than she does . about a month after this i broke up with her

even two months post break up she would follow me round school (since we go to the same college) and constantly message me asking to see me ,, to the point that i blocked her number and on all social media so she used an alt account to contact me . looking back on the relationship , there were a few good months in the middle , but for the last few months especially i felt nervous and afraid of saying anything to stand up for myself

651,"TW// mention of depression and s*icide

When I (20f) was in high school, I was so motivated to do well and pass all of my classes. I had a really good gpa and got into the college of my dreams. I had just gotten out of a toxic relationship and stupidly got into another relationship before going into college which also turned out to be a toxic relationship and I haven‚Äôt been doing well ever since. I‚Äôm completely over it, but ever since then, my depression has come back. I try to focus on my classes and it‚Äôs been tough. I‚Äôm not saying that it still affects me, but I feel like it changed me somehow? It could also be stress from my classes, but I just feel so lost and not motivated to do anything anymore. I‚Äôm not even sure if I want to continue going to college. 

In my freshman year, something bad happened between me and another dorm-mate that brought up memories of trauma and he left the college after the semester ended. In my 2nd year, I went through a really bad bout of depression. I was sad and crying constantly.. wanting to just end it all. I went to see the campus psychologist who told me I would have to seek help outside of campus because I would need more help than they can give me (we are only allowed 8 sessions a semester.) It got really bad in the earlier half of this year (something big in my life happened that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about) and I was literally on the edge of just wanting to end once and for all. I felt like an empty vessel just wandering around. I‚Äôve tried calling hotlines, but they were no help. I tried to check myself into a mental institute, but they weren‚Äôt open even though I called and asked if they were. 

A few months ago, I got a beautiful dog who‚Äôs been a big help in making me happy and just keeping me stable, but I‚Äôm slowly falling back into a depression.

653,"This is a bit of rant, maybe I just needed to vent my feelings about this somewhere akin to writing it out and not sure how to move forward (probably therapy?)... TL;DR at the bottom

I turned 27 recently and I feel like I wasted my social life from 18 until 24... 

Some backstory, I was as introverted as one can be for most of my life. This was mostly due to bullying in high school which made retreat into myself and be safe in my bubble. I went to university at 18 and graduated at 22 and immediately got hired after finishing my degree. I only sort of started coming out of my shell at 25 when I went for therapy because I had low confidence and low self-esteem (because of bullying) thus I never went out in my university career and barely drank (this changed at 25). I've been drunk once at 26 and never been to a night club.

&amp;#x200B;

My university career consisted of me going to classes, sitting in my flat studying / watching movies / playing games. I barely made any friends and now my social life has been mostly empty and since going for therapy (at 25) I've started coming out my shell and now want to go out, drink, party and have fun. But I don't any friends to call up and go drinking. The first two years of working I was still in my shell and didn't make much work friends who go out or would invite me over. I do have friends, but they are also introverted.

&amp;#x200B;

My family was not well of. I made it to university and had to pay for it via loans (almost done though :D). I was the first of my family to go to university and I really didn't want to disappoint my Mom with failing because again finances and not making Mom proud. My Mom also instilled a lot of ""high"" moral values such as don't smoke, don't do drugs, don't drink, eat healthy and those sort of things (I've never smoked cigarettes, never done any drugs, never done weed). I want to try weed, but I'm so scared of the health implications even though there is so much research done on weed and I know I'm stuck up about it. So when I went to varsity I didn't rebel like some people do when they leave the house of their parents. I focused on my studies and that was that. 

&amp;#x200B;

But now, I've come to realize that wasn't the best approach of secluding myself like that and now I'm regretting not having more fun at university, drinking, partying because I was too scared to do it. After going to therapy, I started drinking more, went out a couple of times, but this was with my (ex) partner and her friends because I don't have any friends to do that with. I rely on my (new) partners friends and her going out. 

&amp;#x200B;

And COVID messing up 2020 it has not made me feel better and has actually made me feel worse. I guess this is more of a rant about myself on living so strictly that I feel missed out on the university fun and even though I'm in a better position mentally now and want to do those things and experience them, the fact that I won't be able to experience it when I was younger (like drinking back-to-back on a weekend, for example, I need time to recover after having just a couple of drinks) depresses me because it feels like I'm having a late start to properly living my life and enjoying it. But I can't enjoy it like I would if I was 18 or 19...

&amp;#x200B;

I could say I'm angry at myself. And sad. Even though I have stable job (even during COVID), I'm independent, got my degree, can cook good food, made Mom proud by graduating (she passed away in my second year), got three dogs, renting a house and gonna be buying a new car too, but I'm disappointed with myself and this is dragging me down...

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I feel like I missed out on life by not being more social in my university career and early work career (18 - 24) and now I have regrets on missing out on life because I'm 27 now and don't have any friends to go out with and rely on my partners friends to go out with. And I'm angry at myself for being so long in my shell not wanting to take any risks.",30Nov2020,1
654,"I'm a freshman in college and my school closed their residence halls for the fall semester and went to all-online learning because of COVID. I chose to enroll at a local community college for the semester because they didn't lower tuition for e-learning and I have been planning on moving in with everybody else spring semester, however the guidelines they released have given me second thoughts. They include: 

\- Mandatory quarantine for the first 2 weeks on campus in dorm room (unable to go outside)

\- During 2 week quarantine all dining halls are closed and students are provided meal supplies during the 2 weeks

\- No in-person activities, any club and organization activities will be held over zoom

\- Testing every 2 days or so (something like that)

These new measures are of course unappealing and have made me question whether a 2 week quarantine is worth the rest of the experience on campus.

655,"As the title says, I (23m) met a girl who‚Äôs everything I could as for in a partner. We went on one date and it seems she‚Äôs not into me. I‚Äôll try and be as concise as possible. 

For the past 6 months I‚Äôve been into casual dating and been enjoying meeting &amp; becoming intimate with new women. It was fun and my standards were fairly low, as I just wanted to put myself out there. I met women through dating apps and just enjoyed company while i‚Äôve been taking the last few months to focus on myself. And then I met a girl I‚Äôll call Alice. 

She made me realize I have a type, and it‚Äôs her. By beauty and personality standards. She‚Äôs progressive, unique, and really free with herself. Very ‚Äúhipster‚Äù(i‚Äôd find a more topical word if i could but that‚Äôs about the best i have). We talked for a week before meeting up and I fell harder for her than I have for anyone else before. 

My biggest issue is that though she embodies what I‚Äôm looking for, i seem to be the opposite of her type. Though I have progressive morals and tastes similar to hers, I‚Äôm a lot of things young people like us joke about: I‚Äôm from an affluent suburb, work in finance, play golf, etc. These things we‚Äôve joked about together, and though the jokes themselves don‚Äôt hurt, it really has sucked thinking about the fact that a lot of my interests bore her (and people like her). It worries me that, should things not work out with her (which seems likely), it also seems bleak that anyone else like her would be into someone like me. 

After our date, she said she really liked me but realized she wasn‚Äôt yet ready to emotionally open up to another person, was in a weird place, etc. I trust her, but some part of me feels that she was just being nice and isn‚Äôt into me. I told her I understand and thanked her for letting me know. But I said I couldn‚Äôt be friends with her in the meantime given my feelings for her are already too strong. Gave her my number on snapchat, told her to call me if she ever wants to go on another date, and left it alone. 

It‚Äôs been a week and she‚Äôs all i‚Äôve been able to think about. I‚Äôve since lost interest in seeing anyone else, deleted dating apps and ignored girls I‚Äôd been hanging out with occasionally because they‚Äôre not her. We haven‚Äôt spoken and I‚Äôm not sure we will again.

I‚Äôve accepted that I‚Äôve done all I can and that she will reach out if she‚Äôs ever willing to go on another date. But i‚Äôve been so restless over it. Any advice, books, reassurance on finding peace with this situation? Thanks in advance.",30Nov2020,1

662,"A few weeks ago I posted about whether or not to leave a job (considering this pandemic has stifled job opportunities I've been hesitant to even truly think about taking the jump) but ultimately my mental health is my priority and if that means I leave job without a fallback, so be it.  
I've applied to countless places already. Only a few have clearly rejected me. I have yet to get an interview though.  
My question is: when do I give my notice? My company provides the holiday week off (Dec 21-25) and the last week of the year is pretty quiet usually. I kinda wanna cheat the system and stay on board as an employee until January 1, that way I can get all my doctors appointments squared away while I still have insurance. 2-3 weeks notice seems to be the norm, which would mean waiting another week or two. I'm so mentally checked out that the date I give my notice seems arbitrary. (Earlier this year, I took an unexpected two month leave to focus on my mental health and I gave ONE day's notice.) And during that time, there was no projected date of when I was returning. But my boss was so understanding which is why I don't think he'd care how much notice I gave now, so long as I wrapped up whatever I'm working on and made for a smooth transition for whoever is going to take my place.

It‚Äôs not a massive final so I‚Äôd most likely just get my paper cancelled or that question cancelled (which I didn‚Äôt even answer anyway), but it was the second paper of the maths exam and I think there was just SO much stress building up to these moments that I just blanked out and panicked when I rifled through the pages and realised I didn‚Äôt understand any of it. 
I was *this* close to just letting go and bursting out crying during the paper but I do have respect for the others in the exam room so I tried my best to stay calm, which obviously didn‚Äôt work.


I studied so hard for this exam, over the period of months and so many late nights covering the material. I‚Äôm just honestly gutted that I had a meltdown and shot myself in the foot and because my school is a prestigious private school, it sometimes feels like nothing except maths matters which I know is the opposite in the real world, but it just makes me feel so worthless.

My paper A was fine. I knew how to do it and I think that a combination of the relief from that paper and the sudden panic upon seeing paper B just made me crack.

Please bear in mind that I‚Äôm not trying to make excuses for my poor thinking and actions, I‚Äôve just been crying non stop for the past 6 hours now and it‚Äôs also due to my schools policy of three final exams a day. 

Again, not trying to shift the blame to anyone else. I‚Äôm just at a loss here, if I get a bad overall mark here I‚Äôm moved down to a lower set. Which wouldn‚Äôt represent my actual abilities in maths as usually I‚Äôm an A-A* student in that category.

I only have a few close friends, always had small circles and have always been terrible at making new friends, even now in my thirties.

Lately I've been taking time out of my week to help a couple of friends with their kids that are being home schooled as they work all day, I wanted to help with the stress of it all. Unfortunately this has lead to me having less free time with work and other responsibilities.

As a result the only time I get to actually spend with aforementioned friends is really over video games or the rare occasion that I get to come over and hang out. Problem with this has become that I rarely get invited to the games anymore, when I brought this up I was told that I could just come over and hang out, except when I do I sit on the couch while my friends play games with the same people that are apparently more worthy of time.

670,"I'm not sure what I'm gonna do. I loved this job just as much if not more than I hated waking up at 5am everyday to get there in time. It literally was my reason to live. I made an attempt on my own life shortly before I got this job. It was supposed to be temporary while I worked on getting back into school. But I fell in love with it, and the kids I worked with, and my coworkers. I complained and I moaned but I still loved it. Now I got fired because a parent had it out for me. 

I didn't even do anything that bad. I just played a song that one of the kids requested and it had a bad part in it. Which I did skip over. But apparently that's not good enough. And because I got written up for doing my trainings late this got me fired. After a year of doing what I thought was quality work. 

Now I don't know what to do. I'm sitting at home with my cat, mind is completely blank. Thought about running my car into oncoming traffic on the way home. I'm not going to do that. Or do anything to harm myself or anyone. That's not me anymore but the thoughts are still there. Im just lost. I thought I had figured out my future. But now with this idk if I'll be able to get hired in this field again. Definitely not around here at least. 

I have to move out in a month and now I have no income. How am I supposed to get an apartment without a job. How am I supposed to find a job during a pandemic, with so many people out of work? How do I keep myself from descending into a depressive episode? I'm already most of the way there. I can't eat and all I want to do is lay in bed and hide from the world. I'm spiraling here. I know what's gonna happen. I'm gonna buy a bunch a weed in about a week when I can't deal with reality anymore. Then I'm gonna start smoking again after I've been good for a few months. Then I'm gonna spend the rest of the month high and find myself without a place to live. Then I'll start doing hard drugs. It happens every time. Something bad happens, I spiral until I can't deal with it anymore, then I turn to drugs and destroy every aspect of my life, then I have someone else put me back together and I say I'm gonna start over and do it well this time. I'm so sick of this pattern. 

To be fair to me, 1 year of relative sobriety (minus a few drinks and joints with coworkers) and a stable job while paying my own way through life and going to college is the best I've ever done before. I didn't give it 100% but it's the closest I've ever been to it. When things got hard, yeah sometimes I gave up, but other times I pushed through. So I don't think I'm that same person anymore. But genuinely I have no idea what to do. I'm just completely lost. Where on earth do I go from here?",30Nov2020,1
671,"I have a male friend who is 18 years old, who has abused multiple drugs on and off since he was 10. He started with alcohol and weed and moved up from there, and this past weekend he was using Xanax, amphetamine, and MDMA. He has used meth in the past. He messaged me to tell me he ‚Äúthinks‚Äù he almost overdosed last night, and that it ‚Äúmight‚Äù be time to take a break. 2 weeks ago, he binged hallucinogens for a week, and by that I mean he ate an oz of shrooms and 20 tabs of LSD. He seems to only communicate with me and 2 others (his current friends) as he has shut out everyone else. He lives with his mother and younger brother, but his mother gave up on helping him, and his brother is also a weed user.

672,"So to cut the backstory short, my parents and I don't get along well. They want me to move out and say that I have until July of next year to move out. Sucks because I graduate community college next semester but don't start at my 4 year until like August meaning that if I am being forced out I won't be able to get financial aid to stay on campus (to my knowledge). This also means that I will have to work full time for rent because (to my knowledge) I will not be able to take out student loans under those circumstances. 

My question is about filling in the blanks in my knowledge on all of this. Will I be able to take out any type of student loans to pay for rent if I move into an off-campus apartment a month or two before the semester starts? If not, will I be able to take out a student loan for my rent expenses after that semester? 

I don't wanna have to go full time at work because during the school year I am already stressed enough keeping my GPA up. I will be receiving the community college scholarship after my next semester and finishing my associate's as well as  (I think) a small Phi Theta Kappa scholarship just for being accepted into the PTK program so I'm not too worried about the debt accumulation. I simply just want to know what my options are just because all of this will be new to be and I don't want to sacrifice my GPA and future job prospects just because me and my parents don't get along.",30Nov2020,1
673,"My older brother has had a very hard life up until this point. When I was almost 8 and he was 15 my mom died, which really put a huge dent in our family. A couple years later, my dad married my stepmom, which is when the real trouble started.

My brother (22m) lives a couple hours away from me and my family. I (15f) have been talking to him lately and giving him emotional support as he suffers from depression and ADHD. The problem is, my brother has wayyyy too much trust for my dad, who soon became a narcissist when he married my stepmom. My older brother is constantly begging my parents to talk to him and help him with his career (my brother both flunked out of college and lost his license because of his then undiagnosed ADHD), but they refuse to talk to him for whatever reason.

I am trying as hard as I can to emotionally support my brother, but i cant do much, especially since I'm only 15 (i will be 16 in 17 days). My brother is constantly asking me to ask my dad to talk to him, and I've tried but they just get angry at me for trying to help him. They say that he is ""manipulating"" me by ""making"" me do these things for him, when I'm doing it out of my own free will.

I am very worried for my brother. He refuses to believe that he can't trust my parents, and he doesn't think that anyone else can help him. I've tried my best to help him out, but it's just too stressful for me.

678,"My old best friend and i have a long history. We used to date and even after we broke up we continued seeing each other. I got into a relationship 3 years ago and he showed me that this friendship wasn‚Äôt the best and that it made him uncomfortable if i stayed in it so i let my old best friend go. That relationship has long since been over but I feel like he was right, it was an odd friendship to be in. 

Since then my old best friend has been on a downward spiral because i was his only friend and i feel like he had an unhealthy attachment to me. He hasn‚Äôt tried to make any new friends and is very awkward socially now. I introduced him to another friend of mine in an attempt to get him some more friends and he cried in front of us because he was so lonely. 

I feel horrible, but I‚Äôm pretty uncomfortable with the thought of spending time alone with him due to our past.

His 5th birthday is next March and I was there when my fianc√© found out he was gonna be a dad. With that in mind this child is my kid as well. I‚Äôve been around since before he was born and with that I‚Äôm his unofficial stepmom. Mostly cause weddings are hard to plan. My future sister in law disregards everything I say when it comes to our child and does whatever she wants is overall extremely disrespectful. Over the weekend I challenged her and now she‚Äôs out to make me the bad guy for standing up for myself. This entire family has a habit of just going along with whatever she deems to be what‚Äôs going to happen. And my future father in law backed me up on the fact that I am the parent when my fianc√© is gone and now she‚Äôs pissed. She‚Äôs a classic manipulator and borderline narcissist. Is there a way to make this right without backing down on my stance that I am his parent as well and you have to respect me and what I say?

696,"This story could be very triggering for some. This is not easy for me to talk about and there are not many people that I can discuss this with. So here goes. 

Over the last couple years a family member of mine has had a lot of issues legally. It really all started several years ago when he kicked his 5 year old son so hard that he broke his femur (the thigh bone?) for touching the Christmas tree. 

To give some background, this man that I am talking about has never, at any point, had a stable life since childhood. Once he became an adult, he had 2 kids with  the same woman. This woman is a drug addict and this man was ""more capable"" and caring for the children. The man's parents have been envovled and other family members have tried help care of these kids. 

Back to this Christmas incident. He was convicted with child abuse and the children were put under than guardianship of the man's parents. He was placed on house arrest and then after that was to be completed he was to be on probation. After serving time and following all the rules and doing all the court required classes and payments, they integrated the kids back into his home. He is now serving his probation sentence and is about home free with the whole thing.

Since the Christmas incident, I have had really strong angry feelings toward this person, especially considering I had spent a good portion of my life with this person. This incident with his kid reminded me of all the emotional and physical abuse that I had received and witnessed from this person before he had kids.

Recently this man has been accused of statutory rape when his current girlfriend walked in on him ""finger banging"" a 16 year old. At this point, this man is 30 years old. And then come to find out from his parents there may be 3 other victims that they will be investigating. This also worries me for his children which are now little girl 8 &amp; little boy 9. This is an ongoing investation and has been delayed due to Covid but I do not imagine he will have custody of his children much longer.  

During this whole process, this man has acted like he doesn't understand what he doing wrong and everyone is out to get him but he is doing his best. It's almost as if he is living in some alternative reality and his current girlfriend his not much better. She walked in on this event and has said that maybe it wasn't him or his fault. 

I cannot perosnally do anything to help these children at the moment so unfortunately the only option I feel I have is to disown him and disassociate from him completely. I would love this go off on him or worse but I do not feel that will accomplish anything. 

His parents had a small Thanksgiving gathering. They did not invite the man because they understand that people are very unhappy with him. During dinner the mom started discussing Christmas plans. She stated that the man would be invited for the kids and because he is still their kid and they still love him... They believe everyone should still love him because he is still family despite his mistake. 

I completely disagree with this. This man should not be allowed to interact with anyone or feel loved. That's my opinion and I know there are ways to involve the kids without involving him. I told his parents I would not be attending Christmas for this reason. These are my parents as well. 

Emotionally this has been wearing on me. I don't feel that I am overreacting at all. I do not want to be a part of a family that accept people in this manner. How do people cope with these type of situations?",30Nov2020,1
697,"TW: DEATH

A couple years ago, my close friend sent me a snap streak, it was a picture of her as a toddler with her mom. I cant remember the caption but it was clear that her mom had been deceased for awhile. Last year, I found out that her mom passed 2 years before the snap, which was way more recent than I thought. 

I did my best not to bring up mom related topics in fear of triggering her. We talked about family but nothing focused on parents. She is someone who feels very strongly but doesn't like to talk about upsetting things. I've mentioned my mom a few times by accident and she reacted normally. Once I even cried when telling her about an arguement with my mom. It was a pretty meaningless arguement and I felt so bad to be complaining about my mom when she couldn't even talk to hers. 

Recently, she would briefly mention her mom when we talked. Things like ""My mom loved pumpkin pies"" or ""My mom was really good at XXX but no one inherited her skills haha"". She never did that before.

On one hand, I'm worried that I may have triggered her grief which is causing her to talk about her family more. On the other hand, maybe she always wanted to talk about it but was unsure of bringing up such a subject.

Anyone knows someone or been through something similar and can share some advice on what I can do? Should I completely avoid the subject or should I try to get her to open up? Losing a parent at such a young age is horrible and I want to be there for her and support her",30Nov2020,1

I always blame that I was born like this, then I think of people who say that we make our own destiny, then I get motivated for a while, make no progress, then the feeling comes all over again. From my childhood I wasn't able to make good relationships with people. I had some friends but all of them are now gone out of my life.

I also wonder..if my life is also a joke...there are people in abusive relationships, dysfunctional households, with cheating partners, people being screwed over by the system, being a powerless cuck and suffering through their entire life..I feel like one day I maybe one of them, living in the fear of those things, I don't take any risky steps, always in the comfort of my room.. sometimes I feel if there is a curse put on me, making me suffer..yes I say suffer..even if I am in a better place than some people..I can sing fairly decent, I even participated in the music night in college, fucked up in stage, nobody clapped, felt embarrassed as shit..now nobody thinks I can sing, even though I like to..have no good experiences to brag about..not much good looking or having humour to impress anyone..people think I am serious, nah bro I am just humourless and empty...All of this really makes me think if I want to continue living or not. There. I said it. Have tears in my eyes. Gonna post it on two more subreddits..Any advice will be helpful, or if not, atleast I shared my feelings on a platform with strangers whom I probably won't meet ever. Goodbye...",30Nov2020,1

708," 

My friend literally has the worst time management skills and is always stressed because of it, which leads her to complain about being stressed.  Almost every morning when I see her at school, she either does homework or talks about how she doesn‚Äôt want to do homework or is failing a class.  I take some of the same classes as her(English 4, stats, religion), and if you study and do the homework, it‚Äôs easy.  She‚Äôs always cracking jokes about how she didn‚Äôt study for a test or didn‚Äôt read for English, which I‚Äôm tired of and I don't find them funny bc her grades are already shit and they don't need any more damage.   When she comes in in the morning and talks about how she didn‚Äôt do her homework, I ask what she was doing instead of her homework.  And she almost always says she was lying in bed on her phone.  She makes herself stressed because she doesn‚Äôt know how to get her shit together, and I always tell her to spend less time on her phone and do homework for 30 minutes and take a break. 

We were off for a whole week for Thanksgiving break, and she somehow didn‚Äôt manage to do any of her homework, and she almost started crying this morning, and I didn't even feel sorry for her, it's her fault and she needs to get it together.  My other friend told me that my stressed friend sent her 40 TikToks yesterday(thank god I'm not on Tiktok, she would definitely annoy the fuck out of me there too).  A month ago, I dared her to give TikTok up for a week, and she actually did.  I thought this would help her to do her school work.  Nope, she just substituted her time spent on Tiktok with Instagram/Youtube.  She babysits after school, and she is always telling me how she lets the kids watch tv while she is on her phone.  I told her to do her homework during that time, but she flat out told me no because she doesn‚Äôt want to. 

She is constantly complaining, and I‚Äôm tired of her bs.  Any tips on making her be more productive, or has anyone gone through the same experience as my friend or me?",30Nov2020,1
709,"Hello. I'm African, male, 20 years old. My mom has 4 kids including me. I remember seeing my dad beat up my mom so badly that there would be blood everywhere, i was really young then, about 9 years old.  My dad married another woman 10 years ago and she has lived with us since then. my mom hears them(my dad and step mom) having sex sometimes in his bedroom, she has told me this several times while she cried. My step mom has given birth to 4 kids also and we all live together. he barely hits my mom now because she has stopped insulting him back when he insults her first at every little mistake she makes but even when she doesn't insult him back, he threatens to beat her. he hit her and my step mom last year, he slapped my mom while he used a cain to flog my step mom because of a little mistake they made. He provides for the family, pays for feeding, clothing, education, everything. I'm currently in college and that's because of him but he still treats everyone so badly. He insults my mom so badly he says things like useless woman, bastard, prostitute, ""God punish you and your mother(my grandmother), smelling gutter, harlot, ""i regret getting married to you""e.t.c. and she can't do anything about it, she just keeps quiet. he has been insulting us(his children) since we were little, He says things like bastard(to his own child), useless child, prostitute(to my sister since she was 11), he has stripped my sister naked when she was 13 and flogged her so much with a belt because someone tried to rape her and he thought the rape happened but it didn't(it makes no sense, i know but it's true), he said my brother is useless and he is not sure my brother will make it in life, he has also said he isn't sure he is the father of me and my brother, He has started saying that to us since we were really young, about 11 years old and he started saying this to my little step brother, he is also 11 years. He hits us too. Luckily, the last time he tried to hit my 23 year old sister, i and 21 year old brother were there to hold him. He has beat me and my brother with kicks and punches several times. He is strong. the last time he punched my brother several times to the face and his face was swollen while i tried to hold him but i couldn't. we had to run away from home but we came back because we didn't want a broken family and junior sister is still young(10 years). I and my siblings have never ever done anything wrong to him, we respect him so much. We Do whatever he says, we are usually at in the house if we are not at work/school or else he will get mad and hit someone, we don't allow friends come over and even they do, we don't let them stay long so my dad does not see them and start to hit us. My mom has very few friend and has 0 social life. She just stays at home because my dad doesn't want her to have friends and he doesn't let her go out. My college is far from home and i refused to go back home since the lockdown because i hate watching him treat people so badly and i can't do anything about it. I had to become a virtual assitant early this yeat and i have been taking care of myself although he still sends me money. We all spend Christmas together and now they are telling me to come back home and i don't know what to do because i can't stand him treating my family so baldly anymore and if i take any actions, i might break the family.

My mum hasn‚Äôt seen our dog for months, and I could tell that when she left he was depressed. It was around the same time that I left the house to go university, so my mum and I weren‚Äôt around him like usual, I think he was missing us and confused as to where we had gone. I drop by to see him every week, and he‚Äôs seemed to have bounced back in the past few weeks. 

I‚Äôve been talking with my mum recently about bringing him round to see her, and so here is my question: Do you think it is immoral to bring him to visit after he‚Äôs finally settling down? Is it cruel to remind him of her, just for her to leave again? Or would it make him happy to be reunited? I know that he would be ecstatic to see her, but afterwards I‚Äôm worried that he will miss her and get depressed.

716,"I have been renting a condo since July and the unit next to me was empty until someone moved in at the beginning of October. She would sometimes play loud music (lots of bass) for a few hours at a time, a few days a week, but it was always during ""normal"" hours (nothing after 10 pm). I figured that's just part of apartment living and let it be. 

This past weekend, the music got worse. Louder, and almost all day yesterday. Again, it ended before 10, so it didn't violate any noise laws. I also have been noticing more people going in and out of her place (I am assuming guests for the Holiday?) and the hallway has been smelling skunky (like weed- we do get skunks in the area but the smell was only present in the hallway). 

I'm more bothered by the noise. It has been causing me a lot of anxiety and I don't feel like I should have to put up with it- even if it's not disturbing my sleep. 

I left a polite note on her door today, just saying that the walls are thin and that the loud bass has become a disturbance. 

Is that too passive aggressive? I was trying to muster up the courage to knock on her door when the music was at its worst last night, but my anxiety got the best of me and I had a breakdown. I keep imagining the worst and that the neighbor will react poorly and the music will just get worse and more frequent. 

What else can I do, if the note doesn't make a difference? The bylaws of the condo association say that we have to contact the police for noise complaints first, which I really do not want to have to do.",30Nov2020,1
717,"Me (23F) and my boy friend (24M) have been together for 2 years and a month now. We were planning to get married right after we both got our bachelors. 

We both study at the same field at the same univeristy. Our university is one of the top 3 universities in our country in software engineering.
I work at a good company and he was applying to a great company (for an hr position) at the time of our fight. What I mean to say is we're both at good places professionally.

We have a good relationship for the most part. We really love each other, and when we're good we are REALLY good. But we have our bad times like any other couple. He's usually very kind and caring, and supportive.

So the day of the fight we were at my mom's place and hanging out, and he was talking about a friend of his who applied to the afformentioned great company and was rejected, and now is coming to my company (I reffered him). Somehow we got to a place where he said ""none of us (me, him and his friend) can apply to the great company for a tech position"". I was really taken aback. I always thought he saw me as samrt and talented.

I have been always insecure about my intelligence as my brother was always praised for his intelligence and no one really saw me untill after I was accepted to my university. 

I was really upset and didn't really talk to him for the rest of the evening. At some point my mom was tired of the awkwardness and encouraged us to talk to each other. We ended up in a screaming match and he apologized to my mom and stormed out.

Now usually after a fight he would stop talking to me, and I would get tired or feel guilty about my part in the fight and text him after 2 or 3 days, but this time I didn't initiate contact and now it has been 10 days since we fought.

We really love each other and have a good relationship for the most part, but is this behaviour (stonewalling and not communicating during fights) something I should break up our relationship over? Or has he alreade broken up with me? I'm kind of heart broken and confused and could use some help.",30Nov2020,1
718,"I am very sorry for the length...!  


I am 16 y/o Male. My mother is a divorced single woman and it has been this ways since i was 4. I do not remember anything about my dad except for his face. My grandfather(maternal) was someone who filled this void for me. He was the closest thing I had to a father.  
He pampered me, did everything I wanted, although I did ask for a lot (I was very childish and selfish) taught me lessons, studied with me. He spent more time with me since i was born than with my grandmother (his wife). My mom used to come back from work at around 8 or so. Till then and even after that he would stay with me. He was the one who put me to sleep, and when my mother wasn't home he would prepare extravagant dishes, although he couldn't eat them himself(Health issues). My mother is in no way not caring for me  or anything as such. She is an amazing person as well. I grew around such amazing people.  
My grandfather was an amazing individual with NO character defects as far as i could see. He was caring, compassionate and extremely patient. I am not able to remember one single bad thing he did. If I was half the man my grandfather was, I would pretty much excel in most fields. He was good at whatever he did and even worked as a consultant at his age of (68 then) as a consultant for a pretty large company. In his prime he was at a very high position at a renowned company and was respected everywhere he went. Yet he was humble. Although my mother took care of me very well, I always loved my grandfather much more than her. But, when he died right in my arms(literally) from a heart attack coupled with some problem with the lungs...I did not shed even a single tear.   


He was a very good father to my mother as well. Every time we talk about him even now( He passed away 2 years back) she starts crying. But I, never did. I am seriously NOT bragging about this. I just want to know whether I have some problem. I grieved and felt sad when he died...I guess. I do not know the feelings of grief or sadness to that extent since this is the first death of someone so close to me. I am very confused, although it has been 2 years, it has been nagging me at the back of my mind.   


People including my mother asked me why I didn't cry. I have two cousins, who are children of my mother's siblings..both of them are younger than me. Both of them did cry, although my grandfather related more closely with me than them( This is not an assumption, it is true and everyone in my family including my cousins know it and have commented on the same.). I do not know whether my cousins loved him more or less.This is not a comparison. Rather, did I did not love him enough to even shed a single tear after he left me? My life proceeded as it would normally do so. I made friends, even close ones, and enjoyed these two years. Why am I the only one who didn't cry? What is wrong with me?

To clarify I started dating at 18 because it was the first time in my life I felt kind of comfortable with the way i looked but I'm still very insecure at times. So I actually lost my virginity to her...

But the thing is she has already had sex with 12 other people and I've seen pictures of two of them and they look like f\*cking models... Very lean muscular physique, handsome face etc. and then I start doubting myself again. I have always been unsatisfied with my weight I am 185 cm tall and at my heaviest I used to weigh 90kg (all fat no muscles what so ever) but I started dieting and working out and now I am 73kg. But I look by no means as attractive as the other guys. I also struggle with bad skin and I would rate me just about average looking...

She is the first person I fell in love with and no one has ever been closer to me on an emotional and physical level. She has also told me that I am the first person she is geniuently in love with. I can understand that people have certain urges but I also had at least one opurtunity to have sex but I declined because I can't imagine being physical with someone I feel nothing for.

**next part is a bit graphic**

Eventhough she told me after the last time we had sex that she never came so often in her life it was probably 4 or 5 times in one hour. Which I asume means that I am the best she's ever had. At first that gave me alot of confidence back but now I am starting to struggle again.

It literally physically pains me in my chest and I could almost start to cry when I think about it. I've tried accepting it and it worked for a while but now the feeling is coming back again. Maybe it's my perspective on physical contact and that I feel very vunerable even when I just take my shirt off... So I can't really understand it just makes me feel very insecure and uncomfortable.

It feels so selfish that my family wants to me to live so that they wont be sad when all I want to do is retire from this world. IT ISN'T FOR ME! Yet it's selfish to ruin my brother's life because if I died, it would tear him apart. Maybe I'm lazy, maybe I'm entitled, but why struggle so hard for nothing? I don't understand it. My circuitry just tells me it isn't worth it, to give up and let the elements take me, to starve, drown, splat against the ground, to hang myself. I dont know it is just what life wants for me: To be dead.  


I live in Canada where terminal illnesses are a viable reason for doctor assisted suicide. Why cant I do it? I've felt this way for so long that I know its what I want, not just because I'm depressed. I'm depressed because I dont want to live and I have to so that I don't hurt others. I'm terminally depressed. I can't get out of it. I've been to hospitals multiple times, counselling, therapy, I've tried to stop smoking weed. Nothing helps. I've gone on 80km bike-rides, I'm fit and active. I'm healthy and intelligent. I don't know whats wrong with me. I'm going to drop out of college, get kicked out of my grandparents, waste 4 years of their food, money, time and love all because I just tried to live so that I don't hurt others. I don't know where to go from here.

There is no place for me in this world anymore.

but my mom makes me feel horrible to be around. just seeing her and talking to her gives me bad anxiety. i always become anxious and sad around her. 

she is very irritable, she becomes very angry quickly and she just begins yelling and saying mean things, sometimes kicking and throwing things.  she has moments like these often. she is very stern towards me, and i try to avoid her. being around her makes me want to cry.

then after a fit she will be semi nice and normal, say shes sorry and she was just in a bad mood. then i have a hard time being mad or sad at her.

ive tried ro bring it ip to her, saying sometimes she is being not okay. but then she blows up and claims that others have it worst and that since she doesn‚Äôt hit me i cant complain.

it is so hard to live with her but it makes me feel guiltily since sometimes she normal, and she puts a roof over my head, and nice things but it doesn‚Äôt make up for how she makes me feel.

i will do anything to not be at home, i try to stay at others houses or get detentions on purpose. but even being far away from her, i cant escape the anxiety of knowing i have to come back.

738,"Dear Reddit,

I (18F) hope this post will bring you some attention. I am writing this to raise concerns I have found that my partner (19M) has been facing for years, so I really need an advice or an assistance. 
My partner, who has been living with his mother Emma Jane Campbell (40F) and his sister(s) [13F and 17F], has been treated completely unfair by his mother. I do not think she is fit to take care of any of her children or herself at all. Here is a few reasons why I think that way. 

Firstly, she had kicked out both of her daughters some reason - the 17-years-old girl ‚ÄòJ‚Äô is now finally allowed to be back home - from what I gathered it is because neither of them liked her new partner (28M). 

Secondly, she has also threatened to kick her oldest son (my partner) out, I believe it could be next week. My partner has this benefit called Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which I believe now it is being replaced by Personal Independence Payment (PIP), due to his disability where he has meant to get money every month to be able to support himself - this is a big issue. 

Thirdly, my partner just informed me hours ago that she has threatened to get people to beat me up for asking her to pay me ¬£242.00 back. This woman has no job and I believe that she is depending on benefits she receives. I had asked her nicely to pay me back yet she kept procrastinating. 

Fourthly, a few hours ago, she used her own number to phone me pretending it was ‚ÄòJ‚Äôs phone number‚Äô and got ‚ÄòJ‚Äô to speak to me asking for ¬£20.00 as the internet was down for nearly a week and it needed to be paid (which was accurate) and promise to pay me back when she got paid from babysitting. Frankly, a few minutes later she messaged me saying it‚Äôs ‚ÄòJ‚Äô and asking for ¬£70.00 which I ignored it until she called again. I have spoken to ‚ÄòJ‚Äô and my partner about it and it is sorted for now. 

Lastly, as I have mentioned above regarding the benefit, my partner has been meant to get money from his mother (as he has never got a bank due to neither of his parents getting it done for him) yet he has received nothing from her. We believe she has used it all without giving him a penny.

This has become a huge problem as my partner has college to attend every week and I have become like his guardian as his mother is unfit to take her responsibilities to take care of any of her children. 

Does anyone know what we can do to request any assistance at all, please? This would be a massive help if we could get someone to help us with sorting his benefit out as we believe that his mother will never let this go as she has got a hold of his disability money. 

I messaged D Council through Facebook asking if we could request any assistance but they told me to email D Children‚Äôs Services Trust - which I just did it about three hours ago. 

Thank you so much for hearing us out.",30Nov2020,1

740,"My daughter(18) leased a puppy, and to make matters worse I found out it‚Äôs a puppy mill dog

My daughter has been begging us for a puppy for ages and we finally told her she can have one. We told her to let us take her to a shelter when we had the time, and she agreed.

I came over last week to a small cockapoo puppy running around in my living room. I must admit she was adorable and I fell in love with her. I was completely okay with my daughter owning her and I was quite impressed that she was able to get a puppy by herself without the help of us, it showed independence and I was happy...that is, until I opened the folder the puppy came with. 

Inside the folder was all the information about the puppy and instructions on how to feed her, and then I came across a contract. My daughter had agreed to pay $4,200 in payments of $158 every month....for this puppy. To make matters worse, they had to run her credit ofcourse and it‚Äôs 22% APR!!! She put $400 down when buying her but the total price that she still would be paying is $6000 and then some. As if things couldn‚Äôt get any worse, I looked at the breeders name which read ‚ÄúJ. Jackson from Kansas‚Äù. I looked him up and if the person I read about is in fact the right person, his puppies are kept in poor conditions and get sick and die soon after moving into their new homes, not all of them but a great amount. 

My daughter had no idea what she was getting herself into, and I just cannot for the life of me understand why she thought LEASING a puppy would be a good idea. I believe the place she got her from takes the puppies back and give full refund if it‚Äôs within 14 days of purchase, and it‚Äôs been 10 days already. I told her she should return the puppy so she doesn‚Äôt risk messing up her credit and she‚Äôs extremely attached and insists that she can handle it. The dog is also sick now, with a cough, sneezing, extremely congested, watery eyes, runny nose and the puppy shop is telling us it‚Äôs normal for new pups to get sick when they first come home. 

This whole situation is ridiculous and I‚Äôm quite lost on what to do. I can‚Äôt force her to bring this puppy back because it‚Äôs her own money and I try to give my kids independence but what the fuck.... How should I go about handling this?",30Nov2020,1

745,"I'm 21 and about to graduate college this May. As expected, I'm overwhelmed with life after graduation, like finding work, internships, housing, grad school, etc. In addition, I've been struggling with my mental health again, which is making it more difficult to focus on my future and academics.

I've gained about 20lbs throughout college and I'm becoming very ashamed of my body. I know I'm not overweight, but I'm definitely not happy with what I look like anymore and it's caused me to avoid sex/ relationships and distance myself from my friends and family.

Additionally, I've been losing interest in my hobbies and struggling with my substance use. I find myself taking shots by myself every night, because being alone is becoming so painful and uncomfortable.

My frustration is that a couple years ago I was getting so much better. Even though I was struggling with my ptsd and mental illnesses, I was confident in who I was and I didn't let my past define me. I worked out consistently and was proud of my body/sexuality. I also enjoyed learning, did all my assignments on time, sought out new opportunities to advance, practiced guitar daily, wrote, etc. 

I don't even know how I got to that mindset but I was so comfortable in my own skin and grateful to be alive.

Now I'm constantly comparing myself to how I used to be. I always find myself feeling frustrated and disgusted with who I am, asking myself what's wrong with me? How did I let it get this far? I just can't seem to pull myself out of this rut. Every time I try to be more consistent with my hobbies, weight loss or substance use, I either fall off the band wagon or make excuses for my behavior. I used to do things for future me, but now it's like I don't care anymore?

Honestly, any advice would be appreciated. I really do want to change and just be comfortable with myself again.",30Nov2020,1

748,"This happened a few years ago at university but has been in the back of my mind.

Myself (M) and them (F) were friends but fell out after I placed my hand on her leg: the thing is (the action is objectively terrible) I don't remember this happening at all.

For the background, we had gotten to know each other on our courses, both being slightly awkward but sharing some interests so naturally we hung out a lot. We were both suffering from heavy mental health problems at the time so found a solace together. We sort of attached ourselves to a friend group peripherally but most of the time we just did our coursework or watched a movie in my room.

During a houseparty I'd declined to go to (loud noises make me throw up), my friend had a friend (M) in the periphery group place a hand on her leg. I wasn't there but there were accusations of 'sexual assault' thrown around so I felt quite passionately about helping her, knowing both her and myself were victims of abuse in the past.

The 'abuser' was ostracised from our group but we were still living together the next year (uni contracts are annoying like that) which made it awkward.

Here's where my part comes in: I was furious at the former friend for what he did, and everyone else in the group knew it so there was always some tension. 

A few weeks later (about 1am if I remember) I had asked my friend over as she'd been having panic attacks, or an episode of sorts. I had being having one too and I don't think either of us wanted to be alone. We had sat on the bed together when she left suddenly. I would later find out that she had accused me of the same sexual assault to another friend (F) in the periphery group that the ostracised friend had committed.

I genuinely don't remember me doing anything like that, but with all the pressure from the friend group I stupidly admitted to the action and that was that. Constant burning glares from everyone and back to isolation.

Without remembering what exactly happened, how can I be sure that I didn't do what I was accused of? I would usually calm my friend down by stroking her arm with the back of my index and middle fingers, I think it's entirely possible I stroked her leg that night and didn't realise my mistake but I'll never know for sure. I feel disgusted by the possibility, having betrayed that trust, even if it was accidently.

Is it wrong for hating someone in the group so viciously for doing something he may also have been falsely accused of? Granted the two scenarios are somewhat different, one was at a party with people around and one was in my room in a place my friend thought safe, but effects are still the same.

She trusted me but the trust got broken. I'm just not sure whether I did what she said I did. The whole 'context matters/doesn't matter' debate hasn't ever been decided, but the bottom line is my friend became terrified of me since then, visibly shaking if I was around.

I tried a few times to ask (and I really shouldn't have admitted to anything if I wasn't sure) about that night but I always stopped myself. I'd be asking for my benefit not hers. Whether I was guilty or not she was still frightened by me and it left me heartbroken for many years.

This was the same friend who trusted me to watch over her as she slept on top of my bed during the day as she was too scared at night. We talked until 3am some nights, trying to keep ourselves from being taken by night terrors.

I just don't know how to feel about the whole situation. A lot of friends assumed I was in love with her and wanted her sexually, which is a fair assumption. We did spend lots of time together and at university you can easily put two and two together. I did wonder about asking her out at one stage, before I came out to myself as asexual (a whole different story) and the love I had for her was platonic. I know you can barely get away with having a platonic love for an opposite gender friend in these times with cries of 'yeah sure', but it's what I felt in my heart. 

I'd never think of reaching out now, it was long ago and she blocked me on social media, which I can completely understand. However I think she's doing well now and I've got a fulfilling life of my own. If I were to try and make contact I feel like I'd just be dredging the past for my 'closure'.

That's really all I made this post about was closure. Am I wrong for still wanting it? Or is it better to simply move on and live my life and let her live hers? We were both young and dumb and maybe even bad for each other considering our similar histories but I know we've both got better lives now which I'm grateful for.

Should I have tried harder to clear my name, even if I'm not sure I am innocent?

I know this sounds stupid and complicated (it was a no win situation from the get-go and I fucked up at basically every turn) so I'd like to have some advice about the situation.

Thanks everyone.",30Nov2020,1

751,"Hi,

So I live with three people: my mid 50s cousin S, her mid 50s boyfriend D, and my other cousin M who is my age, 25. M and I moved in because S's kids were moving out of the house rental and it was convenient for us to stay with with them (rent is 600/month for each of us where normally for your own room you have to pay 800+ here.) We are all on the lease and pay equally.


I'm trying to determine how best to resolve my conflicts with them today since they want to discuss their conflicts with me today.


The issue I'm having is that S and D just got back from their thanksgiving and I guess there were some rice grains on the stove top, I had left one or two items out that normally go in the pantry, and there were a few unwashed utensils, but I had done all my other dishes. S sent me a long text about how I need to clean up better. This is a very parent like response, rather than an equal roommate response. However, I am fine with trying to be more mindful about cleaning up after myself. The other issue they brought up (that is fair and Im fine resolving as long as we go on a schedule) is that I dont do household cleaning very much. This is because S cleans constantly and nothing is ever dirty, so I just go about my day and clean up after myself.


The reason I am so frustrated with the kitchen complaint is because they don't hold themselves to the same standards (if they make dishes sometimes they sit for a week. They clean everything else I admit). In addition, they both moved into this house rental from houses they owned (S lost her house, D got divorced but didn't actually move out until he moved in with S at this home) so they have an excessive amount of stuff. There are two sheds in the back yard filled floor to ceiling, the garage is filled floor to ceiling, we can't use the driveway because D has two project cars there that he is not actually working on, and in the house the dining table is always covered in their stuff, every surface has their stuff on it, but if I leave my shoes (one pair) by the from door they will move it into my room. There are also piled boxes of things S and D are trying to sell (barbies, star trek stuff, etc) in the living room 24/7. There is also no designated kitchen space or household cupboard space. I only have my room and what I can squeeze into the fridge. They also rent a storage unit for more of their stuff. So they obviously view this as their house that me and M happen to be staying it. M reacted by only being home like once a week, and im mostly just dealing with it because I am planning on moving out when the lease is up in March which is coming right up.


Also I realize it sounds weird to say they clean constantly but the house is a disaster. What I mean is that they will bleach the counters like every two days and clean the bathroom all the time, etc. Clutter is a separate issue.


After they sent me that text over the weekend (I stay with my boyfriend on the weekend and only go home during the week because I have to. Though this weekend I was home since they were gone and I cooked.) I agreed to discuss the chores issue with them today. Im not sure how best to make them realize that since its a rental and we all pay equally we are supposed to share the space equally. Or do you think they are too set in their ways and I should just suck it up until I can move?",30Nov2020,1

756,"A girl from my high school made up lies about me to a colleague of mine and I just need to rant, because this whole situation is driving me crazy.

She was a bit of a wallflower in high school and I was a theatre kid so neither of us really ran with the 'popular' crowd, but I definitely got attention from performances and awards received through my extracurriculars/hobby and was friendly with the 'popular' people. I was a bit of a prude and goody-too-shoes in high school because I had a severe fear of getting in trouble and letting my parents down. Basically, I played by the rules and never tried to cause any problems.

Recently, I found out that this girl from high school (who I hadn't thought about in years) told a colleague of mine that I was the BIGGEST bully. Now, as I mentioned earlier, I genuinely never tried to ruffle any feathers so this was a complete punch in the gut and a shock. I experienced bullying/teasing in highschool for my hobbies, so this just didn't sit well.

Essentially, this girl was made up lies in order to get me fired from my job so instead, she could take my job. Thankfully, her attempt did not work but the colleague of mine said, ""When she told me all of this crazy stuff you did in high school, I couldn't believe it but I know people can change."" I asked what she said I did and the colleague said, ""We didn't have to go on about it."" Then finally, they said that she mentioned a prank call and tons of other stuff, but wouldn't go into detail on the 'other stuff.' Again, I said that I don't recall a prank call or any other bullying that they insinuated, but they just said it's neither here nor there.

I said to my colleague, ""I don't know what this person is referring to and I can assure you I was not a highschool bully. I've tried to be genuine and show you nothing but kindness throughout our professional relationship, so I hope their words do not affect your opinion of me and that we can continue working together professionally."" They said, ""No, it's fine. I was so shocked! You've always been so nice and professional, but it doesn't even matter - it was highschool.""

I'm having a hard time letting this slander go. Of course, I told my friends and family and they were just as confused as I was, but I just don't like that things were said about me that weren't true and ESPECIALLY that they've infiltrated my professional life. I also don't like that my colleague dismissed this situation as like, ""I believe what this person said, but it doesn't matter.""

I'm on a zero hour contract and have never really been given any kind of written contract or even told about anything that should have been on my contract. The place is a busy yet small independent cafe with a small handful of staff (it is understaffed and they refuse to employ more people) and I only get an hour or two of notification on the day that they want me to work, which is starting to make me struggle mentally as I'm unable to plan my days or relax the night before because I never know if they're going to ask me to come in.

I'd rather quit my job and deal with the consequences of it after than live a life of misery and I'm lucky to still live with my parents (I'm 18), and whilst I pay for rent and electric, I have the money put aside for that just in case I do lose my job. In fact, I essential just work there because, for the most part, I enjoy working there, I enjoy earning my own money and having a bit of independence and it also pays for me to do up a van to live in so that I don't have to spend the rest of my life working.

I've been on furlough for the most part of me working a paid position and have been working there for a year (4 months working, 8 months furlough). I've started to notice a few issues that have arrived whilst I asked for some time off (The first time I've asked for time off since starting). I've asked for Christmas week off (24th - 31st), and a few other days off for medical appointments. These were asked about a month in advance. I wanted to ask them earlier but due to the coronavirus I wasn't able to. The issue is, they've essentially said that they'd have to wait and see how busy they are on the day before saying yes. My reasoning for having the time off on Christmas week is that a large percentage of my family are vulnerable and I don't want to pass the coronavirus on. They know, and I have mentioned it often, that my family and my health will always come before my work and they have always been okay with that.

Out of the week that I asked off, I'm actually only taking two days off. I don't work Thursdays so wouldn't be working on the 24th or 31st anyway. The 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th, they're closed which means the only day I would have been working is the 29th, and 30th.

My question is, if they ask me to come in, am I entitled to say no? I hate confrontation and saying no but taking the time off is really important to me. They have said often that I am a hard working individual, how much of a help I am, and how I always come in when needed.

760,"I have a friend who comes to me for everything. I am, in their words, ""(their) person"".

Initially I didn't mind this, I saw it as an honor if anything. However, as time has gone on, that role has gradually morphed into, ""Whenever I'm depressed, or whenever there's drama, I am going to contact you and let it all out"". There's an expectation that I be engaging and responsive or this person, who simultaneously claims to suffer from depression AND has a flair for huge overreaction, will freak out and insist I see them negatively. This person has allegedly attempted suicide before, so there's the added pressure to be there for them as a result of that.

The issue is, it is DRAINING me. I honestly just...don't want to do it anymore. I've run out of words to say, advice to give, pleasantries to reiterate. However, I worry that me being their ""last true friend"" means that any attempt I make to distance myself from that may result in dire consequences. The problem is that I feel my mental health and emotional health is going to suffer if I don't.

Hello :)

I am almost in College and I don't know if I want to pursue it.

The truth is, I want to experience the ""College Life"": the things I always hear

from EVERYONE; saying it's memorable, new, fresh, worth-it &amp;

educational.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I come from a third-world country, which means there is VERY little space of opportunities especially from my dream career.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I've always wanted and dreamed to go to the States. 

If you want to be a dancer, singer, artist, etc., there are tons of schools, courses, universities, workshops and lessons to find.

But here, it's either there's none, or there are very few options to find.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not kidding. It may seem normal, but we see the States as LUXURY; A country that is full of freedom and hope. 

Friends and family who went there said it's like a dream or something out of a movie.

&amp;#x200B;

If I continue and go to college, I have this sense of guilt, loss of adventure to pursuing my dreams more openly.

&amp;#x200B;

If I go to the States, I still have this guilt of not graduating, not experiencing the college life, disappointing myself and my family, leaving/ abandoning my country and everything else.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is up to me, but these decisions have been hard on me for the past few months. 

I know I can still pursue my dream career after College, but I don't know it just doesn't feel right...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for reading (and sorry if I have wrong grammar if I have one lol) :)

&amp;#x200B;

(Btw my dream careers does not need a college degree)

Any advice??

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: It's been difficult deciding whether I go to the States to pursue my dreams and lose the opportunity to experience the College Life, or continue College in my country and lose the opportunity to my dreams.",30Nov2020,1

(Throwaway account for obvious reasons) Two days ago was my 18th birthday. Obviously it wasn‚Äôt as exciting as I had hoped because of social distancing but what can you do. My family did their best to make it a fun day and all and I appreciate them for it. However, I realized that the path my life is going down is not good whatsoever. My childhood is over and I have no direction. I need help and advice.

I watch porn every single day and even when I try to stop I always come back to it. Diet Coke is even worse, I drink around 3-4 cans per day and sometimes up to 6. It‚Äôs a problem.

Now, right when we begin to talk about 10 minutes after, John mentions that he cuts himself out of nowhere. This makes me really confused and also scared because I don't want him to cut himself. I try not to pry but I ask him politely about why he does it and if he's okay and he just says he doesn't want to talk about it. A few minutes later he then says he wants to kill himself. Before I can say anything about it, he leaves the call. I forgot to mention that John is also 14 and male so I don't know if I can believe him. I stay in the call and hope that he rejoins it and about 20minutes later he does. When he joins it he immediately says ""I'm gonna hang myself."" I then begin to get really worried because i don't know what to do now. I then say hey if you want to talk about it then I'm right here and I'm always here to help if you need anything and to that he replies, ""it's decided. I'm going to hang myself. I'm going to break up with my girlfriend so she doesn't have to miss me. I'm going to make her forget about me and I'm going to hang myself.""

770,"I'm a Lithuanian student in my first year of studying Business in the Netherlands. I am very stressed out, depressed and uncertain about my future.

773,"My grandmother is 83 years old, and over the past month or two, she's been developing issues with her short-term memory. A few weeks ago, she developed a false memory of a recent telephone conversation that never happened in which my sister told her that she doesn't love her. Then there was another conversation, relayed to me from my mom, in which she asked the date towards the beginning of a conversation, and then asked for it again towards the end. My mother believes that it is the beginning dementia, and there's no getting better for my grandmother. I personally don't think we should lose hope so quickly.

First of all, my grandmother recently had a minor stroke. Although it was caught early on, a stroke is a stroke, and even the mildest ones can shake things up in the brain - sometimes temporarily, sometimes not. It seems as though her memory issues really began around the time that she got it, so I think it's a real possibility that her memory issues might be related.

The other thing that gives me a bit of hope is the fact that over the past month, my grandmother's cognitive state seems to have improved slightly. She's not 100% back to the way she was before, but from what I gather, she's not confabulating false memories anymore either. When I interact with her on the phone, she's the same as she's ever been. I think we need to see how things progress, and if her memory issues don't go away within the next few months, then she should probably see a specialist to determine where her short-term memory loss may be coming from.

However, my mother is adamant that my grandmother is developing dementia, and that there's no getting better for her. I've done research on memory loss in old age online, its causes, and what can be done to slow its progression (if not reverse it outright). When I sent my mother some links, her response was like this: ""UaU, your grandmother is getting dementia. Her mind is failing because she's old. You need to stop denying it and just accept the reality of it. She's not getting any better."" I told her that even in cases of dementia, there are treatment options that can help slow its progression. She shot me down: ""No. Her memory is going and there's nothing any of us can do about it. You're really grasping at straws here. It's okay to be optimistic, but you need to live in the real world."" When I suggested that she should go see a specialist sometime to assess her memory issues and determine what their cause might be, my mom shot down the idea: ""UaU, bringing her to a specialist isn't going to do anything! It's not gonna make her better! You need to stop living in denial and just accept it, your grandmother is getting old!"" Even though my mom might be right, these conversations really depress me. I'm trying to keep hope alive, and she's doing everything she possibly can to extinguish it. And look, I'm not saying that my grandmother *isn't* developing dementia - she may be. She's 83 years old, and she's going to be 84 next year. Memory loss is a normal part of getting old, Alzheimer's or no. But I also don't want to throw up my arms and give in until we're absolutely certain, beyond any semblance of a doubt, that her condition can neither be treated nor go away on its own.

Is my optimistic outlook reasonable, or am I in denial? I don't think it's wrong to hope for a best-case scenario even with my grandmother's advanced age being taken into consideration.",30Nov2020,1

779,"I don‚Äôt know where else to rant or ask for advice or just simply vent. But it‚Äôs really long so, 
I‚Äôm 25 (F) my mum is 43. 
From being a young kid, my mum hasn‚Äôt ever really been my mum. She had me young and still wanted to party, so my nana brought me up as her own. My nana was my absolute life but she passed when I was 16 after getting throat cancer. 
My mum has always hated me, I‚Äôm the eldest out of 5 and I‚Äôm also the only girl and my mum has always treated me differently. 
I was sexually abused by a neighbour from 6 till I was 8, but my mum was always drunk or not realising where I was, I kept this a secret till I was 13 until I snapped and told my school. He got 3 years in prison for taking away my whole life. I blame my mum for the whole thing, if she just paid me attention or even a little bit, then I don‚Äôt think it would have gone on for as long as it did. 
Then my mum got into a new relationship, I hated my mum having boyfriends because it meant we didn‚Äôt matter that much anymore. Her whole attention would go on them and I hated it. I spent more weekends with my nana. Her relationship turned very dark very quickly and then it was years of dealing with domestic abuse. I was my brothers protector so I couldn‚Äôt move back in with my nan, I remember nights where I could hear my mum being hurt from the next room and I had to hurl my brothers ( youngest at the time was 2) under a single bed, all 5 of us and it was terrifying. I had to become a parent to my brothers because there was times my mum wouldn‚Äôt get out of bed in the morning for school, she wouldn‚Äôt even get up to pick them up so I always had to leave class early to pick them up, I had to clean and make food for them. They was later taken into foster care and I was placed in my nanas care full time. 

But my point is,
3 years ago I had everything I ever wanted. I had my own house, I was in a very stable relationship of 4 years, I have my own little boy (9) that I try really hard to bring up and do everything I possibly can to make sure he has a good upbringing, but my mum got herself kicked out of her long term home and moved in with me. Without even properly asking, she moved all of her stuff into my house, 2 dogs and her and my brother (19) 

I only have a 2 bedroom house but it‚Äôs been hell since! 
My house isn‚Äôt the same, it‚Äôs cramped and hoarded, it‚Äôs full of my mums furniture and her stuff has taken up all storage you can possibly think of. 
I don‚Äôt even leave my bedroom anymore, 
She has a go at me for disciplining my son when he‚Äôs been naughty. I literally tell him off and send him to his room, I don‚Äôt raise my hand to him, the worse I ever do is take away his toys or ban him from his PlayStation. 

Tonight my mum came downstairs after I told my son off for being naughty and told me I‚Äôm taking his childhood away from him because all I ever do is shout at him. 
I told him off for acting up in front of my boyfriend, and to stop being so naughty when people come round because 1) it‚Äôs embarrassing because he never acts like that when it‚Äôs just us. &amp; 2) good boys don‚Äôt get rewarded for bad behaviour. 
But now I‚Äôm sat in my room with my tea whilst they‚Äôre both downstairs and I‚Äôm literally debating to give up, pack my bags and leave. 

I pay the rent on my own, I pay the bills on my own, I cook &amp; clean every night and I‚Äôm a full time working assistant manager. I don‚Äôt ask for financial help from my mum because she doesn‚Äôt work, but all she does is sit around smoke weed and critize my parenting and call me a bad mum. 

My mum was mega soft on my brother (19) he‚Äôs now in Jail and she feels sorry for him, but has ago at me for saying he deserves it for committing the crime? 

I‚Äôm so tired of doing everything on my own and picking up after her and my brother. 

I want my old life back, I want to be able to sit downstairs and watch films with my son. 

I can‚Äôt parent my child when I have an echo at the back of my head constant. 

Am I being irrational?

I (23M) have a weird shaped head. Super weird. Don‚Äôt go outside levels of weird. Think real life ‚Äúmegamind‚Äù, as it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been called in the past.

The embarrassment that I feel regarding it, and how self conscious I am about it controls every aspect of my life. It‚Äôs got to the stage that I go outside once a week for shopping and on a walk at midnight, but that is it. 

When I do go out I am in a cap, which doesn‚Äôt help much, as the shape of my head can still be seen. Regardless of hair length it is very noticeable, due to a very poor hairline.

I have a very long history with depression, I‚Äôll save you all the details, but in combination with many other factors in my life, it seriously affects my mental wellbeing. I mean I can‚Äôt show my face in public without thinking that everyone is staring at it, it‚Äôs not a great quality of life.

Literally the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning is my plan to eventually have surgery which I have contacted plastic surgeons about, which would be very expensive, and I am currently a student so very little money, and no way to save. My only life goal is to make enough money to afford this surgery, this is not an exaggeration.

Many of my friends tell me that there is nothing noticeably wrong with it, but it has been mentioned in a mocking way by others who are less kind. 

I‚Äôve got to the stage where a year ago I left all social media (Facebook, Instagram etc.) as I hated seeing people tag photographs of me, and I would just stare at them for hours and be miserable.

Sorry that this post was long, I‚Äôm just hoping for any advice on how to make my peace with it and cope, so that I can have some quality of life up until the point where I can have surgery, instead of ‚Äúbeing a hermit‚Äù, as some have said.",30Nov2020,1
782,"So I went to a private catholic all-boys high school, for my final two years and it was dramatically different then public school in ways I didn't expect...

It was like simultaneously more strict yet also far more anti-censorship and very casual beyond expectations...

Of course there was the typical dress code and all that, but that's about as strict as it got.

My english class, for example was simply a former student in his mid 30's who listened to Motley Crue and would often have their music or concert DVD playing when we began class...

There were days where we would spend like 20 minutes watching their concert...
he was funny and a cool guy, would often swear and he wasn't acting like a regular teacher at all.

Then I had an English class which was also taught by the Brit Literature teacher, and older man in his 60's...

One day we had to write poems and read them out loud... most students wrote ones with swear words and nobody cared including the teacher...

I even opted to have the teacher read my poem, which said ""fuck"" many times and he simply read it without censoring!

Lastly, we had this Christian Film Study class taught by one of the Religous people at the school, he dressed like a priest or something... in his 60's I'd say.

A very sweet, gentle man, yet he would often swear and say ""fuck"", and the movies we watched were so out there and unexpected:

American Beauty, Cider House Rules and others I don't recall.

785,"When the pandemic hit back in March in the US, I went through one of the hardest times of my life. Online school was atrocious with nobody not really knowing what to do. I had a really negative experience with online school because I no longer was in a study/educational environment, it was harder to communicate with professors and classmates, and the overall experience was unpleasant. 

On top of this, I also took care of my grandparents, essentially working a 24/7 full time job trying to keep them safe and comfortable as both were in bad shape. I went through some traumatic experiences, including the death of grandpa right before finals. I also suffer with depression and anxiety disorders, so keeping that maintained was almost impossible too.

I had decided to take this fall semester off because of how negative of an experience I had with online school, as well as to better treat my mental health. My school this spring is planning on doing a hybrid of in-person and online for classes. I am genuinely split between going back or taking another semester off. Going back would mean I would be back on track, graduate sooner, and would be with friends again, but it also would mean risking worse mental health (since my degree is very demanding), potentially getting exposed to the virus (I'm slightly at risk), and may end up going straight back to online if a bad outbreak occurs.",30Nov2020,1
786,"Hello 

So I‚Äôve been living with my sister for a couple years , she owns the house and I live in a basement that I built into a apartment and give her rent. It was agreed if I helped her with the house.

I mind my business down here and I‚Äôve liked to try and keep it that way.

For the most part I‚Äôm pretty kind to her , I help her sometimes with stuff she needs help with and do little favors everyone and then 

Well one day I was out of town and couldn‚Äôt take out the trash so I ask her if she could. She reads the message and says no , ‚Äú next week will be two of em so take em out ‚Äú 

Small note: she doesn‚Äôt pay for trash and we put ours in our parents a house over. Not even a minute 

Uh wtf was that about

I noticed she‚Äôs really anti take the trash out which I don‚Äôt understand , takes a minute and if you do it earlier it maybe wouldn‚Äôt be annoying I guess ?
She always likes to ask me / brings it up when it‚Äôs late and night and there coming 

After that incident it came across she‚Äôs entitled that I have to take the trash out so I said fuck it take out your trash then. I‚Äôm not responsible for your trash

So last couple of weeks she ask me to do it and I just don‚Äôt respond and the bags have been piling up and she keeps saying how she needs help with the bags and it‚Äôs all my fault. 

At this point I noticed about the things she ask me to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù it‚Äôs not really help it‚Äôs just me doing things that‚Äôs she really doesn‚Äôt need help with 

A lot of time she wants me to drive her own car to the gas station and buy her what ever booze she wants because for some reason she doesn‚Äôt want to go inside and I don‚Äôt want to she will just text bomb me with what ever slander / your not helping text

I‚Äôve been also watching her dog for the last couple of months. She got a new dog and they haven‚Äôt met , the one needs to be fixed to even meet and she never says anything about it. So I‚Äôve been stuck with dog for months and no one bats an eye about it.
Also she wants me to clean up her garage full of her shit and garbage that she just doesn‚Äôt want to do

So last night she get fed up and hit me with ‚Äú rents goin since you can‚Äôt out my trash ‚Äú and wants to bring it up with dad.

I can afford what ever that‚Äôs fine but I‚Äôm annoyed she gotta bring my dad into this because at the end of the day the situation will probably just end with me doing so , which I‚Äôm fine with but there a big girls never lose an argument streak here on my family 

I get helping her with things she can‚Äôt do by herself but bullshit like being a Uber and taking out her trash? To me I think she‚Äôs being stupid lazy and she could just do it her godam self , take my rent money and let me live in peace 
My dad will prob just beat on me about just what ever she says 

 
I honestly like to ‚Äú help ‚Äú on the things she can‚Äôt do by her self but a lot of this shit she can dam well so she just doesn‚Äôt want to do so she has me do it. 

Do I honestly have any entitlement to defend myself in this situation or do I just take the high road and so what ever bullshit request she has?",30Nov2020,1

It took me 4 years just to get the small amount of audience I have. If I start a new channel for the blasphemous content I then start at zero. If I add this content to my existing channel it will have a larger audience but might piss off some work contacts and maybe some family (not as worried about that).  The new content I am working on is everything from slightly blasphemous to extremely blasphemous. Some of it is animated skits and there will be at least  one music video which will be making fun of all major religions.,30Nov2020,1

So it all started january this year when me (22M) got this new job at a bigger company, after a couple of days i got along well with nearly everybody in my new surrounding and we all still do get along really well, with no major problems at all. After more time i got even closer with said co-worker (F31).

By now it reached a point where we talk about everything, i know about her family, her problems, her  dark storys from the past and yes even sexual stories she shared with me.

Now to said problem, i think by now i love her but i don't know how to express it because she is in a kinda healthy relationship, is nearly 10yrs older than me and is in generall living a totally different life to mine.

And yet i can't get her out of my mind. I see her nearly everyday, we talk, we laugh and we even wanna do more together (yes, we).

Has someone experienced something similar ? How to deal with that.

He pressured one of our friends (F19) to drink eventhough she insisted not to, he then started to berate her and she was visibly upset by it. We then calmed him down and everything was okay after that.

I was doing alright but lately a run of bad luck has me in big trouble. I'm 3 months behind on rent and about to be evicted. I can't go to work because I can't afford daycare and my grandmother, who usually watches my children, is covid positive. I have no one else i can ask for help. We were also exposed in the meantime, so there's that. 

My family is toxic. They refuse to help and I'm pretty sure they are attempting to paint me as a bad mother so they can steal my children, whom they've said before I am not taking care of properly. (Ie: to their ridiculous standards) They have even tried to bully me into giving them power of attorney over my children. 

I have a place to go, but it is 2000 miles away. I just want to get a storage shed and drive away, but I can't even pay for groceries or gas to get to the store at this point, let alone late rent and a shed. 

I can't post on the subs because I don't have enough karma. I've tried a go fund me but I can't get a single donation. I've called churches and charities. I've sold my belongings. I don't know what else to do. I'm willing to do work. I don't want anything for free, but I can't think of anything else I can do. Thank you for your time.",30Nov2020,1

826,"Hi there

I'm just gonna give you a bit of info upfront:

I'm a 14 year old boy

My mom and dad is 45 and 46

So, my grandfather is 83 years old, and last year, he has moved out of his home of 50 years. He had three children, my aunt, my uncle and my mom. Both my parents are lawyers so they helped him with selling the house, and all that. 

He has since then started abusing my mom psychologically, and manipulating her into doing stuff for him, driving him to the hospital in her days off, making her help clean his house when he was moving, saying that ""I ripped my pants today, I know you like to sew. Can you fix them?"". My mom is a lawyer, that has never in her entire life showed interest for sewing, in fact, I made my own costume for Halloween a few years ago because I was the only one who had a clue what I was doing. I only told this part because it shows just how discriminating he is. My mom just got a new job, and instead of congratulating her, he asks, what about paid vacation, I can't go to the hospital by myself. It's like he doesn't believe that she has a proper job, and she's earning money.   


Last Saturday, my mom found him laying on the floor. Her guess is that he laid there for 24 hours or so. They of course got an ambulance and got him to the hospital, he wasn't quite clear in his head. But this morning he was back to his old manipulative self, making sure that my mother had to find his keys, even though he isn't going home for at least a week. She left the hospital because she couldn't take more (I left out some details, he said a lot of things to her). And the second she was gone he called my aunt asking for his keys.  


I guess what I'm trying to say is that the whole of my mothers side of the family thinks she is the one to go to when anything is wrong. And my grandfather thinks he owns her, and she doesn't think she is anything serious.  


I'm currently writing this while my parents are talking to my grandmother (fathers side) and my mom is crying, they are talking about his lack om empathy, calling him a psychopath and saying that he is very manipulative.

Then she accepted the appointment the day of, then created another appointment *in the past and marked it as completed*. 

I'm a busy college student -- or so I like to believe. Is it even worth bringing this up to her first in email, and then to someone else? It doesn't affect me, but it looks like I had a lot of appointments when I didn't.

However we learned that his parents will be moving out of state soon. He lives his parents immensely, which is a good thing. But his parents will be selling their house and he can't bare to see someone new buy it. So he wants to drop the house we planned to buy and buy his parents house instead.

I'm heartbroken about this. I really don't want to move in to his parents house, a place which already has so many memories for him, but none for me. I don't want him to always be thinking of his parents when we are in OUR house. I really wanted a fresh house to make new and fresh memories, that won't be overshadowed by the old ones he had with his parents.

I feel very selfish and mean because of my feelings. I don't want to feel the way I do about moving into his parents house. I want to be excited, but I can't be.

852,"For some context, I'm 19 and he's 22. I moved out of my mom's house last summer and I live alone in a studio right now. He lived with roommates for a few years but now he's back with his mom and siblings. We've been together a few months and we've known each other for several years.

He's very close with his family and had me meet them almost immediately. I'm always at his house and so I've already spent a lot of time with his family and friends. He's only met about half my family, and only spent time with them once. He's never met my friends and I don't think he wants to. In an ideal world he could bond with my family as I've bonded with his, but that's clearly not going to be the case.

I would like there to be other reasons but honestly I think it comes down to the fact that they don't really care. My mom has no interest or plan for ever meeting him. My sister says she wants to but she hardly has time for me. The one time he was over (my dad's girlfriend invited him to a family ""game night"") they all kind of talked around both of us and when I asked what they thought they accused him of being ""quiet"" and ""awkward"". English is not his first language and he is shy around strangers, and I didn't know how to explain that he felt left out.

I let him know that he was invited to Thanksgiving, and Christmas morning, and now he's invited by my sister to another game night, but I understand that he doesn't want to go. He's slowly realizing that I'm not at all close to my parents (they weren't even there for Thanksgiving) and I have been fighting really hard to keep family relationships but it hasn't been reciprocated at all. My parents' divorce last year broke our family and me moving out ruined it.

Last week he abruptly said ""Fuck your family."" He said it seems like they don't give a shit about me and that I try too hard for people who don't care. I know that it's true but it still hurts. It was his mom, not either of my parents, who reached out on Thanksgiving, and it's her who saved a spot for me at her table that night in case I decided to be there. I know my parents love me but they don't want to be present or involved anymore and it fucking hurts.

I don't really know what to do. He asked when the game night is and said he wants to go, but I feel bad that he's putting himself in a situation where he's not fully accepted just to make me happy. People tend to jump for the ""cut off your family"" solution but I don't think I'm capable of doing that. Any help is appreciated.",30Nov2020,1
853,"I've always struggled with forms of anxiety, from trichotillomania to depressive episodes and other symptoms. I've been on lexapro for a few years now and have been pretty stable, but two months ago I learned my mom has stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. I was okay for awhile, but in the last 3 weeks physically I've felt mildly unwell. I feel mildly nauseous all day which affects my appetite and energy to workout, something I do often. It feels like I'm hungover and dehydrated every day but I'm not drinking to that point. I do drink a lot of water. I'm not pregnant, I had my period right before this started happening and I'm a) on BC and b) don't let my partner finish inside of me often (sorry for TMI). 

I haven't seen my doctor yet, I was paranoid it was COVID but the symptoms really don't match. It kind of feels like how it feels when you're super hungover and anxiety, or haven't eaten anything and drank a bunch of coffee.

When I got out, I saw him again at an intersection a block away. He looked at me in a way that made me feel uncomfortable and turned to start going in the direction I was even though he seemed like he was about to cross the street the other way.

I noticed him after a few minutes and ran the way home, running into my apartment front office so I could enter mine without him seeing. I watched him from the window and noticed he walked straight past and didn't seem to notice me.

That was a few days ago, and ever since then I've been really worried that I will run into him again in case he really was following me. We do live right next to a lightrail station so I'm trying to tell myself that's where he was going but it just doesn't make sense why he turned to follow me instead of crossing the street like he seemed to be.

Do I need to keep worrying about this guy? I'd never seen him before and am not sure if he lives near me. And I'm also not sure if he saw me go into my apartment complex's front office. Is that enough that he probably won't know where I live?

Should I have done more? I just keep worrying about it (maybe in part because I have OCD) and don't know what to do to feel safe. I do carry pepper spray and live with my husband but don't feel safe anymore. Nobody's ever followed me anywhere and I don't know what to do.",30Nov2020,1

For this reason I'm not okay with girls who've had sex and I feel ashamed even bringing up sex. But there's someone who I'm very attracted to and interested in me but they're pretty experienced and I know for a fact the relationship wouldn't last forever, maybe a couple years at best. If I go through with it I think I'll feel extremely ashamed and disgusted with myself, like I'm destroying all my moral foundations. But maybe feeling that regret and shame will make me more tolerant with other partner's history, like who would I be to judge at that point? I'm getting older and I have no idea if it's even possible to find a girl in her 20s who's inexperienced and doesn't have some other major issue so maybe it's better to just to do the same and hope I'll feel more empathetic?

863,"So I'm 17 male, and right now I'm probably the most insecure person I know. When I was like 13 I had a cringy youtube channel, and I'm pretty sure that everyone hates me because of that (I live in a small town). Plus I grew up hanging out with my sister a lot so I have some ""feminine"" interests and behavior (like pop music, dance, not good at sports, etc.), so of course, I'm flagged as gay (pretty conservative area, not LGBT+ supportive). 

So I think because I was teased and bullied my whole school life I am hyperaware of EVERYTHING I do. Sometimes I can't sleep because something I said that day sounded bratty, or dumb, or something like that. I often delete my messages because I think they sound dumb even though they were normal texts, I get nervous when I have to talk even to my family and friends. I hate my face and body, and I am always afraid that people are pretending to be my friends out of pity.

864,"My friend has been texting me a lot lately. This has been happening for the past like two week but it seems like it‚Äôs getting worse.

She shows a lot of fear towards the future and doesn‚Äôt see much hope. I feel terrible for talking about her like this but I have no idea what I can do to help her. For the first week I gave her as much advice as I can, but there‚Äôs only so much I can do.

She‚Äôs been through so much already, she attempted suicide almost four years ago, for that whole spring and summer I didn‚Äôt hear a word from her. She was at a low pint again earlier this year because a family member who lived with her and she loved very much and connected a lot with moved back to their home country.

865,"So TQG was an amazing series and I won't be spoiling it here.  Anya Taylor-Joy was mesmerizing and beautiful, and one of the few actresses that I was blown away by (similarly to Emma Watson or Margot Robbie).  The problem is, and this problem extends beyond that series, is that when meeting beautiful women, I become very internally negative, depressed, and self-destructive, thinking that if in my entire life I've never met a girl that likes me, then all my life can be conclude as a lonely life in solitude.

The other reason I mention that series is the presence of drug/alcohol abuse in it.  Throughout my own fights with depression/anxiety/bipolar, ""xanzolam"" is clearly a nod to (Xanax + alprazolam).  Ironically, after binge-watching that series till 3AM, I couldn't fall asleep and had to take a Klonopin, the first one in months.  

Lately, with the pandemic and blurred work-life lines, I've been drinking way too much.  Sometimes, I have 3-5 drinks in one sitting, perhaps equivalent to six glasses of wine?  And then obviously combining this with 2mg clonazepam is a very unhealthy thing--but when I stop, I can't fall asleep, without sleep, I can't function.

While out and about, if I run into a very attractive person, I get very flustered and my social skills decompose even quicker than normal.  Having lived my life in solitude for 26, soon 27 years, I don't know if I can take this much longer.  Obviously I'm not going to be meeting an Anya Taylor-Joy or Emma Watson type in my life, but I don't want to be so bitter about being single for all these damn years that I turn into some incel or something.

My workplace is male-dominated.  I mean like 2 women exist in the entire 150 people or so building.  I'm relocating for work, totally unfamiliar place to me.  Lots of change, lots of adjustment, but I feel I'll never really fit in there.  It's been really tough, tough since middle and high school, and even worse in college.  Having been in the workforce for 3 years or so, it hasn't gotten any better.

I do fear that I'm not going to make it in this world.  I do fear that it's possible to die of loneliness.  There are times when I see other couples having public displays of affection and I can't stand the internal anger and outwards jealousy.

Sometimes, it's strange that a brilliant short series can stir up my emotions in such a way.  Now I am on the 4th consecutive night relying on diminishing effects of high-dose sedatives to forget it all. What do I do from here?",30Nov2020,1

871," 

I work for a government agency and we are being bullied by a newly hired Lead. He has been caught lying multiple times by his supervisor and has defamed the character of employees he overlooks. This has turned to bullying because he hasn't had any repercussions for his actions or lying. He would come to my desk daily and ask me to clean it. I work in radio repair and was overwhelmed with work at the time. Instead of asking if I needed help he just kept adding more to my plate. The person in charge of my old section just received an assistant for his spot. He would also undermine my decisions. Ask me if I wanted a certain desk and then go against my opinion each time. Another event was where I had asked an outside employee to bring a certain amount of employees at the same time. He stood behind me and threw up numbers that went against mine. The outside employee then started making fun of me. He said ""oh don't worry I will watch over him"". I was never offered that nor even help from him. He just sits at his desk majority of the day and delegates. The bullying has gotten so bad that I had to go up the chain of command. I was intimidated during the meeting to change my wording and to avoid the word harassment. I changed the wording on my email and upon completion of the meeting we were asked to shake hands. He shook my hand so hard that it hurt for close to an hour after. I never complained because I felt that our supervisor had his back no matter what and I felt that they would figure out a way to legally retaliate and get me hurt. He constantly calls me out for little trivial things that I am more than sure he doesn't do to his favorites. I have been somewhat late since he has gotten here due to the anxiety that he gives me prework. He makes me write out emails upon my arrival. I started writing down when his favorite brown nosers are late too and will see if they wrote emails on the days they arrived later.

874,I M20 am looking to sneak out of my parents house at night to smoke. I have a job and I am currently working on moving out. I just want to be able to smoke on occasion until then. I would like to sneak out and go for a walk off my parents property to do so. My bedroom is in the basement and I dont have a window to sneak out of. There is one door that seems to be very quiet but it is right below their room. Is it likely that they would hear a door open from the basement in the dead of night? Should I really call it sneaking out if Im an adult? My parents dont really care what I do but I dont think they have the most positive view on marijuana. My dad has basically caught me a few times when I left my room a little smelly on accident. One day he outright told me he thought I was smoking weed last night. I denied it and he let it go but it didnt seem like either of my parents cared too much. Since then he has asked me if I was high or if I smoke weed in a somewhat joking way. Maybe they already know that I smoke occasionaly? Should I just tell them that I smoke and they will be okay with me leaving at night to do so? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

We work at a PR company and we have to share offices (with social distancing due to covid). I have to share my massive office with 2 coworkers, one of whom eats raw garlic everyday and stinks. He is aware of it, he brags about it in the style of ""Eating garlic in my country is normal, I bet people here hate me but this is my culture"". Despite the massive size of the office, he somehow manages to make the entire office stink about 5 minutes after he enters. We open the windows very often to get the garlic smell out when it becomes intolerable and he complains that it's too cold and that he cannot tolerate cold because it's never cold in his country.

How do we handle this? I hate being the one who tells others what they should or shouldn't eat, especially if garlic is so important to them for cultural reasons. But this is making working hell for me. He eats garlic and stinks on one side and complains when we take measures against the smell by opening the windows. How do we tell him that he cannot make the working experience hell for the two of us without offending him? How do we tell him to stop eating garlic during the working days of the week?",30Nov2020,1
880,"So, as the title says, I'm in quite a sticky situation. I'm in love with my best friend. She is absolutely my world, and I would do anything for her. Every time I think of her I smile, every time I talk with her I want to hang on to that forever and never let go. I'm deeeeeep in this, and have felt this way for almost 2 years now. Here's the problem--She's in a relationship. She has been for the last 5 years with this guy who has mistreated her over and over again, and she kept running back. He's finally getting his shit together, which is good for them, but she loves him, and I see the same look in her eyes when she sees him is the same I feel inside when I see her. Which hurts even more. 

What do I do? I've tried ""falling out of love"", and it all just comes back when I talk to her. Is it wrong to hope that they end it, despite the odds of that happening? Am I wrong for feeling the way I do for her? I'm just lost. 

I told her at one point how she felt and it nearly tore her apart because she felt something, but not nearly as much for me as for him. As far as she knows, I'm over it. 

As I'm writing this, I think it may seem creepy or stalkerish, I promise that's not the case at all. I think if it will truly make her happy, I can hold back all these feelings and let her live the life she has planned out with him.

When it comes to my ASD, most people are shocked when I tell them I have this. I have mastered the art of acting ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but there are some tings I still struggle with. One of them is telling stories. I have trouble describing things and events in a cohesive manner. I will bounce everywhere and it‚Äôs often confusing for others. Another big problem is reading out loud. I am so terrible I will even mess up reading baby books. Lastly, I am extremely picky.

But I can‚Äôt stand it here. My family hates each other and fights all the time and by fighting i mean it does get physical sometimes. Lots of holes in walls and that type of thing. But I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs an option to call CPS or police because they‚Äôre always careful to not leave marks

My parents don‚Äôt believe in mental illness. Or at least my mom doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been to two therapists by myself and did not really click with either of them. They were good but I think it‚Äôs just a problem with me not being able to share things well. Anyway if I ask my family for help I‚Äôm not going to get it. So whatever I do I have to do myself. I can‚Äôt drive, I only have my permit. I took driving classes for a long time with different instructors but eventually my last one told me that I have too much anxiety with driving and might have to seek help (like I don‚Äôt know that lol) I‚Äôm not a safe driver because of that. 
I can get an Uber to places as long as it‚Äôs not super expensive 

Anyway what I‚Äôm basically asking is what can I do? My friend said I should consider inpatient care but I don‚Äôt know how to get into that. I want to leave the house but at the same time I don‚Äôt because then I would be abandoning my dad and little brother to deal with my mom. If I did that I couldn‚Äôt live with myself. Besides that I don‚Äôt really have anywhere to go. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I don‚Äôt have any options. I really need advice on what I can do. If you need more information I can give it to you.

I am currently finishing prerequisites for a RN degree. I am conflicted with my career choice because I have a dream to become a Medical Illustrator. I come from an artistic family if I must say. My Mother‚Äôs passions to be an artist have shed off on me as well as my fathers desire for musicality. 

Nothing excites me more than being in a laboratory, and expression in art is my passion. Establishing my goal is not difficult, but finding the correct path is what worries me.

Let‚Äôs pretend everything goes according to this plan: 

I‚Äôm going to attend school for a RN at a local college and pass the NCLEX. I will then attend an accelerated BSN program. With a BSN program I can enter the military as a nurse. The government will then pay for my art education after my contract is over (ha). After art school is over, my art portfolio and experience in sciences would be acceptable at a one of the Masters programs for medical illustration. Happily ever after... 

This will be a long journey to  achieve my goals. Is this feasible? Advice? :)

Thank you for your time friends.",30Nov2020,1
886,"I need some feedback on something that keeps coming up between my wife and I. Sorry this is a little long but I wanted to provide as much context as possible since it's a complex question.

Back in college when my now wife and I were dating (pretty casual up to this point. we'd known each other for a year or so and had been messing around for most of that year. It was somewhere between casual hookup and bf/gf) I took her to a dance of sorts that my fraternity hosted. It is usually about 90 minutes away so everyone gets hotel rooms with their dates we have dinner, a dance, and then have a big party. Think of it as a less formal prom.

At some point in the night, I couldn't find my date. She was nowhere to be found until one of my friends who's gf was best friends with my now wife told me that she was in the room with one of my fraternity brothers and hinted that they're probably having sex.

He wasn't even aware we were dating until she told him afterward and he came up to apologize to me after the fact that night. They had a history and she clearly liked him (even though I know he didn't feel the same about her. Regardless he's a decent guy and my friend still) so she went with what felt right. Since things were pretty casual between her and I didn't want to make a fuss about it and, even though my feelings were pretty hurt and I was embarrassed about the situation, I told him no worries. It was a shitty thing to do to someone but we weren't serious at the time. Then the next day I talked to her and told her that I thought that it was a shitty thing to do and that I'm done with persuing her but we could still be friends. She acknowledged that it wasn't right and told me over and over again she was sorry. At that moment I was dead set on nothing ever going anywhere with her and told her as much.

But that didn't last long. Since the guy she hooked up with at the dance had no interest in her she kept texting me asking to hang out. We had tons of mutual friends so we'd see each other often. We started messing around again and after a month or so of things getting more serious pretty much the same thing happened at a party with the same guy. She even had an overnight bag in my room tp stay with me. Again, he wasn't aware that we were dating again because I didn't really want to talk about it. The same thing happened. He ditched her. She told me how sorry she was. This time I was a bit more frustrated with her and told her that it was over.

Over the next two years we hooked up from time to time before we eventually started dating and she became my girlfriend. A few years later we got married. Once we got married my jealousy about this went away. My wife is great. She's beautiful. Super fun. And genuinely a good person and partner. This is not an attack on her character.

Here's the problem. 99% of the time I legitimately feel like I am 100% over it. We still see that friend and his wife on a regular basis.

But from time to time it creeps back into my head and I get a massive sense of frustration and embarrassment that I was treated like I didn't exist two separate times in front of all of my friends.

So, maybe once every year or two, it comes back up during an argument.

On one hand, I know that my feelings are valid. I'm clearly not over it even though I trust her. It pains me that the person who is most important to me in my life completely disregarded my feelings multiple times and, probably most importantly, embarrassed me in front of my friends without a care until the next day. But I also get that not everyone is perfect and it's not like we were married.

On the other hand, I get how frustrating this has to be for her. What is she supposed to say that she hasn't? She knows she was wrong. We've supposedly moved past it. We weren't overly serious at the time. When it comes up she often times gets defensive and brings these points up and for some reason, it makes me more upset. I feel like she communicates poorly about it right off the bat and in turn, I feel like she's invalidating my feelings about it.

So here are the questions I have for everyone...

I'm not asking who's right and who's wrong. That is not important to me.

What can I do to help me get over this? How can I either stop thinking about it or handle it better when I do? I don't want to think about it anymore because, big picture, we are very happy together. But I get very anxious and worked up about it and have a hard time ending the conversation. It almost feels like an impulse.

On the flip side of that, would it be fair to have a conversation with her about how I, in that moment, want to be talked to so that I can calm my anxiety down and end the conversation? She doesn't do well with confrontation and almost always unintentionally says something that makes me feel worse. Even if it shouldn't it's not what I want to hear in that moment.

I guess my main question is how can she and I work together on a solution to make this not an issue? I feel like we are almost there and can't get over the finish line.

And let me be clear. This isn't an indictment of her. I am 100% aware that I am overreacting and that I should get over it. And that it's really just my pride getting in the way. I'm just struggling to do so. People get over way worse stuff all the time.

Tl:DR - My now wife hooked up with my friend when we first started dating after making plans to stay with me on two separate occasions. Since getting married I'm largely over it. But from time to time it still comes up. We have a very healthy relationship aside from that and I am looking for ways that we can work together to get me to stop bringing it up and, if I do bring it up, how she can help me get over the conversation quickly so it doesn't turn into an actual full-blown argument.",30Nov2020,1

They asked me if I wanted to be in a relationship with them.  I thought it was fine.  I'd never been in a relationship before (like I said I'm ace.  I have a hard time liking people).  I told them that I was ace so they wouldn't try anything down the line.  They said it was fine, they could fix me.  This really surprised me.  I didn't think they were like that.  I stopped talking to them soon after that.  Now I'm wondering if something really is wrong with me.  I've realized now that I'm homo-romantic.  My family is homophobic.  (I don't want to sound like I am too.)  I'm having a hard time accepting who I am.  It's been two years since I realized.  What do I do?  I haven't even come out to my parents yet.",30Nov2020,1

Ok so I have a little part time job on Fiverr. I‚Äôm only 16 so it‚Äôs just a nice income that allows me to go out with friends or buy stuff like guitars or records, etc.

Well my service is blog/article writing. Basically freelance writing and journalism.

A few weeks ago I had someone place an order with me to write a ‚Äúreview‚Äù (it was more of an overview) of their new mobile game. Now I‚Äôm not going to say that name of the user or the name of their upcoming game because I‚Äôm sure they have good intentions but something is just...off. 

The game is weird. Like really weird. They‚Äôre advertising it as this ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù game which is like an AR dating game. Like Pokemon go but instead of catching a charmander you‚Äôre supposedly catching your future wife? Anyways that‚Äôs not actually the weird part.

The buyer attached some pictures and videos of an early ‚Äúdemo‚Äù of the game, and it just seems weird. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt attach pics or vids on this post but it all seemed super sketchy. I can‚Äôt even describe it. It looked just straight up weird. Just really dodgy. 

I ended up cancelling the order, citing my reason as ‚Äútoo busy for this job‚Äù. And it was over...until yesterday.

The same person has come back and ordered the same thing. But I can‚Äôt just use the same excuse twice. 

How do I get out of this?

TL;DR - someone is asking me to write a fake review of an upcoming mobile game but it all seems super dodgy.

895,"Do psychologist subreddits exist? I feel like mental health subreddits wouldn't be the right environment for this question.

Anyway, I use 'psychologist' in the traditional doctor/patient way.

I've considered forensics, or more research-based careers but worry about how realistic that would be? After Criminal Minds I'm not sure the world needs more Forensic Psychologists.

Profiling is something I find the most interesting, but I like the idea of studying experiments too (like Vsauce's Mind Field with Michael Stevens.)

898,"English is not my first language, so please bear with me

Some backstory: I am 21f and my cousin who's getting bullied is 12f. I am very close to all of my cousins because we live in the same building, different floors.

The boy bullying her is also friends with some of my other cousins in the same age group. One of them being a step-cousin.

My cousin  is constantly getting bullied by one of the boys online.  Since everyone is doing online school these days, my cousin has a group chat consisting all of her classmates. One of the boys in this group keeps constantly talking down to her to the point where she was in tears 

Some of the things that this boy went on to say was that, he likes making fun of the weak ones, called her a h\*e , a b\*tch, F you &amp; that she's a mistake without getting provoked whatsover. When he's going on a rant, the rest of the group would be like, ""I'm just here for the drama"" and stuff like that.

So I asked her to leave the group, which she did, but they keep adding her back. I told her to ignore him or stop texting in the group altogether but she obviously cannot stop doing that. So I told her that if she's going to reply to him, keep saying ""ok"" until he gets bored and  stop talking.

I honestly don't know what to do at this point, she won't listen to me and he's not going to stop talking down to her. I don't know if I should tell her mum (my aunt) about this. I don't want to be a snitch and lose her trust. The boy even calls her a snitch and makes up rumors about her and everyone in the school believes him because he's popular

She doesn't want to tell her mum about this because of the reason mentioned above. My step-cousin is really close to this boy and I understand that my step-cousins might feel a bit alienated in this family because he's not related to us by blood. So he has gone to say a lot of things about our family that is obviously not true. And the bully is spreading these rumors to the other kids. 

Apparently the boy is popular enough to make the kids believe anything he says and would turn on my cousin if he tells them to.

I'm sorry this is long and maybe a bit confusing, I'm having a hard time trying to explain everything on here and I'm desperate. Tonight was the last straw for me, I can't just stand by and watch this kid tear down my cousin like that

I need all the help I can get to deal with this situation",30Nov2020,1

905,"Hi, this will be fairly long and I will try to keep things clear. This is my first time posting to reddit but I don't really know who to go to for advice/help on this. I'll delete if this isn't the right place to post. I was also told this in confidence and know my siblings have reddit so if it blows up too much I might have to delete. 

I am 24F and live on my own about 300miles away from my parents, and the youngest of 4. My brother(26) lives at home with my parents and has never moved away or held a job for more than 3months. This is due to a colorful history of problems, educational reasons, and series of mental health issues he has. This is important to note so please bear with me. 

For the sake of the story I will refer to my brother as Mark from this point on. Neither myself or my siblings have a relationship with Mark. He has been cut out of our lives due to his abusive and narcissistic behavior despite still living with our parents whom we very much keep in our lives and support. His mental health issues have gone undiagnosed because he refused to see a therapist/psychologist once he turned 18. We have tried talking to our parents to seek their own counsel because they are constantly at a loss of what to do about his behavior. To sum it up, he is very aggressive both verbally and physically, has problems processing and will quickly assume you are insulting or ""challenging"" him in some way, and is a pathological liar. I do not speak to him at all even when in the same room because it results in a fight no matter how calmly or carefully I phrase my words. This has been going on for the past 10yrs. 

Now my parents are in their 60s, my dad is retired and my mom works. Please know that we love them very much, my parents are very caring and giving people. However, they aren't quick to let us know when something involving Mark has happened since we tend to react the same each time - telling them to get help and get him out of the house. We don't do this out of lack of understanding or sympathy but because there is a cycle of abuse that has no end and is eating at them. They pay for everything he has - food, clothes, car, computers, phone. Honestly they keep convincing themselves that he's getting better and I think when they have to tell us something bad has happened it breaks that illusion. 

This next part is the big thing, I am the only one my parents have told because I've always been the confidante. They don't want me telling me siblings, and I don't know everything yet so I'm going to wait to know more. But I'll most likely tell them soon. 

Around the beginning of the year, Mark began suffering from delusions. We weren't told about this until it ended up with him in the hospital in spring. According to him, he was recruited to work for the govt as a spy on the Epstein case. I don't know the exact reason why he went to the ER, but I know he called 911 himself to go. While there he fought the staff, went into other patients rooms, called my parents screaming and tried to run out of the hospital where they had to tackle and strap him. Turns out for a few weeks leading up to it he was saying that he had files he needed wiped and was destroying household items like candles and pillows saying that they were bugged. Nurses told my mom they thought he was having an extreme reaction to drugs. When I found out about all of this, I begged and begged my parents to seek out help, a psychologist, a therapist, anyone to start making reports. My mom said that she thought maybe he was tied up in something online because of the way he was acting. I told her if she really thought that then they needed to contact authorities - I can't do anything to help from 300 miles away. I also begged them not to feed into any dangerous delusions. They ignored me. 

This is where I get angry, and sad, and at a loss of what to do. I don't want to give too many details here because now an attorney is involved. I was just told that 2 months ago the state troopers/police came to their door with a search warrant. Mark's delusions have not changed, he still believes he is working for the govt. That in turn means stumbling onto illicit items on the internet, please make your own assumptions with those facts because I don't want to somehow hurt my parents by posting this and incriminating them somehow. The attorney they contacted let them know that charges are now pending against Mark, and after he talked to Mark (and heard his delusions) he believes he can get the charges dropped without the need for trial because he is not mentally well. The legal fees for this alone are $15k, an additional $25k if it goes to trial. 

My parents are broken, my dad has so many health issues that have come with his age that he is scared he doesn't have many more years left and my mom is so close to retirement. This has completely ruined them. It will eat up their savings/retirement funds if it goes to trial. Mark is in incredible debt (hospital bills/student loans/etc) and will in no way shape or form will be paying for any of the fees himself. I am angry they didn't get help when I begged them to, I am angry that my parents are now suffering, I am angry that I am only 24 and have no way to help, and I'm scared about how this will affect them. I don't know what to do. 

Tldr; my brother got into legal trouble that could of been prevented in spring, now my parents will most likely be paying $40k for an attorney because he cannot support himself and will ruin/is ruining my parents livelihood.",30Nov2020,1

I‚Äôve not really been successful with women due to not having attractive traits so quite overlooked on dating platforms. I get it, it is what it is. When I talk to women and they say they get 100s of matches it baffles me. Such easy unconditional love is a treasure. I try to focus on things I‚Äôm passionate about like making money. I have a great job and quite a bit of money but I feel it‚Äôs all really pointless. I work 50 hours a week for what? So I can die a rich man? Great... 

I have few hobbies, but nothing really that excites me enough to jump out of bed. I know I‚Äôm a needle in a stack of needles of people on here.

910,"Here is my current situation:

Married, 32, net worth $320k

Salary: $133k + annual bonus of $30k-$50k (gross) + $5k-$15k in stock shares (fortune 100 company)

Wife: $50k, state employee so the retirement package is above average

$90k cash in a checking account, $30k in a brokerage account (mostly tech and low risk ETF's)

One child (1 year old) ($2k in savings)

Max 401k contributions (current balance $120k)

$100/mo into child's savings account

$100/mo into wife's IRA (current balance $10k)

$0/mo into personal IRA, but with future bonuses will probably max this and my wife's out immediately each year (current balance $5k)

**Debt:**

$110k remaining on house (about $90k in equity)

$6k remaining on car (2018)

Other car is paid off (2015)

&amp;#x200B;

After all expenses are paid each month, we will net about $3,500 after my recent promotion.

For several years now, I have had my eyes set on a Rolex that will run approximately $10k, more or less as a ""pipe dream"" item that I would one day acquire once I felt like I had truly earned it. Even though I had money in my account to cover it for years now, I wanted to tie the purchase to an important event in my life (ideally, a career milestone). Well, I very recently received a huge promotion and raise (\~47%), so I'm thinking if not now, then probably never as I doubt there would be a career milestone (short of retirement) this large in my future, and I would be ok with that. For a long time now I have been extremely hard on myself in attempt to ""climb the corporate ladder"" and I feel like I'm finally relaxed and in a position where, if I never got promoted again, I would be perfectly happy as I live in a low COL area so grossing $200k feels like a small fortune, especially at 32.

With that said, I can't fight the hesitation to pull the trigger on the watch. Setting the notion of spending that much on a single item aside, should I be feeling guilt? In my current financial situation, can I ""afford"" this watch? I understand that the $10k will objectively be better spent invested, but I'm trying to balance saving with living my life and rewarding myself for an enormous promotion with an item I've been eyeing for a while. Additionally, the thought of spending that much on a watch of all things may seem ludicrous to some of you, and I get that, but we all have our dreams in life. I tell myself that this will last forever so the $10k distributed over the lifetime of the watch makes it a little easier to swallow. Thanks in advance for your input!",30Nov2020,1
911,"I do not have [vitiligo](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/vitiligo/), nor do I personally know anyone *with* vitiligo, so I sort of feel like I'm entrenching on a moral (ethical?) boundary (?) by including it in my art concentration.

My concentration is based on exploring **what makes me uncomfortable**. I know that sounds bad, but let me explain this piece in particular.

So here's what I have drafted so far in this piece:

* Woman in a modeling pose- portrait only. No clothes, but no nudity either- shoulders up. One of her eyes is technically 2 eyes that's conjoined together- her pupils are also conjoined as well (think the mid-process of mitosis).
* [Mutated flower](https://www.google.com/search?q=mutated+flowers&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS826US826&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk000zSe_JK4PCzGyjbQwfHHoXXLbng:1606770086515&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=5A50J4ZCi2qcAM%252C1y4hwf_KbYVloM%252C_&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kRFVlYMn2fi13TSq6NezPIj_Npm9g&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjA3feBlavtAhUCLKwKHTP3DN4Q9QF6BAgHECU&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=947#imgrc=5A50J4ZCi2qcAM) covering her other eye.
* Butterfly (or moth) with genetic discoloration of some sort- still undecided.
* Probably fungi growing here and there, from her hair and her skin.

So far, it kinda sounds like a lot but it's actually not. Her skin, aside from the fungi, is mostly... Uninteresting? It leaves a lot to be desired, in my opinion. I plan to add more of the flowers since it was what inspired this piece. 

The theme around this particular piece is that despite these mutations making it hard for me to look at certain things, it's equally hard to look away (kind of like seeing someone die in front of you) and in some cases, is still beautiful despite making me uncomfortable. 

(eg. the flowers make me feel incredibly uncomfortable, but I can't look away. Butterflies and moths make me super uncomfortable (mutations added to keep with the theme) but I can't look away either. Butterflies also have gorgeous patterns, and certain moth species are objectively pretty as well, but they're **not** for me. The person is there mostly because I like drawing people and to add to the ""beauty"" aspect of this particular piece.)

So I was wondering if I should include vitiligo to keep with 1/2 of the theme: including mutations. 

I do not find vitiligo disgusting or weird and would NEVER shame anyone for having that condition, but I was wondering if it would be offensive/ ignorant.

I have no bad intentions, but it could still be misconstrued/ be in bad taste/ still make others feel negative about my inclusion of vitiligo. I don't want the inclusion of vitiligo in this piece to be interpreted as vitiligo being an ugly/ disgusting/ gross mutation/ condition. I don't want to inadvertently add to any preexisting stigmas.

But I also want to add more to my piece, and the biggest ""negative space"" is the woman's skin (sans shrooms, but I don't know if I want to add that to the final sketch).

So: would including vitiligo in my piece be offensive/ ignorant on my part?",30Nov2020,1

913,"For context, I was a freshman when I met this best friend (I'll call her Jess (a Junior when I met her)) and I am a Junior typing this right now. I had a rough middle school experience and I joined Theatre class to try and meet some friendly people. 

It started off great to be honest, everyone was very kind and I felt so welcome there. I got to know Jess very well, probably because she was dating one of the only friends I had in middle school. We talked pretty much all of the time, whenever we had the chance in school, and quite often on Snapchat (quite often past 12am). Around a couple of months after I met her, Jess's boyfriend dumped her. I was on her side of it all, she was sad for ages and accusatory towards the ex. 

A few months after the breakup, all was well. We were both in the winter musical (I was in the crew but whatever), and we had just finished one of the last rehearsals. We hugged each other and said bye. We texted each other for awhile after that. All was good. I was happy. 

When I saw her tomorrow, something was off. I could clearly see that she was ignoring me. After multiple failed attempts at talking to her, I got super worried. Did I do something wrong? Is she okay? Later that day I texted her, something along the lines of ""is everything alright?"" she said she was fine and just stressed about the show or something. I believe her. 

Over the next few days, still nothing. It hurt. The final blow was when I looked on Instagram and saw a ton of photos with another cast member (a guy). For the sake of time, ill just say they started dating and I was thrown aside like a piece of trash (that hurt to write). We never really talked since. I did, however, have to see her every day for the rest of Freshman, and Sophmore year of high school. Now that she has graduated and It has nearly been exactly two years since we talked. My question is, I really want to get closure and hear the reason why she ghosted me, is it a bad idea to question her? Happy to answer questions! 

TLDR; My first best friend ghosted me two years ago, should I confront her and ask why?",30Nov2020,1

I hate myself. So I thought I was a little, turned out not to be the situation, it's just me Tring to find an escape. I know that that is basically age regression, but for me it's me looking not my mind.

Back to I hate myself. I don't know what it is, but I can't find anything to be happy about. I hate 
- the way I look, my BMI
- my lazyness
- the fact that I still do stupid mistakes at work
- I am alone
-  I always fight with my parents and aunt
- I don't get along with the people at work nor school
- my personality
I started cutting myself with a arts and crafts scalpel/razor I deconstructed, but stopped. I now just use hair ties and/or rubber bands to snap on my wrist, I still get hurt, but now it's just that one corner where I snap it. Why do I do it? It started of as mee trying to look for pain/pain reliever, now it's seen as deserved punishment.

I've looked for help, but no one ,,has time,,. 
The school counsler said I have to pull myself out, but When you think about it, everything in my life has steadied and I still feel nothing. 
I wanted to go see a professional Therapist, but when I made the appointment back in August I waited till the end of September to end up in the hospital (for a different reason) and had to cancel. I called them end of Oktober again and they said till wait till December to make a new appointment for the end of january. 
I've tried Suicide Hotlines three times where I was at my lowest point and wanted to kill myself. The first/second time I was put through to the uto voice (whatever it's called) and I was told to CALL BACK LATER?! Oh defenitly, I call back after my last hope for life won't even answer and push aside my urge to jump off the bridge to WAIT FOR THE HOTLINE. The third time I went through, but was still put on hold for almost 90min.
My friends know , but they don't really have advice Fr me.
I am even posting this on the Internet for HOPE.

I am trying to grip at every last feeling I ave, but it is all dissapiering (sp?). Can I be helped? am I in the wrong? Am I really the only person who can help me? Am I too Useless too?",30Nov2020,1

Because of quarantine, I haven't been able to see my doctor until tomorrow, and this is where I need advice. I don't know how to bring it up with my doctor or what to say about it. I'm gonna ask my doctor about a couple of other serious issues but I have no idea how to bring this specific topic up. I have a lot of the symptoms and behaviors, I've done a lot of research, and I don't want to self diagnose.

916,"An old friend (we weren‚Äôt massively close in the past) has recently got in touch with me after five years of not talking to say hello and see how things were going. It was lovely, a gesture I appreciated - I really enjoyed catching up with them and hearing about their lives. They‚Äôre in a relationship, live in a comfy house and seem happy.

They called me on the phone shortly after our catch up messages and didn‚Äôt get off the phone for a few hours, they were talking about driving two hours to see me and asked if they should tell their partner about it. (I said absolutely, and that they should bring her for us all to have a coffee and a walk - trying to create a boundary).

Anyway, they ask to call me again on Friday night... however, I couldn‚Äôt dedicate hours to a call as I was busy literally all weekend with my family - my nan‚Äôs recently passed away and we all wanted to be together to try and cheer my mum up.

However, they then call me Saturday day and ask to visit me without their partner on Sunday as she was away. I say I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm busy with family all weekend (as I‚Äôd previously mentioned). 

I think all‚Äôs good and settled until they then drop call me 3/4 times Saturday night and messaged me a ton whilst I was at a family dinner until I answered. 

He keeps requesting to call me, booking in when I‚Äôm free for a chat. But really, we weren‚Äôt the closest of people in the past and it‚Äôs been five years. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable having long chats to a guy in a relationship, whilst his gf is away. 

The whole thing‚Äôs making me feel really awkward, I don‚Äôt want to be rude but it‚Äôs getting to the point that I‚Äôm actively avoiding my phone - turning it on airplane mode and off wifi so I can‚Äôt be contacted so much.

How can I create distance from this person without being rude?? He‚Äôs a good person, it‚Äôs just too much.",30Nov2020,1
917,"I realize this is a controversial question...but I'm having trouble communicating to my family that I won't be visiting for Christmas due to COVID-19.  

They take COVID-19 somewhat seriously, but not seriously enough to not expect/pressure me to visit.  Like everyone else, I'm finding it really hard to navigate everyone's different comfort levels and feelings in the pandemic.  

We all know there is (unfortunately) a spectrum of what people are willing to risk. I feel quite torn because some of my friends are traveling to visit their family during the pandemic and other friends wouldn't dare.  So it's hard to get a read within my community of how to handle this conversation.  

I live in a metropolitan city where there is a high risk of community transmission.  It's challenging, but I came to the conclusion that I'm not willing to risk my, my family's, or my community's health.  There are some other things to note that make my particular situation a bit more complicated.  My dad and my brother struggle with addiction and my mom enables them.  Additionally, my father is a type two diabetic, making his health an extreme risk, particularly in COVID times.  

I already struggle with setting boundaries around visiting them.  It's hard to spend time with people who experience addiction and also those who enable it.  But over the years, I found a way to see them that is controlled and limited and helps me feel safe.  Christmas is usually the only time of the year that I see them (for 2 or 3 days).  But now there is a pandemic and with all of the risk factors I outlined, my father may pass before the pandemic is over, making me feel pressured to see him at Christmas.  I rarely speak to him because he is usually sleeping or incapacitated, but when I have talked to him, he has mentioned that he may die soon.

Any advice or resources you could share regarding how to have these tough COVID-specific conversations, particularly with family members who are not in a healthy state of mind, would be very appreciated.

I would also appreciate any ideas of how to connect with them during the pandemic.  For example, for Thanksgiving, I sent them a care package of diabetic snacks and a handwritten note.  Even though my situation with my family is less than ideal, I want them to know that I love them.  

TL/DR- How can I break it to my family that I'm not visiting for Christmas this year?  They are not in the right state of mind to take this news well.  In what ways can I still connect with them that are COVID-safe?",30Nov2020,1

919,"I used to work with my friend at my last job a few months back. When I worked with her there she was an excellent worker and person but her husband was abusive to her, physically, mentally, and emotionally. He would accuse her of cheating occasionally when she had to go to work and would force her to stay home- because of this she missed several shifts. 

I hate this man. He's a horrible, awful person- but she won't leave him. All I can do is support her in leaving him, but it's her own decision in the end- not mine. 

Now recently I got in contact with her and found out she was fired for a BS reason but her manager passed it off as a ""You had a lot of occurances in the past so we're just going to let you go"" (even though she had these absences during the covid period where they didn't count). 

After finding this out I also knew that a manager friend of mine in the same company I'm working in now but at another store needed to hire more employees, especially Spanish speaking ones. My friend speaks fluent Spanish, needs a job, and lives right next to that store- so I mentioned her to him.

She's now psyched about the job, but I'm worried her husband's going to be pulling the same BS he did before. My manager friend needs reliable people working for him considering how busy his store is- and now I'm worried I recommended someone who's unreliable against her own will. What should I do?",30Nov2020,1

921,So its a bit of a long story leading up to this so I'll shorten it to: my dad is kicking me out. I need to be out by the 1st of the year. So far I haven't been able to find a place that I can afford and I can't find a roommate either. Another issue is that I don't have a car so I have to find a place near where I work so I don't really know what to do. I need some adult supervision on this one.,30Nov2020,1
922,"This happened in the US, if it helps. 22F. So, last year, 2019, I worked in a dog kennel. I quit around August to go back to school. I had worked there off and on for 4 years. I got a late check that come months after I quit. When I went to go cash it, they said I couldn't and that it was expired. They told me to get a hold of my employer. They then handed me a copy of the check and I left the bank. I tried multiple times, calling, emailing, texting my old boss to get a new check. Nothing.  I didn't get any results or proper replies. About a week ago, I found that check copy and looked at it. On the back of the check it says ""this is a valid check and can be cashed"". The lady at the bank did not tell me this, so the whole time the copy of that check was valid but this was about a year ago. Can I go cash it?",30Nov2020,1

924,"I (18) recently got a FWB, 1.5 years younger than me and more experienced. We haven't done anything yet, but we both seem pretty open to going all the way. 

The thing is, I don't know if I want to go through with it. Not only have I not had a first kiss yet, but I am also yet to be in a relationship, so I'm not sure I want to lose my virginity before doing either of those. 

I was also raised in a very Christian home, which I've been questioning a bit as of late, so I'm still not sure if I want to wait for marriage or not.

As of right now, we haven't done anything and I can back out at any point if I want to, so I guess the question is do you all think it's a good idea to keep going or no?",30Nov2020,1
925,"We have been together for 3 years now, having sex for half of that time. In the beginning it wasn‚Äôt terrible, of course, but as all relationships tend to, it improved a lot - exploring new things, getting to know each other even better, and so on - more ‚Äútailored to my experience‚Äù, if you will. 

Recently, it‚Äôs been the best it‚Äôs ever been; not to go into the details, but it lasts a lot longer than it used to, and is a lot more intimate and exciting. I haven‚Äôt really thought much of the change in length, maybe thought it was because he‚Äôs now used to it and it‚Äôs more of a regular occurrence, but a couple of days ago he randomly confessed to me that he bites his tongue to prevent him from finishing - in a lighthearted, joking way, even laughing a little. It took me by surprise but I kind of giggled along with him and said that‚Äôs not okay, that he really shouldn‚Äôt do that and I‚Äôd much prefer he didn‚Äôt hurt himself, and it was kind of left at that. 

However, yesterday, a few hours after we were intimate, I noticed some red marks on his arm. I asked what it was as I looked at it closer which was followed with a ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, and slight giggles. I realised it was a bite mark, and I felt beyond terrible for not even realising he had been doing that. I gasped as I realised there was another one on his upper arm, but he tried to reassure me it was nothing and how it didn‚Äôt hurt much, how it distracted him and that it‚Äôll be gone tomorrow anyway...

I paused what we were watching and tried to talk to him about it, telling him how I‚Äôm not okay with him hurting himself for my benefit, how I‚Äôm sorry I wasn‚Äôt aware he was doing so but he refused to talk about it, which I slightly expected since he isn‚Äôt really one for serious, emotional conversations so I didn‚Äôt push it. 

I am really at a loss here... I‚Äôm scared he won‚Äôt stop, scared I won‚Äôt notice it happening again, so what I‚Äôm really asking is, what can I do?",30Nov2020,1

929,"I‚Äôm turning 21 soon, and while I‚Äôm sure that doesn‚Äôt sound old at all to most people, the speed of everything is troubling me. Ever since senior year of high school, I‚Äôve felt like my life has been on 3x speed. I had a mental breakdown during my first semester of college that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve fully recovered from, so that might have something to do with this as well. 

Most days, I‚Äôm filled with a mix of nostalgia and regret of past decisions. I look back at the past and wish I‚Äôd have done things like gotten more involved in high school, taken things more seriously when I was younger, went to that other college that accepted me, worked on my shyness, spent more time with x, asked that girl out, etc. 

For the past 5 or 6 years, I‚Äôve just felt like I‚Äôve been living a very passive and safe life. For college, I went to a safe school that was close to home, even though I liked the risky school more. I‚Äôm majoring in accounting, and while I don‚Äôt hate it, I feel like it‚Äôs a very mundane and soul-sucking profession. It just scares me that in 18-24 months, I‚Äôm going to be in the working world, and I‚Äôll never get these years back. I‚Äôve made friends and had fun, but I feel like I should‚Äôve done more while I had few responsibilities. This has been manifesting itself lately in things like obsessing over celebrities and music that I‚Äôve grown up with.

931,"**TLDR: I don't know how to feel towards my parents. They do so much for me, but at the same time I feel restricted as an individual.**

I've grown up in a moderately strict christian household. I wouldn't go so far to say that my parents have messed up my entire childhood. I was allowed to stay up late, eat late, have a phone, and a computer. They buy / do so many things for me and at this point I feel as if all they do is turning into a burden.

I didn't have a problem with anything until 2017. My older sister was kicked out because she had work on the same day my parents' wanted to go to church. That did not end well. My sister hasn't communicated with my parents for nearly 3 years now. 

Since then, it has always been hard to open up to them. They've always talked bad about her, which is so weird considering how open and caring my parents are around me. Always going out of their way to work hard to provide for me. Through a lot of thinking, I feel as if they only love me as long as I'm doing what they want me to do. 

To make things clear, I'm 20. I had to come back home for university; and now I commute. I went away when I was 18 to an out of state college to specifically run track and field. It was a division 2 school. My parents didn't want me to run because it would interfere in my relationship with God. In a nutshell, I still did it. I ran, I was happy. That might have been the happiest I was so far in my entire life. They found out, and now I'm back home. Go figure. They did threaten to take me out of college if I continued to run track and field behind their back. Even while I was 18, that did not mean anything to them as I'm still living in their house, and they are the ones paying for my university expenses. (They want to)

Like I said, they do everything for me. They own everything I have. They buy everything, even things I don't ask for. I've never had a real job before other than working for my mom.

I feel as if I have no individuality. It's hard to make friends. My parents don't want me to go to anyone's house unless they meet the parents first. It's like not I want to get wasted, party, or any of that. I just want to be my own person, but I feel like doing that would cause a lot of conflict; and that is one of the things that I want to avoid. But it seems as if the older I'm getting, the more unrealistic it is becoming.

Sorry for this rant, I honestly feel lost, and don't know who to talk to.",30Nov2020,1
932,"So long story short, my son has been a drone for awhile now, and keeps talking about writing Santa a letter for one. What he doesn't know is that ""Santa"" just ordered one online. The dilemma I'm in is that while mentioning gift ideas to my in-laws, the drone idea was brought up. They didn't know ""Santa"" had it covered, so they're buying one as well.

The good news is that they're completely different models with very different capabilities, so it's not like he'd be getting duplicates. What my concern is, is that when my son opens the drone from Santa, he'll be super excited, but less excited when he opens the second drone from my in-laws. I don't want my in-laws to feel like I set them up for failure by not telling them about the drone I purchased.

Should I let them know in advance and assure them my son will likely be super thrilled to have not one, but TWO drones on Christmas?

By the way, these are super cheap drones - as in less than $50 each. My son is also under 10 and has never flown a drone before, so having two drones might not be such a bad idea, as I'm sure there will be many crashes in the beginning.",30Nov2020,1

934,"Ever since I can remember I've had a really difficult time focusing on more than one task. The tasks I usually fixate on are things I'm passionate about which makes dealing with other responsibilities incredibly difficult. And if I'm not passionate about the task it eats away at me until it becomes impossible to accept the responsibility.

I know what I want to do with my life and I just want to focus on it... but that's been the biggest challenge of my life. I feel like everything else in life gets in the way and keeps pushing it back.

It creates a feeling of limbo where I want to be focusing on my passion for so long during a period of life that doesn't allow me to, that when I finally do have time to myself for my passion I have a feeling of overwhelming anxiety about working on my passion. Which leads to me not doing it, and then that fuels my anxiety that I should be doing it so I don't end up doing it.

941,"The main reason i want to move out of my parents house is because they do not respect me or my boundaries. 

They are very strict even though I have never done anything bad, i go to the college they wanted me to go to (i got a full ride my first year), work part time, and I do all the chores i am asked. (Side note - they have another child that they take part time care of which is my step brother, and he gets a free pass to everything around the house.) Out of all of my friends I am the only one with a curfew (11pm). I still have to ask permission to go and do things I want. Every time I go to see my boyfriend (24) (he bought a house literally across the street) there are issues that arise. He is the only boyfriend I have ever had and brought home.

It has gotten to the point where my mother has put her hands on me and we have gotten into physical altercations. She has called me a ""chump, hoe off the street, and needy."" She had me at the age of 19 and when she talked to the baby daddy he wanted nothing to do with me. She also had a miscarriage a year after i was born. She seems very unsure about my boyfriend. 

I believe I am a very responsible adult and can make well-thought through decisions in my life. The most trouble I have ever got into was skipping a study hall in my senior year high school. I was an honor-roll student, vice president of my graduating class, marching band for 4 years, school plays, was nominated for national honor society. 

I think I am to the point in my life where I do not want to be controlled by my mother and push-over step father. I am mentally and emotionally drained and i think that my parents are to be held accountable for that.

Does some of you have any advice? Or maybe going through the same situation? How can I stop this angst of thinking Id be forever single? (Btw I have an awful relationship with my family. They were always negligent, so things are not that great really).

Btw im not from the US

944,"Every day, I wake up, and drag my ass to a school I hate, waiting for the one period I can be with her. Then before I know it, the period is over and I just want to get home. But recently my school went back to remote, and my dad took my Xbox. Those were the only way I could see her. Everything looks gray. I want to give up. She was the only thing that brought joy to my life, (other than video games, but those are gone too) I want to give up, but I'm too much of a coward to pull the trigger, I have these thoughts in the back of my mind, ""Maybe I'll see her again, maybe my dad will listen to me."" but I know that's not going to happen. My dad has to bring in all my family's money, in a way I feel bad for him, I know he thinks he's doing the right thing, but he won't listen when I try to talk to him, he always says, ""You'll thank me later in life."" or ""You're too young to make your own decisions."" Whenever I try to give him a reason, he threatens to abandon me or send me to a foster home.

I can't take it anymore.

I want to end it

945,So this month I graduated college and I am fortunate enough to have a job available after graduating. This job is in the same place that I live and is actually only a few minutes away from where I live right now. The only problem is that I am currently living with my parents and it's mostly my dad but they are mentally abusive and manipulative and during this pandemic I have been struggling with depression because I have not been able to get away from that toxic environment. I have been considering moving out into an apartment here but I know that my parents will argue and tell me that I should just stay at home to save money and pay off my student loans. In my head that argument makes sense since I do need to pay it off but a part of me feels like it is not worth living with them. I am wondering what I should do.,30Nov2020,1
946,"Alright, I've been in a LDR for almost six months, and I have no complaints about my bf-- he's great and I love him a ton, I can go on and on about him but I'm trying to make things short here. The only issue is the distance, I live in the US and the distance between us is nearly 5,000 miles. I should also mention I'm 15, and there's no way we can meet right now. When we're older, we plan to, but it's at least three more years of long distance. For me, it seems like way too much time and I'm not sure if it's going to work out, I'm already feeling touch deprived. 

I have a friend that's started flirting with me a bit, he lives close enough so that we can actually spend time together. Now I do have some interest in him, but I don't know entirely if I want to pursue a relationship. It's also worth mentioning that the slight interest in him is nowhere near what I feel for my bf (If there wasn't a distance, there wouldn't be a problem). 

I've always wanted an ""actual"" relationship where we can actually spend time together, hold hands, cuddle, the whole deal. I think I might have a chance to do that, but I'm not sure if I should take the risk and break up with my bf, given that I feel a stronger way towards him (though also touch deprived). What would be the logical choice here?

TL;DR- In LDR but feeling touch deprived, someone local is an option, feelings for him are less strong but it would solve being touch deprived and it would feel more ""natural""",30Nov2020,1

958,"I met this guy when I was 18. I was on a trip with my best friend and I met him by accident one of the multiple nights we went partying. We hooked up and it was great, but we were both drunk and he seemed to be concern about a friend of his. Anyways, don't ask me how, before saying goodbye for forever, we exchanged our instagrams, and he happen to be from a city 3 hours away from mine. I hooked up with a lot of guys in that trip, but my mind always kept coming back to him.

2 years after that, when I almost had forgotten about him, we attended the same music festival by chance and he started chatting, we were planning on meeting each other at one of the concerts, but we never got to meet since he run off battery that night. Something seemed off to me since I never saw any proof he ever was there, and to top it off, the next day when I asked him to meet me he had to go in the middle of the festival to his hometown because something had happened to his family back in his home. It sounded strange to me, but I wished him the best and he sounded sincere when he thanked me and apologized.

Fast-forward to summer 2020, he messaged me out of the blue, saying that he was doing a trip to my hometown with his friends, I got so excited and he asked me to come with some friends to have some drinks with him and his friends. When we arrived to his house I was so nervous for no reason, there were already some girls when we arrived and it honestly felt that they asked me to bring my friends so they will have more girls to choose to hook up with. With that boy I really liked, we shared some gazes and we talked a bit, and the way he carried himself and his personality really made me curious about him. It seemed like that night neither of both had the courage to start anything between us, later in the night he disappeared to go buy alcohol for 2 hours and me and my friends were so tired that we decided to leave, so I never could say goodbye to him.

Also one of my friends that stayed later that night, told me when se came back, that he thinks the guy I liked was fucking one of the other girls that were at the house. The next day he talked to me saying that he was sorry for no saying goodbye and that if we ever came by his hometown we could hang out anytime.

After all of this story I just told you, I am confused. What I mean by that is that I don't understand if he is laughing at me, he really wants to get with me or he doesn't care at all. In some weeks, I was thinking of visiting the city he lives in since a friend of mine is working there and she asked me to visit her. I don't know if I should message him, I mean, I really like him (DON'T ASK ME WHY, I DON'T KNOW) but I don't want him to laugh in my face. That is why I am giving you the full story, since maybe if you see it from a broader point of view you could help me understand this boy that doesn't want to get out of my head and what should I do in a few weeks--&gt; CALL HIM OR NOT?",30Nov2020,1

Today, I got offered to work full-time for said contractor for $16 under the table for 40hours a week for at least 4 months flipping houses. Compared to what I am making now, this is a significant amount of money. 

**What should I do?** Taking the job would mean leaving the team that I love, and less time devoted to my nonprofit work and grad school applications. Contrarily, it would also mean quite a bit of money that I could use for my future goals and current circumstances. If I could start the job in January, that would give me the month of December to prepare to leave my team, adjust my nonprofit schedule, and finish my grad school apps. But I am not sure if that is an option. Plus, what might happen after the guaranteed 4 months is unknown. I have also put out quite a few job applications at places that are career-orientated that I am waiting to hear back from. If I end up working for this contractor, and one of these jobs comes calling, I would end up leaving him hanging, and I don't want to do that.

Now I know that us hanging out like that in the middle of a pandemic probably wasn't the smartest move, but we are around each other at work quite often.

My friend briefly mentioned that her sister hadn't felt well but never said anything about having related symptoms. My parents are pissed that her parents allowed her to come to our house when her sister wasn't feeling well.

My question is should I quarantine? My parents don't think I should since I wasn't directly exposed to the sister, even though I've been in close contact with my friend. I think I should quarantine because better safe than sorry but they think I'm just trying to get two weeks off from school(which I'm not, I know I still have to do the school work)?

I've felt a sense of panic these last few months. I never cared before, but it scares me to have only dated one person seriously. I've never orgasmed during sex and I worry it might never happen. There's also a serious mental illness he has never had diagnosed which causes problems for both of us and made me doubt who he really is.

971,"**How it started:** I attend a large public university in FL and arrived there from NY in August. I knew no one there and was attempting to meet people anywhere I could. While hanging out on campus, I met this girl and felt attracted to her nearly instantly. She is beautiful in every way and the kindest girl I have ever met by far. By November, I thought about her quite often after merely having an interest for a few months. I left FL last Saturday, 11/21, and only a few hours after landing at Newark Airport, the obsession spiraled out of control. Since I'm on the Autism spectrum, I am prone to focus intensely on specific people and/or topics, and this makes it more difficult for me to recognize social cues. 

**The problem:** I have not been able to go out much to frequent the gym or spend time with friends since I do not always have access to a working car (my dad's car doesn't work right now). NY has stricter COVID guidelines than FL and my community doesn't have much entertainment to begin with. I can't even play basketball at the town parks. I live in a suburb 45 minutes from NYC, the most exciting city in the country, yet I'm surrounded by bland shopping and suburban sprawl. My mom commutes and usually comes home at 5:30 or 6, so most of the day is spent at home, doing nothing interesting, thinking about her and worrying about relationships. I've had so many fantasies with her that involve us kissing, passionately making out, and me driving with her in a Mustang convertible in South FL, among other activities.

**Is there a way out?**: I attempted to FaceTime with her but she said she was not comfortable. I don't think she'll pick up a phone call from me either. She has been busy with schoolwork so I'll wait until Saturday, when finals end, to contact her again if I decide it's necessary. She says she would be comfortable on a video call with our group, but that signals to me she's not interested in being anything but friends, at least for now. I am at war with myself, as I do not know whether to give up pursuing her entirely or talk to her when I can. I am debating whether to reveal my true feelings to her or just cut my losses. I am lost, sad, and feel that few truly understand my concerns. I contacted another friend from school about it and he suggested that I stop focusing on it and talked to me about God. I'm an atheist, don't play those games with me. My mom suggested that I write down positive aspects of my personality, which will do nothing to help me get a girlfriend. 

I feel so broken. I hope I can find a girl I like. This is mental torture that is distracting and unproductive. I don't want to be a loner who can't even kiss a girl.",30Nov2020,1

We live around 20km away from each other and he offered to meet me somewhere closer to where I live, pick me up and drive me over to the trails where he lives and then drop me off back where we initially met at the end.


I took him up on his offer, we exchanged messages and names. I pointed out the fact that the weather forecast wasn‚Äôt looking too great for the day we had planned, and his response was that he would make his decision on the day as to whether he was going or not. The day came and it was pretty wet in the morning, but the forecast was set to clear by lunch time.

He messaged me saying that the weather was definitely suitable and that he was keen to go. As I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get to our meeting place in time, I apologised to him that I thought it wouldn‚Äôt fine up in the morning, and hence made the decision to go out shopping for the labour weekend sales that were on.


He understood why I didn‚Äôt think the weather would fine up and made it clear he was happy to arrange another time to meet and go trail running together. We exchanged our work hours and hence the times of the day/week that would work for a future meet. I left off saying that I would hope to be in touch soon.

meanwhile i just feel more depressed every day &amp; think ill probably end up ending my life one day but im scared to do it.

waking  up, get out of bad, make food, eat, clean after me, look for a job,  make more food, eat, clean again, go to shower, try to sleep early etc..  
every damn day.. im so tired of all of it.  
all while i have 0 experience with girls, and i hate going out.

i  used to make music and sell some online which made me a few dollars but  not much so i had to find a job but im so damn depressed i barley even  do that anymore, tho i do try to learn more about it &amp; improve..

only  thing i find comfort in is playing video games, taking me to another  world with no worries.. but with all responsibilities i barley even got  time for that some times.. or much much less that i wish i had..

just had to unload all this stuff.. see what others think, maybe they can relate maybe not

Then I went to college and my mental health improved a lot and I was actually making friends and studying a lot. But then Covid hit and boom in back at home. So I spent the rest of my time alone and in my bed. I guess I fell back into a depression and now I can‚Äôt do anything but stay in my bed all of the time. I actually do work part time and do online college but I‚Äôm still in my bed all of the time. I literally don‚Äôt have any friends in my hometown( I‚Äôm always by myself) so the only activities I do is just stay in my bed and not be productive. What can I do to stop this cycle?,30Nov2020,1

Because of visa reasons I stayed in our tiny apartment for 6months with occasional trips to the store and walks while my husband worked part time and was attending uni. I could of used this time to work on myself but I was lazy and didn‚Äôt. Iv always been relatively anxious person but doing such a big move made me build up a lot of anxiety. My first job I got was terrible and scarred me for life. I found it really difficult to make friends. At 21 I had a baby which also changed me and my mindset not all for the best.

980,"I'm so far into the semester, but I can't help but think I shouldn't be in college. I just graduated and went straight into college.

I really do love the course, but I've always hated schooling. It feels like I've never had a break and never will. As soon as I moved out I couldn't believe how wonderful it felt to escape the small town I was trapped in. I always think I should be out enjoying life for a year and joining next year, and this thought process was influenced heavily by covid, my field requires a lot of physical activity... but I'm completely restricted by everything. I can't do anything I want, the only I place that I know is safe is my work. That's all I do, and I love it!

I completely ignore my school work, it feels like I've just been given signs to give up as soon as I joined. I didn't have a place to work, then I didn't have wifi, had to catch up so I missed more work, then my computer doesn't use Webex, my email to communicate with my professors crashes completely (ongoing problem), my laptop has malware (Apps don't open, browser switched to Yahoo), my phone has no information for me to get in. It's never ending it's like it's begging me to stop, and I'm working so much I can't get around to fix it. With a second lockdown approaching, I can't seem to get it in to get fixed either. 

Now I live near my cousins, one happens to be someone in the field I want to be in. I'm living in their place, and I don't want much to do with them so I to them the least I can. I feel like if I quit I need to get away from them as much as I can, (I tried avoiding them before joining the school but it was my last resort)

My parents would be upset with me and I'd probably have to go back to the small town I was trapped in and I can't go back... I can't. My parents believe if I drop out of college I would never go back, but I absolutely love this career, how could I not go back to training for it? 

I'm really debating lying to everybody and telling them I'm still in school, I'm known as an honest person so I could pull this off incredibly well, I don't describe in detail so nobody asks me much. 

What should I do?? Do I just drop out silently, or do I try and figure this out?",30Nov2020,1

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where even her friend who has been coming over to spend the night with her cancelled last nights plans because she hasn‚Äôt been in her own home for a while and realized she needed to be. 

Breakups are hard and I understand, I‚Äôve been through heartbreak, and did go through it a bit before her breakup but I never once bothered her or anyone about it. I am more closed up but I do know how to cope and open up to my family about it so that helps me.

She needs to learn to be alone but know that it‚Äôs only because the world keeps going and everyone‚Äôs lives do too, so does her own life. I just don‚Äôt know how to communicate this to her without hurting her feelings especially as she‚Äôs crying like everyday.

982," I have two separate orders I made online and I am having trouble with them and not sure what to do now.

Company A - I ordered a $200 part for my motorcycle, got it and it didnt fit so not useable at all. I contacted the company and they said probably a tolerance issue and they could correct it, so I personally paid to ship it back even though it was not my issue, they corrected the part and shipped it back to me at their expense. I got it and was able to finally see how it would look, and hated it, it did not look right at all. I looked up their refund policy and says they will accept returns from 30 days from when I received it and a 20% restock fee, seems fair to me. I requested my refund on day 32 from the ORIGIONAL delivery date. I requested the refund only 6 days after receiving the part after it was corrected and in useable condition. My refund request was denied because it has been more than 30 days. Can I do anything here? I feel they are using a work around to not honor their own policy.

Company B - Again I ordered a custom painted $120 motorcycle part. It came with very bad runs and bubbles in the paint, it does not look good at all.  I have tried to contact the company via phone and email and I am not getting any response at all.  They have a 30 day return policy and I have been attempting to contact them since the day it showed up.

The unit that I chose is right on the corner of a busy intersection so I constantly hear the sound of cars accelerating, decelerating, speeding past the light, engine rumbling, etc.

This sounds so pretentious because it's only been a few days since my move-in, but I really want to move to another unit within the interior of the complex. Looking at my leasing agreement, transfers are permitted once you've been a resident for 3 months with a hefty fee. I'm willing to shell out the cash, but I'd love to just move into another unit much sooner. Will this rub the leasing office the wrong way if I make my request now to transfer to another unit?

I have literally tried everything from staying up all night and going to bed early the next day, setting my alarm clock early, etc. But at the end of the day, my body tends to want to sleep an entire day and then stay up an entire night. 

When attempts are made to force myself out of bed early in the morning, I'm in such a deep sleep that I am physically unable to get out of bed. It would take me paying someone who's dedicated job is to get me out of bed at 7:00 in the morning, and even still I'd be so tired that I would literally be falling asleep in my chair. I noticed because I put my roommate to such a task and he was able to get me out of bed and sitting at the kitchen table and even if I would stay out and about for 20 minutes, I would go right back into the bed and fall asleep deeply until noon.

For some reason, despite any efforts I make, I am falling into a deep sleep usually anywhere from 4:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.. once I fall into that deep sleep cycle, I have to sleep for 6 hours and interrupting it always fails. 

If I try going to bed at a reasonable hour, anytime before 3:00 a.m., I will lay there completely awake. I also have anxiety that gets really bad when it's time to go to bed. So it's hard for me to just lay down in the complete darkness and silence so that's why I always play a podcast in the background.

1004,"So I‚Äôm gonna keep this very to the point 

Got a cute girls snap right before covid lockdown and we started talking a little here and there. Unfortunately she got into a relationship before we ever really got to know each other. We still talked occasionally but I moved on. 

However that was short lived and once it ended she started hitting me up a lot and we discovered that we have a shit ton in common. This was probably two months ago. Ever since we have become really close. 

We hung out the other day and just talked about random shit for like 9 hours straight. 

And then a few days ago we were watching a movie and I put my arm around her and she seemed to be really into it. It was amazing just holding her. 

And after that date she literally blew my phone up. Like 3 snaps in a row, multiple texts, it was crazy. 

She‚Äôs called me cute and has drunk texted me that she wants me to ‚Äúfuck her into another universe‚Äù. 

She also nearly always texts first. 

BUT 

Sometimes she gets a bit distant and the momentum we‚Äôve built up kinda dies a little bit. Just when I think this is a sure thing, suddenly she goes cold for a few days. 

Usually it‚Äôs because she gets legitimately (verifiably) busy which is understandable but it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs not quite ready to move things forward yet. She has literally said she ‚Äúcan‚Äôt quite figure me out‚Äù.  

We also have not slept together yet even though we obviously want to which is kinda the elephant in the room rn. 

SO WHAT IM ASKING 

What can I do to move this towards us being in a relationship together? I‚Äôm usually a bit of a fuckboy but I have serious feelings for this girl and I wouldn‚Äôt mind spending the rest of my life with her. 

I know I‚Äôm most likely gonna get hurt so bad but I obviously have to try. 

She knows how I feel and she hasn‚Äôt invalidated those feelings which leads me to believe she‚Äôs maybe open to exploring them? But maybe that‚Äôs the problem because I‚Äôm no longer a ‚Äúcatch‚Äù. 

What can I do to give me the best shot possible with this girl?

 I‚Äôm not desperate but if there‚Äôs a way for her to be my girl, I‚Äôd be so thrilled to have her in my life. She makes me so happy.

1008,"Here some backstory (you don't have to read this part):
I recently got in an internet argument (like the juvenile I am) with a couple people I am vaguely acquainted with in real life. The only thing is, they don't know it's me. I saw something posted by a girl I go to school with on TikTok, and it really upset me.
We live in Montana in the US, which is a Covid epicenter right now, and the video was of the girls at a giant party, dancing for the camera and then being spoken to by a group of cops. I obviously wasn't at the party, but it seems like someone called the cops on it, who then showed up and scolded the people there and gave out MIPs.
I know that the party was recent, and not one that was filmed before covid stuff, because the dance the girls do in the video is one that became popular on TikTok just this month.
I saw the video from my main TikTok account, but then switched to my anonymous throwaway account, and commented two things:
1. ""i hate sophomores who have parties during the pandemic""
2. ""i hope y'all get covid tbh""
Listen, I KNOW that it was uncalled for and pretty horrible to wish the virus on them, but honestly I think that actually getting Covid can knock some sense into people who disregard Covid restrictions. If they care so little about harming themselves and others by partying during a pandemic, they can GET the virus for all I care. Maybe that'll teach them to be more considerate and compassionate.
So they replied to my comments, acting carefree and holier-than-thou.
To the sophomore party comment one of them said: ""it wasn't a sophomore party but I had a blast girl!""
And to the covid comment, she replied: ""i already had covid babe üíó""
They also made fun of the amount of followers I have on my throwaway account (my THROWAWAY account, on which i follow nobody, and post zero content), which is ten or so.

So here's why I'm here: I'm super pissed off that these girls are stupid and inconsiderate enough to be partying during a pandemic in the first place, and it only ticks me off more that they're replying to all of my comments with sarcastic ironic remarks. On top of that, I'm not close with any of the girls, but we go to school together, and several of them also went to the same elementary and middles schools as me. And I know that they have a history of being utterly, insufferably bitchy to basically everyone who doesn't look like them (skinny, blonde, white, etc.). They also made up nicknames bodyshaming a friend of my brother's, and repeatedly defended a friend of theirs who raped another girl in their grade. They called the rape victim a liar. They're legitimately pretty shitty people, even from an objective POV.

What can I do to piss them off in the same way they they're doing it to me? I know that's a pretty damn pathetic thing to ask, but I truly hate these people. I just want to piss them off, frustrate them, and/or inconvenience them in some way. I DO NOT want to actually do any physical or psychological harm to them, obviously. I just want to mess with them. I know their TikTok @s, and their Instagram handles (though I don't follow any of them, and some of their accounts are private). What is something I can do to get a rise out of them, piss them off, or annoy them? Directly or indirectly.

And just a reminder that we are all kids (ages 15-17), so please don't suggest anything TOO awful or shitty. We're all minors.

ALSO, please for the love of God don't say anything along the lines of ""Just forgive them,"" or ""Kill them with kindness."" I'm petty as hell.

TL;DR
What are some mostly harmless ways I can piss off/get a rise out of some really awful people? They don't know who I am, so nothing that's to be done in person will work, and both myself and these people are minors, so I don't want to do anything too extreme to them. These can be things I SAY directly to them, or DO to them indirectly/secretly. And suggesting that I kill them with kindness is useless to me. Thanks üíó",30Nov2020,1
1010,"To this day this gives me anxiety and makes me feel sick. I thought this kid was cute a couple years ago and noticed him staring at me and my friend and I didn‚Äôt know why. This continued until a mutual friend asked about who I liked or thought was attractive. I told them. However I did not say we were talking or anything just I found him attractive. Weeks later she sends a screenshot of the messages between them. It was a pic of me and he said how beautiful I was, he wanted my number etc. so he texts me and says hey. Immediately he tried to ft me but I couldn‚Äôt answer (I was at a relatives house). He ends up throwing insults at me like I went through hell and back and I look like someone threw acid at me?? Wtf? He also said ‚Äúand don‚Äôt tell anyone we‚Äôre talking bc we‚Äôre not‚Äù and that his sister was the one that wanted to talk to me anyways??? I‚Äôm just confused as to what all that meant. Later on, I‚Äôm back at my house. My friend as she‚Äôs on ft with him told me he said that just because he was taking to someone. Was someone else texting from his phone? We‚Äôre they joking and set this up? To this day I think of a bunch of scenarios and think about it so much and I feel like shit because of it and think maybe what he said was true. :( thanks for listening",30Nov2020,1
1011,"So, I share a house with a few roommates. It's not exactly my ideal situation, but it's the best I can do for now. We're all pretty much shut-ins and keep to ourselves, but there are shared spaces, naturally.

One of the roommates has been hacking up a lung the last few days and has me paranoid about covid. A lot of my family is high risk and I'm uninsured, so it's doubly a bad thing for me.

I'm not the most personable of people. Charismatically, I'm a step up from a limp noodle. I tend to handle things very directly and don't like to dance around subjects. That being said, I don't really know how to tell my roommate he needs to get tested and isolate as best he can gently. I'm seeking advice for that specifically, or whether it's even my place to do so. Thanks in advance!",30Nov2020,1
1012,"So basically, I have been working at my job for about two and a half years, since I was 15. Throughout the entire time of me working there, there has been one girl who has constantly been working there and constantly been nice to me. 

The problem is is that when I first started working at 15, I was about 5‚Äô1, high voice, baby face, with a low self confidence and a good work ethic. Everyone at my job just thought I was cute, because everyone else was obviously older and they called me ‚Äúthe toddler.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think much of this, I liked the fact that everyone liked me (although it was most likely just because I was small and cute in their eyes.) But, when I first started working, I developed a pretty irrational crush on this girl (let‚Äôs call her Ana.) 

It‚Äôs been 2 and a half years, and I‚Äôve grown a lot and developed a lot since I first started (I‚Äôm about 6‚Äô now). All of the old workers graduated and went off to college, but Ana went to a college only an hour away and because of the fact she has online schooling, she has been working a lot more. 

So, this is where I started developing even more feelings for her. For context, I began working a shift every Tuesday in order to take some stress of the lady who does the schedules (real nice lady, love her to death). After doing the Tuesday shift for a few weeks, Ana coincidentally started working Tuesdays as well. She always greets me whenever she sees me, and always makes little jokes whenever she‚Äôs walking past if she‚Äôs going to get something in the back.

Since she started working every Tuesday with me, I have started to think about her a LOT. It gave me hope thinking ‚Äúmaybe she took the shift because she wanted to work with me more!‚Äù But I know that‚Äôs probably not the case. At first, when she first started working tuesdays, I didn‚Äôt say much to her because I‚Äôm pretty shy and I pussy out on a lot of stuff because of past experiences. But I decided I wanted to grow some balls a couple weeks ago, and started talking to her as much as possible. 

When we talk, she is always smiling (however, this could just be because she is a nice person, but she doesn‚Äôt smile as much when she‚Äôs talking to other people so idk). She prefers to work with me it seems, there are some times when she asks the managers to take my spot and let me help her in her area (again, I could just be irrationally hopeful). But on multiple occasions when this has happened we talked for the full 8 hour shift about surface level things and made jokes a lot. She seems interested in the conversations we are having but doesn‚Äôt start as many conversations as I do.

I have (embarrassingly enough) looked up a bunch of videos on body language and things that girls do when they like you back, and she does a lot of the body language things, but we are kinda at work so not much obvious physical flirting goes on. 

But, she says a lot of jokes and says things like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna fight‚Äù and things like that when I make jokes and things so I just don‚Äôt really know what to think.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm thinking about it too much, if I should just go for it, or if I should let it pan out. But she is on my mind all the time now. It makes me so happy just to work with her and get to talk to her a few hours. I just want to know what you guys think about what I should do in this situation, because the confusion is killing me and I just need a little guidance from someone who has more experience than more or has been in my position. My main fear is the fact that she could still see the 5‚Äô1‚Äù ‚Äútoddler‚Äù that I once was, and that she still thinks I am cute for that reason but not a dating sort of reason.

If you guys have deeper questions that you think would help you understand it better, please ask. I need to know something so I can either get on with my life or be the happiest man alive if I have a chance. Thanks so much guys.",30Nov2020,1
1013,"First or all thank you for reading!

My girlfriend (19F) and I (19M) have been dating for a little over two years now and I am struggling with feelings that I can't shake. We met later in high school and we both knew that we were interested in one another. We came from different ""groups,"" but I just felt some way about her. Fast forward a couple months and I was sure that I wanted her to be a part of my life, but when I asked her out she told me that she ""wasn't sure"" a lot and that she was ""scared."" This was no issue for me at the time because I was willing to have patience if it meant being with someone I cared about. Eventually after giving her time and just being around I finally tried again and still I got, ""I'm nervous"" or ""scared."" Me being the curious person I am though, I asked her why it was that she had reluctant feelings. She went on to tell me that she didn't like the choices I was making in my life. Mainly the fact that I participated in smoking pot. She told me that if she was gonna date me that I needed to give it up. Me being younger at the time not thinking much of it agreed and decided I would quit smoking from that day forward. This was never a big issue to me, but the problem was that it soon became part of a list of things that I was not to participate in. Now, I can understand that some of said things she has said come out of concern for me being healthy, but for those who participate you'll know that me being a pot smoker is one of the lesser bad habits I could have in the realm of substances and you'd know that those friends don't just go away. I never got involved in psychedelics of anything harder than pot, but yet I that isn't okay. Aside from this however, there are other issues that I am struggling with. As time has gone on I feel as though the love I have for her is real, but just not what I want. She supports me and she makes me feel like I should be able to tell her anything, but she does this all while making me feel like I have to walk on egg shells. This is because I feel as though she is simply not ready for a relationship. To me it seems as though she is stuck in a very immature mindset. It feels like she loves me because I am her boyfriend and because she wants me to be who she wants. Not because she wants me to be the person I want.  She cries because she misses me even though I see her multiple times a week. She gets angry at little things and says that I don't care or that I'm just too busy for her because I can't spend all my time in constant contact with her. Even to the point that she will deprive herself of sleep just to talk to me. I appreciate that and all, but I feel like that just isn't healthy and I feel somewhat guilty for it because she then spends less time with other people because she is exhausted. What i'm trying to get across is that just as the  saying goes, if I jumped off a bridge she would too. That not bad per say, but I feel like she just isn't realistic about how being an adult works. She has never had a job, she doesn't have a license, and since high school everything has been school oriented, but as some point we all have to grow up and I feel like she just isn't there yet. On top of that I feel guilty because in the past we took a break for a month so I could focus on my struggling with depression and since we have been back she always says things like ""I don't know what I would do if I lost you"" and ""I will never love anyone, but you."" I am overwhelmed with emotions now though because on one hand she says that she supports me and that I can talk about anything, but on the other she makes me feel like I can't make my own decisions and guilty for wanting to make it final this time. I love her, but I just don't see myself being with her anymore. I just feel like I will be ruining her life because of this dependency on me. 

I know that is a lot and there is much more, but what are your thoughts?",30Nov2020,1

1015,"months ago in April (2020) i (F15) was in a relationship but my Bsf (M16)  (D)  convinced me that I needed time for myself to learn to love myself. I broke up with my  boyfriend. D then told me that he was in love with me and was so excited to date me. He did not consider how I felt or if I even liked him back. Obviously I was upset because he had convinced me to breakup with my boyfriend so he could ""get that off his chest without feeling guilty."" Months prior to this situation he told me that if I liked him we could never be friends. When he told me he was head over heels for me I didn't have feelings for him and I was very upset with him and felt kind of betrayed by him. we talked it out but later that night he  joked about some hurtful things that we have never joked about before. it really hurt me and i dropped him right there and didn't talk to him throughout the summer. Recently me and D have talked our problems out and he apologized. After getting super close again we both talked about how our friendship is really strong and both agreed that its more then friendship although I only wanted friendship from him. I made it clear that I wasn't looking for a relationship and he was totally on the same page. BUT he proceeded to tell his parents that we were dating because ""they wouldn't understand what was going on between us"" although the only thing between us was FRIENDSHIP.  so now his  parents think we are dating. (which felt manipulative) Fast forward to my friend groups secret Santa. I got D. The limit we could spend is $25 which I was grateful for because I have a job that I do once a week that pays $25 a week so its all pocket change when I get my paychecks. D has pointed out that ""if we were to live together he wouldn't let me anywhere near the bills"" because he thinks I cant handle my money"" I spend my money on makeup and food all the time but there's nothing else I can rly spend it on.  D suggested that we buy each other gifts outside of secret Santa and our spending limit is $50. D said "" I'm getting you something kind of expensive so don't spend more then $50 on me."" he implied that because he's spending so much money on me I should do the same. his paychecks are $700 every two weeks and mine are $50... so now I'm stuck because I don't have $75 to spend on him and because I had plans on buying my family gifts too. He tells me I spend my money irresponsibly but then implies I have to spend 3 weeks worth of work on him. I feel embarrassed to talk to him about it and I haven't called him for a while and have avoided his calls. with the combination of being annoyed, embarrassed and stressed I don't feel like I can talk to him at all.

What do i do? drop him? talk to him AGAIN about his actions?",30Nov2020,1
1016,"First, we are following all covid rules for our area and we live in a region with super low cases!


Our next door neighbours invited us to their house this week for ‚Äúappetizers and drinks‚Äù. My husband and I are disagreeing about what we should bring!


I asked my neighbour twice via text ‚ÄúWhat can we bring?‚Äù and she said nothing but ourselves both times. Obviously we‚Äôre still going to bring something, so my husband picked up a nice bottle of wine and a fancy box of chocolates.


My husband thinks we should also bring food but I feel like that might be overkill and not needed? We‚Äôre just going for an hour or two for appetizers and we were told twice not to bring anything. I think wine and chocolates are sufficient! Husband wants to bring an appetizer of some kind. Is that too much?

1019,"I'm in my early 20s, and I had to move back in with my mom due to covid. I always know my mom had depression, and she was recently diagnosed with it (and is also refusing to take drugs for it). Every couple years, when things aren't going well for her, she had said very dark things and tried to do very dark things with me, a child (back then).

I love my mom. I can confidently say that she is my best friend. I love watching TV shows with her, I love sharing memories with her. I love cooking for her, I love spending time with her. 

But I am now realizing that she has periods of ""highs"" where she is fine (happy, normal, etc.) and periods of very ""lows"" where even minor things make her irritated and scream at me. 

Since I have some income (though it is very low, lower than minimum wage bc I'm an intern), I was thinking about getting my own flat. I also need to start studying for a pre-professional school exam (LSAT/MCAT/GRE, not saying because I don't want to be identified), and I know I cannot do it. I also need some space.

But as much as I'd like to remove myself from her, it's really difficult because I also understand that she needs me. Let's be real, I'm not a drug or a medicine that she can just take and make herself be happy. I also don't think that I'm the bestest and the most understanding son. If she makes really annoying or irritating comments, then I make faces. I also stop talking to her when I am fed up. Those aren't necessarily my proudest moments, but I do recognize that I'm not this perfect person. But I do think that I have some kind of stabilizing effect. My parents are basically divorced, and she really depends on me for a lot. 

So I'm not sure what to do. There are a few things that I'd like to achieve, but they seem very difficult/unattainable.

1. How can I get her to go to a hospital and get herself treated? I'm no doctor, but I have read enough articles to recognize very prominent symptoms of Bipolar II. She. Needs. Help. But how does a person say this without telling a loved one that they are crazy? Because knowing my mom, she will think that I'm insinuating that she is. I'm not. I just know she needs help. But how do you say this? How can you encourage them to get help? 
2. Should I move out? I really could use some privacy. I could use some space for myself. I need me-time, but I don't have any when I come home. I'm an adult (it sounds funny as I type it but I am) and I need this. But I also don't want to somehow negatively impact her. What if she has dark thoughts again? It will be my fault if I move out and she decides to do unthinkable things to herself. 
3. How do I take care of myself? I'm tired. I work hard, and I have a very privileged life and I know it. But this doesn't mean I'm not tired. This doesn't mean I don't also feel like I'm drained. I feel like I'm being dragged into a dark place that I have been to before (also had depression and anxiety).

She gave us ¬£300 to cover bills during her stay. But she has been super annoying all throughout.

2. She runs the taps constantly, our water usage has tripled since she moved in and same with gas.

3. Makes a lot of noise when I‚Äôm in meetings (work from home). Been asked to stop and just continues. 

4. Annoyed me on my birthday, by force feeding us her food even though we had food from my favourite restaurant coming and then crying when we didn‚Äôt want to eat much of hers.

5. Moving everything around in the kitchen.

6. Take. Up the entire fridge with her food.

7. Fills the bin then doesn‚Äôt take it out.

8. Uses all the kitchen roll and washing up liquid (no idea how as we have a dishwasher) and doesn‚Äôt replace it. 


When she moved in we set grounds that once lockdown was over she had to move out.


Today when my partner spoke to her about it she started crying, saying she had nowhere to go and then proceeded to lie about:

- viewing flats (she only goes out to buy food)

- having no money for the hotel she was staying in (she owns and rents out several high end flats in the centre of London, we only found this out recently)

- she had no intention of moving out as she stocked up the fridge with enough food for another 2 weeks.

This is my second year of study and I‚Äôm not sure whether I should give it up or not, I‚Äôm basically failing anyway due to lack of motivation that I can‚Äôt seem to get rid of. Every time I try to catch up on my work I always fall behind and my professors aren‚Äôt the best at teaching, especially with online classes. I really enjoyed my course during the first year but I think the pandemic has taken a toll on my mental health and the stress of the workload is getting to me a lot. I‚Äôm scared of being a disappointment to my family but I don‚Äôt think I can take much more. Any advice would be helpful.",30Nov2020,1
1036,"This year in March I met a girl I went to school with a few years ago. It all started with animal crossing, she had bought animal crossing and so did I and so the story began. We often played animal crossing together, called now and then and those conversations could last 8 hours without a moment's silence. Okay months went on and we started to meet, we shared a lot of interests like gaming, music,... I thought she was the one for me but she had already made it clear to me that she really wasn't looking for love. After a while I started to introduce her to a group of friends of mine and she liked that very much. The cool thing was also that we could really roast and rust each other, this was really fun to do. But once there was a day when we met with that group of friends of mine and I was a bit quieter, I wasn't like usual and she started asking me if there was anything and then I just said ""I have feelings for you"". Then she explained to me that she didn't understand that at all because she had made it clear that she wasn't looking for love at all, but yes love doesn't stop you, does it? We kept talking for a few more weeks until our communication stopped, it went from daily talking to monthly talking and this hit me very hard because I could really count on her. It was also so difficult because we talked daily and then suddenly it was gone, I could tell EVERYTHING to her but communication stopped. 

For 3 months I brooded, did I wonder what I had done wrong? After a few months of not talking (3 months) she suddenly asked if I wanted to call her. And I thought yes I would, but okay I did and it was a very nice conversation, she said she missed our conversations etc... and I asked her ""why are you ignoring me for 3 months so to speak?"" her answer was, ""sometimes I do that with people"". I didn't understand this but okay I accepted because I couldn't do much else. A few weeks later I introduced her to one of my (guy)best friends, we started talking daily on discord etc... Also she became better and better friends with that best friend of mine and I started to get jealous (bad characteristic of myself). We talked daily on discord and after a week or two I was suddenly a bit quieter because I knew she was sending snapchats to each other every day, talking to each other what is really normal and what is really allowed but I was very jealous because I was afraid that I would be replaced. I didn't feel so good about this and my (girl)friend decided to come and go for a walk, of course she had said this to my (guy)friend and he really wanted to see it. He did everything he could to stop earlier at work so that he could stop by. After about a week I started to notice that my (guy)friend's behaviour was different: he was suddenly quieter when the three of us were talking, when I would leave to get a drink I noticed that he started asking lots of questions etc... When I got back it was suddenly quiet again. I felt bad about this and addressed this problem and the girl really didn't think it was okay for me to think such a thing (she got mad), we had isolated ourselves for a while and I explained that I noticed this. She said ""this is not my fault, you have to discuss this with your friend"", she also told me that she liked me a lot more etc... to make me feel better. I was much quieter on discord because my jealousy always came up and this certainly didn't have a good influence on the atmosphere in that discord. 

OK now we are a couple of days later and now I have found out that there are two of them calling, playing games,... and they are making up lies not to have to talk to me on discord or anywhere else and I really understand that they want to talk to two etc, but I haven't been able to talk to that friend of mine alone for so long without my best friend being there and now they are going to call two of them without me knowing.

&amp;#x200B;

I had confronted my (girl)friend today and she got very angry with me, she said ""My patience is really gone with you, I haven't called him at all, I don't call him behind your back, I'm done with your bullshit"" But I know you have, I have seen it with my own eyes. And now she doesn't talk to me anymore, I now feel guilty because I confronted them, I should feel guilty, am I paranoid, what should I do? I feel really bad about this and I don't know what to do.",30Nov2020,1
1038,"So I have a school job, funded through an outside entity by a grant. It‚Äôs a unique situation as I have to abide by both entities rules. I love my job. I love helping students. But the district I work in is straight up retarded when it comes to covid. So much so that I feel unsafe at times. 


Problem 1: In the building I primarily work in masks are recommended, not required. Most students do wear them but I have 1-2 students I serve who never do and another 3-4 that ‚Äúforget‚Äù them in their lockers and such. Contact tracing is a joke. I have been in contact several times with a student who has had symptoms. They do not require me to quarantine unless the student tests positive but they do not require the student to test before returning to school so even if they did have covid I would not know and be expected to work unless they got tested or I showed symptoms. 

Problem 2: I serve probably 15 students in this building during the week and then I serve an additional 8-10 students in the other buildings (masks required there). I also serve the virtual students as well so my case load is pretty high, higher than it was pre-covid. My work has gotten more complex and demanding catering to virtual and in person students. They really need to hire another one of me, but every time my position comes up they‚Äôre very pleased with what I‚Äôm doing and even though I ask they brush past it because I obviously have been handling it fine. Hiring an additional assistant for my position is allowed in the grant but both administrative staff of both entities (school and agency)  do not see it as a necessity. 

Because I don‚Äôt feel safe anymore as cases in our county are rising with no school closure insight... and the poor handling of covid by the district... I asked my agency what my options were. 

Option 1: I go virtual 1 day a week (day of my choice), in person the other 4 days and get paid my usual salary. 

Option 3: I got completely virtual for all work days but they only pay me for 32 hours worth of my usual weekly pay. 

Therefore I really have no choice but to stay mostly in person unless the school closes. I can‚Äôt really survive taking a pay cut like that and I also understand them wanting to keep me in person though. The type of thing I do is much easier and effective done in person ( tutoring, student support services, cultural advocacy, etc). I know my job will not be the same if I go virtual and would be letting students down 

I also can‚Äôt take a leave and go on unemployment because I also own a small ‚Äùside-hustle‚Äù type business and in my state if you own your own business you cannot get enough unemployment to live if you own your own business. I tried this before, as My salary is only during the school year, and it is simply not an option in my state. In the summer I find part-time seasonal work in addition to the side hustle and I survive until my school job starts up again. 

I‚Äôm really at a loss as for what to do...",30Nov2020,1
1039,"I don‚Äôt know what PreMed major I‚Äôm taking! I‚Äôm heading off to college next summer! I‚Äôm currently apply for UCI UCR UCSD UCLA!  Anyways, My mom is pushing on the fact that BS Bio is not the best major to take for my pre-med because she said that if I don‚Äôt decide to follow through with my dreams of being a gynecologist I wouldn‚Äôt have anything to use my major for! I‚Äôve researched and asked my cousins friends (they‚Äôre premed) what major is best for premed and they have all taken BIO.  My parents are both nurses who have studied in the Philippines. Maybe it applies only there? What do you guys think is the best pre-med major? And what jobs are options for someone who wants to major in bio and minor in math?? Thanks advance!!",30Nov2020,1
1040,"Basically I was on my E scooter and was hit by a vehicle in the bike lane. The guy was very apologetic and said he was a refuge and had no insurance but would pay for my damaged scooter basically gave me a big sob story I felt bad for him and was in shock so I took his word as I had his ID licence licence plate and a witness whom saw the accident. 

I reported the accident to the collision centre as I was pretty banged up with road rash and bruising. When I went in they said he had not reported the accident but they would contact him to come in and report it as he has insurance and a valid licence. I contacted the driver but he denied it happened and laughed at me on the end on the phone. This really annoyed me as I had to take 2 weeks off work because of this accident.  

Well over a month later and the police are saying he never came in to report it to get a personal injury lawyer they can‚Äôt see what insurance company he is with. I contacted the driver and he has no intention of paying for my damaged scooter. I contacted a personal injury lawyer and they said as I don‚Äôt have a serious injury it would not be worth there while to sue. 

So basically I‚Äôm screwed now when I was trying to help this guy out. I feel like an idiot now and should have just called the cops as my scooter is irreparable and I‚Äôve no way of getting the funds for a new one. 

Anyone any ideas what I can do I don‚Äôt want anything extra just the money for my scooter I‚Äôll even take the hit on my lost wages. Thanks",30Nov2020,1
1041,"This was written a few weeks ago but I‚Äôm still mad. I tried putting this on AITA Reddit and they kept deleting it. 

I‚Äôm (22F).  This is the condensed version I wrote to get my thoughts down, but it is still really long so bear with me. I‚Äôm so upset and hurt, so if there are any grammatical mistakes, please forgive me. My hands are shaking as I write this. 

This happened on Halloween. I went to my friends house with my fianc√©. The only people there were our friend group, so we knew everyone there. We hangout almost every weekend. Anyway, I invite my best friend *sarah* (F22). Something about her: she has been a shit friend since we were kids. She‚Äôs EXTREMELY spoiled, shellfish, and only cares about her guys friends over her girlfriends. I‚Äôve honestly only stayed friends with her because our brothers are best friends. She‚Äôs still not a good person and My friends/family/I think that...Yet, Sarah and I have been best friends for over 15 years. I mean I‚Äôm not angel either, but that‚Äôs besides the point. Anyway, she brings our somewhat mutual friend, her brother, and her brother‚Äôs friend, john*. Now, I met John once and thought he was nice. So I thought nothing of it. At the party, My fianc√© wants to leave and I ask if sarah and her friends can bring me home since I grew up with her and her brother, so he says yes. I tell him I‚Äôll be back at the house soon. This is where it goes down. 
John gets really drunk. Everyone is, but I‚Äôm not drinking really at this point so I‚Äôm sober pretty much except for smoking a little weed  (I do everyday) I‚Äôm talking to John in the kitchen and people are around, but invested in their conversation. He puts his hands on my waist and I move his hands. He does it again, same thing. I think he grabbed my chest but I was in such a state of shock that I don‚Äôt remember that part clearly. But, He grabs my ass, and I threw his hands off and said ‚Äúokay stop, my fianc√© was here at the party, remember?‚Äù And this a***** smiles and grabs my butt pulls me in and goes ‚Äúso what, let‚Äôs have fun‚Äù. THIS is the most vivid part for me, and I finally snap from my shock. I immediately freak the fuck out and say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fucking touch me‚Äù and cry and run outside.  Everyone‚Äôs asking what happened and I tell them. SIDE NOTE: I was in some bad situations with older men when I was younger and I was again a couple years ago (NOT my fianc√© EVER, just terrible people). I suffer with horrible anxiety, PTSD, and depression from this, among others things too. I wish I punched john in the face, but I was clear enough at that point to know that I could get in legal trouble if I hit him, so I didn‚Äôt. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm freaking out. Everyone is angry, wanting to beat the shit out of this kid, but no one saw ‚Äúit‚Äù happen because everyone was drinking. I‚Äôm so upset and eventually they get John to leave, but sarah and all of them leave without me because of what‚Äôs going on. So I‚Äôm stuck there until 6am the next day with my other friends until I can get back home. 





Here‚Äôs the main issue: I texted her at 5pm the next day because she didn‚Äôt talk to me the next day at all, and I said I was somewhat upset that she didn‚Äôt text me to see if I was okay. She said ‚Äúwell you don‚Äôt like talking about your past and yourself so I thought I should just leave it‚Äù. Whatever. Sarah asks what actually happened and I tell her. Anyway, since then my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù sarah has been saying things to justify his actions, and I quote:

 ‚ÄúJohn was super drunk and was putting his arm around everyone‚Äù (same as groping someone‚Äôs ass, right?)  

Said something along the lines of ‚ÄúNo one saw it happen‚Äù (does that mean it didn‚Äôt happen? Wtf?)


‚ÄúIt just doesn‚Äôt sound like something john would do ..like he‚Äôs not like that at all‚Äù


^when she said that, I told her I don‚Äôt know where would we stand if she didn‚Äôt believe me. She read my text and didn‚Äôt text me back. I texted her about 20 minutes later telling her not to respond, and that I need space. 

THEN today, Thursday, she called my fianc√© to talk about this while he and I were at work, and texted him saying she wanted to make up with me, but this snippet is one that made me particularly mad regarding John about my story: 

‚ÄúI would never put my friendship (with OP) at risk over something like this if I didn‚Äôt think there was something that wasn‚Äôt right.‚Äù

I blocked her on everything and I‚Äôm trying to distance myself from her. I have never been so hurt and angry with someone. I would never make this up. She knows about my PTSD and she‚Äôs clearly siding with this kid she barely knows. We‚Äôve been friends for over 15 years. More was said, but I don‚Äôt even want to hear her out now after reading what she said about what happened to my fianc√©. So, AITA for not wanting to talk to her?",30Nov2020,1
1042,So my gf‚Äôs abusive step dad was kicked out a couple months ago for going‚Äôs crazy and physical and verbally abusing my gf‚Äôs sister. He had a huge drinking problem. After a couple months he started going back to the family‚Äôs life again. And I think now my gf‚Äôs mom allowed him to stay at the house again. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with him bc he reminds me too much of my own abusive dad and he threatened me once when he drunk that he will kill me and stalked me. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable being at that house anymore and I always feel like I wanna throw up because I‚Äôm just so nervous. Should I swallow this thing eating inside me? Or should I tell her how I feel and work something out?,30Nov2020,1
1043,"On the 8th of December it will be 5 months since my kind, doting, loving father killed himself. I have spent the last 5 months going to work, lying down as soon as I get home, drinking, and going on walks when I have the energy. I graduated in May and my job offer in my field was rescinded due to Covid so I got a shit job and had been applying like crazy and working on various projects. That all ended when my father died. I feel like I haven't done anything meaningful since July. I've recently began seeing someone who is also grieving a traumatic loss but he's used his grief to go back to school, travel, pick up new hobbies, etc. It makes me ashamed that my grief has caused me to stay in bed, stop eating, and struggle to clean. I want to feel like a person again. I'm in therapy and its not helping. I go to survivors of suicide support groups and that's not helping as much as I thought it would. I just don't know what to do or how to get my life back. I'm deeply, deeply unhappy with where I am in life. I feel stuck and too overwhelmed to really do anything about that. How can I begin to move forward with real purpose and real goals when my current goal is brushing my teeth without sobbing?

1045,"He was a semester into college when he first started to fail his classes, then he skipped a semester, then he recently told me that he dropped out. He told me not to worry since he had been accepted to a culinary school. But I am worried. I feel like he‚Äôs being reckless. I don‚Äôt want to tell him to give up on his dreams on being a chef, but I also feel like he should be smarter about his. Since he is going into culinary school part time, I suggested that he get another degree, maybe in liberal arts/science part time and be a full time student, but he doesn‚Äôt want to. He says that he has ‚Äúconnections‚Äù and that after culinary school his friends‚Äô dads will help him get into the business, but I‚Äôm skeptical of this too. What if they can‚Äôt? Then he‚Äôll be stuck. Due to the pandemic restaurants stents hiring like that, and I have a feeling it‚Äôll be like that for a while.
