0,(25F) does anyone have any advice on how to overcome social anxiety? Like I have no idea how to talk to people. It’s easier online but in person my mind just goes completely blank and can never think of anything to say or how to keep a conversation going. I feel like it’s gotten worse since covid happened,17Sep2020,1

2,"So tomorrow is my birthday, I’m turning 21! I’m mostly excited for the cake but I need advice on something. Due to the pandemic, I’m most likely only gonna celebrate with my parents and brother and idk like I don’t think I feel comfortable inviting friends. To be honest I don’t really have much friends and like due to the pandemic I think it is safe to just spend it with my family?? Or should I invite them? My city is not huge but like it has high rates of covid. I think I’m just gonna celebrate in the backyard of my house lol.",17Sep2020,1
4,"I mean, I said what I said. My best friend is so absolutely enamored with her girlfriend that I barely hear from her anymore. Whenever she isn't at work she's always with her girlfriend--it's like they can't bear to be apart. I've even heard her on the phone with her girlfriend while she's at work and supposed to be, y'know, doing her job (we're coworkers, fyi). I mean no disrespect, but it's getting really old really fast that she keeps neglecting our friendship.

We made plans last Saturday well in advance and she pushed them very late into the day, around 6pm, and I later came to find out that it was because she wanted to spend the whole day with her girlfriend first and I was just an afterthought, even though we had plans first and she sees her girlfriend literally 24/7. 

She'll also bring her girlfriend along when we try and hang out, enough times that I've stopped asking her to hang out because at some point, her girlfriend is always bound to show up.

How do I get my friend back?! Or do I just give up?",17Sep2020,1
5,You see I was watching powerpuff girls z and then I thought huh buttercup is sorta hot and since they are the same age as me in this version I  thought it mean  no pain but then I masturbated so what do I do after guys what do I do,17Sep2020,1
6,"

There's a girl in my class, I'll call her A. A is very manipulative, she's doesn't have many real friends. To put it simply, I'm almost being held hostage to be her friend. A and I used to be good friends, we shared banter. Until she asked me out and I declined, this is where is went downhill. We shared banter but apparently I was going too far, she complained to the headteacher, I got called in and everything was sorted. She's asked to be friends again the same day I was called into the headteachers office, I said sure and we continued joking around. That process has repeated so many times, the headteacher has said the next time this happens, she will she what she can do regarding the police. How is this me being held hostage? It's not over. I'm a good kid in class, good grades and stuff so getting a visit by the police is somewhat scary, as you could guess I don't want it to happen. Now, I'm scared if I end my friendship with her, she will take the place as victim and I will get a knock on my door. It's 1am so I'm probably missing details , but I need as much advice on what to do as possible. Thank you",17Sep2020,1

8,"I share a 2-bedroom apartment with a roommate  in Illinois. My parents were planning on visiting US for the first time in March from India. My roommate decided to move out to a different place for 3 months. COVID happened and plans got changed. I had to cancel the tickets for my parents visit, lost my job for a couple of months and am still struggling to make ends meet. My roommate had already signed the lease at a different place so I couldn’t ask him to come back. After a month of searching for a roommate I explained my situation to the landlord and said that I couldn’t afford it and I would have to break the lease. His suggestion was to keep looking for someone for another month and that he would let me know if he would find one. Another month passed by and we couldn’t find anyone. I requested the landlord again that I cannot afford the total rent and will have to break the lease and will let go of the security deposit. He sympathized with my situation and said I don’t have to leave and that we could come up with something.  I let him know that If I stay I will only be able to pay for my side($500) not the total rent[$1000] to which he agreed and said it would work.I appreciated that he was understanding. 

The apartment is close to a university campus and the campus was closed for summer because of covid so we couldn’t find any roommate for 3 months till the end of lease. I paid my side till the end of the lease and it was fine with him. He never said he had any issue. My lease ended last month and he sent a mail saying I owe him $1500 for those 3 months because I was responsible. I was surprised to see this I called him and he said he is  willing to negotiate. I reminded him that I wouldn’t have continued if I knew that I would have to pay it later and that if this was his plan he should’ve at least let me know beforehand. He said he is open to negotiate and asked to think about how much I can pay and call him again in a week. I called him today and said that I just got my job back and I’m not in a state to pay this amount and after requesting a lot he says he will take half of the remaining amount $750 and that I can pay it in installments. 

It feels like I was tricked into staying and that there is no way I could avoid this situation now.",17Sep2020,1

My friend
I need to talk about my friend. So we usually play Fortnite a lot together but he has started to stop playing and I still play a decent amount, because that’s what I feel happy doing. Yet he always says that I no life it and it’s weird. Also he always calls me trash at the game when I’m not that bad, he’s just really good. So today we play and I actually do really good and beat him multiple times. He then says it’s not fun playing with me cause I’m too good(I’m usually not this good at all, I’ve just been practicing because the people in my games are really good, and I can barely win.He then starts saying “Who cares about winning a solo game!” Then, he hangs up on me and leaves after I kill him(I was proud of myself for doing good but not anymore.)

(This was written on mobile, and is a throwaway)
It kinda sucks cause he is my only friend and I liked that we played together, is there anything I can do? I talked to home and he said that the game is dead and doesn’t care if I like it or not but I enjoy it for now, now I’m kinda disappointed cause now I feel like I can’t play a game I like.",17Sep2020,1
10,"I feel deeply sad with my life and I'm unable to see how I can continue it. I have developed severe social anxiety and my stuttering has gotten worse til the point I only speak on my uni classes and spend most of my days withouth talking to anyone. My mother hates me. She's bitter and usually hits me and says the most terrible things I've been told. This was worse when I was a child. I burted into tears every time I walked to the bus stop before going to school. I know for sure she was depressed when I was a child because she spent most of the time on bed and was absent for some moths. I think it was when she found out my father had another daughter. I knew that too, but never told anyone. She was hurt and so was I. We're still living with my dad. He was in jail twice and now spends more of the time outside. There are days I don't see him and we don't talk that much and neither have anything in common. I love music and it's one of the things that gives me life. However, it is very difficult that it becomes anything more than a hobby because it's not popular music and I lack resources to produce, publicitate and any kind of support. I am writing an album right now and I'm extremely excited with what I can do. 

Notes:

1. I can't go to therapy or anything because I don't have insurance. 
2. I study languages, but stutter. I have been thinking of becoming a translator. I read books.
3. I have few friends that don't care about me at all.",17Sep2020,1

12,"My mam had a mental breakdown and I feel a lot of it had to do with living with my brother. He’s 30 and refuses to get a job or move out. He takes a lot of her money for cigarettes and doesn’t help out around the house. 

We ended up having to take her to hospital as she’d stopped eating and wasn’t able to leave bed anymore. 

She’s made some very slow progress since then with the help of a community nurse. She was starting to do really well but my brother knocks her back. He still lives at home and he shouts and gets angry at her and then she’s terrified. 

I tried to talk to him about it but he got angry at me and went back to her and asked why she was talking about him to me.

It’s breaking my heart because I don’t know what to do. I can’t sleep at might with worry.

He has his own mental health problems which he blames for his behaviour but I’ve had enough. My other siblings won’t really help. I feel so alone trying to handle it and I’m crying as I write this. 

What do I do?? I feel so powerless and I just want to help my poor beautiful mam and take her away from this. She had a very abusive childhood and then married an abusive man and now this. It’s horrible to have to watch this.",17Sep2020,1

17,"This is kind of long, but I would genuinely appreciate any advice. 

I (F17) have an older brother (M18) who just graduated high school. I’m a senior. 

My brother has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I understand what that means, but I can’t let that excuse how utterly rude and disrespectful he is as a person. 

About a year ago he started being rude to my mom. He yells at her when he doesn’t get his way or when she asks him a question, and he even accused her of tracking him at one point. He also physically FOUGHT my father, who is one of the kindest and calmest men I’ve ever met. He gave my dad a black eye. 

My brother did have one episode in which he wrote on the walls, smashed the lights outside the house along with a TV, a mirror, a toilet, and then tried to fight the cops that came to address that situation.

Ever since that one situation happened, I cannot even stand to be around my brother. He hasn’t changed, despite going to a clinic, going to therapy, and getting medication. HE DOESN’T EVEN TAKE HIS MEDICATION. He loses/quits every job he gets after 3-4 weeks, leaving me, my mom, and my dad to pay for his gas, his insurance, or just drive him wherever, meanwhile he spends all he has left on weed. All while still being a complete jerk to all of us.  

Not to mention, every conversation I try to have with him ends up with him yelling at me like I had been insulting him. He acts like I’m trying to attack him but I never am. No matter the discussion, I’m always in the wrong and I get called names by him for it. 

I know it sounds like I’m just complaining about my older brother like a typical teenage sister would, but I honestly just don’t like him at all. 

Part of me feels like I have trauma from the night where he had his episode, because I had been home alone while he was experiencing it. I also am always the one my parents go to when they need to rant about him or if they need help with him. 

I am genuinely scared of him. I have dreams of him hurting my parents. I have dreams of him hurting me and my younger sister. I literally hate being home alone with him. I want him to leave and I wouldn’t even care if I never had to see his face again. I don’t blame him for the mental illness, but he can’t be allowed to act that way to my parents who have only tried to help him succeed. 

I just want to know what I’m supposed to do because every time I’m around him at my house I get this really hot feeling in my chest and it feels like I want to scream and cry but I just go to my room and breathe it out. Sorry this is so long. 

TL:DR : My brother is rude, hurtful, and disrespectful to me and my parents. I don’t know how to handle being around him anymore.",17Sep2020,1
18,"Every single day, I see horrible news no matter where I look. It's everywhere, and it's almost inescapable. All types of social media I use have more or less devolved into a news reporting outlet, whether that be Reddit, Instagram, Snapchat, Tik Tok, or even damn Youtube. Whenever I turn on the TV, there's always some sort of 24 hour news cycle going on around, reporting on the latest scandal. I can't even go outside without seeing a political billboard, or without my damn neighbor trying to engage in a political discussion with me. 

Now I have always  tried my best to be a politically informed person (I've written several research papers in school about different political topics) and have tried to enjoy political views from all over the spectrum, however these past months have been completely overwhelming. Especially when I factor in the fact that *I cannot do a single fucking thing* about all the bad things happening around the world right now. I can sign petitions, send out letters to the government, go to protests, and donate $$$ to organizations... however, I do not know and might never know if my actions have any real consequences. Not to mention, sometimes I feel like I cannot even have a civil discussion with my fellow peers (and strangers on the internet to a lesser degree) that can change their mind on a topic in any way, shape or form. (Sort of related: I feel like many Americans, from all parties, like to dismiss truth as ""fake news"" if it doesn't fit their narrative-- or vice versa, any story that fits their narrative will fulfill their confirmation bias quota, so they are reluctant to do further research on whether or not something is truthful and factual. This makes it very difficult to have conversations with people because everyone already knows what they believe in.) It kind of drives me mad that I cannot do *anything* to help people in need, and having to be confronted with this fact multiple times a day with multiple different situations is just too much. 

How am I supposed to cope with seeing bad news every single day? I've already pretty much deleted a lot of my social media. Deleted my Reddit account, deleted Tik Tok, don't watch political videos on Youtube, only use Instagram for communication with friends and not watching people's stories... etc. I've paused my news subscription, found a nice indoor hobby that will take my mind off of everything... and yet the few times I do go on the internet, I am once again confronted with bad, horrible news. And sometimes I feel guilty that I haven't been keeping up with the news--sometimes I feel like I'm being purposefully ignorant and apathetic. Anyhow, I'm just tired and I don't know what to do.",17Sep2020,1
19,"So as a starter I'm sorry if this a long, but I've held this in for a long time and i think writing it might help? Anyways, the story.

  So back in 2017 when i was in the 9th grade when i met a girl named Miya (fake name) Me and miya didn't really hang out at first, in fact, i didn't like her one bit. As you see, i was focused on another girl in class, but miya always wanted to talk to me even though i was fairly shy and aggressive towards other people besides my friends. So i didn't think much of her at the time.

  Now, here's were i actually
aknowledeged her. After my school's play,  i went up to class with my friends to get ready to go home, when miya approached me, she simply asked me this ""did you like my part?"" (she was the main dancer, while i was playing trombone) I was a bit took back from this, as it was pretty random to ask someone who barely talks to you that, but i immediately responded ""yea you were probably the best one on stage"" I wasn't trying to be nice either, that play was kind of a trainwreck and she was the main one doing well. 

  Anyways, after this event i slowly opened up to her more and more, as something about her made me feel safe. Soon enough, i ended up becoming one of her closest friends, i thought nothing of it, but my friends constantly teased me saying things like ""you like her, huh bro? there's no way you don't"" i simply ignored them and went about my days, continuously talking to miya, more, and more.

  Now, here's were things changed. Miyas friend, we'll call her, Ari. Asked me one day if i liked Miya. Obviously my response was ""no bro we're just good friends"" as usual, like everyone else, she prodded on, but she said something that stuck with me. ""a gf, is someone you would do anything for, someone you care for deeply, i think you care about Miya alot more then you think."" That's when it hit me. She was right. I slowly realized i only got excited for school when i thought of miya, ever since i met her I've stopped getting in trouble, gotten back on Honors and much more. I realized, my drive for life....was miya. It was clear Ari could tell that what she said had me thinking, that's when she said ""your going to be going to the 10th grade soon and you might miss the chance of your lifetime, you should ask her out."" At first i resisted, but after a while i caved in and said ""fine! Ok? I'll ask her, then will you stop annoying me?"" Ari smiled and said ""yes I'll leave you be, but remember, ask her by the end of today""

  Now when i tell i was nervous as fuck. I was nervous......as fuck. I literally had anxiety all day and couldn't focus for the life of me, i kept thinking of how i would approach her. Calm and collected? ""Hey miya, i like you and i think we should be more then friends"" or go in cocky and bold ""i want you to be mine miya."" (God i was so weird lol) anyways, the time came and we were in our last class (the class were i just so happened to sit directly next to her) and i told her i want to talk, but she seemed hesitant, and after a while i asked her ""what's wrong?"" She simply said ""write what you have to say in my notebook."" I complied and wrote down ""i like you miya, i want to try and be more than friends with you."" I was shaking so much now that i think about it, i wonder how i even managed to hand it to her. After i wrote this, she took it and read, looked me in the eyes and said ""yes"" I asked ""what?"" (Dumb thing to say lol) she said ""yes I'll be your girlfriend."" That moment, to this day, was literally the happiest I've ever been. I felt rainbows in my stomach and in my brain. Even when we left school i kept thinking of what I'd do for her on Valentine's day.

  Now for the next day. It was morning when i walked in tired and went to my seat, when Ari said ""your not going to say hi to your girlfriend?"" I blushed hard asf but miya was silent. I was too because I'm an akward fuck. After some time she walked up to me and simply said ""sorry but, that was a prank me and Ari did, sorry."" Ari smiled and my friends laughed. I wasn't even mad, nor sad. I honestly wanted to die in that moment. Hell, even thinking about it now makes me depressed. Anyways, i avoided miya all day. She looked at me a few times and i could see she either felt bad or pitied me. I couldn't tell. A few weeks roll by and I'm still crushed and hurt. When she starts hanging around my best friend.... SPECIFICALLY around me. She was trying to make me jealous. I literally broke mentally, didn't react in front of her I just simply stayed quiet and pretended to be ok by Making jokes and goofing off in class.

  And that brings us closer to the present. It was near the end of the year when me and my old friend henry, were reminiscing on the times we had there. The final bell rung and slowly started walking down the hall when i seen miya. I simply said ""later miya."" And that was the last time I've ever seen her in person.

  To be honest i don't know if i screwed myself over, or if i did the right thing. All i know is 3 years later, I'm still in pain, and due to her i don't even catch feelings for girls anymore. Not even me being horny numbs the pain. I think about her often and wonder if i should maybe reach out and see if she's ok, maybe figure out why she did what she did. Anyways sorry for the long read full of grammer mistakes (i say 'now' too much) i just wanted to share some of my pain, maybe someone out there can relate.",17Sep2020,1
20,"Long story short, a friend of mine has had a rough few last years at school. We have both decided that its worth getting her back on track, so that she will be prepared for college, and also so that she becomes more academically advanced.

My worry is that she may give up because it is too hard, so is there anything I can do to help her continue? I've offered partial support with homework so that she doesn't feel overwhelmed in the beginning, but I'm going to try my best to help her become independent.

Any other advice from people who have had an academic low point and recovered?

21,"Posting here as my partner browses the relationship subreddits. My (F, 21) partner (M, 27) and I have been dating for about a year now and recently moved in together. He is in the tech field and makes a very good income while I’m still a student in college (aka very little cash flow). Recently, I’ve felt like I’ve been doing all of the chores with no help even though we had agreed it would be 50/50. Plus, I love doing little things for him like writing love letters, doing at home dates given the pandemic, picking up his favorite foods when he’s sad, offering massages etc. Try as I might, I can’t figure out his love language when it comes to giving however. I tried to broach the topic today since I have been feeling a little let down lately as I feel like I’ve been doing a lot of things for him but I’m not getting the same thing in return (example is he always asks for water when I’m int the middle of something so I stop to get him some but when I asked him to go grab something for me from the bathroom he refused). He does typically pay for food if we’re out or on Uber as he knows I’m trying to save money. When I brought this subject up, it turned into an argument and ended in him saying I need to pay half and half on everything now as I’m ungrateful and it’s unfair for him to have to do romantic things on top of paying for things. Am I being selfish in thinking he should be doing more gestures when he does pay for things when we’re out and about? Is it a fair trade off that given my student status I can really only pay him back in chores and home-made gestures? Help :(",17Sep2020,1
22,"I’ll be starting my career next year but I generally do not feel 100% in terms of my potential long term due to my liberal arts background. I have self studied finance, but feel that I would have had so much more potential if I had gone to a pre-professional school and studied finance. 

For context I would like to note that I’m a first-gen college student and literally knew no one who went to college. I therefore didn’t really know what I was doing. I do however go to a Top 20 school where the financial aid provided made it almost a no brainer for me to attend. 

Don’t get me wrong, I am very proud of where I will end up relative to where I started in life and the fact that I have a job lined up in this Covid environment. Im just seeking some reassurance or if you all think business school is the right track for me in the future.

32,"I'm a 17 year old girl, and I'm very scared over the thought of being around my dad. He is really angry and rude, and even though he isn't physically abusive, he is still very scary. He yells really loud, and I'm sure the neighbors can hear him. Every time my mom politely corrects him, he flies into a rage and starts yelling at her. If I get a B on a quiz at school, my dad gets very angry and lectures me about the importance of good study habits. I do have good study habits and I do all my stuff on time, it's just that the pop quizzes in math class are really tough. When the Internet connection is down, my dad screams really loud and literally threatens to sue our ISP.

The worst thing is that my dad behaves like wild when he is angry. He usually walks around the house wearing nothing but a pair of boxer shorts with super long straps in the front. When he is angry, he starts yelling and using vulgar profanity. He usually takes off his boxer shorts and then runs around the house, storms up and down the stairs, and barges into people's rooms without wearing any clothes. He burps and farts 100 times more than usual, and he aggressively punches the wall and throws furniture around the house. Sometimes when is too mad, he even accidentally vomits and craps on the floor, and when he does it on the carpets, it becomes a nightmare. Since he drinks milk straight from the jug and he is lactose intolerant, he often lets out massive diarrhea, and the whole house smells terrible for the next few days. He often takes something, such as a teapot, a book, or a hammer and smashes the kitchen table with it. He also pounds his chest non-stop and his face turns red. He often chases people around the house, and it just freaks me out. When my dad yells at others, he burps and farts non-stop, and he also looks like he's going to punch someone really hard. I seriously don't what the heck is ticking him off. It's probably just one small thing that went wrong and he vents his anger on everyone.",17Sep2020,1
33,"For my whole life I've made friends and then lost them after a couple years. I always thought it was because I was bad at picking friends and always chose toxic people. I'm now starting to think the reason I don't have any friends and can't keep friends is me and how I act.

34,"Okay so here’s the deal I don’t know if there is already a term for this type of cognitive thinking (I think its how we are wired) and I don’t know if other people have experienced the same thing:

Situation: you go through a tough spot in your life and there are professional, personal problems dealing with family and health problems and you used to like and be friends with someone prior to this time period. During this time period, you associate these bad feelings to this person that you once were content with. Then you disconnect for a while (years) - the tough spot has been mended . However, you find it hard to reconnect with this person because they remind you of emotions you had at that time and now you’ve associated your own life struggles to them when you think about reconnecting. Is it healthy to reconnect, especially if they are a genuinely great person ? Should you stay away, or this this bad too cause every time something bad happens you associate to someone you are close with ? Or was it indeed their energy that made the time harder for you?

I’m so confused, part of me misses the person but part of me is like I don’t want to open closed chapters of my life , life that I associate to them in an unfair way . Is there a cognitive thinking term for this association ? 

If anyone could help explain what I am feeling that would be great",17Sep2020,1

He was my best friend who lied and cheated on me for the past 5 years. I know that what we had was not real but I still feel so sad over the loss of it. He disrespected me so much but I still have feelings for him. I hope I overcome this sadness. I feel like i am mourning a loss of a loved one.

37,"For a bit of context.. I'm always running into trouble when they ask ""where do you work/go to school?"" which is bold of them to assume that's my main priority at the moment. I've been taking the path less traveled to make my own success story, because it makes sense when I've lived a life one can hardly call ordinary. By which I mean, I'm focused on learning; budgeting, time management, emotional regulation, balance between ""we, i, and you"", keeping commitments, realistic vs idealism, how to treat others, where I belong in the work force, etc. Sure, I was supposed to learn these as a kid but not everyone has that luxury. I want to earn my success, but not by immoral means. I want to fall in love, but not the kind that's only conditional. Some people might be comfortable at ""good enough"" but I refuse to settle. It's fine with me if people don't agree with the route that I'm taking, and surely if they seek to find the negative in me then of course they shall find it. I'm always open for advice which I take under consideration, but I never ask for opinions unless I really wish to hear it.

So in summary; what am I supposed to say when they ask where do I work or go to school? It's clear that I'm not presently focused on either, but I do have income assistance while I'm working on my growth and development, as well as my mental healing from extreme traumas. My credit is good, I've never missed rent, and the only reason I hate giving references is because I don't trust them to tell good things seeing as they do tend to find the worst in me instead of acknowledging that I'm sick and it takes time to get better. Changing a habit alone can take several months.. and I'm talking about changing so much more than just a habit.

I know some might not take this serious, and that's okay.. but to the people who do, I really do appreciate your advice. I'm very tired of being met with discrimination and prejudice. The only thing I want is a safe place to call home, so I can stop worrying about where I'm going to sleep.",17Sep2020,1

43,"So I’ll keep it straight to the point

Started talking to a cute girl I’ve had a few classes with in the past 

We actually matched on tinder and we added each other’s snap and now we talk regularly

She texts me first fairly frequently. 

Over the summer we didn’t talk much but when we did she would always be the first to text. 

I think as a guy I was trying to prove my value by being “unavailable” but I now realize that was kinda immature and stupid. 

I basically started texting her first and it seems like she was waiting for me to make the first move. 

We’ve talked quite a bit over the last few days especially and I can tell she always tries to look cute when she snaps me. We’ve talked about super deep “life things” and we seem to have a ridiculous amount in common. 

She also sends me these long snap videos telling me some crazy story and stuff. Giggling nervously behind her hands lol. 

Idk It’s like we both mutually realized that there’s a thing between us. 

I can’t stop thinking about her. 

We made plans to study together this weekend and I’m nervous as fuck. I can’t fuck this up.

45,"Hey all,

I'm currently pregnant (due in Dec). I come from a family of 7 and my husband has one brother. I have a handful of nieces and nephews who were adopted through foster care but their family dynamic is very different from the one I'm thinking about creating. So that's what I need your help with!

I never wanted to have an only child, but 3 also sounds overwhelming. Pregnancy has been extremely hard for me, so I don't want to be pregnant again. Which leaves us with adoption as our option for adding another child into our life. For those of you who have one other sibling, and that sibling having being adopted or non-biological, how has that relationship been? How can I foster the most loving relationship between my kids? 

My idea is to adopt a baby or toddler who is no more than 1 year younger or older than the current child, so they grow up together. What do y'all recommend?



Disclaimer: I have worked with foster children in a professional setting for 6 years, grew up babysitting my adopted nieces and nephews, and planned to adopt exclusively for the past 10 years, but this baby was a surprise, so I have had to revise my plans. All that to say, I am EXTREMELY familiar with the complexities of adopting and fostering, so I'm far from interested in condescending answers, but I do want honest answers from those who have first-hand experience in this situation and can offer me insight.",17Sep2020,1
46,"I'm a 25M that lives in Brazil and due to lack of maturity and some minor mental issues, I didn't manage to accomplish much in life so far. I finished highscool a few years ago but never even came close to getting into university, mostly because I have no money for it. I'm currently unemployed, living with my parents, and not really sure how to move forward. The only skill I can say I really have is being decent in English. Hell, I can't even use MS Office properly!  


I want to change this situation around but, so far, I have no ideas on how to do it. I'm essentially broke and low-end jobs can't really support a financially ok life; Not here in Brazil, anyways. And on top of that, the only thing that I really have as a goal is living in another country e.g. Canada.

47,"I'm not quite sure if this is a real issue or not, but I would like some advice. So I have this friend (let's call her Jane) and we've been friends for a while. Now, Jane isn't a terrible abusive person or anything. She's really nice and is a literal living meme, just an overall good person. We met in our first year of college and really hit it off. We would talk about dumb things and just have a fun time together. 

Now, even though Jane is a blast to hang out with, she's always had some trouble on figuring herself out and understanding how to solve issues on her own. So she would always ask our group of friends for advice. However, when it came to the really deep topics she would always go to me (since I'm basically viewed as the mom of the group). I would give her advice and support for whatever issue she has, but she never actually ""listens"" to what advice I give her. She just sorta goes and does what she wants while simultaneously ignoring the advice I just gave her. I find this mildly annoying since the entire conversation we just had was basically useless to her, but I can't really force her to follow my advice so I usually let it slide. 

However, recently I feel like our usual chats have turned from ""fun dumb time"" to ""therapy sessions"". This past year, every time she messages me it's either about some sort of issue that she has (that she can definitely solve on her own) or she's going through a rough time and wants support. Usually, I wouldn't mind giving support and advice to my friends, after all they're people I care about. But for our conversations to morph into never ending therapy sessions makes me question our friendship. As far as I'm concerned, I feel like she's constantly struggling trying to figure herself out, but uses people as a distraction to ignore the real issues that she's going through.  

For those that are wondering how she handles other people's issues, this is what she usually does. In our early years of friendship, I would occasionally ask her for advice for whatever issue, but she would either not give any proper and useful advice or she would somehow switch the issue to her and then I would be the one supporting HER.

...As I continue to type this my suspicion on our friendship deepens. There are times where I wonder if she only wants me around just so that she won't be alone or so that she can keep distracting herself from improving herself. I don't mind helping her when she needs the help, but I'm tired of being treated as a therapist rather than a friend.

49,"Just a little background, my husband and I live in the South. I run my own photography business and bring in about 60k a year and my husband works for a mortgage company and brings in around 48k. 

We’ve always wanted to move to the North, I lived there growing up and my husband fell in love with the area. 

We have a mortgage and we have some credit card debt that we’re working on, so we made plans on making the move in three years. We also have no savings (we got married awhile back and haven’t been able to get them going again) 

Well, my husbands dream job in the North pretty much fell into him lap. My dad happened to run into a old work buddy who works for a mortgage company up there and within two weeks my husband was talking to the branch manager and being aggressively offered a position. They’re offering him 80k with a potential additional 12k bonus for underwriting. 

We’re currently waiting on the official offer right now, so this potentially is jumping the gun, but my mind has been racing the last 24hrs.

Here are my worries; 

1. If we move, we immediately cut out ALL of my income. Like I start back from square 1, my 12 year established business vanishes. That’s terrifying. My husband will be making way more, but it’ll still be a downgrade overall family income till I get my business going. I could try to get a part time job to help, but my resume literally ONLY includes me running my own business for twelve years, so I’m not sure anyone would hire me. 

2. We have FIVE animals. Which was never a big deal because we own our own home, but if they need him up there immediately, I’m having a hard time finding any rentals that would even consider that many dogs and cats (two golden retrievers and three cats). They’re our family, our literal children and it’s making me panic.

I felt like this was alright since it’s my life and not theirs but today I was talking with my mum and I told her I was interested in studying computer science and she began to yell at me. She spoke about how a lot of people she knows are already computer scientists and she has a friend that is one and who’s life isn’t that good apparently.

She yelled for a few more minutes about how my attitude is really bad but eventually she calmed down and stopped talking.

I am 21 and my dad has this great deal set up where if I go to college full time, work full time, and get good grades he will pay for it all and give me a car and stuff. He keeps telling me what a great deal it is and I realize how lucky I am but I feel like I’m drowning. I come home from work and want to cry because of the stress from work and I feel absolutely exhausted, I just want to sleep or do literally anything other than look to the grindstone. I haven’t attended class or looked at my grades in weeks. I emailed my professor a little bit ago and told her I was struggling and she basically told me to just keep chugging along. Today she emailed me asking if I had created an education plan. I feel like a total and utter failure because I know I’m smart enough to do well in school, and I’m taking really easy classes right now, but I’m just procrastinating and avoiding. I really just hate myself. How am I going to succeed in upper level classes if I can’t even do well getting my GED’s?

I was semi-interested in psychology, and all of those career assessment tests have always told me to be a marriage and family therapist or some sort of counselor, but when I expressed interest in it to my family I was hit with overwhelming disapproval and wariness. 

“Do you really want to sit in a room and listen to people’s problems all day? It’s just going to bring down your own mood and you’ll be miserable.”, 

“How could you help someone else with mental health issues if you can’t even handle your own?”, 

“Really? You have the chance to be anything, you could be a doctor or a lawyer or something that makes money. There is no demand for psychologists” 

“Yea I wanted to do that once too, look where I ended up” (college drop out &amp; SAHM)

“Liberal social workers don’t do s**t for anyone who really needs it. You’re too smart to waste away with the scum of this country”

Obviously I have some pretty opinionated people in my life and I recognize I can’t make everyone happy, but I fear they are halfway right in a truth-hurts sort of way.

One of my main goals in life is to be financially stable. It’s like, the most important thing to me. I don’t want to have a family or create a life anywhere until I am very financially well off. I grew up constantly on the brink of homelessness and although I know it wasn’t my fault I never want to let myself be there again. Because of this, I don’t want to pursue a job path if there’s not a demand for it. I don’t want to “Do what makes you happy, if you’re good at it you’ll make money” I want to find some sort of middle ground I guess. 

I was going to pursue optometry because I think I would do really well in the one-on-one environment. The medical field is always in demand too right? *financially stable vibe check* I loved my interpersonal communications class and I think that stable 9-5 work environment is something I’d be happy in, but looking at the education path I’d have to take.. it’s a whole lot of science and math classes. I’m decent at math, maybe even good at it, and I enjoy learning biology, but I feel like I would crash and burn in my physics and chemistry classes. If the education path is a good indicator of the career.. I would be miserable working with physics all day.

56,"My husband, me and our friend group are very very close. Never afraid to call eachother out on their bullshit. Until now.

One friend in our group started dating this girl, who on the outside is this loud, obnoxious, bubbly girl. We never thought he would go for her because she doesn’t fit the “type” he usually goes for. We are even surprised it’s lasted this long. The friend, recently bought a house and she weaseled her way into living there even though he said he’d never let her move in. She pays rent, and buys all the food. 

A few weeks ago we were all at an event and I drunkenly heard them fighting over a new diet they were starting the following Monday, saying he would kick her out if he caught her sneaking fast food around him or eating it in private. (She had gastric bypass and lost like 100 lbs and he’s naturally fit but gained a few with quarantine) so I thought that was a little off. 

Today I found out from a different friend who also happens to pay rent at the boyfriends house is that he makes his girlfriend clean, she has to take care of the puppy he just got and specifically told her she can’t take any pictures with it otherwise people will think it’s hers, she went to therapy yesterday and was freaking out calling her asking her why she wasn’t home to cook him dinner and to not worry about it anymore because he cooked dinner (with the food that she buys) and told her she can’t have any and needs to eat out.


My other friends and I want to speak to the girlfriend but not in a way where she would feel attacked, just to express our concerns and let her know that we see what’s happening and we are concerned for her well-being.

65,"Having a hard time figuring out if this comes from my inexperience, lingering insecurities, or if I'm some brand of asexual. I want to do things with men, sex acts &amp; the parts involved are attractive to me, but I cannot imagine myself involved. When other women talk about a dude's forearms or ass...?? Maybe my tastes are just unusual. I can't relate to that at all. 

What I find attractive is litheness, long hair or 'androgynous' features. I've only met a couple of men like this in person and they always blow me away. The word 'hot' has never crossed my mind, but 'beautiful, graceful, or elegant' has. I don't think my standards are too high. Nobody even understands where I'm coming from, they all like the opposite of me, super buff or even chubby guys with short hair.

I constantly feel as thought I put in a lot of effort into my friendships and relationships than others. I just want someone to appreciate me the first time around, you know? I shouldn’t have to explain to people how to treat me.. I shouldn’t have to be the one to constantly reach out first to my friends for the friendship to continue. This has been an ongoing thing since I was little.. even my parents treat me like crap sometimes but I just forgive them because honestly, what more can I do? If I don’t continue to reach out to others then I’ll eventually just be completely alone or hear from people every once in a while (I’ll probably have 3-4 interactions per month with friends honestly).

67,"Throwaway account, on mobile, etc etc 

First time poster, long time reader. 

The situation: I am a shop manager at a fairly large manufacturing plant and oversee several employees. I've been in this position for about 10 years and have an open door policy with my guys. They've always been pretty comfortable sharing personal struggles with me, especially if its something that could affect their availability for work. So far, it's never been a big issue. Until recently. 

I have a cowker that's been with our company for about 5 years. He's a good worker and a generally good guy, a little awkward but he's got a good heart. We've hung out after work and on weekends. For the past several months he's been saying and doing some things that I and others are really concerned about. 

It all started around the beginning of the whole covid mess. He called in to work to tell me he was running late. Okay no big deal. I asked if everything was okay. He told me he was talking to the police because some guys broke into his house. I asked if he needed any help and offered to let him take the day off to deal with it. He said no and came in later that morning. When he came in he explained that the guys broke in to spy on him. He said they got away by jumping into a lake near his house. Little weird, but whatever. 

Since then he's been talking to me more and more about how he believes the government is watching him, people are coming into his house while he's asleep, recently he said the government took control of an RC car he was playing with to ""make their presence known"". He's been standing in odd places around the shop at work just staring at the walls. Claimed our color coded safety chart is part of a mind control scheme. 

Long story short, he's clearly had some kind of break from reality. I'm no expert but I've been told it's schizophrenic kind of behavior. He has no family I can reach out to and I don't know of any friends outside of guys at work. I'm scared of how he might react to someone telling him he needs help. We can't just fire him for having a health crisis and he doesn't seem to be dangerous to himself or anyone else.

How should or could I handle this and maybe get him the help he needs?",17Sep2020,1
68,"Sometimes when it's quiet, my past comes creeping into my head and I think about how I used to be such an awkward jerk and make a complete fool of myself, or be downright mean to people or offending them without realizing it.

Over the years I'd always say or do awkward things or act silly since I didn't know any other way to get people to like me, and was worrying too much about if they liked me or not, which just led to only toxic people being able to stand me and just getting bullied and being a sad, miserable person who feels like an outcast but now I realize I was the one at the wheel and I let myself be asleep the whole time.

I guess the way I was shown by my family is nobody will like you and you're worthless unless you have something or did something impressive to show off, so instead of relating to people and making friends with them, I'd try to one-up whatever they were proud of doing, or switching the conversation to be about me, or try talking about some topic in a smart way that I really don't understand so then I end up getting it wrong and just offending the other person, like talking about feminist issues with a woman and relating some of the critical thinking I read on 4 chan.

I also regret all the times I put more effort into bragging about my own skills in person and on my resume, then when it came down to actually doing the work, my anxiety jumped in the way and I choked every time. I've lost clients and almost gotten a company sued by a client because I was more worried about what other people thought of my skills than how competent I actually was.

I honestly don't know if I am (or was?) autistic, but now I'm fully aware of all the times I've been awkward to people in person, or used facebook as a way to vent my anger, where everyone I know from school and work and people I've met can see. This even gave me extreme anxiety as I realized most people on my friends list had blocked my activity and I had no idea which ones were still my friends and which ones only didn't unfriend me out of politeness.

I'm in therapy now and am working on ways to be more present and personable, although when I do talk to people now (rarely) I keep feeling like I'm still doing this kind of stuff, but that might even just be because I can't forgive myself for being so stupid in the past and now I'm worried about making the same mistakes and going another 30 years without any friends. 

Either way I can't find any reasons why I should forgive myself for being like this, and it just turns into self hatred for why I have no friends and no career and no skills",17Sep2020,1
69,"I, 32F am currently single, last relationship was with a 52yo man, I didn't mind the age gap at all. We had a great relationship for a while. With as much modesty as possible, I'm pretty, he'd make comments about me being his trophy GF and people stared, all the time. 

Currently there's a 21M that there seems to be mutual interest.

While the gap is significantly smaller, I feel he's too young, but also like a hypocrite, I was fine with nearly double the gap because I was the younger.
Yes, I do realise as we get older the gap doesn't look as bad.

For context we live in a rural area, dating pool is limited, especially for men. Pretty sure he is trying to have me notice him. Made a point of telling me he's reducing his drinking to become a more mature man.

77,"I’m a 25 yr. old Female and I’ve been in a long distance relationship for a year with my 24 yr. old girlfriend. 

She’s my actual best friend, the most amazingly selfless, supportive, and positive person I’ve ever met. Admittedly, she’s never really been shown affection before from her family or friends and she tends to see herself as unworthy of love/affection/attention. Most of the time she just grins and accepts it, but since quarantine’s kept her with her family(who doesn’t know she’s out) she’s started having these mini-crisises of going into sudden boughts of deep, self-deprecation. 

She’ll say things how she feels she’s weighing me down or wasting my time. That she isn’t beautiful or a good person and she doesn’t deserve good things. But I always manage to bring the mood by reassuring we’ll get to meer up one day or if we don’t work out as a couple, she’ll always be my best friend. It usually gets us in a loop and I know it’s just cause she’s self conscious/anxious, but also because of her family and cultural religious/social pressures. 

Today she brought up how her family would hate her if she died this minute and they found all the “gay” things on her phone. To which I argued you can’t really be living life worried about when you die and what people will think. You’re dead and it’s sad, but ultimately whatever people think won’t matter to you. Which sounds like a horrible thing to say, but she and I often get into these looped conversations about how you cannot be scared to live your life authentically. 

My own parents don’t know I’m bisexual or in a relationship either, they are very religious as well. So I understand her there, it’s just in the US it’s obviously far easier to be gay than the Middle-East (even if being gay is legal in her country and honor killings are outlawed). Her being scared what would happen if her family found out is completely valid, but I don’t think we should throw away our friendship or discount our relationship’s possible future over distance and disapprovals. 

She’s expressed many times she wants to move out and be her own person, but always falls back on this “family is everything” mentality. At the same time, she constantly remarks how her family isn’t as open and loving as she wishes they would be. That they make her feel like a burden and a failure. I try to keep her motivated to be that globe trotting gay icon she talks about being. 

At the end of the day, I kind of feel like I’m selfishly holding on to her instead of handling her fears/anxieties/self-consciousness the wrong way. But it’s just so hard to see her go from an attitude of “I’m gonna keep telling mysef I’m worth it until I believe it” to “You deserve better” in a few weeks flat. Especially with this quarantine and COVID BS it doesn’t make it any better. 

Is there anything I could do better or am I just adding to the problems?",17Sep2020,1

He constantly always expresses how much popular he is than everyone else, he has a big ego, on many occasions yells at us, because he believes he’s in the right, &amp; even used to talk trash about me.

She was psychotic anyway btw) when confrontedbshe ülied again and said she does love me but needs more sex caused by her mental state and suggested an open relationship.  No thanks
I then got all my remaining trust together at the age of 20 and got in an almost 10 year relationship with what I thought the perfect girl.
She suggested an open relationship as well, and somehow got me to the point where I once tried swinging. While she had a threesome in the club, I got drunk and turned down a whole lot of gay/bi men (which were the only ones interested at me, which is natural as that was a sausage party).
That was basically the dying point of my last relationship.

The point is: Am I the problem? Am I so ugly and / or terrible in bed every woman I get with cheats or needs other men? 

Well as a result I lost all trust in women, and can't shake off the thought that they are all sluts, I dontget many chances, but I turned down literally every single one of the few I got in the last few years for that reason, also I lost all interest in actual sexual contacts, but still masturbate on a regular basis. Which is an act of boredom not arousal.

I don't know nearly as much as I need to about my major (which is Information and Communication Technologies) in order to get an actual work-from-home job, so I need something rather unconventional. I've considered something like Fiverr but I don't have an idea of what I can really sell.   


 Some skills I guess I could say I have are beginner editing skills (I know how to use some photoshop and similar programs) and a decent amount of knowledge building computers. Though it's more of a hobby currently than something I think someone would pay for.   


I don't need too much money. I'll probably be moving back to my university in the Spring if my classes aren't all online again.

We all watched Ted and refused to look up from his phone the whole time because it was Seth Mcfarlan related.
We went to hot topic and when we picked him up and brought it up he said ""did y'all seriously go to hot topic?... I'm not even gonna say anything about that...""
We all went to spencers together and he seemed very uneasy there. He saw a shirt that he liked but he refused to buy it and we think it was solely because it was from spencers.
He says he doesn't like something and when we ask why his only reasoning is that he's heard that it's terrible and if we challenge him on that and say it's a bad reason, he'll just stop trying to defend himself about it and change the subject.
He wont let us know the type of stuff he listens to or likes because he says it's private and he doesn't want people to make fun of him for it but then he makes fun of us for liking anything that isn't shrek or memes.

Last year my ex and a car dealer tricked me into co-signing for my ex's car. They told me that because we lived together at the time that they needed to verify my income for financing and payment options. So, I signed. I know it was dumb, and take full responsibility for not doing more homework to understand what exactly I was signing. Im owning that mistake. I was 20 and in the middle of buying my first house, so I was probably just signing whatever was put in front of me (however I did do the homeowner homework lol).

I've tried getting him to try to re-finance to get me off if (this was before the repo), but he knew without my credit impacting him, he wouldn't be able to. I tried getting him to sell it or something and using that money to pay whatever it covers and told him I'd figure out the rest, but he wouldn't do that either.

I dont know if its because I'm just a lowly co-signer, but I never got a repo notice for the car, or anything like that but now its negatively affecting my credit, so I guess my question is: what can I do to get this taken care of?

99,"

One of my biggest regrets in life is being nice to people who just did not deserve it. I would say to myself ""I wish I was more of a bitch to this person back then..."" and the rare times I did snap, I would look back and think ""man I could have done even more."" because I was always a doormat, and always felt afraid of the consequences of hurting someone. I would kick myself for not standing up for myself. 

I've transferred schools because of running away from bullying and harrassment and took abuse from  my brother's abusive/narcissistic ex wife. I finally told her off on facebook because I completely snapped and was so done from the torture she put my family through for nine years. But I was reprimanded and punished by the consequences. 

I'm overall an optimistic person who regularily meditates, does yoga and I've played the therapist role in many of my friends lives... but it feels lonely to not be able to free with my feelings as others are with me. Without getting too into details, I've recently been exploited and harrassed on a platform where I share my creative work. When I took my work down from the disrespect- hate increased and people got mad at me for placing boundaries. Recently I've been through hell with this line of work and the trolls and I eventually couldn't stop venting and telling people off , who were mocking my mental health issues and much more. 

But now I feel guilty for standing up for myself and exposing the shit I was going through because people always expect me to ""take the high road"" and ""just be positive!"" But I'm so fucking tired of being strong and quiet all the time.",17Sep2020,1

She is literally the kindest person i have ever met with the same appreciation for fashion and music as me. Her smile melts my heart and whenever i look at her i just want to protect her forever. She’s really a one of a kind girl and it physically hurts that i can’t be with her. She says she’s 100% straight but I also said that until the moment i came out as bi.

109,"I dated a man for 3 years who I was very much in love with. He cheated on me repeatedly, lied to me, ghosted me randomly, etc, for 2.5 years of the 3 we spent together. He got better, but I had started to resent him despite all the “love bombing” he did, so I left him shortly after our 3rd anniversary and ended up dating a mutual friend of ours 3-4 months later.

Everything was great between this new guy and myself. Awesome chemistry. Talked all the time. We are long distance but we fell in love pretty fast and hard and I went to visit him twice. Both times were absolutely lovely. (Meanwhile my ex berated me on the phone every single opportunity he got for leaving him, but that’s kinda beside the point.)

Here I am 2 months into dating this new guy. Last time I visited him was a month ago. As soon as I left, within probably 3-4 days, he stopped talking to me. He didn’t call me anymore, when he used to call me daily. He left every snapchat, text, and DM I sent him on read, no matter what I did. I tried to talk to him about it and he would shut down and insist he just needed “alone time”. He went to a strip club at 4 am one night that he was supposed to set aside time to call me and watch our favorite show together and lied to me, but I figured it out pretty quick and it became a whole argument.

So after a month of him not speaking to me, I decided to pack my shit and come see him for a few days to try and talk this out and see wtf his deal is. I am now here, in a hotel room, waiting for him to get off work in a few hours. I saw him before he went to work, and I just feel... sad. Empty. Like its my ex all over again, like I’m scared. I think I’ve got the “ick” about him, but I don’t know what to do; I went through a lot just to be with him and I don’t wanna give up, but I just want to cry right now. I want to go home.

He is competing for scholarship so that could be the reason. But, those whom he gives his assignments are mostly better students than me(Although I used to be a so called good student).

Once I had asked him, how much did he made by winning scholarship in college. But, Even before that he was weird with me, and saw me as a privileged guy(but others are also as privileged as me, like study in capital city since childhood etc)..

I can't really understand why he dislikes helping me. I have never behaved badly with him.

And, Another bad thing is that I am feeling bad due to it and stopped working hard like I used to do, which is toxic **** moment.

I want a mindset to let go of that guy from my brain. How do I shift my brain? I am totally sad for that shitty reason but can't stop being sad tbh.

Because of his behaviour, I haven't been able to do any assignments after that day. I am really feeling fucked up, thinking that  people don't like me.

I know becoming an entrepreneur fresh out of high school is a bit unreasonable, but is it possible if I start now? I want to start a SMALL business (selling homemade products, online store, etc). I will get a job to fund this + the future too.  I wish to have multiple income sources one day so I don't just rely on ONE. 

I am not expecting to be rich or making thousands a month right away, but to have stable finances and not go to college. As for why I do not wish to go, there aren't any majors that would both pay me and make me happy. College is expensive here in America. So, I just want to live a good financially stable life without the need of a degree. 

In the meantime, I want to keep my grades up, start learning a language (French!), and learn the basics of code/web design IN CASE I need some extra cash (and they are marketable skills.)

Anyways, am I asking for too much Reddit? I want to know if this future is way to unrealistic for a young adult.

 If you think of ways I can achieve this sort of lifestyle, please give some advice on how to start a small business, what I should invest time (skills?) + money into, how can I eventually make thousands a month/how do you make that much, (2-3k?) etc. Feel free to recommend some college majors that you think would interest me.

114,"Hi Everyone I really couldn't get the negativity out of my head so I thought I would ask what all of you would do.

&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated at 21 in May! It was super exciting. Unfortunately, obviously, COVID-19 hit and I scurried on home. I think I was prepared to have my mental health decline while at home, in isolation, but it was darker than I thought. Thankfully, I have my therapist who I signed up for, but I think the lack of friends to talk to in this time kind of hurts. Friends often provide solace and advice in addition to the professionals during hard times. So I thought I would reach out here and ask what y'all think could help my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated with a BA in Political Science and moved home. Unfortunately I have pre-existing conditions which really limit me seeing anyone minus my parents. I also went to a college out of state and most of my friends either did not move near me or are stuck in their homes too. But my friends are all employed. I have not found anything yet and honestly it kills me a lot. I know part of it can be blamed on the pandemic and economic state, but I can't help but blame myself and my choices. I loved learning about politics, but my friends in STEM already found work and have begun their lives. It also feels like the work they have is immediate and pays more. The political turbulence of the world makes me also very anxious-ridden, mostly because the changes I think should occur in the world, in my view, may not occur based on how the election may turn. 

  
So I sit kind of alone and barely talk to my parents occasionally. But the anxiety, depression, and boredom really have caused me to become a blob. I barely eat, I never want to leave bed, and I'm scared of everything and everyone, kinda. And I'm afraid that's always going to be the case, either because of the politics of the world, or because I made stupid decisions.   


I don't wanna quit. I wanna be happier. I want to build my own life on my own two feet. I want to make money so I can stand on my own and truly make some kind of impact. I want to make friends after college, and for the one to two friends I really have left, I want to be the bestest friend I can be to them. And I want to at least have a job maybe out of college that may not be the greatest or immediately as important, but at least I'll be more aware of my place in the world. (This is me trying to be as optimistic as I can)

How do I start now to get my life together?

I'm a 20 year old dude living in his aunt's basement (or garage) struggling to find a job. How in the hell do I even do that? I've put in quite a few applications for random places around town, but I never seem to ever get calls back. I assume I'm doing something wrong(I am somewhat of an idiot after all) but the one job I did have, McDonalds (almost a year ago, too, I made a mistake not lining up another job before quitting. And I wasn't even the person to sign up for that

&amp;#x200B;

As well, I feel like I'm having difficulty maturing. I know I'm mature physically, but I feel like I have an immature mindset. Any tips or tricks to slowly inch towards more maturity? I know that's open ended and kind of ""Well you mature when you mature"" or whatever, but it's like, what steps should I start taking to head towards that

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, I know it's way more common, but I have SERIOUS self-esteem issues. It's part of why I'm depressed, because I'm overweight and everything. How do I motivate myself to start losing weight? Or at least hit the gym?

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, just a few things. If this stupid post reaches anyone in the vast cosmos that is Reddit, I would be most appreciative if you could offer insight. If not, that's fine too! Either way, this sub is great and I'm glad I found it before ""re-branding"" myself",17Sep2020,1

118,"Hi friends! I’ll try to keep this short and sweet. About 4 months ago, I hired a consultant to help me with post graduate school applications. I needed help with all of the writing supplements, mostly, but was also looking for someone to hold my hand and challenge me a bit. So I hired this consultant that came really highly recommended. But it’s just been a nightmare since. First, he wants me to lie and write a narrative about something that didn’t even happen to me. And he keeps pushing for this topic and asking me if I’m sure it didn’t happen. Second, he just wants me to copy and paste my resume into his template. But I said I wanted my app to be mine, not a cookie cutter application he’s had everyone else submit. I want my work to be my own. Third, and this one was the worst one to me, I had started the application process a few years ago. I started the app process, but then got really sick, and postponed my application by a year. I had received two letters of recommendation. My consultant asked me to have them send me the letters because he didn’t believe they’d be good letters. I told him I wouldn’t have asked who I asked if I thought they’d write me bad letters. He then asked to see ALL OF MY PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM so he could “determine” how “useful” they’d be. I said this was highly inappropriate and I wasn’t asking them anymore because I didn’t want to loose their trust. Finally, one month ago, I asked him for a two week break to reevaluate if I really wanted to go through this process. It’s been draining on me. He said that was fine and during those two weeks he’d go over the new outlines I posted before asking for a break. And then sent me this long text about why I shouldn’t need to think about it using info about previous clients he’s previously sent me before. So I didn’t answer because... it was all about why I shouldn’t need to think about taking a break. Two weeks go by and I hear nothing. Radio silence. It was a hard two weeks finding out my grandfather is dying and my boyfriend broke up with me. All this time I’m waiting for my consultant to say “I uploaded my comments to your outline.” Two more weeks go by. Today, I finally shove all the anxiety this guy has given me down and ask him if he’s had a chance to look at my outlines, he said no, because I said “I didn’t want to go to law school anymore and I ignored his message.” I tell him that I believed I said I needed time to figure out if I still wanted to apply, not that I wasn’t applying anymore. And that I read the text but just took it as a reflection piece, but he was the one that said he would look at the outlines in the meantime. But I told him no worries, it’s fine! At this point I’m just so annoyed with him. But no, he doesn’t just drop it. He proceeds to say that when I didn’t reply to his “long, thought-out message,” he took it as a hint that I was putting things on hold. And if I were putting things on hold he wasn’t going to jump into my materials only to “forget them whenever I decided to return. And on that same note, it’s been a month and I still haven’t give him an update.”

So maybe I’m not the perfect client. But we’ve had one previous long conversation about how our communication is off. I told him then I’m willing to try again. All of the above has happened AFTER the conversation about communication.

Here’s the kicker. I’m **PAYING HIM ALMOST $5,000 to act like this.** I shouldn’t have to be so stressed every time I get an email from him, a call, or a text. This is almost feels like gaslighting and everything seems to be my fault to him. I want to quit using him. But at the same time, I don’t want to waste the thousands of dollars I’ve given him.

I'm in debt because of my parents. I financed 36/38k of moving costs, new furniture, upgrades and repairs for thier house they bought a year and half ago. At that time I was debt free after paying off my car myself and supporting them with 40% of my income and paying off 10k in debt I had accrued keeping them afloat. 2k of my current debt is medical, after that I've paid it down from the original amount to 18k. 

Sorry if I sound rude, but I'm really exasperated with people automatically jumping to ""oh he has debt and lives with his parents, he must be a frivolous kid leaching off his parents"". Im not. Its actually the opposite, i have leachy parents that raised me to be duty bound to take care of them cause ""family"" and it took me a long time to realize that they took it to an extreme, and still struggle to break the years of emotional control created by them  Every time i ask for advice I get comment after comment, ""learn how to budget, dont live frivolous and pay off your debt"". I know how to budget, I pay gas, food, insurance, phone, small amount to savings, and dump the rest to debt. I dont eat out, go out and party, have a fancy car or buy the latest technology so please dont say that.

My social life consists of occasional get togethers with coworkers. I have never dated, but I have tried and failed. I spend most of my time taking care of my parents or watching tv.

I am still bitter about it and regret being talked out of it.  Another opportunity has presented itself to me to move out again, however this time, while im interested, after mulling over the pros and cons, it doesn't feel like the first time and I always came back to the same thought that if i pass over this chance, I dont feel like I care about it. I have budgeted living on my own, and if I let a 7k loan go to collections I would be able to be ok, with 50% of my income going to rent and the rest being dividing up on my debt, utilities and other living expenses.

She did sales until I was 5 and then says she quit because I had selective mutism as a young kid. She doesn’t work, clean the house, cook meals, workout, see friends. The only thing she does is go out to eat with my dad, stare at her computer all day doing nothing, and read. For the past 15 years I remember she always sits on the couch all day. She’s too lazy to grocery shop and pick up more than a few things more than twice a month. 

I don’t want to end up doing nothing with my life. I actually am super motivated and passionate about school so it might shock you that I got a 1.7 gpa my first year of college. It also might shock you that I’m not dumb- I’d been wondering my whole life. I was just at my breaking point with adhd. I was able to get my D up in history because I scored a 98% on a 12pg essay that the teacher assigned us one month to write. I wrote it in three hours and the average was a 60%. I can hyper focus like this sometimes but it’s so rare. School work became impossible in middle school and I tried to fix this in college but it didn’t work because my focus was horrible. I couldn’t pay attention to the teacher for a second- despite me sitting their telling my self to focus and staring at the board. Adderall changed all of this. My social anxiety and CONSTANT overthinking is gone. I can focus, read, comprehend. I can walk across the street without my eyes darting in 373 directions. 

But I feel like I’m almost depressed now. The adderall was working great. I got it a month ago. But abt 6 months ago my mom snuck on my email and emailed the apartment me and two of my best friends at college signed a lease at.. and pulled me out of the lease. My friends were upset by all of the confusion this caused and my roommates still hasn’t talked to me. I could’ve handled the situation better- the apartment told me to get on the waitlist and said I could get back into my room with them. A month later they said I wouldn’t get off the waitlist. So my friends were kinda waiting around with no answers. Two weeks before school (after I got adderall) my mom said I couldn’t do school even online. So I had no motivation to start my classes if she was going to cancel but she didn’t. I want to email the school and explain but I’m assuming they wouldn’t allow me to start weeks into the semester?


I’m too scared to fully open up to my highschool friends about how screwed up my life is right now. Im still close with them and text them everyday. I feel depressed. I can’t get a job because my mom didn’t allow me to learn to drive because she didn’t believe in it I guess.",17Sep2020,1
126,"I just want to vent and I just want anybody's advice to what I could do.  
**I want to be able to discuss this with my best friend but I don't know how, he's very fragile emotionally and I don't want to make anything worse for him.**  


(Note we are 18-19)  I'm not the type to worry about boys, but I had a major crush on somebody, he liked me as well. When we were all hanging out one night he told my best friend he likes me a lot in private after he was flirting with me and showing clear signs, I was livid I was so happy, he's the only real crush I've ever had and I've liked him for so long. Then the same night my best friend told my crush that he liked me too. My crush said he'd back off, so now that's ruined. My best friend was even helping me with my crush. I probably sounds harsh, but it felt like a stab in the back in a way.   


Yes, I guess you can say I ""friendzoned"" my best friend but I want him as my best friend and nothing more. Plus I couldn't imagine him as my best friend, there's things I dislike about him and I just don't want to feel like I have to f my best friend! Also when love songs come on about anything close to ""liking somebody and not being able to have them"" he dramatically sighs sadly and skips it every time I felt bad, but I just find it annoying at this point. I can tell he's sad about wanting me everyday I just see the signs and It's getting weird for me.  


At parties when guys try to talk to me he makes them go away ""because they were being weird"". He flips off people who catcall me which I don't care but it's out of jealousy. I just feel a little controlled. He tries to get any girl he possibly can and doesn't have much luck, he's so desperate for a girlfriend it makes him depressed. I don't understand that well as I'm not desperate myself. I started to feel bad for him and told him we could go on a date, and It wasn't true feelings. I immediately changed my mind because it felt gross, not right, I didn't have feelings for him and I felt like a horrible person. I cut it off right away. I know that was a dumb, stupid decision of me. But what angered me a lot was prior to that he quit hanging out with me and started ignoring me and was being a total d to me all the time and after I told him about a date he suddenly wanted to hangout with me and be nice to me again?

I moved in with my best friend about a year later (now) because super bad things happened to the both of us causing it to happen, and I was trying to talk to somebody new, and I wanted to invite him over but my best friend didn't allow it because he said it made him depressed, I don't want to feel like I'm 13 again not allowed to hangout with boys. So I just cut off what was going on with that guy I was kind of talking to because there's no point in dating if you can't even see the person. And when he sees me with guys it makes me uncomfortable because I can just feel the jealousy from him. My best friend doesn't take care of himself, trashes the house that I try to keep clean, is rude occasionally, does nothing but videogames, and I feel like I should move out because It's stressful for many reasons and I don't know if I should or not because he's severely depressed now. I want to be able to start my own life without being scared of what's going to happen to him.  


I may be a total d, but this is sucking really bad. I just want to be able to like who I like and not feel bad and to be able to hangout with my best friend without me literally sensing his jealousy and sadness that he can't have me it's super overwhelming. I want things to be how before he told me he liked me before it all started.",17Sep2020,1
127,"Sorry there's a long story ahead before I get to the I need advice bit.

So from ages 7-13 (which is how old I am now) my mother has been a raging alcoholic who has made my life very difficult. She has only got physically violent once, where she tried to choke me (not that she apologized once she was sober, in fact she pretended it never happened). But I won't bother telling hundreds of stories of how my mother has made my life hell. I'll just tell the story of  what happened today.

First some side notes:

I have two siblings who also have to deal with this, though my mother rarely is mentally abusive to them. 

My parents are divorced, and I'm being to realise maybe my dad has been the better parent all along.

Anyways so what happened today is I go into my mothers room to confront her about her drinking (my siblings are at my dads house by this time, I don't go on thursdays) as I'm sick of her finding a way to blame her problems on me, hell she even says its my fault she's an alcoholic. I first have a five minute small talk chat with her before bringing up and when I finally do she says 'Well you should be more concerned about my health', to which I replied 'The alcohol is the thing making you sick', then my mother tells me I ruined her day, I just get up and leave I've heard it all before. Then half an hour later my mother calls me down and 'says how dare you bring this up, you have no right' to which I stayed silent. 'You are so selfish Jess, who are you to tell me we shouldn't get a dog' (we already have  four cats why on earth would we need another pet). Normally my mum swears at me, so that's a bonus for today. I then get and leave and she tells me she won't be having dinner with me as I'm to selfish and don't deserve it. So I'll be making dinner again for the sixth day in the row. I'm just getting so angry, I don't want to become like my mother.

So here's where i ask for advice, and no please nothing about going to social services, been there done that, How do I keep from hating my mother and How do I cope with her?",17Sep2020,1
128,"I'm a manager at a grocery store. I recently took a promotion and switched stores which is about about 35-40 minutes away from my original store. 

I had a customer at my original store who just seemed like a normal customer at first. Come in, buy a handful of things and be done. I'm a very friendly person naturally and always ask people how their day is going or just whats up. She would have a couple brief words, ask where something was.. Thats about it. After a couple days she started coming in more and more and started asking where everything was. Now just before I left she would come in quite often. 2, 3, 4, sometimes even more a day if I was working. Her record is 7 in a span of 5 hours. From my understanding she very rarely came in multiple times a day if I was off, at least that's what I heard from coworkers. She buys mainly wine and snacks, leaves. Rinse and repeat. She'll come up and say really weird lines about her mother(she is born in '97, I know from ID'ing her, and still lives at home from my understanding) being abusive, or how she almost killed these two kids that she babysits or that she's all of a sudden pregnant and not able to buy wine or ask me to run her over with my car.. Ya know.. normal grocery store convo's. /s

Also, a coworker(my equal) has now given her their phone number because they feel bad for her. So she has even more of an attachment to the store.. Completely unnecessary and unprofessional.. But it's whats going on.

Well, obviously I have felt uncomfortable with this chick for the past six months or so. She's actually one of the main reasons I wanted to switch stores. I try not to engage but if she asks me a question I answer it because its my job. And I also dont want other customers to feel uncomfortable if im being rude or what have you.

 Long story short.. A fellow employee told her I was transferring, yeah.. f#ck that employee.. And the customer asked me where I was transferring and if it were true.. I lied and said I didnt know. Well, she found me at my new store.. On my first day at the new store, which was Monday. Now she is saying she is staying in the town that the new store is located. Which obviously is a lie. She has also shopped at my original store since I moved from what I've heard. 

In the past three days she has been in a total of 8 times and she lives 45 minutes away.

As a guy, I am not totally freaked out in the fact that she will be physically imposing and dont want to this to seem like I feel like I'm threatened. But I have been worried the past couple nights that she'll break into my car and get my garage door open or something crazy like that. Im worried that I'm being watched. So its just unsettling. She could be, and most likely is, completely harmless and just wants to talk with me. But I feel extremely uncomfortable about this. It's legit freaky and concerning. Im also concerned that something will happen to my car or even more extreme if I try and handle this on my own.

I plan on telling my direct leader and their boss about it tomorrow. I dont know what to expect. I dont know even if we're able to do something about it. Anyone ever had a situation like this before? If you have any info on what I can expect, please leave a comment. Thank you for any input.",17Sep2020,1
129,"When I was younger (4), my older sister sexually abused me by making me do terrible things (12-13). 

It was a really horrible experience and it happened more than once. Last year, I confronted her and she told me that if I ever told anyone, she’d make something up about me. 

She also physically abused me for years as well, left me with cuts and bruises and even punched me in the face with a concussion. 

I got the courage and told my mom, she cared but seemed to brush it off. 

My mother confronted my sister and told me to get therapy and that she’s not discussing it. I asked my mother to kick her out, she’s a horrible person and my sister never apologized for what she put me through, mom told me she will not do that. 

Was it wrong of me to ask her, was it wrong of her not to kick her out?

130,"Hi friends! I’ll try to explain this the best I can. 

About 4 months ago, I hired a consultant to help me with post graduate school applications. I needed help with all of the writing supplements, mostly, but was also looking for someone to hold my hand and challenge me a bit. So I hired this consultant that came really highly recommended. But it’s just been a nightmare since. 

First, **he wants me to lie and write a narrative about something that didn’t even happen to me.** And he keeps pushing for this topic and asking me if I’m sure it didn’t happen. 

Second, **he just wants me to copy and paste my resume into his template.** But I said I wanted my app to be mine, not a cookie cutter application he’s had everyone else submit. I want my work to be my own. 

Third, and this one was the worst one to me, I had started the application process a few years ago. I started the app process, but then got really sick, and postponed my application by a year. I had received two letters of recommendation. My consultant asked me to have them send me the letters because he didn’t believe they’d be good letters. I told him I wouldn’t have asked who I asked if I thought they’d write me bad letters. He then asked to see ALL OF MY PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM so he could “determine” how “useful” they’d be. I said this was highly inappropriate and I wasn’t asking them anymore because I didn’t want to loose their trust. 

Finally, one month ago, I asked him for a two week break to reevaluate if I really wanted to go through this process. It’s been draining on me. He said that was fine and during those two weeks he’d go over the new outlines I posted before asking for a break. And then sent me this long text about why I shouldn’t need to think about it using info about previous clients he’s previously sent me before. So I didn’t answer because... it was all about why I shouldn’t need to think about taking a break and previous stats about how successful his past clients have been. 

Two weeks go by and I hear nothing. Radio silence. It was a hard two weeks finding out my grandfather is dying and my boyfriend broke up with me. All this time I’m waiting for my consultant to say “I uploaded my comments to your outline.” Two more weeks go by. Today, I finally shove all the anxiety this guy has given me down and ask him if he’s had a chance to look at my outlines, he said no, because I said “I didn’t want to go to law school anymore and I ignored his message.” I tell him that I believed I said I needed time to figure out if I still wanted to apply, not that I wasn’t applying anymore. And that I read the text but just took it as a reflection piece, but he was the one that said he would look at the outlines in the meantime. But I told him no worries, it’s fine! At this point I’m just so annoyed with him. But no, he doesn’t just drop it. He proceeds to say that when I didn’t reply to his “long, thought-out message,” he took it as a hint that I was putting things on hold. And if I were putting things on hold he wasn’t going to jump into my materials only to “forget them whenever I decided to return. And on that same note, it’s been a month and I still haven’t give him an update.”

So maybe I’m not the perfect client. But we’ve had one previous long conversation about how our communication is off. I told him then I’m willing to try again. All of the above has happened AFTER the conversation about communication.

Here’s the kicker. I’m **PAYING HIM ALMOST $5,000 to act like this.** I shouldn’t have to be so stressed every time I get an email from him, a call, or a text. This is almost feels like gaslighting and everything seems to be my fault to him. I want to quit using him. But at the same time, I don’t want to waste the thousands of dollars I’ve given him. 

**TL;DR - I hired a consultant to help with school applications. He seems to be gaslighting, but I spent a butt ton of $$ for his services and feel conflicted about possibly ditching him.**",17Sep2020,1

132,"My girlfriend was texting me earlier and she said she was upset. It took some prying, but she told me what was bothering her. Her friend, let’s call her Brit, has been hanging out with my GF’s other friend, let’s call her Sam. They are all the same age. My GF, let’s call her Maile, told me that Brit went and got drunk with Sam the other night. My father suffers with alcoholism and this really hurt me that Maile’s friends are ditching her for alcohol. 

     This isn’t the first time they’ve done this. Brit and her BF (same age) went to go get drunk with family and they needed a designated driver. They were going to make my girlfriend sit and watch them get wasted and then drive them home. 

     I told Maile that she needs to keep talking to them because they are her friends, and she should always stick by them whether or not they are idiots. But it’s one thing to be smart and have stupid friends, but another to be stupid with them. I don’t dislike her friends, I just dislike their decisions and how they walk all over her, and especially when it comes to underage drinking. 

     I’ve told Maile many times that she should never drink, and she takes my advice every time her friends go out drinking. 

I want advice as to what to do about it because it really hurts. What do Reddit?

TLDR: Girlfriend’s friends ditch her to go drink underage.",17Sep2020,1
133,"We've known each other for about 8 years now. Started dating in high school for a bit, broke up, and got back together 3 years ago. We have a silly goofy relationship and get along great for the most part. I just feel like he's lost the ""lust"" he used to have for me. Recently, (maybe the past 7 months or so) his sex drive has decreased and we rarely have sex. Maybe twice a month. We have talked about it numerous times but so far nothing has really changed except for the fact that I now know that he feels less attracted to me since I have lost motivation during quarantine and haven't been working on myself much. I recently got a new/second part time job and things have been going well/the same but still no change in the sex life. Tonight I asked him if he wants to bang later and he said yes. We laid in bed and then he told me he was too mentally tired.

I can't really imagine what it will be like if we stay together like this for years. I really don't know what else to do at this point.

Is it too late to fix? Should I just move on if I'm not completely satisfied? I don't even know if I'm happy to be honest. Is anyone ever really satisfied? 

*What I'm looking for here is: Has anyone else felt this way and made a decision that changed or saved the relationship? Or is this just the way relationships go and you have to learn to fight each battle and suck it up? *

so im going home to her in a week and a half. hes been wanting to spend more time in person with me before i moved in but the place im at wont allow me to see him. so basically i wont even get to see him before i go. he gets upset whenever the topic comes up because he says he doesnt want me to move hours away. but i told him i was going to go homeless for him. then once i told him the option i wrote on here, he got upset, telling me i was giving him an ultimatum. but i was just being realistic. he seems to want me to change my mind or lie to make him feel better about the situation, but we have a week and a half. we literally dont have time to that. that night he ignored me for the night until the next day when i called. since then we havent talked about it. i dont want to upset him but i obviously have to let him know im leaving very soon. how should i break it to him in a way that doesnt come off as insensitive?",17Sep2020,1
135,"I'm currently living with my parents, I love them so much. They saved me from my abusive mother's house and have provided for me since I was 16. I am so grateful for everything they've done. But there's a problem. My dad will yell at me for the tiniest things, such as not picking up HIS underwear from the bathroom after his shower, not putting the dishes away as soon as the timer stops, not vacuuming the house (the whole house besides the bedrooms is hardwood floor). He also is very disrespectful towards me.

Just last week I came home with a mosquito bite on my neck (yes that's really what it was) and he said I was disgusting for coming home with hickeys all over my neck every time I go to my boyfriends, which is not by any means true. In the summer of last year, (I was 17) my dad found out my boyfriend and I were having sex and he told me maybe he would have some respect for me and stop looking at me so grossed out if I shut my legs. My dad has openly talked shit about my boyfriend, saying he's a lazy bum and that he isn't good enough for me.

My stepmom will sit there and watch him say all of these things and not say anything.

My boyfriend is 18, he dropped out at 17 and doesn't have a job yet. I agree he could do something with his life, but every time he has ever had a conversation with my dad, my dad doesn't even try to get along with him. My boyfriend has done everything he can to make my dad like him. I've done everything I can.

My stepmom cornered me that same summer my dad told me to close my legs and she raised her hand to me. She almost slapped me.

Both are high-strung professionals with probably poor communication skills. Anyways, not sure if I should tell them go get couples therapy, get a divorce, or tell my extended family. I don't know how serious of a fight this is -- it's not over infidelity it is likely over something petty or relatively insignificant.

149,"Hello reddit! I come to you with a dilemma. My husband started working at a software company almost 3 years ago and he is thriving. I made the mistake of disclosing how much my husband makes to my female friends because they were there when he got the call that he was promoted so obviously I jumped for joy and they congratulated him. They asked a few questions about the position and one of them was ""so how much was the bump?"" 
Anyways, few weeks later a friend of mine asked me if my husband could get her husband into the company (he has no experience in software, just knows his way around the computer) all I could say was ""well, hes welcome to come by and spend the day with my husband so he can watch him work and see if it's something he can do"". He never made the plan to but often get asked by her ""are they hiring yet?"" I lie and say no because they showed no initiative. This is my husband's career and as much as I would love to see them do better, I won't let my husband look bad. I had this conversation with my hubby and we agreed that it wouldnt be smart to bring friends in because it would create tension if for some reason my husband had to discipline my friends husband. I can imagine said friends husband getting home and complaining about how my husband brought something to his attention and my friend probably create a distance from me because of it. I have another friend who invited us on a double date and IT FELT LIKE AN INTERVIEW! Her husband also asked about a job and then continued to give us his whole background and I could see my husband getting tense and wanting to jump off a bridge lol (not literally) I had to try my hardest to steer the conversation away from it and then he would bring it up again like, ""so like I said earlier..."" My husband felt sad because he was going into this double date hoping to make friends because he's not very good at it and it completely turned him away from wanting to connect. He says he feels like lying and saying he works some other low level job but I think after how hard he has worked to pull himself from where he was, he should have the right to state his position because he's proud of it. I love my friends dearly... So much. They are amazing friends but I don't know how to bring it up without sounding snobby or like I don't want them to do better. The biggest problem is that they want to jump into a career they don't know how to do, don't have the experience or background and don't even take the time to listen to the details of his job. All they know is ""I work at a software start up with telecommunications"" . How can I explain it to them? Is there a compromise? How do I not offend? is this a problem alot of other people have had? And how do you deal with it ?",17Sep2020,1
150,"I'm a 22M who's currently doing an extra year of an undergrad. to boost my GPA for medical school. Tried the MCAT twice and got low scores in only one section (twice!). I've recently come to understand that most people find stuff they enjoy, and then make careers out of them.

Well this extra year has been quite illuminating in that I no longer find biology or biochemistry (my undergrad program) because I don't see a potential for $$$. I've come to think of success as having $$$ and capable of doing anything you want any given day. I wrote out my goals in life yesterday on paper:

1. Be my own boss
2. Become rich with help from friends/people or solo
3. Own multiple investments, real estate, etc.
4. Get a sexy car, house, suits and shoes, etc.
5. Do whatever, whenever without worrying about $$$ (responsibly)

After reading up on how others became successful, I then made another list of my goals and it narrowed down to two points:

1. Find something that ""clicks"" and that I like
2. Become good at it enough to be my own boss

I still have yet to find something I like. I tried my hand at laboratory research, photography, video editing, streaming myself playing Minecraft, etc, but I lose interest very quick. I hate talking to people but I like it when I have to lead (temporarily lead) a group. I never really had friends except one whom I know quite well and am comfortable opening up to. Nowadays I spend my time playing Minecraft with my friends online. If I could, I would play a lot but this extra year of university ticks me off because I don't find studying interesting. Medicine is becoming very repulsive to me as a career choice because of so many hoops to jump through and brown-nosing people to get references. Very neurotic indeed. Now I prioritize passion in a career choice and $$$ as a second priority. But I really don't know what I want to do in life. Do you guys and gals have any advice or were any of you in similar positions but moved on? I would appreciate any advice thrown at me!

TLDR: How did you guys find what you enjoy and make it/incorporate it into a career? How did you prevent becoming uninterested in it?",17Sep2020,1

153,"With my 21st birthday approaching I am still a virgin. I know we're supposed to believe it's no big deal, but I have been trying so desperately hard to lose it for so incredibly long. Being a virgin is literally the only thing in my life that is out-of-place. And no matter what I do, I cannot be okay with being a virgin. More than anything I want to live my life without having to obsess over sex,  but the fact that I am still a virgin is eating me alive. I am seriously thinking about losing it to an escort. 

I am so insanely jealous of women. I know they may overall suffer more than men, but all I can think about is how easy it must be for them to get laid. I feel like my sexual failure has overwritten every other aspect of my personality. School, hobbies, those things are going well for me, but none of it matters as long as I'm a virgin. 

I hate the person I am. I wish I was a normal kid who lost it in high- school. I really don't understand: I think I am kind, intelligent, good at many things, I even think Im pretty good-looking now.

154,"My (24F) customers, especially the men, always check me out, flirt with me, and even ask me out. Objectively, I'm very beautiful. Subjectively, I'm hotter than the sun *(yes, I know I sound arrogant)*, and the customers seem to agree. I'd also like to think that I'm very nice, but that's par for the course in customer service. I work at a financial institution, and thankfully there's a two-inch thick bulletproof glass between me and the customers.

My coworkers have taken notice of it, and have even poked fun at it. I don't mind that. I'm not attracted to any of those customers and don't really care so long as nobody actually acts on it. The problem is that some actually *do* act on them. One customer slipped me his number with a note with some donut holes *(we're across the street from a coffee shop and customers bringing treats is common)*, and I didn't call him. Another actually proposed to me. Wasn't serious and I kept things professional.

The most aggravating customer is one who has seriously asked me out several times. I've done his transactions over the past year or so, and we had a nice conversation about our shared Scandinavian heritage. Whenever he asks me out, I try treating it like a joke and say, *""I can drink you under the table and eat you into bankruptcy""*, and have even straight-up just said *""no""*. But he keeps persisting. Today, he even gave me his business card, and I'm very tempted to call whoever is in charge of him at work and tell them what's going on. The creepiest part about this is that he's older than my own mother (60).

Yes, I've brought this up to my managers. I really want to put up a sign at my window that says, *""Please, no flirting, asking out, or proposing to the teller""*, but the district manager has said no to that. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this?",17Sep2020,1

157,"Hi friends! I’ll try to explain this the best I can. 

About 4 months ago, I hired a consultant to help me with post graduate school applications. I needed help with all of the writing supplements, mostly, but was also looking for someone to hold my hand and challenge me a bit. So I hired this consultant that came really highly recommended. But it’s just been a nightmare since. 

First, **he wants me to lie and write a narrative about something that didn’t even happen to me.** And he keeps pushing for this topic and asking me if I’m sure it didn’t happen. 

Second, **he just wants me to copy and paste my resume into his template.** But I said I wanted my app to be mine, not a cookie cutter application he’s had everyone else submit. I want my work to be my own. 

Third, and this one was the worst one to me, I had started the application process a few years ago. I started the app process, but then got really sick, and postponed my application by a year. I had received two letters of recommendation. My consultant asked me to have them send me the letters because he didn’t believe they’d be good letters. I told him I wouldn’t have asked who I asked if I thought they’d write me bad letters. **He then asked to see ALL OF MY PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM so he could “determine” how “useful” they’d be.** I said I understood why he wanted to see the letters, but asking for personal conversations was highly inappropriate and I wasn’t asking them anymore because I didn’t want to loose their trust. 

Finally, one month ago, I asked him for a two week break to reevaluate if I really wanted to go through this process. It’s been draining on me. He said that was fine and during those two weeks he’d go over the new outlines I posted before asking for a break. And then sent me this long text about why I shouldn’t need to think about it using info about previous clients he’s previously sent me before. So I didn’t answer because... it was all about why I shouldn’t need to think about taking a break and previous stats about how successful his past clients have been. 

Two weeks go by and I hear nothing. Radio silence. It was a hard two weeks finding out my grandfather is dying and my boyfriend broke up with me. All this time I’m waiting for my consultant to say “I uploaded my comments to your outline.” Two more weeks go by. Today, I finally shove all the anxiety this guy has given me down and ask him if he’s had a chance to look at my outlines, he said no, because I said “I didn’t want to go to law school anymore and I ignored his message.” I tell him that I believed I said I needed time to figure out if I still wanted to apply, not that I wasn’t applying anymore. And that I read the text but just took it as a reflection piece, but he was the one that said he would look at the outlines in the meantime. But I told him no worries, it’s fine! At this point I’m just so annoyed with him. But no, he doesn’t just drop it. He proceeds to say that when I didn’t reply to his “long, thought-out message,” he took it as a hint that I was putting things on hold. And if I were putting things on hold he wasn’t going to jump into my materials only to “forget them whenever I decided to return. And on that same note, it’s been a month and I still haven’t give him an update.”

So maybe I’m not the perfect client. But we’ve had one previous long conversation about how our communication is off. I told him then I’m willing to try again. All of the above has happened AFTER the conversation about communication.

Here’s the kicker. I’m **PAYING HIM ALMOST $5,000 to act like this.** I shouldn’t have to be so stressed every time I get an email from him, a call, or a text. This is almost feels like gaslighting and everything seems to be my fault to him. I want to quit using him. But at the same time, I don’t want to waste the thousands of dollars I’ve given him. 

**TL;DR - I hired a consultant to help with school applications. He seems to be gaslighting, but I spent a butt ton of $$ for his services and feel conflicted about possibly ditching him.**",17Sep2020,1

163,"Title.

Here's a breakdown of how my life situation has changed in the last two months:

I \[M19\] live in a suburban town in the Midwest United States, with my dad \[M40\], my stepmother \[F38\] and her daughter \[F19\], and my half-sister \[F7\]. Things have been very tense between my parents for a few years now, but I had no idea about this until it all came to a head and blew up last month, when my stepmom confessed to my dad that she had cheated on him. He completely lost it, and vandalized her car before taking off to Arizona for nearly two weeks, leaving us to fend for ourselves in the midst of this pandemic under complete radio silence (we only found out where he was because my great aunt was able to get in contact with him). 

He came back about midway through August, and things were very tense. My stepmom told me that they were going to ""work it out,"" but each passing day proves this to be more and more of a load of bullshit. They are as far as I'm concerned equally at fault -- from what my stepmom said while he was gone, he has been a horrible husband, and though I haven't witnessed much of this myself aside from the last two months, it lines up pretty damn perfectly with what he's been like as a father. Neither of them are bad people, but they both have a lot of issues, and they are not mature enough to fix them on their own or to seek out help. It has become very clear to me that I can no longer rely on either of them, and I want out.

&amp;#x200B;

As for me personally, though, things are very rough:

I do not have a job or any work experience. I don't have a driver's license or even a valid permit. My permit expired in March, and I haven't been able to get a replacement as both my Social Security card and birth certificate are missing (not my fault: I was never in possession of either of them, and neither of my parents have made any significant effort to assist me in getting them replaced). I dropped out of college last semester; I have $5500 in student debt, and the only money to my name is $1550 in room and board refunds from last semester due to COVID. This money could disappear at any time if I earn my dad's ire; my bank account is co-signed with him and he's taken money out of it before without my knowledge or consent. As a neat little cherry on top, over the last year or so I have become about 95% certain that I have undiagnosed, untreated ADHD which has been severely affecting my ability to function in a consistent and orderly manner for pretty much my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

While I want out of here for my own personal happiness, ultimately, my biggest long-run concern is not myself, but my half-sister. I don't want this to end up fucking up her life. Neither of my parents are even slightly capable of properly raising a child; the result of my dad trying to do so is, well, see previous paragraph, and the result of my stepmom trying to do so is my stepsister, who I could write an entirely separate post about. She's narcissistic, largely unconcerned with anything but her own immediate gratification, obsessively and dysfunctionally attached to her phone and the internet, and physically very unhealthy due to a variety of habits which stem from these traits; she'd live in this house and do nothing but eat, sleep, and look at her phone for the rest of her life if she could. It's somewhat cynical of me, but I've believed for a while that she's beyond help, or at the very least way beyond anything I can do.

My dad has been largely not present as a parent ever since he and my stepmom got married, meaning my stepmom has been left to raise my half-sister. Similarities between her and my stepsister are already starting to develop, and she's only seven. She's still nowhere near the point my stepsister is, though -- it's not too late to help her, I don't think . It is not her fault that my parents are unable to deal with their problems, and she shouldn't have to suffer for it. I want to do something, I feel like I *have* to do something, but from where I'm standing, it feels like I'm barely able to help myself, let alone her.

164,"Alright so, my brother (34M) has been dating this girl (idk her age, late 20s early 30s?F) for a few years now. She is beyond means no good for him. She down talks him, treats him like garbage, belittles him and she’s just an uptight bitch. He was located in FL and recently moved to GA for work, and she followed. Nobody in my family likes her the slightest bit and my brother has changed for the worst. He stopped doing all hobbies that he enjoys, he’s miserable whenever he’s around her, hell, if and when we ever hear from him, it’s when she’s NOT around and he has “a free minute” to talk. I Could go on and on about the issues with her. 

My parents were planning on a weekend getaway to GA and going and staying in a cabin and trying to pay a visit to my brother in mid October. My mom got a phone call from him tonight saying his gf is having a hard time with work, people are quitting and she’s not in a good place and needs a “mental break” and doesn’t want “visitors” at the house. Needless to say, my mom is completely heartbroken and beyond devastated. I was recently in GA and didn’t get to see him either because he was going away, so I wrote him a letter explaining that I missed him and I feel our relationship isn’t what it used to be (we used to be so incredibly close) and how he barely contacts us anymore and if there was some sort of beef between us I’d like to squash it, along with voicing some other concerns (but nothing about the gf). He called me about a week later to talk, because he had time bc his gf was out running errands, and not once mentioned anything about the letter, but he rather seemed bored and inconvenienced calling me. 

Now, I have voiced my concern before and explained to him that I wasn’t fond of her along with our parents and that she wasn’t good for him. Explained what I saw and I was very calm and collected about it but he wanted nothing to do with what I had to say. Instead he lashed out and retaliated towards me. 

Now I have a major gut feeling he isn’t happy, and he’s stuck. He doesn’t do well with breakups and doesn’t quite like to be alone. But if he keeps going down this path he is going to lose me and my parents unfortunately. Mainly because he is distancing himself and isn’t making any effort to keep in touch with his family. 

I just don’t know what else to do to try to get through to him. I’m afraid if I try talking to him again about it he’s going to just get pissed off and lash out again, or what he is going to do. But at the same time I’m at a major loss. I feel like either way I am going to lose him.  So do I try explaining my feelings again about her with my parents somehow, or do I just ride it out and lose contact due to no communication? I’m just at a huge loss right now.",17Sep2020,1

this is only my second relationship but i really do feel secure in it and i’ve always seen a future for us, and i still do; we are actually set to move in together soon. i still love my partner and our relationship, which makes these feelings very confusing.

167,"For example I'm a local in New York, I live in the best place in Queens, though I have lived in Manhattan and did do my schooling there, and people who are in Manhattan tend to be asset rich but cash poor. It's possible to be middle class or even live in poverty while still living in Manhattan. I had to turn people down at times cause they weren't as rich as us, and we were not willing to inherit their financial issues. They have income disparities to the point you feel like you are adopting a family. We have neighbors who have places in Manhattan and also live with us. 

People don't talk about it cause everyone is like, if you are having financial issues you can just sell off land. It doesn't work that way cause no one will shell out that money immediately. I know a family who did and ended up living in another city while having property in Manhattan and the only earning hand in the family was a 25 year old teacher who probably brought in 300 dollars of income. This was one of the 20th cases I've met like that. The richest person I know from Manhattan is a guy who owns his business and married a white chick and he is also upper middle class. 

So it's basically, at one point, their grandparents moved early into the city, bought a house, the value of that house escalated and now they seem okay but they probably have been middle class for three generations.

So to start off I’ve been a very good looking guy, I’m like 5’9” about 270, I have a pretty big belly with some plump man titties. so I’m a bigger guy. Honestly I can’t remember a lot of details from before middle school. I might have been bullied I might not have but I’ve always put myself down. I’m the kind of person who has a lot of self deprecating humor, and doesn’t show a lot of emotions. I have never been good with emotions. When I was with my first gf I liked being around her but idk if that was from me never being very popular or if I liked her. I’ve also never been one for taking compliments well. Even if I get compliment I usually brush them off. I always point out the bad about myself, and I just don’t like really anything about myself. I hate to admit it but I did try killing myself before, but I’m no longer that low so atleast that’s good. I guess the main point is that I’ve put myself down so much that idk if I can love myself anymore, or if I can even try to accept who I am.",17Sep2020,1

180,"I work at a federal agency in the US. In March, the Department allowed anyone to “self identify as high risk,” generally meaning that the person would have something like severe asthma, diabetes, cancer, COPD, etc. They did not require any medical documentation. Anyone who self-identified would be permitted to stay at home and still receive full pay and benefits without working... because my agency isn’t telework capable due to security reasons. Several people chose to do this.

Then we shut down completely for three months. 

In June, we reopened. But people who had self-identified were still allowed to stay home. Many other people caught on to this and also decided to self-identify. The majority of these people have no medical issues to speak of, and most are in their 30s. These people are still accruing paid leave and getting scheduled promotions... but many haven’t worked at all since March. I have seen some on social media on vacation, and some are even working other jobs. 

Now it’s September. Six months later. More than half the office is out. The rest of us are busting our asses to cover the extra work. 

I don’t know the individual pay amounts of each employee, but, doing some loose math, in my section alone, these people have cost taxpayers over $500,000 in paychecks over 6 months even though they aren’t working at all. I would guess it’s over a million for the whole office. 

I don’t know what to do here. I’ve followed the proper channels in reporting specific “waste, fraud, and abuse,” but of course, nothing has happened. I’m so unmotivated to come to work every day knowing that these people are taking a vacation on taxpayer money and will have zero repercussions. Especially at a time when so many are jobless and suffering to make ends meet. It’s so sleazy to me. Our management knows, but *technically* they aren’t doing anything wrong. It’s up to higher-ups outside the office to make any calls on ending this ridiculousness. Plus, I am worried for the massive amount of resentment when they’re finally required to return. 

Any advice for helping to stop this policy or just coping would be appreciated!",17Sep2020,1

183,"I am 21 (F) and my bf lives with me he’s 21 yrs as well. So, about 3 months ago I believed there was a stalker, or am I paranoid? 

It was a white car, with the engine running, parked in a parking spot in front of my apartment. I’d pull in on my lunch break (assuming its a neighbors friend) I paid it no mind. They’d immediately leave by time I make it to my door.

It began to happen once or twice within 1 week or so. I’d either leave my apartment to go back to work one day, and see the car. They’d leave when I got in my car(?) My boyfriend was never around to witness so he’d always say “maybe the neighbor has a boyfriend who comes by” 
I tried to piece it together but Both downstairs neighbors are elderly. The neighbor across from us (upstairs) rarely has guest, it was only one time she invited family and she makes it known lol they get loud. she’s probably in her late or mid 30’s and works a lot. But I left it alone and we never seen the car again... I didnt think to look at the plate or whenever I tried to quickly glance, they have dark tint so I see a figure ): 


Until tonight (9/16/20) less than 20 minutes ago, 10:40pm I come home alone from dropping my bf off to his night shift. The white car is running and it’s not parked in front of my apartment door. Its parked towards the next door building and its an open spot between us. I turn off my car and immediately call my boyfriend to stay on the phone. I get out my car, quickly glance and they look at me and immediately pull off. I seen their race, and their eyes but everything else I didnt catch.  

I’ve lived here long enough to know for sure, the people in the next building didnt have a guest. All their lights are out by 10pm. And its 1 family and a single guy that drives a moped. 

Could I possibly be paranoid? What can I do? I can try to report it but the car doesnt show up consistently nor do I have the tag # to give the guards who supervise the entrance...",17Sep2020,1

193,"I'm not going to give names for the sake of privacy but we'll call my friend Jake. Jake's little brother has had cancer for all long time now, they've tried all different kinds of chemo and medicines and at this point there's nothing else for them to do. He's got almost no chance of living and as much as he tries to seem like he's doing okay mentally I can see it's crushing him. Recently he's started dating a woman we'll call Bethany. Bethany is 19 and in her freshman year of college. When he told me about this I immediately saw the red flags. The fact that a grown woman who's been in college for a year is interested in a high school boy who's just barely finished puberty is extremely disconcerting. Especially with the fact that he's in such an emotionally vulnerable state he's the perfect target to manipulate and take advantage of. There are lots of men her age available to her; going for an emotionally and sexually immature high schooler seems very predatory. I've tried to voice my concerns to him but he sees no problem with it. According to him he's over the age of consent and he's mature enough to have a relationship with a young adult even though he's still a child himself. When I bring it up he gets a little defensive and doesn't really hear what I have to say. I've decided to stop pushing it for fear of driving him away which is the last thing I want. I do slightly feel that he's with her for you know ""comfort"". I don't really care as long as he's using protection; its certainly not the most healthy coping mechanism but it's better than drugs or self-harm. I'm really afraid for him but there's nothing I can do to tell him how suspicious the whole situation is. If anyone could tell me what to do or how to support him I would really appreciate it; I've seen a lot of friends get into emotionally abusive relationships and I'm frightened that the same will happen to him.

195,"Yes it seems very highschoolish of me to be posting this but hear me out. I’m a 27 YO F btw.  About 7 years ago when I got out of my toxic serious relationship, I literally had no friends. Like none at all, barely knew how to make any, barely knew myself, how to value myself and so forth. When me and my ex broke up, I started working at this one place with so many people my age and a lot of cool people to hang out with. It was here where I learned a lot about myself and most importantly, how to socialize and make friends, which to me at the moment was huge. I made a lot of cool friends, but down the line I made this one really good friend to which I don’t ever get too deep with people unless I see they’re truly caring people. 

Well there was this one girl and we became really close and eventually we became like really good friends. We talked about deep stuff, family, values and I would always make her feel better about her insecurities and vice versa, and just be there for each other. Then this one “clique” of girls that were pretty shallow started hanging out with this friend of mine and we all sort of hung out but she started hanging out with them a lot more than I ever did.

 So it was during this one party they went to where one of the shallow chicks spread a rumor about me hooking up with a guy that’s known to be the biggest bullshitter and liar of the place we worked at. My good friend at the time was there when the rumor was being spread and knowing that I had told her about how shitty this guy was and spreads rumors of him hooking up with a lot of girls he liked but couldn’t have, she just stayed quiet and said nothing. For 1, It was only through one of these shallow girls I even knew this rumor was being spread and 2, this “good friend of mine” didn’t say a word to defend me or tell me this happened. This really hurt me because I thought she was better and deeper than that to have my back in this situation, and when I talked to her about it she apologized and said she should have interfered and so I kinda got over it, not really ever forgetting it. After this incident, she just kind of stopped talking to me as much and really started becoming shallow like the other girls so we stopped talking and she even unfollowed me on IG. 2 almost 3 years later, I see a follow request from her on IG today and it shocks me to see that because I guess I didn’t expect that. I want to accept her because Idk if she wants to apologize for how things turned out between us but then again what if she doesn’t say anything? I know her well enough to know just trying to add me took a lot out of her. I know things like that scare her and she might be scared of me hating her or not wanting to talk to her but I guess I’d like closure? What would you guys do?",17Sep2020,1

197,"I have a friend that doesn't do much outside of work. He doesn't spend time with his family and doesn't have many friends.   As such, he has a lot of free time and has somehow decided that I am largely responsible for his entertainment.  I get multiple texts and phone calls per week and sometimes per day.  

The challenge is that I do not have a lot of free time to share with him (or anyone really). I have an increasingly demanding job and not a lot of flexibility to socialize during the day.  I have family and personal responsibilities outside of work and most times when I'm done with my day I just want to crash. 

Attempts to curb his dependency or distance myself are met with overtly codependent texts either demanding a response or alluding to me being a shitty friend because I don't shirk my responsibilities to chat with him all day.  In several situations he showed up at my house claiming to be ""worried about my well-being"" because I haven't responded to him all day.

But when I do have the opportunity to hang out with him in person, we have a great time.  So it's not a friendship I want to end, but he's ignored every direct requests to calm down or back off even a little.  

This dependency is becoming a drain on me and strain on our friendship.  I think he needs a new shiny friend/object to draw his focus so I can live my life and get back to enjoying hanging out with him instead of doing so it of obligation or guilt.  

What can I do to find him a new buddy?  Or am I just sugar coating bad behavior and need to take more decisive action?",17Sep2020,1

It crept back again at the end of June but soon went away because I had distractions. Now it’s September and I feel like it’s triggered AGAIN.

Our entire condo complex has been infested with cockroaches for over a year now. Their activity ebbs and flows but it's in the warmer months where they make their presence especially known. I've attempted near everything, including caulking our baseboards, applying gel baits, and dust treatments. Our condo's management has also brought in exterminators to no avail. Just this evening I've placed an order for Advion Gel Bait from the States and Diatomaceous Earth. 

The problem is that I don't live alone. I live in a two bedroom suite with my mother, my sister, and her two teenage kids. As it concerns the kids, they are especially lazy when it comes to doing household chores (they don't do any), and don't go out of their way to help ensure that the house stays tidy. My mother is more proactive, but she is incredibly hesitant about me laying down things like bait and powders and is rather irrational about them as it concerns the health of everyone living in the house. It has gotten to the point where we've had numerous heated arguments. 

Basically I feel as if I'm alone in attempting to eradicate this problem and it's becoming unbearable. I've started to resign to fact that this isn't an issue that's leaving anytime soon, if at all.

My question is: With all this in mind, should I at the very least consider cutting my losses and making a move? I'm a full-time student with a part time job, and I have 6.5k in my savings, so that already makes things pretty complex. I enjoy living here virtually rent free and really dislike the potential of taking on more expenses and potentially more debt but I simply want to know if I'm sounding rational or not.

My sister is 13 and I think she’s in her “youtuber” phase. She’s been watching a bunch of vlogs and makeup videos and lately she’s been pretending to be a youtuber in her room, which, admit it, we’ve all done something like that before.

The thing is, I don’t think she realizes that her room is RIGHT NEXT TO MINE and that I can hear every word she says. She always waits until late at night when everyone is asleep to do her thing. Now every night I just hear her in the other room going like “Hi youtube!! I’m Chrissy123 and today I’m going to be doing a fun night out makeup tutorial!!!!!” and it’s getting a bit irritating. She occasionally sings as well and I gotta say dude, she sucks at singing.

Anyway, as much as it gets annoying, it’s pretty easy to tell that she’s just having fun and being a kid, so I don’t want to ruin that for her. Plus I’m pretty sure she’d be embarrassed as hell if I told her to stop singing at 12:00 am, since she clearly doesn’t think anyone can actually hear her. I want to find a way to get her to find out that I can hear her without actually telling her, you know? Like I want her to realize completely on her own somehow. Because really, she’s just having fun and playing pretend, which makes me really happy to hear as an older sibling.

Although we live a state where it’s not legal so we have to be extremely careful of what we keep bc most often we have frequent visitations from the house repair guy and so we usually just keep edibles and dab pens so it doesn’t stink up the house and is easy to hide. A few days ago however he brought home actual weed that was extremely loud, so much so that it basically stunk any room that he would walk into and stay smelly after he left. We agreed that it would be just a one time thing and that we would smoke it up before the inspections started again after Covid is over. But tonight my roommate mentioned how he tried hitting a bong for the first time at his friends house and really wants to get one for himself now (and only using it at his friends house). I didn’t feel comfortable with the idea bc bongs aren’t easy to hide and it can build up a smell. He mentioned how it is very different from keeping that and keeping weed, but I told him that the weed is a temporary thing  and he just said that he can just drop it off at his friends house before an inspection happens but I still dont feel comfortable with the idea..

My Mother was ecstatic with the idea and found it very touching and I do too! 

My Mother offhandedly shared the news with one of my cousins and how she thought it was a nice gesture. The following day she received a message from my other cousin (sister of said cousin) about how this has hurt both of them and they find it wrong that this is happening and how they believe the granddaughters should be the one to use my Grandmother's ring in a wedding. My Mum thought maybe there was a misunderstanding and told them that my brother and sister-in-law aren't going to be keeping the ring, they are borrowing it for the ceremony as it is sentimental. 

My cousins still weren't happy with this and still stick by the fact they believe it should be the granddaughters that use it or wear it for their future weddings. 

My Mother genuinely didn't mean to hurt anyone by allowing this and I felt maybe I should chip in to explain that I believe my brother has just as much right to use my Grandmother's ring as a grandson and how it wouldn't diminish the importance of it in the future. They stood by the fact that it isn't correct for my brother or his fiancee to do this. 

I tried a bit to reason but in the heat of the moment, I pointed out that one of them has kept and worn a ring (gifted from my Grandfather to my Grandmother) for months that was actually passed down to my Mother and she has repeatedly asked for it to be given back. Latest time being this week. 

This just sparked more hostility and arguments as they've been sending my Mother barrages of texts about how this isn't true and how my Mother didn't want this ring anyway. Months prior when my Grandmother was still alive, I recall conversations that my Grandmother wasn't happy that my cousin was wearing the ring and wanted my Mother to take it back, however my Mother wasn't pushy enough - only casually reminding my cousin now and again. 

Now I feel like there's a no-win situation, my Mother is really hurt at how my cousins are acting over this and is unsure what to do.

Do you think my Mother shouldn't allow my brother and his fiancee to use my Grandmother's wedding ring? I feel like my cousins are acting very entitled about my Grandmother's possessions and while I don't want them hurt, they're putting my Mother in uncomfortable spot and it feels a bit like they're prioritising their status as grandchildren above hers as a daughter to my Grandmother and putting pressure on her. My Grandmother's will involves my Mother, Auntie and Uncle, my Auntie lives in a different country and is less bothered, and my Uncle hasn't discussed still how they want to split certain possessions, but it feels like my two cousins are trying to run the show in where and who her possessions go to and what is done with them.",17Sep2020,1

So honestly I have helped many people and I know how to make myself happy and solve my problems, but I get so busy that I avoid it. I am here looking for advice about something that is happening to me. I am being harrassed and it is impacting my day to day life. I am being harrassed about something I didnt even do and I have evidence to prove that I didnt do it. Like it doesnt even matter and everyone (except my roommates and a couple hundred people who I have helped) treats me like im a bad guy, scum of the earth although The people who accusaed me has lied and manipulated the facts. I just want the harrassment to stop. It takes so much energy to put up on the front like I dont give a shit that I am being harrassed. I feel so alone, im so busy with my classes and stressed. Because of those people I now have anxiety and panic attacks, my ptsd came back, i am trying to stay afloat. Like I know how to solve these problems but it feels like I have to take on the world alone as I always have.

223,"For starters I apologize for the format, I'm on mobil. 

I'm 21 male and in the next few weeks I'll finally have my life set out for me. I start my career, I'll have my own place and so on. This is huge and exciting considering I've been homeless since I was 16. But for the past couple of months I've been kinda ehh. I'm not sure how to explain it, I'm not really excited nor happy. I can say I'm happy but I'm just saying it. I'm constantly tired all the time and I feel exhausted no matter how much I sleep. I'm generally sleeping around 12 to 13 hours right now and I'm still tried when I get up. I've tried getting up early and going to bed early but I'm just as tired and also cranky. I don't have much motivation to do anything other than what I need to. I haven't touched my video games or sketch book in a few months other then the other day when I forced myself to draw.(the pictures came out horrible and I felt like it was something I had to get done rather then do for fun) Instead of being happy about my success I'm more so okay with it. It's like great, now what else do I have to do. I've noticed it but not as much until earlier when my girlfriend mentioned that I was being a ""party pooper"" She was trying to joke with me and be playful but I wasn't picking up on them and was just really sluggish. I kept taking everything to serious and was acting grumpy apparently. (I didn't feel like I was but then again idk.) I went to sleep at 12pm today and woke up at 8pm. I've been up since then but I'm fighting to stay up. (I did go to sleep at 11pm last night but I was babysitting a puppy so I had to wake up every 2 hours for 5 mins to bring her out) All I wanna do I sleep. That's all.

I'm concerned about why I'm like this and what it is.",17Sep2020,1
224,"Trigger Warning!!!⚠️🚨 I started to self harm in 7th grade and eventually stopped in 9th grade due to my mom finding out. She quickly found a therapist and I have been seeing that therapist (let’s call her Sasha) for almost 2 years now, because I am in 11th grade.  I have always had social anxiety and have had panic attacks, and then I was diagnosed with depression and take Zoloft. Now Sasha thinks I have Bipolar disorder too. Yesterday, I told Sasha that I self harmed again (it wasn’t too bad only four cuts that were not deep) and I told her I was having suicidal thoughts and really felt like killing myself. It wasn’t a great appointment, and she asked me if I was going to be safe and I said yes and I don’t know if I was lying or not. Thankfully I don’t think she told my parents, because she usually does when I tell her I’m having suicidal thoughts. But anyways, today she texted me asking how am I doing, and I told her I am doing okay and that I am not doing bad or good and that I just feel really empty and numb. She replied saying “ok, let me know if you need anything”. Is it just me or is it weird that she didn’t give advice? Am I being too dramatic? I just have no one to talk to. I just have her, and sometimes it’s just not enough for me. I still feel so numb today I’m not sad or happy I just don’t know what to do. Do I need a new therapist.

228,"(First) I have had an online friend for a year. I really care about her but our whole relationship is based on lies I made. For example, I lied abt where I was born, how many siblings I have, etc. I lied abt shit like that. I just looked at our earlier conversations and I said something like “it’s just my sister, brother, me, dad, and sometimes mom”, but months later I mentioned I had an additional little sister I don’t have. I lied about my gender too. I’m painting a picture with her. A picture I wish I was. I don’t know if I should continue on but to stop adding to the lies, to come clean, or to stop talking to her. Im so hurt and confused. I really think I fucked up. 

(Secondly) I have a friend I’ve known since pre school. For the past year I got into pot and drinking. My moms side holds the addict gene, and a doctor told me I probably have it. But yeah, I got addicted. But this friend I’ve known for so long constantly tells me they are disappointed in me. They tell me I do everything wrong. I know I’m a shitty person.

235,"Hello. I (m18) have a fear of flies, or any insect with the capacity to fly. I think this originated back when I was three when I was dive-bombed by about thirteen flies/wasps simultaneously while at a waterpark, getting into my mouth and ears and stinging me on the face. It's spring in Australia at the moment and as such many insects are around, including massive terrifying hornet-esque flies, and many get into the house. When I think there's an insect in the house I start hearing buzzing sounds that aren't there and lose all capacity to concentrate. If one is in my room I will either leave the room or immediately seek to kill it in the most effective way possible, usually with a spray can as the spray hits a wider area than a swatter or anything of the sort.

But my family is not exactly understanding of my fear. They always get mad at me whenever I attempt to kill a flying insect in the house, saying ""it can't actually hurt you"" or ""just leave it and it will fly out the door eventually"". I've told them many times that it doesn't matter how small and insignificant the flies seems to them because their existence in any proximity to myself makes me incredibly uncomfortable, but they don't care. They recently said they were going to take the spray can away because they don't want anybody's brain cells killed by the chemicals, which seems like an excuse to control me. They also told me that they would force me to see someone about the fear, even though there is a simple solution to it; let me kill some flies in the house, maybe shut the door on days with more flies out. It's not hard to be accommodating to my fear but instead they seem to be doing everything they can to stop me from feeling comfortable in my own house.

How can I make them realise that I need to kill the flies to be comfortable, and that they are being unreasonable and making me upset? Thank you?",17Sep2020,1

238,"Hi everyone, so I've been dating my boyfriend for around 9 months (though in actuality I feel like it's less because we haven't been able to see each other for many weeks/months due to the pandemic and strict lockdowns where I live).  


He is super sweet and treats me better than any guy I've ever been with. I know he sees a future with me because he often talks about marriage, kids, and a future with me etc. I'm in my early 20s and he is a decade older so him being mature and good at communicating is nice.

But my issue is, my parents are nice to him but I know they are not a huge fan of him because whilst he got a good degree from a good university a few years back, he is not working in the area of his studies and is working a part-time job at a retail store. He is intelligent and well-read and talks about ""not being at his retail job forever"" but I don't actually know if he is making any efforts to pursue a career related to his studies. I don't know how to bring this up without hurting him because he has mentioned in the past how he didn't like how people judged his worth by the job he has/how much money he makes and that he feels like a disappointment during reunions with old friends when they find out he's still at the same retail job and not with some big wig job. I am close to finishing my college degree and whilst I too will probably(definitely in this global pandemic climate) have to spend a few years post-college working jobs unrelated to my degree, I can't imagine being in my 30s and still not having some sort of professional 9-5 job. I am doing a prestigious degree and it makes me always feel a little uncomfortable when people ask me what my boyfriend does/what his plans are for the future because there is some judgement in their expressions when I say I'm not sure and I can tell they feel like I'm potentially dating a guy with no future. I know I shouldnt care what others think but this makes me wonder if maybe I am being too naive by being with him and not considering these things?

 I love him a lot but I am probably used to a certain lifestyle provided to me by my own family and I'm not sure if I can provide the same kind of life for my future kids if I was to settle down with him and if he was still working a part time job. I know this sounds very pretentious and snobbish, my family is not rich by any means but my parents immigrated to another country with us and put in a lot of hard work to get us to where we are today and I want to put that to good use and not feel like I've progressed backwards instead of forwards in my own life.  
How should I bring up the topic of asking him what his future goals for his career and life in general are, without coming across like I am prying/judging him?

I feel very uncomfortable when he wants to come over to my house because I know my parents will be there just silently judging and everytime me and my dad are alone my dad asks me ""so did he get a job?"" (aka a job related to his field). I want to tell my bf why I feel so awkward around him when my family is there but would that just be unnecessarily mean? I prefer meeting up at his house so i can avoid this awkwardness until he settles down a bit more in his life.

Am I being unreasonable? Other than that he is SUCH a good guy and I've dated plenty of guys that appear good on paper but are just selfish people deep down or not genuine and so I dont want to break up with him over this one flaw.

Thank you",17Sep2020,1

241,"i feel somewhat sad recently because my best friend hasn't been talking to me for the past four months or so. im not sure what exactly caused this - i've been sending her messages but there have been no responses so far. 

we both graduated college recently and she has supported me a lot emotionally and academically over the past 6 years since i've known her. we are also both trying to get into medical school. i'm not sure if she stopped talking to me because recently she had been discouraging me to proceed with the medical school route (i have significantly lower grades compared to her and my road to medical school is much harder and more tedious). however i have not received any outright response from her stating that me stubbornly proceeding with the pre-medical route is the reason that she is not talking to me anymore.

another reason for her sudden stop in communicating with me might be her boyfriend? i'm not sure. i asked my mutual friends if they had received any correspondence from my best friend as of late, and they told me they were in contact with her around early August. learning this somewhat hurt me because it gave me the impression that she was actively avoiding my messages and attempts to contact her.

i'm not really sure how to proceed with this. should i contact her via another way (text message, email? instead of what i have been using) and ask her if i have done anything wrong? she is really my only friend so i'm scared of losing this friendship but i would rather figure out what is going on because maybe there is something wrong i have been doing that i need to correct and improve on.

243,"So, I created this account for this purpose and this purpose only. I need advice. 

In January I met my boyfriend, and our relationship has been great so far with only a few minor disagreements. We have a lot in common and I have a nice time with him. 

 However, over this year I’ve begun to notice some really core issues. For one, while he isn’t completely on the opposite political spectrum from me, he’s begun to say things that show me he’s clearly much more conservative than he led me to believe, which is a big issue for me. Things relating to BLM and the current president which are concerning.

He also has not told his family about me despite us dating since January. Not meeting them is one thing, but being kept secret is another. 

I asked him about this 4 months into the relationship and he told me that what he tells his family is not my business. He is close with them and sees them weekly, so I find it hard to believe I’ve never even once come up in a conversation, but he said if ever asked directly he would tell them. 

I told him I felt like he was embarrassed of me and he said that it wasn’t his problem that I wasn’t confident enough in my appearance to trust him. This really hurt me as being overweight most of my life I have very low self esteem. 

A few weeks later we had a long conversation, that he tried to avoid, where I told him that I loved him, and he started crying and said it was difficult to hear that. He just wanted to live for the moment, and that he didn’t think I would be the last girlfriend he had. It stung. A lot. But we decided to continue to date even though he essentially put an expiration date on our relationship. 

I thought maybe he just wasn’t ready to be in a long term relationship, and that we could take it easy for a while, but with the election coming up, and him seeming to retreat further and further into the conservative upbringing of his family, I’m really just at a loss for what to do. I would hate to end it when I think he is truly a kind, but occasionally misinformed man. But at the same time I worry he doesn't value me or respect my opinions. 

I really wish I didn’t have to feel like this all the time, but I’ve been thinking we should break up pretty much non stop for a month. When we are together it’s awesome and I’m so happy, and I can almost feel his mind opening a little more to see things in a different way than he was raised (as I had to do when I left home), but he never truly left his family to establish his own opinions.

I feel like a traitor to myself for allowing him to live in ignorance, but I’m not a rehab center and I’ve told him before that any change he makes should be for himself and not for me. 

I just don’t know what to do. I never saw myself falling for someone like this. I also don’t know why I’m so attached and unable to break it off when I can feel this isn’t going to last unless he wants it to. If he doesn’t see a future with me anyway then what’s the point? 

Please give me advice as to what to do.",17Sep2020,1

They even went through all my social media and threatened me.  I feel very violated.  This person made the comment based on a miscommunication.  Somebody in the comments found  another redditor looking up ways to bully people and they misunderstood that comment and pointed the blame on me.

So this friend was a bit jealous of me coz I knew his extended family and the other friend knew his college friends and so on. The party was great, we had an amazing time anyway. But today, the sister posted a selfie of me and herself and captioned it as ""cheers to the planner."" And I clarified that it was the other friend who planned it, I just invited her coz it would make the birthday boy happy. So she was totally cool with it and so I reposted that picture. Now, this friend who planned everything thought that I told the sister that I planned the party. So she said really horrible things to me, when I did nothing wrong. I told her like a million times that I clarified everything to the sister but to no avail.
Please advise.",17Sep2020,1

248,"A few months ago I just randomly thought about this one thing... And I wish I never had.

 I had already been constantly thinking about this one subject for years before that and it had always bothered me a little bit, but never had it been so disturbing and disruptive of my life as it now is after that. 

 I think I have came up with an info hazard, or at least have accidentally reached the same conclusion as one, if it has already been thought of. I don't know what to about it because it really is disturbing me on the inside and I don't think there is a good answer for it although I've been trying to come up with one since, and talking about it with another person would mean they'd also have to come in contact with this thought and also potentially hurt themselves doing so.

249,"I’m really self-conscious lately. I am 18, F, 5’5” and 130 lbs. I weighed around 115 last year. I went to the doctor less than a month ago and I was 125. I feel awful, I know I shouldn’t think like this, but I have always been super skinny and underweight. This is not what I’m used to. I have stretch marks all over my ass. I looked in the mirror the other day and could barely recognize myself. I used to be a 3 in jeans/pants and I’m now a 7. 

I have not changed my eating habits, in fact I’ve been eating less because due to the schedule change from high school to college, I wake up later and no longer really feel like eating breakfast. My stomach has a pouch and none of my jeans or pants from last year fit me. I have a normal body type, and am used to being underweight/skinny (genetics; I never had an eating disorder). My boyfriend (20m) of 2 years assured me that I look beautiful, etc., my mom is saying that it is a woman’s body instead of the teenager body I am used to, but I just feel like I’m not even in my own body. I know I am not “fat”, I am just average, and I am very body-positive, but I feel like my body would look much better on someone else than on me (if that makes sense?) and it’s hard to be body-positive for myself. Does anyone have any suggestions or advice to make me feel better? I really don’t mean to offend anyone and I’m sorry if I do.

250,"I don’t know what to do... theres this chat full of really nice people I’m in that I thoroughly enjoy but the Leader of the chat and community will often butt in and put down whatever I’m saying... like... we were talking about sexuality because someone said a character looked hot and I said I wouldn’t understand because I’m ace and aromantic and the leader came in right after I said that and started talking about how they see it as wrong to announce ones sexuality and how it’s not something you should just bring up and tbh that made me feel like crap... then again we were talking about art and I said that I had a drawing that represented how well I can draw and they wanted to see so I sent it and said as a warning that there was blood they liked it and I made the comment that it was vent art but that it wasn’t anything serious... then the Leader popped in out of nowhere and started saying how they don’t post their vent art because they see it as attention seeking and how they hate it when people do because they see it as some kid who wants attention... it made me feel awful about it and that I really should’ve just shut up and never talked at all... I don’t wanna start any sort of drama or have them get upset with me so I asked that if I do something that’s unpleasant to them to let me know and all they said in reply was something similar to oh don’t worry I will, I honestly fear them and don’t wanna get banned from the community because I did something they didn’t like or worse have them turn everyone on the community against me...

252,"Hey everyone! I’m in need of some more perspective on a tricky situation that happened to me today. So I made a reservation at a fairly popular hotel chain on Airbnb last Friday. I travelled about 9 hours in a car with two cats to reach my destination. I pull up to the front door and run into the lobby to check in - all of which went very smooth. I run back to my car and grab a bellhop cart on the way out to get both cats and their litter box up to the room ASAP since they’ve been in their crates for most of the day. But when I get to the room, all the lights are off except the bathroom and the tv is on which I thought was odd. I look immediately to the right into the bathroom and see pee in the toilet and stuff all over the counter. My immediate thought is “Oh great! They sent me to a dirty room in the midst of a pandemic!!!” But as I walked further into the room I see an open suitcase, and luckily no one there to greet me... at this point, my blood is boiling and I immediately exit the room. I return to the lobby with my cats in tow and tell the front desk person that there’s been some sort of mistake and that the room was occupied and that luckily there wasn’t anyone in the room when I entered. She seems apologetic and gets me a new room number and fixed my keycards within a minute. I can barely speak or look at her and I just take the cards and walk away to bring my screaming cats to the new room. I was so flustered that I ended up locking both keycards in the room and had to return to the front desk. I was pretty upset at this point, and the same lady at the front desk that had just helped me asks what my room number was... whatever... I get a new keycard and ask to see a manager. He was very understanding and can tell I’m visibly upset (I get teary eyed when I’m frustrated). He said he will investigate what happened and why it happened and I end up getting two entrée vouchers for the hotel restaurant and little to no explanation. So I guess some questions I have for you all would be: 

1. Would you be satisfied with this resolution? 
2. Do you think the hotel would notify the guest that I entered their room? I’m doubtful that they would, so if not, would you take it upon yourself to let that person know somehow? Maybe a note? 
3. How can I get some peace of mind that my cats will be okay when I leave them alone in my room tomorrow? I just feel so uneasy about leaving them now. Not only that, I feel I violated someone’s privacy and that it very well could easily happen to me.",17Sep2020,1

255,"I have pretty bad ruminating thoughts and I constantly think about the bad things my ex did. It’s been about 2 years since the breakup. It really upsets to an extreme degree and the thoughts are constantly on a loop so it exhausts me. I just recently started therapy but we haven’t gone over this issue yet. 

I’ve been wanting to message him telling him how much pain I’m in because of the things he did hoping that it will relieve me of the stress. I’m hoping for an apology/to have my feelings validated. The last goodbye message was kind so I was hoping he’d have some compassion in him to do that.

I hope someone who relates to the ruminating can chime in. It’s really painful, almost like it gives me a headache. I don’t know how to explain it well. It’s the only reason I’d want to reach out is to relieve that anger. If it helps to understand better, think about when you’ve had an argument with someone and you go over it in your head later wishing you’d said something different. My ruminating over this is kind of like that but it’s really intense and it drains me.

So any advice on whether I should reach out or continue not messaging him",17Sep2020,1

addiction versus distraction versus happiness 

dopamine and brains chemicals are interchangeable

what would make something a sin? what makes something immoral? if it is hurting someone...adulatory would be making atleast one party endulge in something that would release great dopamine...it could be hurting one person and helping another with dopamine/chemicals as a guild 

how are we able to resist activity that produces dopamine? conciseness and maybe it was produced as a way to evualuye the legitimacy of dopamine as a way to evolve...dopamine is the old way of evaluating what is good and eventually we will realize the damage it can cause and we will evolve towards something that is similar to a computer in the way that it makes decisions 

dopamine seems rather 21st century thought ridden but maybe higher intelligence has the ability to decipher between dopamine ridden decisions and the best decisions and therefore would be the next evolution evidence of this world be lower intelligence people not being able to control their spending habits 

test spending habits and intelligence 

this is all biased 

all of this assumes that humans/natural evolution would be able to decipher what is good, survival is good, 

what put natural selection into place? 

would humans eventually evolve to become with a physical being? artificial intelligence? 

emotions are a counter product of conciosunessk

emotions would keep one from killing their offspring even though the offspring is inferior, but the offspring could still provide a benefit to the whole of the race if they fulfill their potential 

ai is the culmination of emotionless, consciousness but could lead to killing of offspring who could provide a net benefit if they fulfill their full potential...what would be after ai? 

i would want to assume addiction is a malfunction of the dopamine system because it feels bad 

suicide could be the method of eliminating the consciousness that is too emotionally connected for actual progress. we could all be in pain but it is manageable until a better method is adopted, ai?, but suicide is the way to rid of the extremely emotionally attached 

all of these thoughts are the surface and rather shallow fuck me",17Sep2020,1
258,"Hello!
I am a college senior in the US and I was on the route to a medical career. I'm the first in my family to go to college and was always told that college was my only option at a good life. I enjoy learning, but i've never given a rats ass for math and science classes. My drive to get a specific medical job has encouraged me to push through the tediousness and boring nature of the many science classes. But, after having done more research and hearing from those in the field, and some soul searching, I've learned that this career isn't that great after all. I can't shake the feeling that I need to have a career picked out soon. As of now all I want is to be able to support myself financially and afford a place on my own and get my life started.

260,"Hello, I know how this sounds but a little over a year ago, I (21F) broke up with my fiancé (21M). We were together for 3.5yrs and planned on getting married 1 month before I ended things.
 After I broke up with him, I realized I was in an abusive relationship. Basically, he was extremely controlling, told me who I could be friends with and who I couldn’t, told me what I could wear and all that. He would also often blame my parents and isolate me from whoever he could. I ended believing there was no one for me and that I needed him. He cheated on me but basically told me I could even interact with guys at all.

Anyway, I ended things with him but I haven’t recovered from any of his shit. He found a new girl about 3mo after the breakup. However, I kinda realized throughout the relationship, he would basically convince me and coerce me into doing sexual stuff. I held out for the longest and refused actual sex (like we did other things except having sex if that makes sense) but I finally caved when he kept begging and begging and even used the military as an excuse. He decided to go to the military and told me he might not see me for a year and basically kept begging until I gave in. I said we can do it once but of course he got me to sleep with him 3 more times on top of that.

It’s been like a year now but I just realized a week ago this might’ve been sexual abuse. Was it? Where do I go? I can’t talk to my parents, they’re extremely conservative and would go nuts if they find out I slept with him. I’ve been thinking about a therapist but haven’t been able to get one.

I wanna clarify, he never forced me. But he kept begging and begging until he convinced me. He also started the sexual stuff early in the relationship without even asking. He were just kissing once and he just took it kinda far. I’m sorry if this is just stupid.. but I kinda have to know. Please help me if you can. I don’t know where to go or what to do.

That being said...
I’ve had a lot of family drama the past year that has left me feeling pretty distant from my siblings (We are all in our early 20’s/late teens so usually families are still tight knit at this point). 
My husband and I have just taken the space we need from the toxic relationships that were happening even if they do live in the same city, we just politely choose not to interact.

NOW: my birthday is Friday and my mom is coming into town and I know that she will be inviting all of my family in the area to go out to dinner for my birthday, whether I want to be around them or not. 

She did this to me last year and it just turned out to be a miserable way to spend my birthday and the whole time I just wanted to leave.

I’m asking for advice for how I can avoid this situation! Any idea is helpful! I just feel trapped and don’t think it’s fair for me to have to feel uncomfortable on my birthday.

I was in middle school at the time and didn't talk to a lot of people, but me and this girl in my science class got along real well, so I got her snap so we could be friends. Long story short, I cheated on my at the time girlfriend, I won't say that I was raped, cause I didn't want to fuck her but I feel like I could have stopped it looking back. Fast forward to a couple days ago. I met this girl on snap and we started talking, we tried long distance dating and it didn't work. We decided to just be friends with benefits, but loyal. Honestly, I forgot about this and got another fuck buddy, kinda. She added me off snap randomly. She seemed cool, so we texted and she eventually sent me nudes, me being a horny teenager, I sent one back. Her and I had an argument and I blocked her. I texted the more recent girlfriend and asked if I was the only guy. She said yea, I only want you. She then asked if she was the only girl and I said now you are, I blocked them recently. I had another fuck buddy before her and I dated that was still trying shit, but I didn't do anything back and blocked her. We then argued about how I basically cheated on her for a couple hours. Obviously I regret it and wish I had remembered that we said we'd stay loyal. She gave me another chance and is even helping me kick a porn addiction now.

My family is very Republican, they are the definition of Fox News watchin', Back The Blue Supporting, Anti-BLM Trump supporters, and while I still love them they have become so obnoxious with everything because I don't like Trump like they do (today my father went from listening to me complaining about customers at work to him ranting about the BLM protests calling them Riots and being full of thugs in less than a minute). Regardless of that I think Donald Trump is the worst president we ever had and it doesn't take much evidence to prove as such.

Because of my distaste for Trump, my family have automatically assumed I'm a hardcore liberal communist who will vote for Joe Biden by default (which is like 25% true), when in reality I despise Biden as much as I do Trump. I don't think either candidate is fit to be president and either way this country goes we will be screwed over in the long run.

They aren’t upset with me they said just come in when I am “feeling better” but I know this isn’t something that just goes away it’s recurring . My question is should I attempt to even go back in again? I can’t keep going in and leaving early it’s unprofessional, also they are being totally cool and understanding about me needing extended time off to get well. This is just the first time I’ve experienced this in my life so I don’t even know what to do. Any thoughts / suggestions 🙏

280,"My (17F) friend, lets call him Andy (19M) just got out of a relationship with his girlfriend (17F) of two years. I have been friends with his girlfriend for many years, and iv been close with him since before they became a couple. His girlfriend dumped him out of the blue; quite harshly I would say. They had a relatively toxic and co-dependent relationship for the last 5 months in my opinion. They both suffer from mental illness such as anxiety and depression and were consistently helping each other through suicidal episodes. 

After she broke up with him, he absolutely lost it. I had to pick him up at 3am and take him to the hospital, because he confessed that he was going to end his life. While he was at the hospital, she texted him that she had fallen for someone else. She told him details about their sexual experiences together, and that she stopped loving and caring about him months ago. She also mentioned that they had been ""talking"" for a few months at the least. 

Andy has decided that he wants revenge. He wants to catfish her new boyfriend, get him to be unfaithful, and show her the conversation. His ultimate goal is to break them up. This is where I feel very torn. 

On one hand, I have been to hell and back with this guy and I want to help him however I can. I have explained to him that doing this probably won't make him feel any better, and might be counter-productive. I have explained other options such as therapy, researching healthy coping mechanisms etc. although he won't budge on trying to end their relationship. 

I see how much he's hurting, and it's not that she doesn't deserve it, but morally I feel it's wrong. As much as I hate her right now, and lost respect for her, she is still my friend of over 6 years, and I feel ""girl code"" might apply here. It's not my business to get involved in her relationship. Yes she acted like an AH by messaging him so brutally, but ending the relationship because it's what she wanted? well that's completely valid.

 I have also maintained throughout this mess that I am trying not to take sides, although that is easier said than done. I don't want to lose either of them, 

As a person, I tend to have very strong values and morals in general. I strongly believe that two wrongs don't make a right, and he needs to start processing this loss in a positive environment. But he is set firm on taking this route with every fiber of his being. 

I love this kid, I really do, he is one of my best friends and I am scared for him right now. I am the only one he is talking to about this stuff, and I don't want that to stop because I fear he will be in danger. I know it is not my responsibility to keep him safe, but I would rather that than the alternative. 

I need advice on how to proceed. Do I support and help him in making this decision that I believe will be a mistake? Or do I stick by my morals, feel better about my personal actions, and risk him losing his main/only support system, and possibly putting him in danger?

Any advice here would be greatly, greatly appreciated.",17Sep2020,1

283,"Hello, I am a freshman in college and I am getting to the point where online school is starting to bother me a lot. I always viewed that I would be able to learn more about myself and have new experiences around this time because I will be in college living away from my parents for the first time. Well all my classes ended up being online this year so it was a waste of 8000$ to spend on a dorm so i decided I should stay home. This is starting to affect me mentally now because every once in a while I would be thinking about all the things I could be doing when I am in college and how free I would be. But now I feel like these experiences were robbed from me as if I lost the choice I had. I feel trapped in my house.  I can not get my licence because covid closed the dmv licence test and my parents were stubborn AF these last 2 years.(they legit would not let me take the test in the dmv because they did not want to pay for insurance) .  Thinking about what I am missing out is tearing me apart in the inside time to time. I feel like I will never get the college experience I always thought I would and I will be stuck with my parents forever(I know this isn't true or I hope its not true but thats how I feel) . Also when I do homework i don't enjoy doing I sometimes feel like I am getting tortured because unlike school I don't really have people I can go and talk to after I finish work to lighten my mood, I have to wait a till the evening until my friends come outside to feel a bit refreshed but until then I feel stuck at home with homework I hate doing. I can't just ignore these feeling because that is just a temporary solution. What is a permanent way I can deal with the way I am feeling.

285,"Last year I did a lot of awful things. There are a few people who know about my actions and I’m terrified that one day I’ll run into those people again. 

I’m the same way with people from high school, if I were to ever see a former classmate in public I’d go running the other direction. I did sleep around a lot in high school because I had very bad self esteem issues and was bullied and called a slut for 4 years. This is what people know me by in high school or at least in my mind they do. I’m not sure. 

Here lately, being hauled up at home due to the pandemic I’ve been thinking why I can’t move forward and do things that would make me successful. Like losing weight, because I had a baby a few months back. I feel like I don’t deserve it. Like this is my punishment for everything that I’ve ever done. I don’t attempt to better myself because I’m afraid something terrible will happen as a result if I do.

Last year, I was promoted and fired within the same week. I had worked so hard for that promotion, I had so much confidence at the time that I even finally hired a personal trainer because I had always wanted to compete in body building. All within the same week I was promoted, fired, and had shilled out 500$ to a trainer that I could no longer pay. 

I had the most confidence I had ever had in my life and the rug was ripped out from under me. It was embarrassing. I had everyone in the company on facebook and Instagram so I just nuked and deleted all my social media. 

After high school I got away so I’d never have to see my classmates again. Now, for a straight year I have been held up in my house because I’m too afraid to face the people that saw my downfall. 

The weight of my mistakes is crushing. Will people always look at me and think “there’s the girl who slept around in high school, there’s the girl who got fired because she was gossiping and spreading rumors about herself” which yes, is the reason they told me I was being let go. I didn’t understand. But recalling back to the time, I knew my coworkers didn’t like me being promoted so I cried to another woman about feeling left out in the office when I shouldn’t have said anything. The HR person found out and let me go. I take full responsibility. But still, humiliating.

286,"My parents are beyond strict asf like they are REALLY strict. It’s rare that they’d ever buy anything for me or smt like that. And when I ask if I can get a job and debit card so I can pay for my own stuff, they also won’t let me due to the fact that they want me to be fully dependent on them, all the way into my adulthood because they are really manipulative and want me to have to follow through with the EXACT plans they want for me in life. I cant do that and want my own life and not live the depressing one my parents have set for me. As soon as I’m eighteen I’ve got to move away from them because of how manipulative they are. I’m legally old enough to work but idk how that works here tbh, because I’m not a citizen but i am a permanent resident of the US who’s allowed to work here as well. I’ve also seen multiple people with extremely strict parents like mine get jobs and stuff. And I would really appreciate the money because I’m willing to work hard so I can own some nice things through the rest of hs and be able to move out easily at eighteen. I asked this on another social platform and they told me to come to reddit for advice because apparently people on here have advice for ANYTHING so please find me advice for this. The criteria is it doesn’t have to require parental consent because they won’t let me work, and I don’t need a debit/credit card and can get paid directly because they refuse to get me one of those as well. And at least where I live, nobody looks for babysitting, tutoring and in house things like mowing. It’s also unsafe to do that around here. Please give me some advice on this.",17Sep2020,1

290,"There’s a tldr for anyone who doesn’t want to read this novel. 

I don’t like my best friend of 5 years anymore. To give the context of why I feel this way without revealing too much personal information I want to start with this, he did something wrong. Something that was morally and legally wrong and he spent time facing the consequences. The part that really gets me was when he was caught the first time doing it he lied to me about it, and the second time and then the third time for months he looked me in the eyes and lied everyday and I believed every word whole heartedly. 

Despite this I stuck with him as a friend through all the legal stuff and stigma around the nature of his crime. But in the back of my mind I just lost all trust in him. To give him some credit he admitted to it many months afterwards to me but there wasn’t necessarily any apology for his manipulation and deception. This stuck with me and is really eating at me, even a year later.

Some more petty reasons why I’m pretty much done with him are the following. His readiness to point others shortcoming but when on the other side he takes it like a coward, for lack of a better word. We live together and doesn’t keep things very clean, which is annoying to me. He also shows zero initiative in actually improving his life, it’s just half ass attempts, and it sucks because I don’t want him to fail. I listen to him vent about shit but when I try to I feel ignored, it’s seems like he doesn’t care. Every time he does something wrong and inconsiderate he just plays it off, which is ironic since he’s said multiple times I have no respect for others. 

And admittedly I can be really difficult to like, but fuck at least I try man. 

I stuck through it with him at a bad time in his life and I just don’t think I can keep going. I don’t like speaking to him but I feel admitting these thing would be awkward since we live with each other, and probably will be living with each other for a decent amount of time. 

TLDR: My best friend lied to me many times about bad shit he did, and I lost trust in him. He also does generally inconsiderate things and doesn’t own up to it, but is ready to point the finger at others. I want to let him know I don’t want to be his friend anymore but we live with each other so I think it would be too awkward. What is your advice?",17Sep2020,1

I never agreed to do it, as I saw the text about an hour after he said he was going to sleep, but I still planned to do it later on.

However, after moving home and disclosing my marijuana use(which is legal in my state for those over the age of 21, a demographic that I myself fall into) my doctor told me I would be required to discontinue all marijuana use and submit myself to random drug tests in order to get a prescription I need to function. I know I’m not educated in the field of medicine like my practitioner is, however I have done extensive research regarding the effects of mixing my medication with marijuana, and the interaction isn’t anywhere close to harmful. I’ve smoked while taking my prescriptions as indicated by my doctors in the past and I’ve never found issue. Is this legal?

So, for the context, back in 2018 I was seeing a guy for ""sports"", during almost a year. I kinda fell in love but we quit seeing each other, he found a gf for a couple months and I went on with my life. 

In September 2019, he wanted to see me again, and of course I ran back into his arms. At the same time, I accepted a job offer to start 6 months later - march 2020. This job told me that I would need to go to Austria for 6 months, and I thought it was not a big deal since I didn't have a proper boyfriend at the time. 

The thing is, we started dating ""for real"" shortly after I signed. In March 2020, when France got through confinement, we spent it together, and it took our relationship to a whole new level : it was absolutely great. 

I thought that because of Covid, my job would cancel the 6 months in Austria, especially because it is really starting to go bad again in France. But this morning, my boss told me that he just got confirmation that I would be leaving in 2 weeks, they are taking care of finding housing for me. 

I am in a mild state of panic, because I thought this obligation would be cancelled. My boyfriend cannot come with me for professional reasons, and the original deal with my job was that I would spend 2 weeks in Austria, then 2 weeks in France for the 6 months. But the way my boss told me sounded like I would spend the whole time in Austria.

I asked her if she or any of our family who she lives with were symptomatic and if they too had tested positive and to please let me know if there was anything I could do to help. She didn’t reply. I decided to tell my sister who in turn told my parents. 

This cousin also spends a lot of time with our grandparents who are in their 80s (runs errands, etc) so when my dad found out she tested positive this morning he called me and asked me to follow up with her to get more details see if she had had recent contact with our grandparents (my dad’s parents) so he could help them get tested if needed. (He has also been to their home to fix a leak this week so he too would need to get tested) Out of respect he wanted to make sure he had all the info before blabbing all around that she had tested positive, and give her the chance to tell everyone first. She again didn’t reply. So my dad just called my grandparents and told them and they are now getting tested. 

By this point it had been 24 hours of radio silence from my cousin, so I texted her a third and final time to let her know no response was necessary anymore, my dad was helping our grandparents get tested regardless, and that it was inconsiderate of her to be withholding this kind of information. That’s verbatim what I said. 

Hours later, this evening, she responded with a 5 paragraph text lashing out at me about how hurt she was that I would think she wouldn’t tell our grandparents (who she has been in contact with, and has exposed) and how my text was hurtful and it “rose emotion in her” so she didn’t want to respond right away “and say something out of anger”.  And how she is “really sad I’m not being more supportive during this hard time for her”. It was such a long, angry and honestly hurtful to me text that I wondered if she had misread my text or accidentally texted me instead of someone else. That’s how out of left field it was. So I didn’t even reply. 

I guess I’m just wondering if I’m in the wrong here. I felt I was supportive, but out of concern for my more vulnerable family members, and not knowing who else she had told, and honestly how careless she has been with social distancing, I wanted to make sure everyone who needed to get tested was doing so. Was I wrong here? Should I just have waited for her to respond? 

tl;dr Am I a jerk for asking my cousin questions after she tested positive for Covid and has been in contact with the older members of our family?",17Sep2020,1

Yesterday I had one of those days where I progressively felt worse as the day went on. I don't know what caused this, I really don't, but I fear it's not only having an impact on me, but also on the people that I talk with. I interpret mean things into innocent sentences and start to get a bit passive aggressive. I want to change this behavior of mine in such a situation because I worry about possibly worsening my relations to the ones around me, especially if they're someone special to me, like my love interest. We had a little talk yesterday and I told her that I just don't feel so good. But is that enough? What if it happens again?

333,"I'm writing this with career in mind, but I would say this applies to life in general. If I listen to people in isolation and hear their thoughts on why their life choices or careers are good or bad, I can see their point and agree. Yet, when I compare these people's thoughts and opinions to others, there doesn't seem to be any universal consistency.

For instance, on one hand, there are people who say graduate school is a terrible time investment and suggest that from a financial standpoint, it is one of the worst things you could do (with the exception of intellectual pursuit). Yet, I also heard from a professor who has a startup funded for around 10 million dollars. I try to consolidate these two seemingly contradictory with the argument of survivorship bias and that the professor was passionate about his research.

But then that got me thinking. My choice of pursuing a Master's in Computer Science...was I wrong for choosing it for pragmatic reasons, rather than for the sake of what I was really passionate about? I thought that I was right to study CS, since it could give me opportunities to work remotely and maybe even start my own business. But, wouldn't it be harder to distinguish myself/find success since so many other people are getting into software engineering?

Maybe the key to success is in pursuing what you're passionate about? Maybe I should've chosen to study bioengineering or genetic engineering (I was interested in things like how to genetically modify brain cells to react to light). Maybe it's not too late. I don't know, my mind's a bit jumbled right now. All I can really make of all this is that, when it comes to success at least, market demand is first priority, then maybe passion comes second. After all, just because you are passionate about art/music doesn't mean that directly correlates to monetary success (nobody might care about the genre of music you make).

But, demand and passion might not necessarily be mutually exclusive, either. Like, the video game developers who made Minecraft, Undertale, and Stardew Valley. They were all passionate about what they did, and were paid handsomely with millions or even billions---this in an industry infamous for underpaying developers. Again, it's all just confusing to me. There just seems to be contradictions wherever I look to what I should do with my own career.

I guess my question can be condensed down to: what is the truth when it comes to the question of succeeding in your career/business pursuits? Does passion take precedence over demand, or is it the other way around? Or is it a different mindset/frame of understanding entirely?",17Sep2020,1
334,"Hi,

I'm sorry if this post is messy, I'm pretty much writing off the top of my head and venting because I need advice on this.

So I'm (M/24) currently in my 2nd-3rd year of University (delayed university due to mandatory enlistment). I am struggling to make school decisions, mainly based on my school performance and the amount of classes i should take for this current semester to follow my plan on graduating at a certain time.

So during my early years of university, I wanted to pursue Computing Science however my high school grades were not good enough, so I went to college and did some easy classes to get into my desired university &amp; program. 2 years later, I get accepted into the university... but not the program. So I spend ANOTHER year taking easy courses (2-3 each semester) to maintain a high GPA, and finally during this Summer 2020, I get accepted into my program. Woohoo!

However, I think taking less/easy courses throughout university has made me develop an unhealthy study habit and scared to pursue taking more classes (4 each semester). I have fear that I'll do terrible which will lower my GPA and I'm worried that if I continue to do bad enough, I'll eventually get kicked from the program. My ideal time that I have planned out to graduate is in 2 years (because I feel like I'm being left behind and stupid for not finishing fast enough). I have already fallen off my plan as I've dropped 1 class, and I'm already considering dropping another due to the amount of work I'm not used to.

I also rely on being a full time student to take student loans to pay off tuition but also just general daily things. Dropping one more course will result in me not being able to receive the loan I need. The reason is because I spend too much time trying to catch up on studies, which makes me feel I wouldn't be able to handle both a job a school simultaneously. I know many people who take so many courses and a job at the same time, but the idea of that makes me feel so stressed that I'm scared to try.

I've considered the options of either trying to continue my current workload and hope for the best (although I know the results wont be good) OR dropping a course to slowly ease myself until I am more comfortable but will delay everything. This whole dilemma may also be a result of whether I'm happy and want to pursue Computing Science even though I don't love it (pressure from my dad has made me think i should continue that field of work. But that's a WHOLE different inner problem that I have to dealing with).

Thank you in advance for the help. Cheers.",17Sep2020,1

I really really like him as a person, it’s not really a crush because 1. age gap 2. he’s married.

343,"I don't even know how to begin this all. I'm currently studying software engineering writing my bachelor thesis at a company. I'm at 100% home office. I wake up at around 7 - clock into work from my phone. Stand up at around 7:30. I don't want to eat or drink anything. Have to force myself to do so. Have to force myself to clean up afterwards. Make a coffee. Think now I'm going to be productive - sit on my pc, close all distractions, listen to lofi maybe - get exactly nothing done. I get super stressed out and start doing something else to distract myself from .. myself basically. I call a good friend who is at home so I don't have to be alone with my thoughts.

I havent written a word in 2 weeks. The thesis is due in about 1 month.

My girlfriend broke up with me recently. She moved pretty far away since things didn't work out too good between us and she wanted to study in another city. She thought the distance will help me working on myself. She moved to a very young and social city. I was there. The average age is .. maybe 30? Maybe even younger. She is at parties until 6 in the morning, corona apparently doesn't exist there i don't know. I get crazy over it. I know I love her but I almost had trust issues. I can't sleep until she texts me when she's gone. I get jealous of all her opportunies. I get jealous because she is good at her work. I constricted her when she lived in my city. I'm fucking dumb and I can't help myself. I don't want to do it. I tried so hard not to, but I make myself so dependend on her that I can't stand the thought of her leaving me or cheating on me.

Since she broke up I'm even more lost. And at the same time I notice she's .. pretty fine with it. Probably tired of our relationship and maybe even glad it's over. No one that clinges to her.

She wasn't perfect. She can be manipulative also has a mild boderline personality. But she was able to do everything I wish I was able to do. She could just dance careless, she enjoyed the small things like cooking or just lying on the bed and listing to music, she loves nature, she is freaking beautiful (I know it shouldn't be so important but I've never seen a woman who I was more attracted to in my life I think). And these are probably the reasons I loved her and .. and the same time was mean to her. Because I realized I couldn't be like that. I am full of fears, anxiety and depression that holds me back. I got so jealous. I was just a bad boyfriend to her and now I pay the price for it.

I'm also living in a city that I don't like anymore. I live here since 16 years now - it's a small city. Not much going on. I've been where she moved and there is so much going on .. like I described above. Now I can't stand my city anymore. Old people everywhere, no parties etc. I don't know if I would even attend these parties because of my social anxiety I have sometimes (I do get out and meat people, it's getting better) but I still have that I don't even have the option to do so here in my city. It's just bars .. a few of them. That's it. No club (I'm interested in), no open space for something like an open air festival.

I'm currently thinking about finishing my bachelor and then moving somewhere else. But I have no Idea where and also what I will do for work. I don't see myself working 40h a week - I can't handle it at the moment. I even doubt I'll finish my bachelor in time. I get nothing done. Especially in the mornings life is so difficult. I wrote this text in the evening where I was feeling .. almost ""motivated"" and now it's the next morning already 10pm .. did nothing. Can barely eat because I'm so stressed out. Had no dinner last night. 

I contacted my ex and we talked a bit. And I immediately feel like I HAVE to know what she did in the meantime. She came home at almost 11 in the evening yesterday and I wanted to know where she was so bad. I did not ask her. But the urge is hard. And all this stress I'm making myself on top of the thesis .. it's hard.

I don't even know what I want from this post. I'm already in therapy. I just want to talk to someone I guess. Let it all out. And maybe get some advice.

345,"Alternative Title: Took An L Recently (18-22F)

First post so I'm not sure if I'm doing this right but I'll go ahead and try: 

I've felt very violated and panicked over something that happened a bit earlier this week. Only one person witnessed this so that is probably an overreaction and it's actually very rare that I overreact. But that gives you insight on how big this is for me. I know how many more important things are happening and how trivial this should be. It is truly a privileged problem, but still being, I am genuinely struggling to move past it. It is just so intimate for me and I feel invaded on in a personal way that I was never prepared for. 

What happened just keeps replaying for me over and over until I literally, physically hit and slap myself over the head or in the face to ""shake it off."" Which is something I've never done but has suddenly become my new habit, where a few times a day I commit to this physical impulse to counter the intrusive thoughts I deal with. It's formed as a new normal thing I do without question, just starting back a bit less than a week ago and now it feels semi instinctual which I can recognize as probably a bad sign that my brain is treading on 'developing an unnatural reflex' territory. But I don't care much about that because I don't do it incredibly hard. I'm not getting brain damage over some light hitting. It just grabs my attention. There's never even a mark. 
I do this solely to distract me from what unfortunate image I was seeing (the event) and it does its job temporarily. I do have OCD and this is probably my latest compulsion but I have enough self control &amp; awareness to manage which obsessions and compulsions manifest in me long term vs short term. I can never stop or prevent a new O or C from forming of course, but I can for the most part have some say in what it will be. Such as a point in time where I had to count to a certain number constantly throughout the day until one day I flipped a switch and shifted from that to constantly scribbling on everything. I can fine tune and adapt what specifically will take over my mind next. So I don't fear that I'll fall into a self harm trap or anything. If I try enough, I can definitely get myself to not commit any violence against me. I have that under control and handled. I just don't want to stop that mild hitting tick I have going on until there is something better to keep me away from what happened aka another tried &amp; proven method that will keep my mind off what's freaking me out near 24/7. This sounds incredibly dramatic and I'm not sure I can excuse it, but I'm just being entirely honest at the moment. I can't say why I act how I do, so I'll just leave it at the 'how.'

&lt;Interlude over&gt;

The event being, that I'm pretty sure my relative saw my inappropriate search history. 

I know most anticipate being caught or that the odds catch up to them eventually, but for over half my life I've managed to avoid that possibility. I've been unscathed and so maybe I started becoming too confident and it made me messy, which got me to finally slip up recently. 

I truly thought I wouldn't have to face this inevitable day. As they all say, ""I'm normally so careful."" 
But in fact, there never was any personal, special porn guardian looking over me apparently. I'm 99% sure I'm plain BUSTED here.

I don't want to elaborate what sort of content I was searching but it is truly abnormal. No one would understand it with an ease or accept as an interest for someone they know--or that they thought they knew. This qualifies under, ""you'll never look at someone the same after finding out what they're into."" 
By far. 
No exaggeration. 
I'm not even the expected demographic to be into it. It isn't just kinky, but instead a pretty disturbing fetish (doesn't hurt anyone else/any breathing entity out there don't worry), that I'm aware to definitely stem from my prior experiences that started in childhood. I don't like sounding typical nor whiny but I'm sure it classifies as 'unresolved trauma.' And even if it doesn't count, I can definitely say that this fetish porn &amp; erotica I'm into is entirely a developed coping mechanism and has been for a LONG time.

A fetish that I can become too dependent on at times and even obsessed with at certain points. But I do really give my all to avoid that length of obsession, and also extensively usually try my hardest to keep a secret and unknown to everyone. I'm not self accepting of this behavior even though I constantly engage in it, or off-and-on engage with it these days I suppose.
I feel compelled to mention for full context that I DON'T LIKE how often it has been for me to chronically search this wild shit ever since I was only 8 years old. I really try to stay away and at times I do succeed. But when I feel I need it, I'm so indulgent and reliant on it that I can't just be satisfied by searching incognito or clearing my history afterwards. I can't just do ""a quick fix."" I have my favorite sources I like to go back to so I have many related bookmarks. And related, I somehow like subconsciously or something, believe that it is less risky to have bookmarks on your device than email yourself every link you want saved. With the logic that your device will eventually give out on you (2-3 yrs for smartphones usually). And that your phone will already not usually wind up in the hands of others, and that I keep a passlock on regardless which serves the same purpose. Whereas, it is a very regular occurence for email platforms to get hacked and for people to intentionally seek &amp; try to hack emails. 
Much more, than it is for your phone and computer content to get hacked or leaked. Random attacks are common for emailing sites. Not so much entire cell phones. I think of it like, 'Who's entire browser application gets compromised outside of viruses, or cause from government tracking purposes?' And it's not like I'm breaking the law so there isn't much likelihood the FEDS will randomly bang on my door one day because they've noticed I'm into weird shit, so all the same this is obviously not my main concern.

If this line of reasoning is very accurate I can't say. 
But that's my reason for bookmarking over emailing. And as for any other alternative, I'm not sure what that would be. Let me know if you have some.

How this went down was pretty simple.
An older family member (authority figure), pretty much decided to show me some options I have on my phone since we have the same model, essentially by force.

Why? They're just controlling like that to be honest. 

It wasn't very important but that's just how they are. And they wouldn't let me just follow their verbal walkthrough while I went along as I physically handled my phone myself, so instead I had to just stand by and watch what they did on it. And what eventually happens is... that they accidentally end up in the wrong place (too quickly for me to predict or process at first) and stumble upon one of my installed browsers where past searches or bookmarked searches pop up automatically the moment you enter the cursor or by the time the keyboard sensor shows up. That's hard for me to explain, but just picture yourself trying to type something into a search engine and then visualize memorized options popping up even before you finish your new search. 

So, yep. That what's happened.

And because my phone wasn't totally facing me, I'm not sure if they had enough time to see those options (the past searches that would show up would definitely be crazy/weird fetishes I've mentioned). But if so, they had approximately thirty seconds to read and interpret what they were seeing. And it was more than one search, which makes it very obvious that I was looking up this graphic &amp; bizarre material with complete intention. Therefore, it would be clear as day that I didn't accidentally look this stuff up or come across it. They would have seen variations of the same phrases multiple times.

Moving on...

They didn't mention at the time if they saw it and they haven't acted any differently since. But that could easily be explained by them wishing thay they didn't see it either. I doubt it's a respect thing in that case, because they never really regard me in that sort of way. Not even on the basic level often times. Along with that, they're not known to mind their business when it comes to me. So it's likely self motivated on their end to ignore the creepy and weird stuff they saw, if I'm to make that assumption. 
I try not to get caught up on the details of that moment because otherwise I will harp on it even more and feel excessively hopeless when I'm already discouraged enough, but I think I do vaguely recall their reaction at that moment; it was a minuscule and minute change in their face with a version of a blank stare as if they were surprised and quickly wanted to get away, and they seemed even more quiet than previously, as if they were breathing a bit less or something. Difficult to claim that since they weren't saying anything even before the searches (possibly) came up, but it seemed that somehow the room managed to get even quieter than before. This either genuinely happened or I imagined it. 
I don't know. 
But either way, they definitely had a very understated reaction if they had any reaction at all or if they even saw-what-I-think-did, to begin with.

Again, if so they tried to manage their definitely (would be) shocked reaction. I can tell that for sure because this was indeed a look of discomfort and 'just wanting to navigate away.' That's the best way I could describe it. And a minor and pretty controlled expression at the same time. I could translate their look to mean they had no desire to to make it clear that they saw it, or make any scene, etc.

So I guess that is the best reaction I could hope for, all considered. 
But that also sucks if I'm correct because that makes as evidence that they DID see what I'm afraid that they saw. If they didn't see anything strange, they would've had the same look they did before obviously, which would just be focusing on the task at hand instead of that change in reaction demonstrated.

One last time: there's a chance they saw, and also a chance they didn't have enough time to pay attention to it. 
Plus a chance that, at first they weren't sure what they saw but then they got to review and mull it over after I left their company or even some time later and ended up putting all the pieces together. 

This is a scenario I'm very worried about as well because my reaction was very quick and prompt but also maybe a bit obvious. Looking back, I remember that I was very quick to keep them away from the section/browser I observed them getting close to clinking on, to right before they finally ended up there. And once they did get there I was equally quick to explain that they were in the wrong place and needed to go somewhere else for what they were trying to do (the actual purpose to what they were showing/instructing me).

There really is no way to ever truly know what they did see. And there is no way to do damage control if they did see anything. 
That said, I'm at a loss for how to move on from this. I'm very private about what I find most intimate and this constitutes as one of those things for me.
On top of that, the person referred to is probably the last person I would ever want to know about this 'secret.' Yet, exactly the one to catch me. 

Is there literally anything I can do now? Or that I should do? A way to force myself to forget? A way to confront the situation and mislead them into thinking they saw something else utilizing some sort of explanatory lie, or even a manipulation tactic? 
What would you do? 
Keep in mind, that we don't have a good relationship.

Alright. Thanks, I guess.

Tldr; My fetish searches were likely seen by one--if not THE worst person possible. 
I'd like advice for what my next move should be in regards to action or even relieving myself of the associated stress psychologically. 

In advance, I'd prefer being told something outside of ""distract yourself"" or ""pretend it never happened"" &amp; everything related to that strategy. Speaking from my personal experience, I've found that really only works to an extent, over solving the underlying/deepest issue. And when there is a problem I like to legitimately solve it. So some longterm, solid, more concrete advice would be much appreciated.

I never want advice or help for all the heavy things I handle but for whatever reason this more light yet hard-to-predict-or-expect sort of occurence tends to always fuck me up and really stay with me.

I'm almost always with self control as well and my ability to compartmentalize assists in that. But that tool is useless during these moments.

(Feel free to skip to ""TLDR"" towards the end since this is so dragged out).

First post so I'm not sure if I'm doing this right but I'll go ahead and try: 

I'm feeling a lot of things. 
Most of all though, I'm feeling very violated and panicked in particular. 

This is all over something that happened a bit earlier this week. Only one person witnessed this so that is probably an overreaction and it's actually very rare that I overreact. But that gives you insight on how big this is for me. I know how many more important things are happening and how trivial this should be. It is truly a privileged problem, but still being, I am genuinely struggling to move past it. It is just so intimate for me and I feel invaded on in a personal way that I was never prepared for. 

What happened just keeps replaying for me over and over until I literally, physically hit and slap myself over the head or in the face to ""shake it off."" Which is something I've never done but has suddenly become my new habit, where a few times a day I commit to this physical impulse to counter the intrusive thoughts I deal with. It's formed as a new normal thing I do without question, just starting back a bit less than a week ago and now it feels semi instinctual which I can recognize as probably a bad sign that my brain is treading on 'developing an unnatural reflex' territory. But I don't care much about that because I don't do it incredibly hard. I'm not getting brain damage over some light hitting. It just grabs my attention. There's never even a mark. 
I do this solely to distract me from what unfortunate image I was seeing (the event) and it does its job temporarily. I do have OCD and this is probably my latest compulsion but I have enough self control &amp; awareness to manage which obsessions and compulsions manifest in me long term vs short term. I can never stop or prevent a new O or C from forming of course, but I can for the most part have some say in what it will be. Such as a point in time where I had to count to a certain number constantly throughout the day until one day I flipped a switch and shifted from that to constantly scribbling on everything. I can fine tune and adapt what specifically will take over my mind next. So I don't fear that I'll fall into a self harm trap or anything. If I try enough, I can definitely get myself to not commit any violence against me. I have that under control and handled. I just don't want to stop that mild hitting tick I have going on until there is something better to keep me away from what happened aka another tried &amp; proven method that will keep my mind off what's freaking me out near 24/7. This sounds incredibly dramatic and I'm not sure I can excuse it, but I'm just being entirely honest at the moment. I can't say why I act how I do, so I'll just leave it at the 'how.'

&lt;Interlude over&gt;

The event being, that I'm pretty sure my relative saw my inappropriate search history. 

I know most anticipate being caught or that the odds catch up to them eventually, but for over half my life I've managed to avoid that possibility. I've been unscathed and so maybe I started becoming too confident and it made me messy, which got me to finally slip up recently. 

I truly thought I wouldn't have to face this inevitable day. As they all say, ""I'm normally so careful."" 
But in fact, there never was any personal, special porn guardian looking over me apparently. I'm 99% sure I'm plain BUSTED here.

I don't want to elaborate what sort of content I was searching but it is truly abnormal. No one would understand it with an ease or accept as an interest for someone they know--or that they thought they knew. This qualifies under, ""you'll never look at someone the same after finding out what they're into."" 
By far. 
No exaggeration. 
I'm not even the expected demographic to be into it. It isn't just kinky, but instead a pretty disturbing fetish (doesn't hurt anyone else/any breathing entity out there don't worry), that I'm aware to definitely stem from my prior experiences that started in childhood. I don't like sounding typical nor whiny but I'm sure it classifies as 'unresolved trauma.' And even if it doesn't count, I can definitely say that this fetish porn &amp; erotica I'm into is entirely a developed coping mechanism and has been for a LONG time.

A fetish that I can become too dependent on at times and even obsessed with at certain points. But I do really give my all to avoid that length of obsession, and also extensively usually try my hardest to keep a secret and unknown to everyone. I'm not self accepting of this behavior even though I constantly engage in it, or off-and-on engage with it these days I suppose.
I feel compelled to mention for full context that I DON'T LIKE how often it has been for me to chronically search this wild shit ever since I was only 8 years old. I really try to stay away and at times I do succeed. 

But when I feel I need it, I'm so indulgent and reliant on it that I can't just be satisfied by searching incognito or clearing my history afterwards. I can't just do ""a quick fix."" I have my favorite sources I like to go back to so I have many related bookmarks. And related, I somehow like subconsciously or something, believe that it is less risky to have bookmarks on your device than email yourself every link you want saved. With the logic that your device will eventually give out on you (2-3 yrs for smartphones usually). And that your phone will already not usually wind up in the hands of others, and that I keep a passlock on regardless which serves the same purpose. Whereas, it is a very regular occurence for email platforms to get hacked and for people to intentionally seek &amp; try to hack emails. 
Much more, than it is for your phone and computer content to get hacked or leaked. Random attacks are common for emailing sites. Not so much entire cell phones. I think of it like, 'Who's entire browser application gets compromised outside of viruses, or cause from government tracking purposes?' And it's not like I'm breaking the law so there isn't much likelihood the feds will randomly bang on my door one day because they've noticed I'm into weird shit, so all the same this is obviously not my main concern.

If this line of reasoning is very accurate I can't say. 
But that's my reason for bookmarking over emailing. And as for any other alternative, I'm not sure what that would be. Let me know if you have some.

How this went down was pretty simple.
An older family member (authority figure), pretty much decided to show me some options I have on my phone since we have the same model, essentially by force.

Why? They're just controlling like that to be honest. 

It wasn't very important but that's just how they are. And they wouldn't let me just follow their verbal walkthrough while I went along as I physically handled my phone myself, so instead I had to just stand by and watch what they did on it. And what eventually happens is... that they accidentally end up in the wrong place (too quickly for me to predict or process at first) and stumble upon one of my installed browsers where past searches or bookmarked searches pop up automatically the moment you enter the cursor or by the time the keyboard sensor shows up. That's hard for me to explain, but just picture yourself trying to type something into a search engine and then visualize memorized options popping up even before you finish your new search. 

So, yep. That what's happened.

And because my phone wasn't totally facing me, I'm not sure if they had enough time to see those options (the past searches that would show up would definitely be crazy/weird fetishes I've mentioned). But if so, they had approximately thirty seconds to read and interpret what they were seeing. And it was more than one search, which makes it very obvious that I was looking up this graphic &amp; bizarre material with complete intention. Therefore, it would be clear as day that I didn't accidentally look this stuff up or come across it. They would have seen variations of the same phrases multiple times.

Moving on...

They didn't mention at the time if they saw it and they haven't acted any differently since. But that could easily be explained by them wishing thay they didn't see it either. I doubt it's a respect thing in that case, because they never really regard me in that sort of way. Not even on the basic level often times. Along with that, they're not known to mind their business when it comes to me. So it's likely self motivated on their end to ignore the creepy and weird stuff they saw, if I'm to make that assumption. 

I try not to get caught up on the details of that moment because otherwise I will harp on it even more and feel excessively hopeless when I'm already discouraged enough, but I think I do vaguely recall their reaction at that moment; it was a minuscule and minute change in their face with a version of a blank stare as if they were surprised and quickly wanted to get away, and they seemed even more quiet than previously, as if they were breathing a bit less or something.

349,"First post, throwaway account, mobile upload.

I'm (21f) recently single. I dated my best friend (22m) for one and a half years. During that time, I didn't realize it but he was always hating all of my friends, and slowly I stopped talking to them all. he also seems to have tried it with my family but on a much smaller scale and didn't succeed. Basically he was manipulating me into not having any friends or family to lean on. 

He pressured me on a lot of things, cheated on me, and manipulated me into having sex before I was ready. I was clear from the beginning that I did not want to have sex, if not until marriage then at least until he moved to the State I was living in. 

it was almost a year ago that we had sex, and we only did it once (barely counts, I was in too much pain, he never finished and we stopped after like 2 seconds.) It took me a long time to realize that I hadn't wanted to have sex, and he pressured me. I broke up with him for different reasons (cheating and I was depresses and didn't know why) and realized it happened thinking back on it. 

Since we've broken up I've managed to make a friend. I actually worked with him (~33) during my relationship, but didn't keep very good touch until recently because I subconsciously knew I wouldn't be allowed to actually hang out with him. 

I honestly don't know how to move on from what happened. I have nightly nightmares about my ex, the worst ones are the ones that are actually good memories or something. I keep waking up crying and having trouble breathing. I can't go to therapy at the moment for a number of reasons. 

I'm looking for any advice to help me move on from this. I haven't been able to hang out with my friend because of this, and I know he won't wait forever, and I wouldn't want him to. I also just really want to stop crying about this.",17Sep2020,1

 our meetings continuously (We would agree to meet up and she'd come up with an excuse at the last minute every single time) while i was making huge efforts to meet her,

364,"hi. i have,, minor anxiety? it's been chilling bc of quarantine monotony. anyways. i get a tad triggered by suicide in general (but especially jokes about k*lling oneself? where it can be taken seriously. idk if this makes sense. sorry in advance) bc of the context behind my past suicide attempt. issue: my best friend has started to use humor to cope with stuff, i think? her parents are pretty disapproving of therapy. but also i'm one of her closest friends. do i tell her that joking about suicide has the potential to rly fuck me up some days? i worry that she won't confide in me otherwise. she's been sending jokes abt losing her will to live n shit that make me think,,,,,, ah ha ha,,,,, but are u good. and that little tendril of ""what if?"" tends to become a monster in its own right.  that train of thought leads me to being selfish because who am i to reject a coping mechanism if i'm sensitive to it????? i'm her friend and that should be unconditional? 

anyways. please help. should i just. not. (also unrelated but my reluctance to have human decency and be an unconditionally loving friend has just grown immensely. i dunno. maybe throw me a bone about how to motivate myself for social interaction. now that everythings online, ive literally just downgraded all my friendships to acquaintances because of how little i interact even when i reach out. i speak to maybe two people on a kind of regular basis outside of school and one of them is said friend. please. i crave social validation but i'm simultaneously cringing at the idea of breaking my routine to spend time with people outside family.)",17Sep2020,1

My mother is not a good person, I'm not saying this as oh she's done one thing bad here or there I mean generally just not great. Some examples are,

I have 3 brothers, 2 older and 1 younger. None of us have the same father as she cheated on every one of our fathers with someone else ending each marriage.  Through lying and lawyers she financially screwed over 2 of our dads for life (one being mine who's now in his late 50s and has only now been able to purchase his own house) 

Lied about having cancer to me and my youngest brother just to end an argument and have us feel bad for her only to tell us never to tell anyone about it not even older brothers, which was very suspicious and after looking into it she did infect lie and never had cancer. 

Often would wake me up in the middle of the night to tell me my cat or rabbit had died and she needed help to bury them only for me to find them just fine and her then make a comment about how its the only way I'd get out of bed (context for this example was while I was very depressed after she gutted my father's savings left him and wouldn't allow me to see him) 

Forced me (18 at the time) and my younger brother(16 at the time) to start paying 600$ rent each on top of the Child support my dad was paying. 
She makes well over 90k a year with her job plus the Child support cheques. 

The list goes on and on, she's been the main cause of allot of depression and financial troubles in mh life. Any advice on what to do, if I should cut her cut of my life when I get the chance I don't know. Whenever someone wrongs her she paints an awful picture of them to every family member and basically gets them shunned or disowned with lies. Im scared and need advice on what to do.

Hey! i was bored at work when i decided to start writing a adventure novel. The story starts of by describing a mysterious village that's located by the foot of a huge mountain called Mount Ergos. As always that mountain is cursed. Little is known about the enteties living in that village, all thats known about them is that they have lived there for tousands of years.

Mount Ergos is named after a King that was named Ergos. He was ruthless and had a spiritual bond with the Titans. one day he vanished. His body is inside Mount Ergos (i guess you know whats going to happen next)

The Titans are some sort of ghostly enteties built up of stardust and matter. They all have a different purpose. Some for war, forests, agriculture etc.

Im kinda running low on ideas on what to add. Please give me some tips and give feedback on what you think about the story so far.

I have no friends due to mental health issues and the closing down of everything during covid. There's literally not a single person I can call a friend at this point in time.

I can't volunteer anywhere because everything was closed due to covid.

I'm scheduled to go to a few events, but these are once I start university, and they could be cancelled if the covid situation gets worse.

I had a very difficult exam resit and filled my time with studying, going out, going to the beach etc. But now I've passed with flying colours and there's no more studying to be done.

I'm trying to fill my time with reading, writing fiction, going out, cooking. But the fact that I don't have contact with other people besides my family feels suffocating. I feel that if there aren't opportunities to meet people I should instead find something useful to do, learn a new skill or something.

With the marks I am getting now through my cheating I would probably end up in the top 5.I'm gonna have my last subject tomorrow and I know I don't deserve these marks so I'm thinking of failing the subject on purpose (in my school if we fail on one subject we can no longer have any rank).

No.

We were wrong.

       P started blowing us off to hang out/see her other friend. A lot. It feels like she physically avoids us. She will text and call every once in a while, but she seems different. Even on my birthday, she didn’t answer the phone until 30 minutes before I had to go to bed for the next day.
       For *HER* birthday, W and I decided we wanted to take her out to eat and to a movie. We told her for months, reminding her. We all were really excited! On her birthday, she didn’t answer any of us. At all. I then found, on her friends snap, that P was hanging at her house... watching movies and eating sweets.
       Anytime we text her or call her, she ignores it. We will ask her if she’s busy on a certain day and she replies with, “I... don’t know.” Just to find out that she will be at her friends.
       She says she is suppose to be in bed by 10, but will posts snaps of her at 2:00AM, with her light on, and watching movies.
       The other day, I was really upset. My parents’ divorce was starting to get to me. W wouldn’t answer the phone so I texted P.
       
       “Hey {P}, are you busy? I’ve had a really bad day and I wanted to talk to you.”

No response.

I only have my GCSE's (I had some pretty serious mental health issues from 16-19 so that's why there's a gap, I'm doing okay now thankfully).

I'm planning on moving back to the city in a few months (currently live in the countryside, where it is very difficult to find jobs if you don't drive, which I don't nor can I afford to learn at the moment) and I really want to get some kind of office job there, probably like a secretary or admin assistant. As stated in the title I have no experience or qualifications and I'm not really sure how to proceed, I know neither of these technically require  qualifications but I'm definitely at a disadvantage especially considering how competitive the job market is at the moment.

I’m just trying to do my job and finish my shift, but he constantly does this, I guess to irk me. It’s difficult to have a regular conversation or ask what’s the plan for the shift we have in hand.

Please don’t think that I don’t know what sarcasm is, another coworker of mine uses it, but when he does, it makes sense and is actually funny. He uses it at the right time and context. And when it’s time to be serious, or when a question is asked he doesn’t use it. 

But this other guy is just annoying, he uses it to be mean, tease, and start small bickering, and in the ends says, “I was being sarcastic.” I’m just going to have to assume all he says is sarcasm, if yes, then it’s gonna be a very long shift every time I’m scheduled with him.",17Sep2020,1

I’m talking to psychiatrists to try to find the right medication but first round I had didn’t work in fact it made it worse, so much so I had to stop taking it and I’m talking to them later today but that’s going to have to be another trial run so I don’t know what to do any help would be great.

 2. And I've recently started sexting to some older guys on reddit by kik. I didn't know before I started sexting, but it turns out that they're all married. Then I got stressed out and felt like a bad girl. I like satisfying them and I like the attention they are giving me and fulfilling me (I'm a bit clingy and like receiving love and someone taking care of me), but at the same time I feel guilty for sexting someone that has a family. 
 3. I'm also worried about what other people will think of me. I asked my parents and my friends what they'll think of me if I like men older than my age - they said they are fine with it, but what about other people? The society and people around me? I'm not liking older men because they tend to have more money than me! I just like that they are more mature and settled and treat me with love (like I said, i'm a bit clingy and like receiving love and someone taking care of me) (Well I don't hate money though - it's even better if he has some money)

Middle sibling is too a troublemaker, but if he doesnt get his way, he tries to escape (dont know bany better words) from our house. Problem is, he can. We dont have any rooms we could make him To calm down.

My step mum demanded that the key for my bedroom window/balcony be taken for the 2 days they are away over NYE night, even though I was in for the whole time. Her reasoning was safety but I repeated multiple times that I would be in the whole night. Instead it was locked and when midnight came I had to go out in the street to have a cigarette while everyone else around me celebrated. Because of this I'm finding it extremely difficult to want to see my step mum when I see my dad as when I previously brought this up the reply was 'you're really being like this over something like that?'

395,"Recently I got in a realtionship with a great girl. She is really amazing, truly, really supporting, even accepted the fact that I'm bi, the first girl to do so.

I realised that I wouldn't mind having a ""part time lover"", someone who I could go out every so often and share the bed once in a while, but I can't imagine being married to anyone at any point in my life. I only think about that no matter how good the relationship is, it really doesn't compare to my work and the fact of all the good I can do if I give all of me to medicine.

396,"hi
my little sister(16) and I(20) grew up in a not very nurturing environment. we were both homeschooled and mostly isolated from other kids. we were emotionally neglected and discipline methods used by my parents were pretty harsh. however, our needs were very well taken care of.

when i turned 11 and started sixth grade at a real school, they realized that their discipline methods were ineffective, unaccepted by american culture, and damaging to our psyches.

i know they never intentionally meant to hurt and only wanted the best for us. my parents were only disciplining us the only way they knew how to: the way they were disciplined growing up.

since realizing their mistake, they have been trying to change their way of parenting. it’s not perfect, and honestly, the damage has already been done, but it’s so much better than before and they are very supportive and loving parents now.

they pay for my school and they let me live with them for free and they expect nothing in return. they buy us expensive electronics and comfort items. honestly, we’re somewhat spoiled. and they’ve learned how to talk and encourage sharing feelings instead of dismissing/punishing them. i really dont have much to complain about anymore.

but like i said, the damage has already been done. i am suffering from pretty bad depression and anxiety that i’m going to a therapist for. my little sister is incredibly emotionally closed and i dont even know where to begin to help her because she refuses to even talk to counselors.

im not sure how much i can tell my therapist. i dont want my parents to be taken away for poor parenting 10 years ago. i dont know what the consequences would be if i share too much. my sister is still living under their care and i dont think my parents going away would help her at all. i’m also in no place to be able to care for myself either, as i’m currently very unemployed and very broke.

sorry for the shit formatting im on the phone
tldr: my parents were pretty bad at parenting but they’ve changed and they’re pretty good at parenting now. but my sister and i are super fucking depressed so im seeing a therapist. would there be consequences if i talk to my therapist about the abuse and my sister’s mental state?",17Sep2020,1

401,"Greetings,

I work for a local authority. A member of staff who had worked closely with a team of 8 others (myself included) had his Covid-19 test results come back as positive. I was informed as soon as the results came through - right after my affected colleague's first and only (6hr) shift since returning from 2 weeks leave.

We're all based in what is essentially a glorified shed and we all use the same pen, sign the same sheets, sit on the same chairs and use the same toilets and vehicles.

We've been instructed to not wear face masks, as it apparently instills fear in the public, and have been told we'll get sacked on the spot if we're seen wearing them.

Because we operate with radios, a lot of us leave our phones in our lockers, and the two people that had kept their phones on their persons received texts from NHS tracing the following morning, informing them that they need to self isolate for 10 days.

The rest of us are expected to carry on working whilst immediate management lie about the working conditions to upper management.

We've all been exposed to this colleague, and we're expected to develop symptoms before we can get tested - but I feel it's too little, too late at that point.

What would you do in my shoes?

Many thanks,",17Sep2020,1
402," 

I'm writing this post because I have no one safe who I can share this with. It would be very embarassing if somebody found out.

So I've (22M) been in a relationship with my girlfriend (21F) for over a year now and its going great. We haven't had sex or anything but that's mostly due to a cultural issue ( we're both Indians).

She thinks I'm a super confident guy who's ready to face anything in his way. And sometimes I am like that.

But she doesn't know how insecure and how little self esteem I have.

My mind always brings up thoughts of her leaving me, scenarios where she dumps me and finds a better guy.

I used to watch porn from when I was 17 years old, and I never understood why people said porn is bad because I never felt as though it affected me.

But after getting into the relationship, I stumbled upon cuckold porn. It's fair to say I got manipulated because first I thought it was baffling, but then I would imagine scenarios where she would leave me and it used to break my heart.

The feeling I used to get was a cocktail of self-pity and being miserable and somehow this heartbreaking scenario where ur girlfriend fucking another guy gave a wierd sense of pleasure for me.

Whenever I felt miserable or bad about myself, I took to cuckold porn as an escape route.

Whenever I saw an attractive guy, I'd imagine him fucking my girlfriend. This shattered my confidence.

I hated this, but a part of me enjoyed this nightmare. A part of me wanted my life to go wrong and wanted to fuck things up.

But then later, I realized that this isn't fair to both myself and my girlfriend. So I decided to quit porn and do nofap.

I quit PMO for 2 months and there was a huge improvement in my love life and I felt like me again. I had stopped thinking those negative thoughts and I felt much better.

But somewhere in the back of my head, my mind would say why are u lying to yourself, ur a cuck, ur girlfriend will leave you and she'll find someone better than you u piece of shit.

I relapsed a week ago, and my life is spiralling down.

I want to be better. I want to be the man my girlfriend loves.

Does this wierd fetish mean anything about me? Have u overcome situations like this?

I don't want anything of this sort with my life. I just want a normal relationship.

Please help

403,"I’m torn. Basically my two main passions are writing and gaming, and the idea of sharing these online really excites me. I love the idea of streaming/making YT videos about gaming, and interacting with that whole community. But at the same time I’ve always been an avid reader and writer, and have been interested in the idea of blogging. My dream is to write and publish my own book eventually. 

My question is would I be crazy/stretching myself too thin trying to grow an online following in two completely unrelated things (blogging/fiction writing and gaming) at the same time, or is it worth it to try out both for the fun of it and just see what happens? Also I’m 20F if that affects any advice.

404,"I’ve (20M) been friends with a friend (19M) since high school, and we’ve been and have stayed pretty close throughout the years (we did similar activities together, graduated hs together, etc etc). In addition, I managed to transfer to my dream college for computer science this year and have been over the moon about it for the most part (looking at you, covid). 

My friend has never shown signs of interest in engineering — he’s in a completely different major, has always talked about going into his major + career, and is relatively good at what he does as well. So when he suddenly brought up the fact that he would be applying to transfer to my same college and was thinking of switching his major to engineering + pursuing an engineering masters as well, I’m a bit ashamed to admit that my reaction after the initial shock was one of extreme discomfort. I guess after we parted ways for college, I really enjoyed the freedom of starting over on a clean slate. With so few people from my old schools in the same place as me, I enjoyed becoming a new person and the better version of myself I always wanted to be. Should he be attending the same university, much less being in the same classes, being in the same major, doing the same activities  — for some reason, it makes me feel like I’m trapped.  

If I’m being honest with myself, I’d say this discomfort stems from my growing dislike of him ever since I entered college, and the thought of being in undergrad and potentially masters + similar careers + leading similar lives + needing to keep in such close touch for so long bothers me. Whatever it is, I’m more than fully aware I a) have absolutely no right to decide what someone else does or where they choose to continue their education, b) need to focus on myself before anything else, and c) probably sound and definitely feel like a major asshole, hence me being here posting on a throwaway account. I obviously can’t tell him any of this face to face, nor do I want to break this friendship for old times’ sake, so how can I get rid of my mindset/feelings and focus on myself without getting bothered?",17Sep2020,1
405,"I don't even know where to start. Ahh, I'm a high school grad with no current college plan besides ""year off, go to college next year"" (my friends are starting college now). Sorry if this post changes directions, I'm just so lost.



Anyway, I used to be happy. Socially, emotionally. I had a small circle of friends that I met in my first year. We were kind of misfits, but we didn't get together just because of that, we all just got along. It was one really happy family (with crushes.) One went pretty far, we held hands and cuddled and said I love you to each other, and I thought eventually it would progress into a romance like the previous aspects had just naturally come about but I just sat in the friendzone for a year until a better guy came along and they began dating within a couple weeks. I really don't want to sound like some loser incel but I'm worried I'm getting closer to that, considering two years later I'm still not fully over her. Anyway because of that, I started avoiding her which meant avoiding the entire friend group. For the next two years of high school my daily anxieties were to avoid them and try to maintain the confidence that was ripped away from me.



Academically, I've always been lazy. I blew through elementary school because I liked reading unlike the other kids and everything was super easy. After that, middle school was like hitting a brick wall of difficulty and I never adjusted. Eventually I gave up, and my norm became putting in minimal effort for barely passing. My parents were frustrated but they've always sheltered me while praising whatever small achievements I've made so it was mostly fine with them too. When lockdown first started in March and classes went online, it almost cost me my diploma. Luckily, like many other students, one night was enough to barely complete the numerous little assignments given to us over two months of the semester and I was able to graduate. But to me that's truly meaningless. I didn't join clubs, didn't push my grades up. Its something I regret and would do anything to go back and change. This is one of the things that makes me anxious about applying to colleges. 


The only thing I've ever applied myself towards is making music. I played in the school's guitar ensemble and I finally found something besides lazing about that I was pretty good at. Not the best in school, but pretty close. I would also write my own little songs and make recordings with my other musical friends. Among real guitar players though, I'm nothing special. I'm ""in"" a band, but I'm hardly considered to be a real member by half of the group, the other half I don't know well enough to be judged by them out loud I guess. Obviously we aren't meeting up much either. Because of this exclusion, I taught myself how to use a free music production software which has taken my songwriting up a notch. The problem is, being a musician is hardly a career aspiration. I'm really not good enough to bring in a living or following, in a band or on my own. I've always thought of music as something I'm good at, but just a hobby. Like the games I've wasted lots of time on over the years, but a little more meaningful.



Which brings me to where I am now - I haven't had my first job yet, my last resume experience is 14 year old me volunteering for a church I no longer go to/associate with, I can't drive (took lessons, my dad never took me out practicing after and I forgot everything) and I'm socially anxious/awkward. As nervous as I get thinking about a job, I want one. Just to get it over with, make some money and start kicking away my anxiety. Problem is, the places nearby aren't hiring and the ones I need driving skills for are. I live in an area that gets incredibly icy during the winter, so I don't trust myself riding a bike. The weather will also make it even harder for me to learn to drive, let alone pass a test for a license to begin driving on my own. And with covid affecting everything, my parents (they caught it early on, both had a foot in the grave before recovering) don't want me to work but at the same time are getting frustrated by me just sitting at home. When I think about my far future I see myself with a big house and a wife and a kid, but it's just a fantasy. I don't know how I'll ever make it. My laziness of the past won't look good to any employers or schools, and I haven't mentioned it before but I'm fuck ugly. My skinny body weighs maybe a feather or two and my face really doesn't do me any favors. It's always been an underlying insecurity, now more than ever when I haven't gone out or socialized with anyone in literally months. 


When I think of careers that do interest me, my past continues to hold me back. I want to do something like CAD or CE but again my academics look awful for that. Core classes were always my worst grades, and trades don't interest me. Even if they did, I have no physique. 


I hope I'm not a complete lost cause, and I really apologize if I sound too hopelessly poetic lol. It's just really how I feel. Thanks in advance",17Sep2020,1

411,"I'm still the scared and alone boy i was. Playing Go-Fish by himself in that derelict basement.
I wait for my turn patiently and smile staring at the cards in front of me.
The sounds of drug fueled rambling abruptly shift into the incoherent screams of my mother.
Is she the victim this time or the aggressor?
It varies so much i'm not sure.
The sound of glass shattering and bodies developing bruises overwhelms my senses and i quickly snap back into my trance.
""Got any 3's?""
""Go fish! Haha!""
I draw a card for my side and shuffle to the other side of the deck.
""Hmmmm...Got any 8's""
""Dang! You got me! Here take it.""
I slip the 8 under the adjacent pile.
""How did you know!?""
I smile at nothing ahead of me. As a child it's fun to pretend.
I'm well aware at this point that nobody would want to be friends with the pathetic pile of human garbage i am.
I stink.
I'm unkempt.
I say vulgar, horrendous things that are embedded in my subconscious no boy my age should even fathom.
If i bring anyone to my home they will quickly realize that i am not ""friend material""
This thought was reinforced many times by trial and error.
Even paying a boy $25 to be my friend at school was a failure, he took the money and said we would hang out. 
The very next day i saw him at school on the playground equipment.
He handed me my $25 back and said his mom was upset that he took it.
If only she knew how desperately i needed a friend.

""Got any.....""
""Matthew! It's time for bed!""
My peaceful escape suddenly collapses back into the reality of my situation.
""Huh?"" I say.
""You heard me, lay down! It's time for bed!""
""But it's only 6...Usually we just fall asleep whenever.""
""You fucking heard me! Get into bed, NOW.""

A combative statement would be unwise and possibly harmful to my own well-being.
I relinquish all hopes of escaping back into my game.
I crawl into my unmade, unwashed bedding and stare intently at the basement door. The glass panel is horrifying abysmal and dark to my not yet developed mind.
""Mom....I think there are faces in the window."" I say.
""Don't be stupid, there isn't any faces in the......."" she pauses and looks at the window with the same distrust i had felt moments prior.
""Oh fuck....There is faces....I can see them, oh my god. Are those ALWAYS there?"" She asks me.
""Yes! What should we do?""
""Nothing to do, close your eyes and go the fuck to sleep.""
I can never sleep.
 The house and myself constantly reek of putrid chemicals due to the rampant drug use going on above me.
I can close my eyes.
But i can never sleep.
""Goodnight."" She says as she exits the room, only pausing to examine the faces peering through the glass pane before walking through the door.
I close my eyes.
I wait.
The sounds above only intensify as people come in and out of the house.
Friends of the family.
One such friend was incredibly nice to me. Showing support and promising guidance to help ease my young troubled mind.
His idea of fun was going onto Rotten.com and exposing me to extremely explicit photos of gore and real life tragedy.
The pictures of dead women really got him excited.
""Damn, look at the pussy on her! Shame she had to have her fuckin' head chopped off, HAHA! But, damn, i'd still fuck her. Whaddabout you?""
""Haha, yeah! I'd fuck her!"" I'd say.
My only glimpse into what sex was at that point was from him or walking in on my mom taking hardcore photographs for her escort job.
I never knew that all those random houses and multiple men had any actual purpose.
Just fun day trips with mom.
Waiting in the car.
Or on a strangers couch.
The occasional hair tussle and a ""hey kid, me and your mom will be back in a while.""

Why are all these memories coming back now?
Is the mental dam i constructed bursting and flooding my subconscious with the reality i've tried so hard to contain?

Things are much, much worse than i could have ever comprehended them being as that lonely boy playing Go-Fish in the basement.

I tried to reach out to my mom recently for help and guidance. I told her i was incredibly lost and depressed and needed help.

She responded by saying ""You are draining my energy and i can't have you coming around anymore. I am cutting you off from the family like i did Grandma. You are to negative and i hate when you talk to me. It drains me.""

She broke up with her bf like 4+ months ago, they were together for 2 years. The reason was that she came out as bi and wanted to experience a bit...

So, she might like me, i’m not sure. She’ve done tons of things that would indicate that fwb is not enough for her, and she might be into me more romantically. 

A year ago while she had a bf, we were with some friends and she took my hand and we sneaked away. I won’t go in details but sure was something idk. 

- She have tried making me eat with her parents

- She didn’t want sex immidiatly (which i have seen girls do often when they want something serious) 

- Get jealous when she see snaps with other girls

- Got mad when i first told her we should just stay friends... and she constantly tell me that i’m still the second guy (after bf) she have been with and she won’t have sex with someone else.

We enjoy each others company a lot, share same hobby and stuff. On paper, she’s perfect. I would say i like every bit of her, except i Think she’s very immature, and her friends are scary (close to all of them, not those i’m friends with tho ofc). 

I have never been interested in her more than a friend, but suddenly after having sex with her etc., i just want it all the time. The netflix while cuddling and all that.

I did receive a raise of €160 about 2 months ago, and that has been the only raise since I started. 

There is one other person who works in my department and they receive €241 more than I do per month. This person is extremely unreliable, lazy, and overall does not do the work. Since I started, I have improved every single process in my department and implemented several new procedures. I've really worked hard and know, for a fact, that I work much harder than the one other person in my department. 

They have given me more than half of this other person's tasks and I've only asked for a title change in return. 

During my contract meeting, my manager told me that I have exceeded expectations and have improved many things within the company. I did not bring up salary because I expected a raise without asking. 

For some info, I am 6 years younger than my colleague in the same department. I also have been open about my plans to return to school for my master degree once corona has settled down and it is able for me to attend school (not online). My manager is supportive of my plans to return to school.

It doesn't like me feel lonely in a ""i don't have a boyfriend"" type of way. But on the ""everyone ignores me"" type of way. My parents are talk with each other on trips (most of the time), she is talking to her boyfriend and i'm just sort of there.

435,"It has taken me a while to post this but I (29M) got out of an extremely toxic 2 year relationship a little while ago (36F). I now understand why it is so hard for people to get out of these, when I heard stories I used to think to myself ""just leave"" but after experiencing it first hand I have a newly developed respect for people that have gotten out of any physically or mentally abusive relationship.

Let me start from the very beginning. I started talking to a girl I met at my work, and she agreed to go out with me. We went out a couple times, no red flags. She had a daughter that was 13 at the time, and I dont mind that. Although I have no kids of my own yet. Through the years, the arguments started becoming more and more aggressive. Only for me to find out that she had been cheated on in a previous relationship which lasted 8 years. I did my absolute best to try and not let those trust issues carry on into our relationship, but they had. Her ex was the man that raised her daughter, so I had no problem with him coming over and taking the kid for the day, or anything like that. My ex even went to vegas with him because her daughter wanted to go and she didnt want her daughter to go alone. So I had to be cool with it (although this was tough). Fast forward to near the end of our relationship. She was threatening suicide, accusing me of cheating all the time (as if the mortgage just paid itself and I was never really at work). She would physically assault me and I would always have to call the cops or run, literally run out of the house, just to get away to go spend the night in a hotel, or even drive away to sleep in my car.

I think that is enough background to explain my problem now. We broke up, it took a cop telling me to go to the courthouse and file a no-contact order. So I did, and it was on a friday, she always knew where I was or what I was doing otherwise it would spark an arguement about me cheating. So I told her I was at the courthouse and she freaked out. She took a hammer to my TV, bleached my clothes in the bathtub, broke dishes and decorative pieces, threw beers at the walls and caused damage, and shut off all my utilities (they were in her name while I paid the mortgage) before she managed to leave. I really broke down when this happened as i just wanted to part ways like civilized adults.

Since we have broke up, I have fallen into a huge depression. Not suicidal or anything, just extremely depressed. I do not miss my relationship, but I find that I do not know how to interact with people, of the same sex or opposite sex. And people just need human interaction. I have none, I go home to an exceptionally large, but empty house every day that I work, although work has been shut down this last week due to poor air quality because my state is on fire. I find myself drinking alone to escape reality because my life sucks right now, I have since lost all my friends because they hated my ex so much they didnt want to be around me if I was with her, and I guess I just want advice on how to develop a better quality of life. I had to move to an area away from my hometown for work but obviously I never made any new friends.",17Sep2020,1

441,"Hi!

I'm planning to transfer to another school, but since my current school has a different curriculum, I'll be taking more subjects. I don't know if I should continue or not, especially since transactions are very difficult during quarantine.


Pros:
1. The tuition fees in the school I'm planning to go to are half the total fees in my current school.
2. The quality of education and the system here sucks, and I feel like my current school is ripping us off.
3. It's a LOT nearer my home.
4. The school I'm going to is more active and well-known.

Cons:
1. They already had their prelim exams so I have a lot to catch up to.
2. New people to adapt to, I have social anxiety so it's gonna be hard for me.
3. I already paid like 1/3 of my tuition in my current school.
4. Process of transferring is gonna be long.
5. Already have friends in my current school, which is really a first for me.


Should I continue transferring? I'm planning to transfer as soon as I can.... I don't really wanna have to regret my decisions again so please help me. :c",17Sep2020,1

Although I’m happy for her, and wish them all the best, I can’t help but feel a nagging worry in the back of my mind. They’ve only been dating for a year and each have their separate apartments, they do not currently live together. She’s a bit naive at 24 and he’s 33, I haven’t met him because of covid and before that he worked away on rotation (gone 6 weeks, home for 2) so I don’t know what he’s like.

448,"So, my apartment ended up getting very damp from the heavy rain storm. My landlord used fans to dry it out. As I was putting everything back, I saw it, a bed bug. I looked more, and there were more. I have about 10 dead bed bugs in a bag, and they were on both the mattress and the box spring, more than what’s in my bag. 

I notified the landlord first thing in the morning, and he treated my apartment only. All he did was put covers on my mattress and boxspring, but some powder around and sprayed. I looked under the covers and there were still bugs under them. It’s like he didn’t even try to vacuum or anything. He also didn’t treat my couch OR the chair in my living room. It just seemed like a halfass DIY attempt at getting rid of them. The neighbors weren’t notified (this is a separated house apartment) by him. 

I called him about my concerns, that I don’t feel safe sleeping there, that I recommend an exterminator, that I recommend he treat every apartment, but he just told me that I should stop mouthing off and get out. He told me that if I’m not satisfied, then I could hire an exterminator myself and he’d approve it. He also RELENTLESSLY blamed me for the bed bugs. I’ve never had bed bugs in my life. He told me that I should have to pay for the treatment he already did, which he never said before. I told him that’s not fair and I won’t. His basic message is to get over it or get out. 

I can’t get over it. I can’t sleep in a place that I know has bed bugs. I can’t. I know he hasn’t been thorough, and I know there are bed bugs. He said “it doesn’t happen overnight” when defeating them, but of course that’s true when you use the methods he used. He also told me he’s never had a problem before but another tenant who happens to be my friend sent, in a text message, telling me our landlord has treated his apartment, before.

I have my lease. I have the dead bugs in a bag. J have recordings of safety hazards in this building (there are a lot, such as open wiring). I have recordings of other tenants’ negative experiences with him. I have the texts. I have videos of mold, open chemicals, improper bed bug treatment.

This is my first time posting to this sub. At this point in my life, by my true friends parents, I’m viewed as the bad kid. Let me give you some back story. Growing up I was put through a sheltered, catholic elementary school where I had absolutely no idea what went on in the real world. I was young and influenced by this. Fast forward 8 years later when it was it time to graduate all of my friends were getting ready to enroll in expensive private high schools in the area. Well, my family could not afford these schools. I was heartbroken. But life goes on. When I was introduced to my first public school I felt something that I have never felt before... real fucking life. Not being hidden away from what the real world was. Quickly I begun to hang with the wrong crowd.... got into drugs early freshman year and became the outcast of my old friend group. I really was not in control of myself, when I was 17 I started using hard drugs and things really escalated quickly. I gained a stupid and horrible reputation with friends and families. As I’m writing this it has been 2 years since I’ve done anything relatively stupid. I’ve cleaned my act up. Got a job, am going to
College in hopes of becoming a firefighter, but I still hold this reputation. As I’m writing this, my friend just had to leave because his parents thought I was going to give him drugs.

461,"When I was 16 I uploaded some lewd pics (no face) of myself to the internet with an alt account (it was stupid, i know, but I can’t do anything about that now) An ifunny User found them and connected them with my face in order to expose me. Mods took it all down and banned him (likely temporarily) but he seemed pissed. I also had mods take down everything related to me and my main account in order to try and distance myself from the situation but I know this guy still has screenshots of my underage pics and face. I also know he is mad and petty enough to keep digging into me and my personal information in order to inflict more damage. I feel like I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop at this point. 

I posted about my college on my main account so I am worried he will try and use the pictures as blackmail. He may also post them somewhere as revenge porn. What are my options here? Would some ass pics I took as a teenager get me kicked out of a conservative college? He doesn’t know my name but he still has my face

Currently I am checking a variety of tags on the app and websites hourly to catch any mention of me or my face but I can’t keep this up for the rest of my life. I’ve built up a great future for myself and I’d hate for it all to come crashing down because I posted my ass when I was a dumb, sad 16 year old.",17Sep2020,1
462,"Hey, this might be a bit longer post, but in real life I have nobody to talk about it and really need help, so please read and give me an advice!

To start with, I am male and 20yo, living in Europe. Since the beginning of this year, I was trying hard to improve myself. One of many things that I decided to do is to stop watching porn, because I realised how bad that thing is. This is where I found about r/NoFap aswell.

I had many streaks, ranging from 2 days to 60 days of abstinence. But here comes a problem. When I would relapse, it used to be by watching some NSFW subreddits.

It started with only reading other stories, looking at photos other people posted, but soon enough I starfed doing big mistakes I really regret now. I know many people here will judge me for all this, but at that moment I really did not realise how stupid I was, and I never had bad intentions towards anyone.

So, I made anonymuous accounts on reddit, kik and snapchat, with some random usernames, and location on snapchat was turned off.

I posted my nude photos (not showing face) in different subreddits. Started ""sexting"" with people I found on NSFW subreddits using those platforms. After some time, I also added some suggested profiles on my snapchat.

I never sent anything to anyone until that person told me they are looking for those kind of things here.

What I once did is, I sent my shirtless and my face pic I have on instagram (not showing my username), followed by nude no face pics...

I also received different pics from other people, but never shared them and never saved them on my phone.

Few times my pics (again without face) were screenshoted or saved on snapchat. I would immediately block that person.

I always asked people about their age, and if they were under 18, I would not send anything and would immediately stop conversation. There is one exception, where person claimed that ""she"" is 16 but that is legal age in UK. ""She"" sent me ""her"" nudes (not live pic but saved ones), and I do not really remember if I sent anything myself or not. But I realised that person is probably lying, as many people there, so I blocked and stopped conversation.

Uh. I know, stupid stupid stupid. Will never ever ever do anything similar so you do not have to tell me that at all.
I know this was my huge mistake. But now it is done, I can not change my past, can only learn from it and never do anything as stupid as this. I deleted all those accounts, deleted all posts I have made, and am just trying not to even think about it.

Now, I am scared and feeling so bad and worthless. Fell into deep depression and have no idea how to continue my life.

Here are few things that really makes me feel uncomfortable:

1) Morality - feeling so much as an idiot that I do not want to have a girlfriend one day. I do not know how I would tell her about this and if I should. I feel guilty that I did this because of my parents who did their best to make sure I never do anything stupid, but in the end of a day, I did. I am so sorry for all people I trully love. If they ever find out, they will be really really dissapointed.

2) Leaking - as I said, it is hard that anyone could recognise me because I covered my face (with that one exception I mentioned), and all those people were strangers. But I know that once you post something online, it is almost impossible to get rid of that. As I said, some poeple saved pics. But again, there are millions of nudes online, and as time passes, maybe chsnces of leaking are not that big...

3) Legallity - I did my best to maje sure I do all this with people 18+. However, I can not be sure that they all trully were. They claimed, but there is always big chance they lied about anything, and I am aware of that. I am really affraid that somebody could trap me by his lies and later make me have legal troubles, or even going to jail. I do not know why would anyone do this because all those people were looking for nudes, but still who knows. They can use this as a trick and I could have legal problems.....

I can not stop overthinking. I never ever had bad intentions. I am aware of my mistakes. I will never do this again. I learned from it.

But I am soo depressed...",17Sep2020,1

465,"So I had a best friends, it was group of 5 of us.
We were very tight and spend everyday together.

Best friend 1 / let’s call her S.

Best friend 2/ let’s call her M

Best friend 3/let’s call her I

Best friend 4/let’s call her B

So s and me were friends from the first day I came to secondary, we all noticed at the end of secondary, she likes to lie to us, she lied about so things, she would make up stories, we told her we like her for her, but she still lied to us.

So m and I had a big fall out, when I was in year 10 I had a boyfriend and she used me to get to me and she slept with him, she didn’t even have the guts to tell me, instead I found out from him.

So I and me, were also friends from the beginning, when we all left high school, we all didn’t talk, I only talked to I, s, b, I had contact with them only. 

But I and me talked none stop, we hang out too, and we FaceTime and everything, until one day I found out she blocked me out of no where.

I don’t know what I did, I can’t even come up with reasons. We are laughing the day before, joking, talking on the phone and the next day all I got was a block.

It’s been years now, since me and b are still best friend. I found out that I and b still talk, and to my surprise b went to I’s sons birthday today.

I can’t help when think she blocked me because she thought I was a bad friend. 

Or that she didn’t like me.

But what shocked me the most was that she was still friends with every one else but me. 

And that made me feel like a shit person.

I feel so worthy less, what did I do? What does everything bad happen to me?

So I asked b if she talked to I when she went I her sons birthday party and b said she did.
I asked tell if she told her about why she blocked me.

B said she did.

“Idk its something about her ex i think when u come tommorow ill tell u”

I said did she say I did something with him?

B said no, its not like that

I said it must be bad because she blocked me for it

Whoever is wrong or right doesn’t really matter though so much as he just won’t leave me alone about it. We had the conversation, I explained why I did what I did and he explained why he was upset. But he keeps bringing it up, bringing it up to other people and asking me questions about how long I timed certain segments for and then rewatching the broadcast to try to catch me in a lie. It’s bordering on obsessive and keeping me from doing other work. Problem is this person has worked here longer than anyone and I’ve only been here for two years.

He blocked me. I ended up posting his Facebook profile and what he did on the local buy and sell pages informing people he may do the same. When someone suggested legal action he messaged me threating me about posting his name. I formed him I was informed of what he did and he had like 6 different stories about why it wasn't him. 

I fould out he works from a fraud team in a insurance company and was not going to pursue any options with police or his employer even though it was suggested to me. 

He ended up messaging me being a dick and blaiming me for the issue that happened. So now I'm thinking his employer should know that he is out committing fraud to myself and other peolle while working in that same department.

472,"Hey guys. Sorry if this is long.

So yeah, I’ve got a bit of a problem. 

A few months ago I didn’t renew my lease at my current apartment and decided to reach out to a friend who lives in a city 3 hours away from where I live. At first I was looking forward to move in with them since they already have their own place and looking for a new roommate. I told everyone I wanted to move to that city but only a few weeks before I’m feeling pretty off about it.

My problem is, I feel like I really no longer want to go there. I have a poor mental health (have been for the past year especially), and I don’t even have a job; I receive money from the government and just received an e-mail stating that I won’t be getting financial support anymore pretty soon. The amount of money I have to pay for the movers company is just crazy and plus the rent for the first of the month. I mean, I do have that money but it’s gonna ruin my budget, and I’m afraid that I might get overwhelmed by having to find a job straight away, considering I’m not feeling at my best about all of this.

The thing is — I must absolutely leave because my lease is over by October 1st. I currently stay with my parents because of my mental state, although I have my own apartment I couldn’t stand to be physically alone due to a mental breakdown and chronic anxiety. Staying at my parents is very toxic and anxiety inducing, I have an agressive stepfather and a narcissistic mother. So while I don’t want to stay at their house any longer, I really don’t know where else I could go if I choose to cancel my plans to move to the other city.

I know this all sounds like I’m really irresponsible and I’m aware I am, at least I have been for a very long time. I could blame it in my mental health but I know I fucked up and that seriously I didn’t know how to be real enough. I took a microdose of shrooms earlier this week and that’s how I realized how uncomfortable I was with all of this. I saw how I kept intellectualizing my gut feelings so as to gaslight myself and it’s difficult to unsee that now. I would make myself feel miserable if I forced myself to go there anyway because “it’s too late”. 

The only thing I had in mind was to tell my friend everything and then apologizing for being so last minute about cancelling the whole thing. I even thought about paying them the rent anyway while they look for someone else to move in. And besides, if you were wondering what I would love to do is to move to British Columbia instead (I’m from Canada) and settle there. I crave change, nature and I have family there as well. But I might have to get a job anyway before that happens because I need to save more money.

Honestly I would appreciate any word of advice or compassion.",17Sep2020,1
473,"I do private security and they recently hired a new guy, we’ll call him jim. Me and jim don’t ever work together, he just comes and relieves me after my shift is over but for some reason people always seem to like to tell me about their life problems, maybe because I’m a good listener, I met a resident in the building last week and he basically started telling me his life story after I greeted him and we ended up talking for like 2 hours, so I’m used to people talking me to death. 

Anyways back to jim. So it comes time for my shift to almost get over and jim will come in 10 minutes before his shift starts and just start talking to me about random stuff. Jim is a black man in his late fifties and all he ever talks about is how he hates white people and how he hates black people who are educated and how he hates all our white co workers, our managers because they’re white and think they’re better than black people. 

All I wanna do is just go home and smoke some weed but I always have to listen to him being extremely racist. Today he talked to me for 40 minutes before I stopped him for the 3rd time and said I had to go. It’s not like I don’t try to shorten the conversations with him but whenever I do he always comes back with a “oh, one more thing” or he’ll bring up something work related and twist something racist in and act like he’s a victim of something. 

I’m black and it bothers me just being in conversations like that because I look at everyone equally. He talks bad about some co workers that I’m cool with too and he even said if it were slave days I would’ve been a house n***** or an Uncle Tom because of how proper I talk. How can I kindly tell him that I don’t want to partake in these conversations? He also told me he hated black island people like people from Jamaica and Africa and that somewhat offended me because my family is from the Caribbean and I’m also offended that he thinks it’s okay to be racist at all.. let alone on the job.

I totally quit drinking and smoking weed about 6 months ago and fell into a deep depression and have hardly left my place this summer. I don’t want to be around anyone, all of a sudden I experience bad social anxiety that seems to be caused by feeling cripplingly sad and hopeless about life. When I am content, enjoying hobbies and simplicities of life, have plans to move forward, like I did in the past, I seem to have no problem with social situations, confidence and making quality connections with people. 

This is making me feeling extremely scared and hopeless about the future because I feel like I need to go back to school and get some credentials in something to get a decent paying job and live a good life. I am 25 and it feels like time is starting to run out. The issue with this is the way I’m feeling lately, it’s hard enough to even get out of the house for a walk or do anything productive at all. I’ve seen friends maybe once or twice this whole summer because I don’t want to be around anyone.

477,"I have been thinking about moving back to my home state of Virginia for almost 3 years now. After living with my boyfriend in Virginia turned toxic I made a rash decision to pick up and move  away from friends I’ve had since childhood to be near family in Ohio and escape my relationship situation. Although I wasn’t doing bad in va career wise, I have been able to do very well for myself in Ohio , much more stable financially however my quality of life has decreased substantially , I have developed several anxiety and depression and drifted further from the family that I actually do have here in OHIO. I haven’t been happy here and miss my friends in Virginia but have been too scared to quit my job I hate here and risk it all too move back. I still have friends in Virginia but because I moved without really letting anyone know the friendships have been strained but I think they are salvageable hopefully. Fear has been holding me back but with the pandemic my job switched to work from home and it gave me time to really reflect on just how unhappy I am here and how much I do want to move back, although I have rekindled things with my ex that originally caused me to move. I am hoping things will go different this time and that I am moving for the right reasons I am scared that I will ultimately regret it but I’m so miserable here that it couldn’t possibly be any worse right ? 
The second thing concerning me is my finances. I have about $5000 to my name total with no job lined up there. I’m currently on unpaid leave for anxiety from my customer service job. I don’t want to go back there and I the thought of looking for a new job here in Ohio is just depressing , if I have to seek new employment I might as well move to where I want to be. I have started the process of moving but paused it several times due to my uncertainty. I am also taking online courses for my degree, I have about 2 years left. I considered doing the smart thing and waiting until I finished school to move but I was blessed to come into the $5000 by chance and I feel like that is a sign that I need to take this risk and can’t wait 2 more years. The cost of living in Virginia is a bit higher so the o lot apartment alone I could find (can’t do roommates ) is a step down in quality than how I am currently living but is it worth it? Is it risky ? Is $5000 with no job enough to make it in northern va ? Is it a bad idea to rekindle with the ex that made me move in the first place ? I feel there’s nothing left for me here but I’m scared of reversing all the progress financially I’ve made while I was here. Being out of that relationship allowed me to learn how to save money. I also have a small business I think would thrive if I moved because I won’t be as depressed. Sorry for the long post.

Obligatory on mobile etc. 

I (21, F) moved in with my “best friend.” Not a good idea. We had problems from day one. She brought gangbangers in to the house, brings kids in to a not at all child friendly home, leaves food out to rot and spoil, leaves dirty dishes out, bought a reptile that I take care of, pays less than half of the rent, uses the whole spare room as her room, and the list just goes on and on. I constantly have to clean up after her and ask her not to have children and random men with scary reputations over. She leaves milk out to curdle for days even if I ask her to put it away. She leaves raw chicken breast just sitting out until it starts to stink. We now have bugs because she refuses to keep a clean home. I literally have to pick up after her like a mother does her kiddos. 

Last week I came home to some random person in using my shower while her shower sat empty. 

I was on vacation for a month and when I came home I spent the entire next day cleaning because things were rotting. 

Her dog ruined the screen door and part of the house. 

She had covid while I was out of town and refused to clean the house because “covid germs don’t live on surfaces” 

She turns the air conditioning on when it’s 70° outside and yells at me when I shut it off because it’s a waste. 

She leaves empty beer cans everywhere and has ruined my heirloom kitchen table as well as my futon from not using coasters. 

I got a gate for in front of my room in the hallway so my cat can run away from her dog when her dog decides to harass my cat. Then she’ll leave the gate open and her dog chews stuff in my room up. 

Yesterday she told me that she feels that I am unapproachable and she doesn’t feel comfortable talking to me about issues that she has. I was baffled &amp; did not know what to say. She told me that she doesn’t feel like an equal in our home. wtf. 

All of this stemmed from the fact that she leaves food out and my cat eats it, gets sick, and throws up. She refuses to clean it up while I’m at work for 12 hours a day and it has started to ruin the carpet. 

She wants me to lock my cat in my room for the 12 hours a day that I work so that she doesn’t have to put her food away or pick up after herself. 

I can not live in a disgusting environment and I don’t think that the few things I have asked of her (no kids, pick up after yourself, use coasters.) are outlandish requests. 

Honestly I’m at a loss. I don’t know what the heck to do and it’s starting to wear on my mental health. We’re on a lease together and I know I can’t move out because she, not any of her friends, will be able to afford it.

480,"Hi, i dont know if anyone will see this or take this seriously, but i genuinely dont know what to do with my life right now and i would like to hear what other people think. Sorry this will be a bit long. Im 17, and im a senior in highschool, and i struggle with school because i feel like im being forced into a mold i just cannot fit. But the thing is that school has become so triggering to me that it causes me severe panic attacks and/or will cause me to dissociate and now im having so much trouble with it especially since we are doing distance learning along with functioning normally in my everyday life because im always so tired no matter how much i sleep. 

I used to be a straight A student until highschool, even though i rarely put effort (or felt like i did) into anything and i did well naturally. I was always an extreme perfectionist, i was always sleep deprived, really suicidal, and really had no social life when i think about it. 

Once i got into highschool, my grades slowly started dropping while my mental health deteriorated rapidly and there were a few times where i almost attempted suicide, but could not go through and called a hotline instead. I think it became the worst in 10th grade, so i was finally put in therapy and prescribed antidepressants after 10th and before 11th. 

Anyways, i had this one panic attack in the middle of the night at the end of last semester where i could not stop crying and screaming at the top of my lungs because there was ONE assignment i had not completed in my english class and it dropped my grade 14%. It was definitely not the first panic attack, but i think it was the last straw. Everything hurt so bad, i had aches in my chest, my face, and my head, i felt like i was suffocating because it felt like screams were being forced out of me and i started hyperventilating. I was thrashing around, scratching and grabbing at my throat and chest and pulling at my hair screaming things like “i cant do this anymore, i cant, etc” while all my parents could do is watch and panic while my sister cried in her room. It made me remember all of my previous panic attacks and the upsetting thoughts i had in mind during those times and it was like a whole domino effect in making the whole thing much worse. (I guess thats what happens when you pent things up for yeaaars)

Okay, reason why i was so upset during the most recent panic attack was because i was almost back up to an A only to have it drop back down to a C. The teacher and student teacher were always telling me i was a great student who always made our discussions much stronger when i participated because i had a lot different perspectives, but i would always get a B or lower on all of our classwork assignments. I never understood why, because they would actually leave comments saying what i wrote was really good/interesting/etc, but never really said what i needed to do better. It made me think of all of the other times i came so close to achieving something after giving my all, but not reaching it by just a litttleee bit and just feeling the hurt and disappointment all over again. After this panic attack happened, i completely stopped attending all of my classes and turning in any work even though it was the last few weeks of the semester because i just accepted i would not be able to keep up and i would rather give up on everything if this was how it was always going to end even when i give my all. It was so bad that a bunch of my teachers were emailing my mom telling her i was acting really unusual and asking her to check on me and find out what was going on. 

Ever since this panic attack, i have not really bounced back like i usually have before, and whenever someone starts asking me about school i either shut down, get hostile, or start crying depending on what the person is asking about or saying to me. I also avoid looking at anything school related, whether it be schedules, emails, assignments, or even opening my school chromebook because i get stressed out when anything brings back the memory of that panic attack and any of the thoughts i had in that moment. As a result, i never do my homework, and i only turn in stuff that we do during class meetings because i go right back to sleep when school is done for the day and when i wake up i spend time with my sisters and then go back to sleep. I know its still kind of the beginning of the semester, but i dont think im gonna make it. I know i have one year left, but what do i do after highschool if i even finish? People will say i have my life ahead of me or not to worry right now, but i really dont know what im going to do in the future or how im gonna function as an adult if i cant even function properly right now.

I am seeing a new psychiatrist, and he was more proactive and questioned me more than the previous one and said that he did not want to make a formal diagnosis yet, but i may have borderline personality disorder but i wont get to talk to him again until mid october. But how am i supposed to help myself when i dont know how to, and when the help is coming so slow? School is not going to slow down and wait for me, and i just cannot keep up right now. What should i do?

*The reason why im asking this is because i was supposed to take an intersession course to make up the one and only D i have ever gotten so far, and i completely forgot until now. I have to take an exam by tomorrow, but i am so behind theres no way i can do two weeks worth of work in less than a day, when i already have a bunch of late and newly assigned work in my regular classes, and it just made me think about everything up to this point*




TLDR: school has gradually taken a severe toll on my mental health over the years, and now it is so bad anything related to my responsibilities and school are triggering to me and cause me to dissociate, i sleep all day only to do the bare minimum and avoid anything that upsets me, seeing a psychiatrist and therapist for help is taking too much time, and now i dont know how to handle this last high school year and what i will do in the future.

In one party which he participated as well I just relied on him to make conversation cuz I suck at these kind of situations. Then it was okay, he wasnt too toxic. But in todays class he just started to act as a shithead. Idk if its cuz im a quiet guy and dont like that alpha male kind of humor or sth like that. But he started to show off his snapchat hoes who were sending him booty pics ant telling me I will never get any pussy in my life. I dont really mind but it still feels wrong to just not to say anything. Should I tell him next time its not okay to tell things like that and its really fucking annoying and not cool, I dont want to be that kind of guy who just doesnt fight back, how can I just let him know its not okay. How the hell can I make friends with other extraverts so they will respect my way of life? I dont want to be lonely, I still want some kind of a friend group, but I still want to be myself. Can someone with similar experiences help me out here I really need advice:(((",17Sep2020,1
483," 

Just found out I'm pregnant with my second child. I've been at my job for three years, and will be close to four by the time I give birth. We have been working hard toward me being able to stay at home after bb 2. My current role is a care coordinator at a mental health clinic, and i have 120 clients on my case load on average, many of whom I've worked with for years. Here is my dilemma:  
I'm having a difficult time deciding how I should put my resignation in. If I didn't have longstanding relationships with clients, the issue wouldn't be such a big deal, I'd just quit. However, I want to make sure that I have my insurance during the duration of my maternity leave (last time I got 12 weeks) as well as qualify for short term disability. Here are the options I've come up with:

1. Clean break: Don't announce my departure to any of my clients, go on maternity leave for the duration, then put in my resignation.
2. Sneaky Break: Tell my clients that I won't be returning, and help them transition to a new person, but don't tell supervisor or put my resignation in until end of my maternity leave as to not forfeit any of my benefits.
3. Return: Transfer my clients temporarily to a different person during my leave, then return for a short period of time to create closure for clients, then put in resignation, only for them to be transferred to a new person once I leave \*again\*
4. Tell both my supervisor and clients verbally that I \*probably\* don't plan on returning, take the duration of my leave, then officially send a resignation letter to the company.
5. Any other options you see?

I don't want to be a crappy employee, I don't want to be a crappy person and just disappear on my people without notice...but also my family really needs the insurance coverage (and disability coverage if I qualify) that my company provides for as long as possible. How do I do this right? ok- that's long enough. HALP!",17Sep2020,1

He’s lost 6 people that are really close to him in the span of 9 months including his fiancé and I don’t know how I’m gonna help.

And calling the cops or anything is a big no no so all I can do is talk him off the ledge. He’s really sweet despite it all and never lets it get to him.

486,"Firstly, I think the most important part is to mention that I dislike my job. I am in research, and the only reason I am here is because my parents saved my ass and got me a job in a hospital working as a clinical research coordinator.

5 years later, I’m still here. 

I’ve struggled with finding the ability to commit to something different that requires endurance and longevity. 

I enrolled in a few college courses, even grad school, and I found myself not willing and not interested in committing myself to data analytics. I tried it, but I felt disconnected with it. 
Even prior to that, I gave photography and videography a go for a solid 2 years, didn’t make any money, and I sold all of my equipment.

I think by now, learning how to code is a solid option. Thousands of free resources exist online and although I know it would not be easy it is a solid choice to get out of my current field. 

But the problem I am finding when I have a bunch of ideas and things I want to do, I quit when it gets hard. The desire to want to push through isn’t their. 

You name it and I have quit it

- CS50
- Courses on Coursera 
- Community College Courses
- Grad School 
- Studying for the GRE 

I could go on but I won’t. In terms of getting out of this rut, has anyone lived or seen someone go through something similar?

We still kept playing online games and ""hanging out online"" with each other.

So, now it's 2020 we still kept playing with each other (even if it's not quite so often) and i asked her, if i maybe could visit her, because in a month or so i am near her location. I even offered not to meet at her place and just hang out in the city.

She started getting sad and defensive and just didn't want to talk about it at all. So when i wrote her ""from this time to this"" i am near you, just if you would like to plan, she started to write about her ""fear"".

494,"Hello friendly advice givers and seekers, 

I (F) was recently invited to a friends’ wedding. Due to COVID restrictions, the guest list is limited. The couple asked me if it would be okay if my partner (M) not attend and I go solo due to the limit on guests. Not wanting to cause any additional stress for the bride, I said of course and that we understood and not to worry about it. For context, we have all been friends for over 10+ years. 

My partner is understandably upset to be left out, is disappointed they didn’t ask him directly and that I spoke on his behalf. It has become an ongoing ordeal between us. 

I’ve been told by others it is not my problem but I feel caught in the middle and worry he won’t be friendly towards them in future.

He believes it would be resolved if they reached out to him directly to explain and apologize. Should ask the couple to do this? Or mention my partner’s disappointment before the wedding? I don’t want to burden them before their big day but worry about the future of our friendships.",17Sep2020,1

He screams at the top of his lungs, cusses at us, throws things, slams his bedroom door, threatens to hit us and break our belongings, and just attempts to do whatever he was told he can't do. This isn't a learned behavior since his father and I don't act this way and neither does his sister. He's six. 

We've tried sitting him down to talk about his feelings and emotions. He just says he's mad but won't go into further detail as to why he acts the way he does. We've tried time outside, single swats to the butt, chores, taking items away, and the usual. But nothing seems to get through to him. It's like beating our heads against a brick wall.

The latest event that makes me ask for advice was he pissed all over his sister's (4) bed and tried blaming her for it. He eventually confessed to doing it but would explain why. He was made to clean it up the best he could and I wet vacuumed his floor and washed her bed. But he shows no remorse. He refused to apologize to his sister. Or to me for the inconvenience of having to clean half of it up.

Since I’ve been injured I’ve noticed try at only half of the chores have been getting done. Before I was injured we had agreed to split the chores 50/50. Even though I worked more hours than her I was okay with this. I thought that it was fine to share the load of housework. Now that I’m hurt I’m unable to do pretty much any of the chores. After noticing some things weren’t getting done I decided to talk to her about it. I asked her nicely if she could cover my chores for a little while since I was obviously unable to do them. She seemed offended and said “Um no, I don’t think I can do everything. I have a job too.” I told her she could quit it if she needed to do that she could do all of the chores for right now. She got really upset and refused to do that. I asked her if she wanted me to hire a maid. She said that she wouldn’t feel comfortable doing that either as she feels that would be unnecessary money to spend. I asked her how she expected me to do stuff. She said that surely I can do some stuff as I’m already able to do work from home. 

I told her one way or another that she’s going to have to do all of the chores and stuff around the house for a little while until I slightly recover, there was no way around it. She got really upset told me that I can’t make her do things. She told me that she wasn’t my slave and stormed off into our room.

I was told others had no issues with getting time off for their weddings and even and had requested longer amounts of time than I did. 

My team lead (manager type person) came to me yesterday and told me they flat out declined the request. My team lead said she asked if there is any way they could still give me any time off, and they said we will see. She offered a few ways that may work but isn’t 100% that I’ll even get that. My team lead said she was definitely going to fight for me which I am sooo grateful for

Anyone that does the before and after school program has a hard time getting anytime off unless it’s medical, which I have also been declined time off for a doctors appointment.

I’ve missed/had to cancel many things because they couldn’t find coverage (or didn’t try very hard to accommodate me which i understand in some circumstances).

Last week I politely asked if my hours will be increased with a strong YES....However yesterday says differently, I have 9 HOURS?! this week so I almost cried. I brought up to my Manager the fact my hours have decreased dramatically under what was set, and I have 4 days in a row off?
With the response I knew may come, that I will be getting 10-15 hour weeks.....

I Feel like I've been taken advantage of due to my past circumstance? They knew I wanted a job ASAP and was going to take so right away! I moved 10 hours?! Being promised hours over the phone and stupid me was trusting.

After receiving the confirmation I needed, I started jobsearching. I feel horrible leaving a job I've only begun....
I wrote another resume, and a few cover letters. Do I make my employer aware that I'm seeking employment elsewhere? They seem passive aggressive, I can't afford to be fired before employment elsewhere.

This is complete bullshit, believe me, I'm a man.

Here is why:

They say stupid things like: ""men are hunting animals and if he really have the balls then he should read my mind and approach me even with the risk of getting rejected.
I have to make things difficult so he will be more interested in me after the approach""

- If you are interested in a man, you should approach him. There are no reasons for not doing it.

Do not wait and pretend for him to read your mind just because you smiled for a fraction of second.

Lots of times men approach girls who are friendly smiling and found out is just happy or friendly and not interested in anything sexual.

Or maybe you are in social location and there are lots of other girls that smile at him or he looking for other girls and you are not the only option and if you wait other girls will approach him or he will approach other girls.

So it's your loss if you don't approach first.

Realize that you are not the only girl on this planet with other 3 billions females and there is a lot of concurrence and men have options to choose from.

And if you don't approach because are shy and don't have courage, I tell you an easy trick: just go to say you like him or he attracted your attention.
Nothing difficult to do.

In most cases the man will be interested in you too or just tell you gently that is not interested and thank you to be interested in him and nothing bad happened.
He will not think of you bad things, not treat you bad, the planet continue to rotate and you can approach next man.

Not as some girls that reply in disrespecting ways or insulting when approached by men not of their interest, this will never happen with a man.

About the ""make things difficult"":

-Hard to get is most likely hard to want.

If you ever saw some predators animals, they hunt the most fragile prey, so the easiest one to get, not the most difficult to get even if that difficult one is bigger.
Why?
Because why to waste energy with the difficult one if the purpose is get a prey?

An other example is the tree with apples, if you want an apple you take the easiest one you can reach, you don't climb until the top to get the same apple!

If a girl makes things difficult it just annoying and make most men lose interest in her immediately.

It doesn’t matter when you have sex with a man, if he likes you he’ll treat you the same.
If you don’t have sex right away with a man you’ll lose him because what you won’t do another girl will.

In summary, Men prefer way more when girls approach and are direct with them and don't make the difficult princess.",17Sep2020,1
516,"Let me preface this by saying I am a 13 year old male, going to high school next year. I have an high school entry test in a month and a half that I cant study for because no one knows whats on the test. I love playing on the Switch with my friends, I used to play the switch for 3-5 hours on summer vacation. I will admit, that was unhealthy so now I play for 1 -2 hours a day. Yesterday I was playing on the switch, for like an hour and he came in my room. He asked me if he could have the laptop, which I gave him. after another hour, he looked irritated when he looked at me, so I asked him if he wants me to get off. He said ""no, continue playing."". I was playing for another 30 minutes and then he started screaming at me for not going outside and riding on my bike. I was about 6 then and I told him I had an online class at 6:30 which he told me was canceled. then he screamed at me to go outside. when I was turning everything off he told my mom to get over here and said he was going to throw everything in the trash. later when i came home the xbox and switch were gone. 

I checked who's on my wifi and the switch and xbox were gone. He does not know how to turn off the wifi for the switch. later the evening. I asked him what did he do to the switch, and he said "" i threw the switch and the xbox away"" I asked him why and he said ""You have a text next **MONTH** that you got to study for and because I bought them I can throw them away."".

519,"I have no idea what I’m supposed to do with my life. I work at an okay job but I’ve been here about a year and got promoted to a different position and I’m starting to realize a lot of problems here. It’s a relatively small company as in we have a lot of work to do just not a lot of people to do it. 

The position I had was mine and then they moved me. I didn’t like the new position because I wasn’t really trained so I wanted to go back, which management didn’t have a problem with. However while I was working that other position, someone else got hired for my old position. It’s a small company with not many positions so I feel like I don’t have a place here anymore.  

Over the year I’ve been here we have grown a lot. He’s always tried to keep that family feel but since we’ve gotten a lot bigger, it doesn’t feel the same. My pay isn’t great for the work I do and he makes employees do somethings that, per his rules for the company, he should be doing. Nothing illegal or some shit just other employees that share that same position (not ownership of the company) with him are put on blast by management for not doing what they should be doing. 

If I were to leave and go to another company I would be going for the position I didn’t like since I’ve tried that position at my current job and don’t care for it too much. The pay would be way better but I don’t think I’ll like it, no matter where I work it at. 

I currently live with my mom still and neither of us can live by ourselves. Both of us don’t make enough to live on our own. I want to look for a job that I would be interested in but the only places I can find jobs like those are in other states.

One of the locations we do prep for is in a hospital, as well. 

I live with 2 elderly people with lung issues and I feel bad enough working at my other job in which masks are strictly enforced, this just made me very uncomfortable seeing people work with food and not have a mask whatsoever, so would I be a piece of shit for quitting after 1 shift due to this? &amp; if I do, should I tell them exactly why I’m quitting or would that be very rude as well?

Now my best man got drunk the two nights before his flights and missed it.  He had to rebook and spend what I'm assuming the last of his money to get there.

So he shows up and he has no money for a day or so.  Fine.  I foot the bill for him on my stag.  Well, his payday comes halfway through the trip and he wouldn't get out of bed.

Fast forward a few years and it's his 40th.  He's rented a big house and a few of us are going to spend it with him golfing and having fun.  
He calls me up and says ""it's going to cost you this much"" and I'm like ... 😐

I am an hourly employee.  I'm taking time off work to attend this, so I'm not getting paid which is a huge loss, but the ""price you pay"" as they say.

526,"So since the whole pandemic my husband has been working from home, to me I thought this meant he would be around me and the kids more.

But the amount of problems with his business that have kept him in his office has been dreadful and he makes it a thing to not stop working until a problem is fixed so he has had a lot of sleepless nights, That and business has been high as well.

To be honest the lack of communication and attention he has shown to me and kids made me last month give him an ultimatum of us leaving or him changing.

Slowly he decreased his hours but for me at the same time after being stuck inside with doing everything for the kids, and most of the housework, I've felt like I needed to get out of the house.

My husband came to me last week to tell me he booked us a place to stay for a couple days so it's just us, well when we arrived earlier on, given that my husbands business is well known, someone offered him some work, my husband told me he would just talk to these people, and meet me in our room.

To me talking means coming to an agreement, which I know from past experiences.

531,"Long story short I had a terrible youth suffering from depression, OCD and anxiety. Despite being a decent looking and smart guy, my teenage years were full of romantic betrayal and failing grades. I now suspect that I may have asperger's and that's what enabled people to easily take advantage of me as I was viewed as a weak and easy target. I always tried to be a genuine friend or boyfriend and was always met with emotional abuse, gaslighting and cheating.  


My social life was really good until high school, then people just became evil. I spend so much time trying to understand why. Maybe there is something wrong with me and I deserve to be bullied and treated like shit by people. All the ""friends"" I ever had except one or two always just constantly talk negatively about me and put me down. Call me stupid all the time and don't help me with anything or give me advice.  


The two girlfriends I had when I was 17-19 both cheated on me with my best friends. The first time my ""best friend"" actually messaged me and laughed at me telling me he was doing this. I was traumatized for months and couldn't go outside. Then when I was 20 I was dating another girl, my friend died and I was depending on her for some emotional support. She ghosted me and when I went to a get-together to celebrate my friend's life I found her in bed with another friend upstairs. I ended up checking myself into the hospital as I felt like I was going insane. A lot of times I have tried to talk to people about these experiences I end up being told it's my fault because I'm too nice or some people have said I'm a liar and it sounds like ""incel fanfiction"". Good to know my horrible life experiences are so bad people can't even believe them.  


Not sure where I went wrong in life that this kind of stuff happened to me. I feel like I did something wrong and am being punished by the universe. All this trauma plus the trauma of my dad's alcoholism and abuse has rendered me unable to function properly as a young adult.   


Now, these same people who did these things to me try to contact me on Facebook and be friendly with me. I've told them to fuck off or have not responded to them. My ""best friend"" who fucked my girlfriend in high school got pissed and said ""dude why are you avoiding me what the fuck is wrong with you?"", after years of no contact. As if we can ever go back to some level of normalcy after what he did to me in high school. One of my friends told me people back home say I'm ""in a really dark place, not sure what's wrong with him or why he won't talk to us."" Maybe because you people are FUCKED and have a fucked up view of what normal friendship and interaction is like. What in the hell is wrong with people? I'm so tired of people making me feel like shit and guilty about everything.   


Am I being an asshole for not wanting to rekindle ""friendships"" with people who bullied, betrayed and traumatized me? Even my own family says ""oh you need to put the past in the past"". Fuck that, I wouldn't be a fucking depressed traumatized loser today if it wasn't for what these people did to me.",17Sep2020,1

534,"A little background: over 10 years ago I was in a long distance relationship with a guy I knew from high school. In the nearly 2 years of us dating, we rarely saw each other. We were briefly engaged and the relationship ended after I found out he was cheating. The same year we broke up, we reconnected, but I soon realized he would never change and I deserved better. He met someone else then deleted me on social media per his new girlfriend’s request (allegedly). The last time I heard from him was when I told him to stop sending me friend requests on FB after I met my now husband. I wasn’t playing games and honestly didn’t want him in my life. Hadn’t heard from him since. 

Fast forward 10+ years later: I’m happily married with a family and living in my hometown. I have been moved on from my previous relationship for a long long long time. When I met my husband, that was it. Any previous relationship I had just did not compare to what I have now. 

Anyway, against my better judgement I added my ex on FB after he showed up on people you may know. I figured it had been 10 years, I had no feelings towards him ill and certainly not otherwise, so it wouldn’t hurt to be friends on FB. I justified this with the fact that I was friends on FB with my other two exes, and in fact my ex boyfriend from high school sends his child to the same preschool as mine. No big deal, we are all adults. 

Then my ex messaged me on FB after not talking for over 10 years. We had been FB friends for months with no contact with the exception of liking a post here or there, so needless to say I was surprised and confused to hear from him. The message was some weird meme. Then he eventually asked how I was doing and we made small talk. A week later, he messaged me again and we had a decent conversation about nothing (old movies, music, etc). Nothing inappropriate and we did not bring up the past. But he did relay to me that he had been in and out of prison and recently moved back to our hometown. Ok.....

Then he called me through FB messenger which I did not even know was a thing. It was 11pm on a Saturday and I did not answer. Then he called again immediately after. Again, I didn’t answer. What the fuck?

So now he is messaging me every day. I am just ignoring the messages. I don’t want him to message me and I certainly do not want him to be a part of my life. I’m creeped out! This is exactly why I didn’t want to be FB friends 10 years ago, I didn’t want the attention from him. That’s what he gets off on, going after things he can’t and shouldn’t have. I guess I figured after 10 years, it’d be fine. I was so wrong and I really regret adding him.

So how do I get these messages to stop? The fact that he actually thought it was ok to call me leads me to believe he is not thinking clearly or very likely drunk (he’s an alcoholic). At first I thought I was overreacting. But I have a family and it freaks me out that he’s been to prison multiple times and lives within 10 minutes of my house (he doesn’t know where I live, but he moved back with his mom apparently and she lives by me).

I'm 15 and by the time i was 8 i lived with my mom, because my dad left us.

I've been always attached to her, because we went together through a lot of bad times, but something ain't right.

She wouldn't let me go out of our flat's garden when i was 11 years old, and i lost my only friends because of this, they always wanted to go out and i couldn't.

I had to beg her to let me go to school by myself.

When i did something wrong like dropping a towel on the ground it was tragedy, especially when i had to help cleaning the house. She would rage and smack me or scream at me.

When i started talking the guy i liked (My current bf) she told me that i couldn't have a bf until 16 years old, and when i first met him in person (distance relationship) after he was gone she and my step-dad started talking shit about him, and they told me that he would treat me like shit and he was not a good guy etc.

You would say ""Maybe they saw something strange and thought that they needed to tell you"", no, he didn't do anything wrong and he still is a good guy and i love him, we have a very healthy relationship.

After this i had to beg them to let me keep seeing him, and they let me, but we couldn't be alone in my house (i couldn't keep the house keys and i needed to stay out even if i had to go the bathroom) We couldn't kiss, have any kind of sexual thing between us, and sometimes they would even ""Call me out"" for hugging him.

She always called me names, like ""Asshole"" ""piece of shit"" and various things.
She threatened me for anything saying that she'll beat or hurt me.

She always was very paranoid even when i was little and she believed in conspiracies and told me things that legit mad me scared.

When quarantine started she first was very protective but when it ended she thought the exact opposite of before, the '19 wasn't true, and the government killed people in the hospitals.

Problems grew with her, as she would force me to put down my mask when i was around people and talked all day about it.
She even made me and my step-dad move with her to another place in the nature and i couldn't go out because we where in the woods, and she feared them because of ""Satanists"".

She now won't send me to school, because she's no-'19-vax and fears '19 tests, because they would ""result false positive"" and the government wants her to lose her job for self quarantine.

I'm now homeschooled against my will and still confused about what i need to do for the school problem.

If i say something against her talk she calls me names, threat to hurt me physically and to isolate me from everything.

Some months ago i first talked about it with my grandma and my uncle.

538,"I'm a college freshman and recently my school has announced that they will be continuing online learning for most of 2021 too.

I'm a dual citizen (us/korea), so I have to serve in the Korean military unless I decide to renounce my Korean citizenship. Originally, I was planning on renouncing my Korean citizenship maybe few years after I'm done with college. But with the current unusual situation, I think taking a leave of absence and serving in the Korean military (1.5 years) as I wait things to go back to normal might be a great alternative too. And by normal, I don't mean colleges opening up for hybrid classes or in-person classes with strict social distancing rules. I mean, back to the how things were before the pandemic hit, so that I get the full college experience.

In fact, some of my Korean ( &amp; dual citizen) friends have deferred their enrollment and began serving this summer or are planning on serving after their first semester in college. 

The Pros of serving:

\- Hopefully things will be back to normal by the time I'm done with service (some sources say it might be over by the end of 2021 or mid 2022), and I get to enjoy the college experience to the fullest extent.

\- My parents have $5mil worth of assets/properties tied in Korea, so they've been encouraging me to do my military service so that I can keep the Korean citizenship. They've told me that managing those properties in Korea (after I inherit them) without the citizenship can be a real hassle.

The Cons of serving:

\- I already took a gap year before coming to college, and taking another leave of absence for 1.5 years would put me 2.5\~3 years behind my friends (not that life is necessarily a race anyway). But, I don't like being left behind my friends/age group.

\- I'm not sure if I want to serve in the military when I have the option to not and quite frankly I don't think I have the mentality for it.

I’ll try to keep this short.

Several months ago, my girlfriend’s best friend started acting increasingly manipulative toward her. She constantly said things she knew would upset her, told her she should break up with me, but also always talked about how much she liked me as a person to my girlfriend. Then, about three months ago, they finally hit a breaking point, and now they’re no longer friends.

My girlfriend became closer to a different friend after that. The girl even went as far as calling my gf her best friend. In the few weeks since school started, she’s talked to my gf less and less, to the point of completely ignoring her in the class they have together. In that time, my girlfriend said she’s kind of just talked about me whenever they have talked. She’s also started to talk to me more, at least two or three times a day, where before we talked maybe twice a week.

I guess I just want to know if there really is a reason that this has happened twice or if it is just all down to coincidence. I know that her old best friend was manipulative, but her newer friend’s actions came with zero warning. To me, it just seems like there’s too much in common for it to be coincidence, do her friends just hate me?",17Sep2020,1

546,"OK, so I know that I definitely won't be the first person and certainly not the last person to admit that parenting is hard.

Our baby boy is just over a month old and no matter what we do at the moment he just won't sleep and is constantly crying. We feed him and change him consistently when we know he needs these things done. If that doesn't work we know if could be trapped wind and do our best to get that out but after that what do you possibly do?

We can occasionally get him to sleep by holding him when he eventually calms down or can take him on a drive and he'll fall asleep, but the second we put him down his eyes open and it's game over start again.

547,"\[28M\] Just started seeing this girl a few weeks ago. It's been great. Her birthday is this week, she didn't have any plans so I am just taking her to get some ice cream after work (everyone should do *something* for their birthday). (Also she has plans for the weekend, since her bday was mid-week, she didn't have any plans for it).

  
I would like to get her *something* for her birthday. But don't want it to be too big or anything, we've only recently starting going on dates (maybe 5-6 at this point). Asking for advice on what to get? Or at least some ideas? I know it's hard to help without giving you a ton of details about her likes/dislikes but any general ideas would be helpful.

550,"Hey,

I am having some mental problems lately. It might sound silly but here goes.

Before I was extremely motivated. I always try to learn something new, never gave up and had a high will power in general. 

But now I get scared by everything I see.

For example, I am scared that if I watch TV I will get addicted to it and never achieve anything so I stopped watching TV. Similarly I never touch games, social media(except reddit and sometimes discord for computer science study help). But I get constant demotivation from everyone around me.

For example my school is full of people who do drugs and alcohol and I am really scared of it. I am scared of falling to peer pressure and I do not want to make any decisions that will make me lose sight of my goal. I am scared of making friends for this reason.

My whole family is quite negative too. My family is full of high achievers like doctors, lawyers and engineers. But they constantly scold me and demotivate me nowadays. 

I try to find inspiration from people like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs people such as Mahatma Gandhi and so on. But even that is not working anymore.

I am scared that I will lose sight of my goal and end up doing nothing for the rest of my life. I really found a passion in Computer Science and Coding and I try to do it everyday. But all I have is constant demotivation and I do not know how to stop getting influenced by people. I to have my own thoughts and to block out others. I am really in need of help

Many thanks and stay safe!!",17Sep2020,1
551,"OK so all my life I've had issues regarding social situations and understanding people. social situations others find easy I find complicated, hard to understand and scary. I have frequent panic attack like occurrences where I can't breathe and completely shut down, mentally and physically. I don't know what is wrong it got to a point this problem became so bad I went to a very dark place, and when I asked my dad to take me to a psychiatrist to find out what is wrong, he got me counseling instead. which although it was nice to have someone to talk to, I still have no idea what is wrong or how to cope. I've tried to bring it up several times that I need ligit help but he just wants me to go back to counseling (which I did for almost six months) but I genuinely think I got all I can from that experience.

555,"Hello!

I'm 25M from Europe and I seek career and life advice.

To sum up:

* Raised in a country-side with both parents;
* Decided to become movie director at the age of 16;
* Did audio-visual arts in high school, field in study: AV and sociality;
* Graduated in 2014, but didn't get into university;
* This failure prompted me to get a credit on national television within 3 years;
* Achieved this goal only a year later, in 2015, at the age of 20 (still in the country-side, didn't move to city for this);
* Graduated with diploma in applied sciences (2016);
* Because of the national television goal achieved so early, I started writing feature film script;
* Dropped out of bachelor's degree in 2017;
* Gave a successful pitch to the leading movie producer in my country (2018);
* 4 months after, my dad suffered a stroke and became paralysed;
* Caregiver to my father for a year and a half now;
* Now in 2020, I'm ready to start a relationship.

All my actions are done by following my heart. Life has been difficult at times, but I can't complain, because I have achieved so much: got credited on television and managed to save my father from death.

Although, I feel very depressed at times and would like to move on with my life. My movie script still hangs on online and introducing it to the other companies is difficult (unless you have a degree in film).

I have been to psychiatrist for couple of times. I have described all my wins and losses, in which they have told me: ""...(simply) LIVE!""

 I really take intrest in improving my financial situation: investing in stocks and saving up money. I have done well for my family, but I think I would like to have something for myself: a girl would be alright. Haven't found that girl for whom I would fight 'till the end of time.

557,"Never been here so I apologise if I format incorrectly or anything. I (24M) have a partner (25F). We have been together for almost five years now. We both suffer from quite bad mental health issues - I have severe long term depression and possibly a undiagnosed fatigue issue (trying to get to the bottom of that slowly), whereas she is also depressed and suffers from severely erratic uncontrollable emotions (it is very likely she has bipolar disorder). We both suffer from trauma from our youth and past negative romances.

We've been through the ringer throughout our relationship, both as individuals and a couple - she in particular has suffered a lot of loss and misfortune. I was in a real bad way a couple years ago and developed a very bad attitude and she eventually, very fairly, left me. I turned my life around in more ways than one over a couple of months and she eventually, to my great fortune, took me back. Since then she has been quite depressed and unwell due to a myriad of misfortune, including an abusive job, long-term unemployment, an unwanted pregnancy followed by a complicated abortion. I wasn't perfect throughout all of this but I think for the most part I was a good and supportive partner.

The pandemic hit us hard and worsened a lot of issues we were already having. It knocked her real bad just as she was finding her footing again. I too fell deep into my depression again and haven't been myself. Neither of us have. Trying to keep it brief, I become both lazy and emotionally disjointed, whereas she becomes erratic, negative and sometimes scarily suicidal in her down moments. I've had to restrain her as she punches herself or bangs her head, and hold her for long periods of time as she sobs out misery. Once a year ago this was manageable but with my poor health of late I find it is effecting me more and more - to the point I've become curt, impatient and just plain tired around her. 

Two days ago I told her I wanted to split up. I thought I meant it but in the fallout as we've been talking I realise despite the ways I've become ruled by fear and exhaustion, and despite the ways she's hurt me in her very darkest moments through snapping and at one point insinuating she'd die if not for me (which we both have a history with and had promised we'd never do to each other), I know I care about her so very much, and she about me. We really truly love each other and it feels that PTSD, life obstacles and depression always gets in the way, that there's always a new obstacle. I told her I could take her back if she starts taking her medication again (she's avoided it a while) and if she goes to get an assessment for her outbursts, just things to help me not feel that I have all the pressure and responsibilities of her mental health (we are both in biweekly therapy too).

She agreed but has said she doesn't want to resume things if I can't guarantee that if things get tough again, if she's erratic and violent to herself again, that I'll get tired and bail. I can't say with confidence that I can have the patience and the strength of will to not be tired, impatient and frustrated around that behaviour again. I'd like to think I can, bit just like she can't guarantee that her mental health won't cause bad frames of mind again, I can't guarantee my mental health won't cause bad responses to it.
I really really love her and we're probably maybe a bit codependent I guess. We've made second chances work again before... I just don't know what to do. I know this situation is too complicated for a stranger on the internet to fully understand and offer full advice for. I just thought some opinions might help clear my head one way or the other.",17Sep2020,1

Even here on reddit, Ive tried to explain my problems and vent a little but it always seems like when I put my problems or experiences out there people treat it as if its small or insignificant.

Idk.. I know I haven't had serious problems or drama like getting cheated on or having family problems. I have a great family and amazing friends, but I always feel like my problems and frustrations are looked down apon.

564,"
So,  I’m almost 15 and have been going through shit like everyone lately, with lockdown (another one has just been put on my area in the UK), going back to school, and also specifically for me, a lot of conflicted thoughts. 

First things first, you should know I’m not a flashy over the top token gay kid, I’m quiet, I love school and I have a small group of friends that I hang around with, but, one problem I have been facing recently is what I believe (from my hour or so of googling) is anxiety. I feel like every time I go into a shop to buy something, everyone is staring at me, judging what I’m buying or what I’m doing. I don’t buy the typical things a 15 year old does, no energy drinks, no gum, no OTT shoes or whatever. I love Lego, and Star Wars, and I think every time I’m buying a box of Lego, or a Star Wars themed item, people are judging me, or just thinking I’m a weirdo. I have no reason to think this, most people I have never seen before or know, so why would I think they’d even put a modicum of their time to thinking about what I’m buying.

Another thing is, paying for things, I get extremely stressed and worried, like, profusely sweating and sometimes even crying, even if it’s not me paying. I recently got a debit card, and it declined once in a shop, for no reason, it worked again straight after. But for the rest of the afternoon, I had a lump in my throat and couldn’t really speak that much. I think this might be because I hate making a fuss, bothering people or asking them to do something they are literally paid to do. This happens other places, but I think a shop as an example was the easiest place to convey this. 

Although, sometimes, especially when I meet someone new, I get a weird burst of confidence and adrenaline and just start acting weird, trying to impress them or whatever. I have no idea why I do this, and it’s only for random people, sometimes I just meet someone and do nothing out of the ordinary.

If anyone has any thoughts of this, or what I could do? Thanks 

P.S I have posted this in r/teenagers, so please don’t say I am stealing/reposting thanks.",17Sep2020,1
565,"Hi, im 17, Male  
5 and a half years ago i moved to germany and I had NO IDEA of how to speak german.. I was 7th class in my country.  
For the first 5 mohnts in germany I was on google translate just translating words from different sections (familly,house stuff, work stuff, etc.) from german to my own language. (I started learning englisch since i was 6, its almost as my second motherlanguage execpt no one talks it in the house.) 

After that 5 mohnts I was in the special class for new students in germany and we learned german there for a full year i think. Then they put me in the 6th grade (second half of the year) and that class was filled with students from different countries. Now , almost everyone from that class has been in germany for 3/4 of their lives and i was the only one with crappy german. I made some friends, barely and had to move to different school. (I was told it was better)  
When i moved to that new school i was 2 years in germany, they put in 7th class and after 2 weeks they moved to 8th class for unknown reasons, but i didnt mind it. Little did i know, the 8th class was ALL germans that knew eachother for over 4 years and some knew eachother from kindergarten.  


Nobody was interested in me and they never spoke to me for the first week.. when we had to do group jobs no one wanted me with them etc..

After about 4 mohnts of being alone i found a friend in my class, he had ADHD and was really smart and could draw really good, also a german, and he understood me and my struggle, they didnt hang out with him because he was ""nerdy"" but we were hanging out

In germany sometimes you have to do a presentation in front of the class and it counts a lot of % for your final grade.. well, here comes my problem..

I went to talk about my presentation, just watching them all there made me nervous, cuz i was bad at german, (8th class = 2 years in germany) i learnd a lot at home so i was kind of confident in myself.. 5 minutes in, i got more and more nervous cuz i saw everyone smile while i was talking, later they started laughing out loud.. the teacher told the to stop, they didnt care, about 20 stundets and 7 of them are laughing out loud.. because u cant speak their language properly.. 

My confidence collapsed, i was ashamed, my head and ears were burning cuz i felt embarrased, then i just stood for like FULL 30 seconds not saying anything execpt uhmm,uhmm ,.. ah.. and my eyes started watering,the teacher than asked me a few questions cuz she saw i was stuck.. i didnt say a word, said i dont know (they started laughing again) and i just said: that was my presentation hope you enyojed it. i got a 5 on that one.. and it really shitted on my grades.. since then i didnt ask questions anymore if i didnt understand something, they all started making fun of me etc.. 

i finished 8th class and had to do 9th grade, same school same class.. i kinda worked it out, and finished that too, i came back to the school where they teached me how to talk german and was reunited with my good old friends from other countries.. i finished ""realschulabschluss"" there (11th class) and had to find myself a ""Ausbildung"" (Its a school only for the work you want) i choose electrician cuz i didnt think i would ever be able to finish ""Gymnasium"" (its the highest school you can do and gives you ""access"" to go on college) after 1 year in electrician ausbildung i dropped out cuz 3 mohnts in i couldnt bare working anymore.. (i forgot to mention.. Biology,Chemistry,Physics and space exploration is what interests me) so i told myself : Try Gymnassium (3 years) and if i finish it i can work my dream job and i can try to go and study biology/chemistry or physics and if i fail i will just work the misserable job that i dont like, OR continue doing the job that makes me unhappy

&amp;#x200B;

well, i chose to go in Gymanssium and i said to myself that it is going to be hard, i will have to learn a lot etc etc.. 

First 4 days in the new school (from monday): My confidence DROPPED as i saw it was a class of full and pure germans.. i .. cant.. speak.. without.. getting..hot head (my head and ears start burning,i misspell words or the whole sentence) i forgot that i just cant talk german infront of full german classroom.. i want to get around it, because in germany the teachers will be giving you grades for how often u raise your hands and if your answers are correct, also how much do you listen.. i listen a lot but i just cant talk infront of them im start to misspell and then i get even more embarressed and i know that it is all in my head.. they are nice to me, they asked me if i wanted to play cards with them and even explained my how cuz it was a german card game ""lies"" 

I know that my problem is psychological, i dont think i need german friends, i have 2 , and about 10 non german friends, also 8 in my own land 

i will be able to speak normally in the class but after about 3-4 mohnts in.. and by then, my grades will be crap cuz i wasnt speaking the whole time.. HOW do i get around this or THROUGH it (as they say lol..)

Oh and just to mention :

At first i am very shy (doesnt matter which people)

Later i talk and cant shut up (not on the annoying way lol)

I need my grades to be good because this school is deciding if i live happy life or misserble one.

I like to learn especially now that i am in this school and it is deciding everything.

566,"Hey all! I met a lady just over a year ago and we got really well and had lots in common so I was happy that we were going to be friends. I arranged to meet up with her a few times and she kept flaking on me; forgetting we had plans or making up excuses. It really hurt my feelings and I probably should have told her that but I didn’t at the time. We messaged back and forth but then she started completely ignoring me. 

I didn’t hear from her for months so figured that she wasn’t interested in speaking to me. Then she told me she had a boyfriend started sending me photos and saying how happy she was. I congratulated her and then I didn’t hear from her again. She then messaged me on my birthday to say she had been dumped and she was devastated. I comforted her via text and made she was ok. 

I then didn’t hear from her for ages and the pandemic happened and my mental health was really affected. I didn’t confide in her because our friendship hadn’t been consistent. She randomly messaged me out of nowhere saying ‘I hope this doesn’t go on for another 6 months’. Which is a bit of an odd way to communicate with someone you haven’t hear from in months. I didn’t know what to say back so I ignored it and then she started messaging me a lot despite the fact hadn’t messaged her back. She messaged me on three different social media platforms and it was coming too much. I couldn’t deal with her random out of context messages at that time. 

Again it’s been like 5 months and she’s started with the random messages again trying to get my attention. I don’t really understand why she’s doing this and I don’t really want to deal with it anymore. It really doesn’t feel like a friendship anymore. It’s been a year since I last saw her. 

What should I do?",17Sep2020,1
567,"# TL;DR - My neighbour is an extremely creepy middle-aged woman with boundary issues and probably some kind of mental health disorder. I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone without causing a potential shit storm. 

I moved into a block of flats earlier this year and met my neighbour on the move in day. She seemed like a quiet professional woman who was just minding her own business. We said hello once or twice as we passed each other in the hallway. Nothing atypical by British standards. 

A few weeks pass and I hear a knock at the door at 3 am. She was there complaining about how I have my TV too loud. Except I don't have one and I was asleep. I told her so and she said OK and left. I figure she must have got the wrong flat. The walls are thin and students have trouble keeping the volume down sometimes, so whatever. A little while later I get another knock at the door at 10 pm. She wanted to know if I had any plasters because she had cut her foot. She showed me and there was no cut, just a scratch. But I didn't have any so I said so and she left to go get some. A bit weird, but I didn't think anything else of it. 

The next morning she appears as I'm leaving to go to the shop and asks me to fix her laptop. I have no idea how she found out I have anything to do with computers, but I say okay just to be a helpful neighbour. While I was sorting it out, she spoke about how she hates the neighbours and frequently complains to the council about noise and things, as well as about how expensive the rent is. In retrospect, I should have started seeing the red flags at this point.

Over the next few weeks, I hear her screaming like a banshee at something or someone occasionally. Sometimes I could hear her crying. I assume she's arguing with a boyfriend or something, but I don't hear another voice so I just leave it. I've lived in enough places now to know that it's not uncommon to hear arguing or shouting, especially in such dense living conditions as we have here in the UK. 

A week or so later, I get a knock at the door around 11 pm. I open the door and she is hysterically crying. She hands me her phone and runs off. I answer the phone and speak to an emergency services operator who explains she called because she is going into anaphylaxis**.** I go next door to find her behaving erratically, crying, tearing things out of cupboards. I assume she is looking for an epi-pen so I ask her if she has one. She says (with no breathing difficulty whatsoever) that she's never had an attack before and doesn't know what caused it. Her hand was mildly swollen, but her face and throat didn't look bad. I assume she is just having a panic attack and tell her to calm down while I speak to the operator. Eventually, they send an ambulance. They give her a once-over and conclude she is fine. They take the piss out of her for reacting like an idiot. She says thank you for being a good neighbour and I leave it at that.

Several days later, I get another hysterical knock on the door. This time, at 7:30 am. She hands me her phone with an email open. It's a snooty response from one of her superiors. She claims he wants her to die, she doesn't know what to do, doesn't feel safe working there anymore, etc. I have no idea what the hell she's talking about but she's hysterical at my front door, so I take her back to her flat and get her a drink of water. She manically explains how she hates her bosses because they treat her like shit and are sexist pigs. I have no context, so I let her rant for a bit. She eventually calms down after talking herself in circles and I take the opportunity to leave. 

The next day, she brings a gift over and tries to explain more of the office politics. She is noticeably wearing much less clothing than usual and I feel very uncomfortable being around her. I tell her she needs to get mental health help because her reaction was abnormal and decline her gift but she refuses to take it back. I tell her I'm not a fan of her unprompted calls because there's still a pandemic going on and I'm considered at-risk. She either saw this as a joke or didn't take it seriously, because she just laughed about it. I tell her to go as I have work to do and she leaves.  

I leave for a week and on my return she immediately knocks on my door. I ignore it because I couldn't be arsed to speak to her. The next day she knocks while I am working (I'm WFH) and I open the door to tell her that it wasn't appropriate. As soon as 17:30 rolls around, she knocks again and tries to show me something she bought on ebay, but I explain that I'm still working. She doesn't take the hint, because barely a minute later she knocks again in a panic asking if she left her phone. \*Except she didn't even come into my flat\*, so how would it have gotten inside? I see it on the floor barely a meter away and instantly get pangs of anxiety, because this is extremely odd behaviour. I point to it and shut and lock the door. She knocks several times again up until midnight, but I ignore them. 

The next day, I am walking through the city and spot her out of the corner of my eye, \~100m behind me! I pretend like I haven't seen her and start walking around the block to see if she is following me. I do a figure 8 around the shopping district and she follows it exactly. At this point, I am EXTREMELY perturbed. I start walking home, and she sprints to catch up and grabs my arm. She tries to make idle small talk, but I give her one word answers and try not to make eye contact. As soon as we get into the block I go straight home and close my door without saying a word. 

This week, I have ignored her door knocks (5-10 times a day!). It's insane just how persistent she is! Yesterday, she bumped into me \*in the exact same location\* once again. It's very clear she was waiting for me to walk by because it is basically impossible to accidentally bump into people this often in my city and I also don't really go out much. At this point, I am fairly certain her ""crises"" were manufactured, or at least exaggerated. I'd call the police, but the age gap and the fact I am male really makes me feel nervous involving them. I am very evidently an insular person who values my alone time, so I do not know why she felt so entitled to knock on my door. Short of telling her to fuck off, I'm not sure what else to do. I fully expect her to make complaints to the council and police just to be a pest if I do.

I  have an account that was supposed to be just for writing stuff, but now I feel like I want to maybe combine it with one or some of these things? I'm not sure. I feel like if I combine ideas, people won't like the account because it won't have a focus. But if I make multiple accounts for each of these, I worry that I will be too spread out and each one will be weak, if you know what I mean?...Any advice about what I should do?",17Sep2020,1
570,"im 24 years old. ive made/saved some money from being in trade school for almost 5 years and i got my associates degree through the companies apprentice program and tuition reinbursement. but id like to go back for 2 years to get my bachelors. 

However the big problem is that i have slowly began to DESPISE my current job and im depressed living in this city 600 miles away from my home state. my mental health has sufferd from being here over the years. depression, lack of engagement, isolation, and anxiety which led to alcohol abuse, getting therapy, psychoactive medication, etc. 

i just sit behind a computer in a cube all day trying to learn this boring complex HVAC design job from an unsupportive mentor who works remotely because he has COVID-19 plus i dont like this type of work or work enviromnent. the makeup person teaching me the job hasnt even been here a year and she never gives me clear instructions so i have to go bother other busy people in the office to ask for assistance and then my mentor gets mad at me via email for taking too long to finish jobs. 

i just dont see an enjoyable future for myself here, the job is extremely boring, i have no friends here, and i want to be closer to my friends and family back home so i dont have to buy a plane ticket or drive 8 hours to see them. 

I also dont want the stress/added difficulty of having to take mechanical engineering technology classes at night after my day job. I feel like its already gonna be hard enough and I want the best circumstances for me to pass the classes. 

Is this a stupid/unusual decision? i know ill lose my paychecks but my dad said he would pay for my tuition and ill most likely find somethingbpart time to help support monor ecpenses until i get another full time job. Im just not happy with my life right now and i need to make a change/move forward. 

ultimately my goal is to get some kind of abuse test/crash test/durability test engineering job for pre production cars, trucks, and other machinery. but jobs like this almost always require a 4 year degree and pretty much everyone keeps telling me how important it is to have a 4 year degree if i want to move up. 

**I'd like to find a good high paying job that i truly enjoy in my home state before im 30.**

Any advice or opinions on my situation?",17Sep2020,1
572,"I (27/f) and my boyfriend (28/m) have both confirmed the energy and dynamic between us feels different. He has a pretty big weekend ahead (today being Thursday) and I decided him and I should take this time apart and come back together/reevaluate next week and he agreed. Plus he wasn’t exactly prioritizing time with me and every time I tried to get him to confirm he said there were too many logistics in the way to confirm. He’s spending the night at his moms, taking his sister back to Boston Saturday. And then his DND group is playing either Saturday morning or Sunday evening. And because that’s confirmed he couldn’t really tell me when he could or could not come over. 

I don’t know why I’m so sad now that I can’t see him... and now I just want to go crawling back saying JK. But I know I need this (and him too) and now I’m afraid this might be the end. 

I also think me mental health is at play... due to COVID reasons I am no longer in therapy or taking my depression, anxiety, or PTSD meds anymore. And now I’m just becoming a big old emo kid again. 

So, Reddit, is it normal for couples to take breaks like this? I don’t know... this is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in and I don’t know how this shit works... and why am I so sad about this when this was my solutions...

573,"Back in high school I had a group of best friends, a guy and two girls. We had all been best friends for about a year.

I will call the girls ""S"" and ""A"".

Two years ago when I was in my junior year I was pissed off at these girls because I thought they were annoying. At the time I was too much of a coward to deal with these kind of situations myself so I used my friend's phone to text S ""couchfucker6669 thinks you and other girl are annoying and doesn't want to talk to you again""

I got a text from her later saying ""is this true?"" and I responded with one word answers and was a huge dick about it... The last thing she ever said to me was ""okay cool. fuck you 🖕"" (until like a month later she obnoxiously said hi to me in the hallway because she knew I was afraid to be confronted by her)

This happened in April 2019. Deep down I have always felt bad about it but recently I am feeling extreme guilt. I already apologized to the other guy in our friend group and now I want to apologise to S.

The thing is, I recently realized I was only annoyed by the girl A in the friend group because she was very controlling and yelled at me over the littlest things as if she were my mom. Since her and S were so close I guess I was jealous that S was giving A more attention than me. I was a huge attention whore at the time and always felt everyone hated me when I didn't get attention.

S didn't really do anything to upset me. It was a time in my life where I was really pissed off and wanted them all out of my life. I just graduated high school and had a lot of time for self reflection and want to make things right in my life.

I don't really know what to say to her. I just blocked her on everything after that last text she sent over a year ago.

What do I say? Should I even say anything at all? I feel like she deserves an apology because everything is my fault. She deserves the truth.",17Sep2020,1

576,"I (25m) met this girl (25f) last year at work. We became really good friends as time passed. We both independently found jobs in the same city afterwards, and it was great. We kept in touch throughout, and used to meet regularly before she had to go to her hometown due to Covid19.

Even though I knew she wasn't looking for relationship type stuff, I kind of started to like her (I guess). I found out from a mutual friend that she really liked hanging out with me and I was the only person she could be herself with. She suffers from an anxiety disorder and I was glad I play this role (non-romantic though it might have been). 

Early this year, she got admission into a good PhD program in California, USA. I knew she'd be leaving eventually, and to be honest it didn't really bother me. This was/is a really great opportunity for her. More than anything I was happy for her and was busy with stuff of my own. Fast forward to a my birthday last week, where she was the first person to call (at midnight) and she said 'I'll really have to figure how to talk to you when I'm in America', when it suddenly struck me that she'd be gone very soon (she was referring to the time difference). 

However, I don't think our friendship (at least the special aspect of it) will survive. I have little/no chance of going to the USA anytime soon, and I've not been able to remain friends with people who've gone abroad for smaller periods of time. And all of this is ignoring the fact that I possibly may like her. Now, even the prospect of asking her out does not exist anymore. Five years (min length of her program) is a long, long time. 

Her flight is leaving in a couple of hours. I wanted to talk to her about about this but decided not to, for her sake. She's been super anxious about the long flight(s), covid19, and everything - as I mentioned, she has anxiety disorder and it's her first time abroad. Her parents are also quite emotional to see her go (only child) and she has enough on her plate. I just sent a 'bon voyage' message, to which she replied saying she found me 'cute' and that thanked me for 'always being there'.   


The thing is we did so much stuff together that it feels weird for her to not be there. I don't think she likes me as anything more than a friend and that's fine. I do however, want to 'de-couple' from her and deal with the fact that we are going towards separate paths in life. Any advice would be greatly appreciated - just really feeling very shitty overall.",17Sep2020,1

580,"Obligatory apology for long post and poor formatting. I don't post much so I don't know what I'm doing.

TL;DR: my girlfriend revealed to me that her family treats her extremely poorly and it makes me sick to my stomach. I haven't seen them since she told me (covid) and I have no idea how to deal with this new information when I will inevitably see them again.

I started dating this girl, let's call her Rose about 9 months ago. The whole relationship has been a dream and she's the girl I want to marry. We have amazing communication, understand each others love languages, can always discuss our feelings/thought and come to agreements. I literally have no issues with any aspect of our relationship minus one thing, her family.

Here recently towards the start of quarantine, rose has been opening up to me about her family, she still lives with her parents and 2 of her older siblings. And her 3 other older siblings visit very frequently. They seemed like a normal family however as she's been opening up to me about them It's clear how dysfunctional they are.

Her mother and father fight constantly, they rarely sleep in the same bed and have fights where they get into yelling matches that last multiple days. They use rose as their personal servant and they live on a big farm house. I have no issues with parents having children do chores but rose will literally work 5+ hours each day doing chores on top of practicing her musical instruments, doing school and trying to find personal time. This seems entirely too excessive and her parents still have the audacity to call her ""lazy"". They berate her looks telling her she should lose weight when she's a totally healthy weight and even on the thin side. They say she's not smart enough when she graduated high school with a 4.1 and they constantly tell her that I'm too good for her and will break up with her. Recently her mother told her that if she got pregnant out of wedlock that she would ""never forgive her"". I understand unplanned pregnancy can greatly change someones life, but for a mother to never forgive her daughter over one genuine mistake seems cruel and heartless.

Her siblings are no better. The one closest to her (20F), is alright but every other sibling is just as bad as her parents. If they have any small chore such as errands or laundry etc. they'll make her to do as she's still a minor and they know they can get their parents to force her to do it. They berate her looks calling her fat or the ""ugly duckling"". They call her spoiled and pick on her constantly calling her weird, strange or ""the out one"". They have a hunch about her not being fully straight (she's bi) and they make fun of her for that as well. They know that she's sensitive and that these comments hurt her feelings yet they chose to say them anyways. And they also constantly say that Rose isn't good enough for me and that she should dump me before I ""break her heart"".

I understand that people are flawed and you can't pick your family, and that naturally families will joke and pick on one another. But the behavior expressed by her family and siblings seems entirely inappropriate. They treat her like some servant and berate her constantly. Luckily I haven't had to see her family due to covid but the thought of shaking any of these peoples hands or having a civil conversation with them makes my blood boil. And the idea of these people attending Rose and I's wedding or holding our child makes me enraged beyond belief.

I've told rose I greatly dislike her family due to their poor treatment and it saddened her but she said she understood. She seems to see past their extreme character flaws and still loves them, but to see people treat the most sweet and amazing girl I know so poorly is unbearable to me. Sooner or later I will have to see these people again and I have zero idea what I will do. I have 0 experience in this as she is my first relationship and I don't know what options I have. If anyone has been through a similar experience with their partner I would love to hear how you worked though it/ what the outcome was.",17Sep2020,1

582,"I’m not very good at eye contact but I’ve been forcing myself to make eye contact lately and it always feels like I’m angrily glaring at them.

Like I’m so concentrated on listening to their words because my mind gets fuzzy and loses focus with eye contact- it takes mental effort to look someone in the eyes and that makes me partially distracted and I have to focus even more.

Because of that I have an emotionless gaze like even if I fake wear some emotion on my face like a smile or surprise it’s still not convincing and I end up just staring like a sociopath.

When she asked me for a feedback, I gave her a positive feedback because I didn't want to mess up my head anymore. I don't want to to seek anymore therapy. I know I have a bad coping mechanism but that doesn't need to be shamed , especially by a therapist right?

I'm going through a bad time, no one to share with. I cried a lot in the evening, recorded it as a voice journal to save time. Any other ways to cope faster? 
I have decided to go NC now (after 4monthsk because out of the blue, I installed strava and had forgotten to unfollow him. I saw a lot of feeds and saw how fast he's moved on.

586,"My husband and I are in our mid 40s. We moved 4 hours away from our hometown about 13 years ago. We moved to a town close to Nashville. Since the move, we have kids under 11 and both have jobs. My husband is able to work from home but I'm not. So, lately I'm really wondering if I should give up my job and move our family back to our small hometown in MS. I have quite a few reasons. 

Reason 1: My job is very unfulfilling. Most of the time I'm extremely bored. I could care less about it. I honestly feel like the only reason I am there is to work until retirement and draw a larger check. There's no movement and nothing exciting on the horizon. Every single day is drudgery. I find it hard to stay interested and productive. I have 15 years to go and I honestly dread it. I can't concentrate on anything there or take it seriously because of life issues.

Reason 2: dealing with three kids by yourself is really really hard. We have no family here. Plus one  son has an intellectual disability. 

Reason 3: Our parents are getting old. They are all in their 70s. Plus, my mom was recently diagnosed with incurable cancer and given a year to live. The guilt from not being there is excruciating.

Reason 4: The cost of living is a lot cheaper there. The area around here is growing so fast and we don't really enjoy the growth. I could stay home with the kids if I lived there and possibly help take care of aging family members.

Now on to why I think we should stay:

Reason 1: I have a decent job with a retirement pension that will drop dramatically if I leave before 15 years. Am I crazy to give that up to stay here or would I feel guilty if I did. 

Reason 2: I really hate my hometown! I don't agree with the politics or way of life. There are things to do in towns closer to it but the place is pretty sleepy and people don't give a crap about anything but themselves. The downtown is nice but that's about it.

Reason 3: After our parents pass we will still be there. I don't want to live there the rest of my life but I don't know where else to go. Probably end up following our kids wherever they go.

Reason 4: Options for my son with ID would be harder to find. We would have to drive further I guess.

So, what would you folks do? What kind of feedback can you give me?",17Sep2020,1
587,"Hello! I'm in a funny situation and hopefully someone can help me out.

My girlfriend is a teacher. She acts very much on emotion, and tends to flip back and forth on subjects because of it. Covid has been a huge issue. She isn't concerned with getting sick herself, but she is very much concerned that she will get her coworkers, students, or me sick. Because of this, since she started going back to teach, she has decided that we are now not allowed to hug, kiss, hold hands, etc. Yet, she's okay with sitting on the same couch or being in the same room, or being in the same car together. And it's whatever. I don't agree with that logic at all, but I will support her in any way I can.

The last couple of weeks though, I haven't been able to give her the advice she's looking for. Apparently her school has given guidelines, and said that she is not allowed to be with within her students for more than a few minutes, and she basically has to isolate herself. If people at her school start getting sick and it is somehow traced back to her, she will be reprimanded. She teaches very young children, so as you can imagine, this is a very hard thing to do. She has been worrying herself to death because of it. 

I will always support her with anything she does. But I just don't know what to tell her. She's so caught up in the scare of covid (which it's a pretty serious thing, I'm not arguing that at all) that it's making her believe that she is sick and will be fired. I also don't agree with being able to sit in the same car or on the same couch, but we can't even hold hands. I can't be there to comfort her like she needs, and it really sucks and makes me think that I'm not a good enough boyfriend.

And for the record, our relationship is not in question. I lover her more than life itself. We've discussed moving in together, getting married, having kids, etc. Our relationship is great. But covid and her job are really hurting her right now, and I just don't know what advice I can give her anymore.",17Sep2020,1
588,"I started an internship two months ago. It was cool at first since I was getting to do some projects but now it’s basically become one sporadic project and a lot of busy work. During meetings the higher ups always talk about passing stuff off to an intern that they don’t want to do, and if one of us can’t do something the other one is forced to do it. I got a new task that my fellow intern couldn’t complete and now I’m not sure that I can do it but I didn’t have a choice to take it on since my schedule looked free. Yesterday another manager basically signed me up to talk to a client and gave her my schedule without asking. I would’ve appreciated more time to prep. Also, sometimes I get sent tasks right before I’m done for the day and I have to get them done that day and then I go over my time.

Ok so it’s just a few things I have picked up on recently and idk if she’s just trying to make a big deal out of things or maybe it’s just me being an asshole idk.


So yeah here are a few things:

I made an AITA on my second account (just cause this one was being weird about it) and we were going to the bank or something and I genuinely had no energy, I was really tired and didn’t really want to talk to I said hey I’m quite tired don’t mean to be rude but can u stop talking. And she got really mad..? 
She said “well tough” “who cares” “I am your mother so you WILL speak to me.

I was messaging my friend and she was going through stuff so I obviously had to be there for her and support her (over text).And my mum happened to come in the room and start speaking to me, probs shouting at me cause I did something wrong. Anyway I was obviously distracted and said hey sorry can you talk later to me about that, I’m talking to my friend. (I probs shouldn’t specified they were upset)

This one was like just a few mins ago, she just randomly brought it up and said “oh yeah I seen you when u were going to school-(she was coming back from dropping my brother off) and I waved but you didn’t wave back, what was that about?”
I was probs just having a bad morning cause well I’m guessing it was cause of her tbh.",17Sep2020,1

593,"I've been working at my company going on two years now, since I was in my college senior year.  The position I had wanted to apply for out of college at the company was this prestigious training my program for my goal job.  That position wasn't available though, so I took an entry level job at the company in hopes of applying next cycle.  Job still wasn't available.  But I was patient.  It's one of only 2 companies in my hometown that has the position I want, and for familial reasons, I need to stay in my hometown.  Finally, after 1.5 years of patience after graduating college, the job got posted!

Now my only dilemma is telling my boss I want to apply.  My company requires that I do that if I want to apply.  My boss is somewhat new, and I only have a medium amount of rapport with them.  I've recently had a conversation in an semi-annual one-on-one where I expressed desire to apply for higher jobs once I finished up an industry certification (in April 21).  However, the timeline I gave didn't account for my dream job being posted only a month later.  However the dream job wouldn't start until next Summer, so I think it's in the right timeline.

So basically, I'm getting way too anxious over letting my boss know I'm applying.  I've got a good thing going with my job (working from home, minimal oversight, great teamwork with coworkers), and I don't want to rub anyone the wrong way.  I'm partly concerned about applying just weeks after saying I was planning to apply for things in April, and I'm more concerned about applying for this trainee job, which is usually aimed at college grads (though nowhere does it say you can't apply 1.5 years after graduating, and i think the fact that I always wanted the position and was so patient in waiting for it would make them consider giving it to me).  I'm more than qualified for it (top grades in college, one industry certification, knwlowledge of the company, etc...), in fact, a friend with almost my same resume (except I had better grades and more leadership experience), got the position straight out of college last year.  My concern is that my boss is just going to be like ""that's a position for students coming out of college"" then judge that I'm just desperate to get out my current position (or worse just say I'm ineligible to apply).  Then if I don't get the job, I'm concerned that'll mess with my high job security and positive work environment.

I know I'm overthinking this (my anxiety issues tend to hold me back from accomplishing what I should be able to on paper), but can someone offer advice on what I should say?  Communication would have to be over work messenger as we aren't in the office rn.  This is my dream opportunity that I've patiently waited 18 months for, and I don't want to miss out on applying because I'm too scared to ask to.",17Sep2020,1

Okay so there’s this huge creep (murderer) at my job. He would always talk about bashing people’s heads in in the nineties and a bunch of different jail stories. He’s like 60 or so, always talks to himself because of all the drugs he did growing up. I was curious what this guy did to go to jail so I looked up his name in the work database to find his last name, and sure enough, I found a news article from 2000.

So I’m tweaked the fuck out, and tell the other chef I work with. I work in a shack at a yacht club, it’s like a big concession stand where you get burgers and drinks but not really a restaurant, you order at the window. So it’s, me the killer and the chef, I tell the chef the story and he decides that we should try and pick his brain a little to see if we can get anything. He asks him the craziest story he has, and he says the full story I read, but that he was innocent and they got the right guy. 

The chef went to hang out with him today because the season is over, and he told the chef he killed the girl (stabbed 19 times for not going to the movies with him at 5 AM), just killed someone on Sunday, and can’t ever stop thinking about killing people. Keep in mind, he has done a shit ton of drugs in his life and frequently talks to himself. You can’t just believe everything he said, but he for sure admitted to one murder. 

THIS SCARED ME SHITLESS, I MEAN HOLY FUCK. He also does not like me at all, saying things like “you know what I like about you, nothing”, told the chef I talk too much. I’m tweaked off my dick because I don’t know what to do. Cops? Parents? I’m scared of this dude because if he kills girls who say no to dates then he doesn’t really have a motive, just erratic. 

I feel I brought this all on myself. If I never would’ve looked him up we never would’ve picked his brain and never would’ve figured out. The good chef is the farthest thing from a snitch, so he’d get tight if I went to cops. I feel so trapped 

I have a test due at 12 today and my mind has never been so out of control in my life. I can’t tell the professor because authorities get involved instantly. I told him I have the shits and he told me to take the test otherwise, so now I said something about my mom being a drunk. I hope he lets me take it tomorrow but I honestly don’t care, this is the only thing I’m worried about right now. 

Someone please give me some advice....... I could really use some help

595,"I can’t manage my money. I mean I can but, once I finally have my money in order and a set budget plan, it’s never kept up. It’s always either something has come up, or there is a product that I want/need to buy. 

3 years ago I financed a laptop from Best Buy because I needed it for school and my mom thought it would be a great way to start building my credit score. Things were going great at first. I was paying my credit card bill on time and I managed to work my credit score up to a 760!  Well overtime I started spending my money carelessly on my card. It got so bad to the point I went OVER my limit. Like $800 over. I eventually paid off the -$800 on my card but now I still have $1,760 more dollars to pay off on the credit card. Because of this I have stopped using my card completely and I’ll make payments here and there. My score has now dropped to 595. I am devastated knowing my score has dropped so low because no company for any reason is going to accept that credit score. 

This stresses me out to the max. I want to build my credit score backup but I don’t have the discipline to keep a budget plan/save money. I only have $100 to my name right now and it sucks. I want to be able to buy certain things that I’m in desperate need for without the guilt and shame. Like for example, I desperately need a new car and I need it soon. I don’t plan on financing one because I’m not near as ready to handle car debt. I plan to buy a cash car instead. Yet, I have to really save money for it if I want a good decent one. So I’m thinking around $10,000. Yet how am I going to do that? Like there are so many things I’m in desperate need for that I put off because one I’m scared to spend the money and two the process of saving money for anything is a lot. And usually if the process of saving money is long, I’ll never stick to it 😞.

I feel so behind. All of my friends are handling their finances really well. Great credit scores and everything. I wish to be in their position but I know it’s going to be a process for me. I just don’t know where to begin. Plz help",17Sep2020,1
596,"Or rather, I don't know if I should do anything at all.

(Going to use fake names for obvious reasons)

This happened a few months ago now. Decided to have a drinking party at a friend's (24M) house. Going to call the friend Alex. He works at the same company as me and we've known eachother for a year. We're close and talk about a lot of personal stuff together, play games etc. He has a girlfriend and he knows that I myself am a lesbian. One other girl who works at the same company was there. (23F) Alice. 

The night started off fun and we made food, watched netflix and drank steadily. The tone of the conversation gradually got into relationships, sex etc. Work talk too. We all talked shit and it was fairly normal. ( I found out afterward from Alice that while I was in the bathroom Alex had told her that he didn't have a girlfriend, to add to where his mindset was I guess..)

When it was time to go to sleep, we all slept in the same bed and quickly fell asleep. Me on the right, Alice in the middle, and Alex on the left. I got awoken after a while to a hand on my ass. Alex's. I couldn't see Alex's face because of Alice, who was attached hugging me, so I lifted up my head and looked at him like bruh what are u doin lol. he didn't stop. After that he decided to finger me and did so for about 5-10 minutes. He knows I'm gay and clearly I wasn't enjoying it. I lifted up my head several times and made a face at him to get him to stop but it didn't help. I didn't want to move because it was embarassing and it might've woken up Alice. He eventually stopped but tried to then wake up Alice up too and I guess tried to get a threesome or some shit. Alice is not a dumbass and kept her eyes closed laughing saying shes sleepy n just wants to sleep. It stopped him.

We woke up the next morning, I still remembered it all and eventually went home. I knew what he had done was wrong and sure he knew too but as we were friends wanted to make sure there wasn't bad air from here on out. I messaged him and said we should hang out again with Alice, in the day at a Cafe or something. Just have a normal conversation or something. He had said he regrets the night because he has a gf but nothing about what he did to me being bad or w/e. He started to be cold to me and not reply to any of my messages. I eventually started to cut him off but he didn't get the message until I did infact stand up and say (over messages) that what he did disrespected me. Even until now he hasn't apoligized and only ever said he regrets it.

I found out today Alex is still in contact with Alice and they talk. They are currently at a different store and will be returning to the one I am at soon. I'm anxious about it.

I'm angry, I'm disgusted and sure this isn't the first or last time he will do this. I hate that he has this power. Because he works at the same company as me, if I were to tell HR I assume it will get him fired and get him sent home to his own country (We are minorities in a different country, with different views on this kind of thing, but the company is very much American-values).

What I want to know, from reading this, am I in my right to do so? Am I partially in the wrong? I have been told that I should not have put myself in this situation in the first place, but also told that there is no excuse for this and he shouldn't have touched me in the first place. I am worried that if I tell HR, considering it was not flat out aggressive rape, that the punishment will be too cruel. 

At this point we don't talk anymore, he started to ignore me since that night.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I got molested by a good male friend even though they knew I was gay and want to know what I should do.

I want your honest opinions, please.

Thank you.",17Sep2020,1
597,"So here is my situation:

I am 25(m). I have an associate degree in applied sciences, and it has been utterly useless. I finally found a job I enjoy with the postal service. Everything about it is awesome except one aspect. I fear I won’t be able to retire here. Mail is in decline and other companies outbid us for parcel contracts. I decided to go back to school for a degree in something useful that I can use as a Plan B type deal. I would stay with the postal service, get the degree, and if anything happens, well I’d have the degree to fall back on. However, i don’t know any good areas to go in for “fall back” degree. I figure the medical and technological fields would be good, but idk what positions, degrees, or certifications to look into, as I’m not necessarily gunning for a bachelor’s or anything. 


Does anyone have any suggestions?",17Sep2020,1
598,"Basically I was doing a lab technician job which is the swing shift schedule I describe below and making $24.81. I was laid off in April and came back in July doing a cleaning position doing the straight shift schedule also described below. That position I'm doing currently is $20.88. Basically just clean two floors of an office building. Vaccum some rugs, etc. I usually have only 3 hrs of work with the cleaning job and have the rest of the 5 hrs as downtime to do whatever. 

So the job schedule and pays are below


Job making $24.81 an hr but you have to do 7 day swing shift (7 days of 7a-3p, then 1 day off, then 7 days of 3p-11p then 2 days off, then 7 days of 11p - 7a then 5 days off and back to 7a-3p again etc),or do a job making $20.88 but you work M-F 3p-11p every day with weekends off

I'm currently doing the cleaning position making the $20.88 but working steady 5 day schedule. I'd be making a little more a month (up $600 more a month after taxes) if I went with the swing shift position. I got called back to my lab tech position to go back on Monday. So Im a temp doing the cleaning position. But I put in for the cleaning position permanently, that's what I'd be doing.

The lab position has what our union calls, callback rights for 3 years. Meaning if I got laid off from that position, I'd come back to that position guaranteed. With this cleaning position, because they classify it as a group 4 pay (less than the lab), that position doesn't get the callback rights. Meaning if I'm laid off I'd be brought back to whatever open position there was and be stuck there for 6 months due to union rules and would have to re-put in for the cleaning position if one became available again.

Sorry if the union rules for all this sound confusing but I'm just trying to decide if I should go back to my lab swing shift job and make a little more or stick with the cleaning position and have steady hours.

599,"I’m uncomfortable with how my (20F) boyfriends (22M) parents are handling certain situations.

My (20F) boyfriend (22M) and I have been together for almost 2 years. He currently lives with his parents along with his younger brother (20) and step brother (17). I’ve lived alone since I was 18 but moved home since university transitioned online. Every since we started dating, I have spent a lot of time at his house so his parents and I have a good relationship. 

My boyfriend and I’s relationship has not been the easiest. He has intimacy and communication issues which I know stems from his childhood. However, this has to do with a situation outside of us. My boyfriends step sister (13) also lived in the home. His step siblings mother was extremely abusive, sexually and emotionally, so they lived with their dad full time. The step daughter does have issues and to my knowledge, has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and as bipolar. 

Spring of 2019, the step sister was having a hard time and was getting in trouble a lot. I grew up in a house where we were not hit and rarely yelled at so hearing a 12 y/o girl get hit with a belt was hard for me. Things got worse and I learned that she accused my boyfriend’s brother of sexually abusing her but nothing came of it. 

Fast forward to a couple months ago. The accusations came up again and now she’s saying it’s been happening for years. This time, however, CPS and the police seemed to be involved. They both showed up to the house. Now, the step sister is no longer in the house and the brother is still living in the house. 

There has also been issues regarding the step brother and I guess my boyfriend’s step dad has asked his son if he wanted to move back in with his mother, regardless of the past. 

One of the things that is most concerning to me is how my boyfriend responded to this. When I attempted to talk to him about the situation regarding his brother and the accusations from his stepsister, he yelled at me and asked what I wanted and if I wanted “his brother thrown in jail.” Regarding his stepbrother, he told me the way he was talking back to his stepdad, he’s lucky that he didn’t get hit. 

This is all concerning to me. I feel grossed out and don’t know how to handle it. I know this is technically none of my business but it makes it hard when I have to interact with all of them every time I visit. I also worry about how my boyfriend doesn’t seem to take this seriously. Any insight will be appreciated.",17Sep2020,1
600,"I work part time for a roller rink as a snack bar attendant. I know it isn’t a very important job, but the place holds sentimental value to me and having the job is amazing! I love all of my coworkers and have grown to be good friends with a couple of them as well as regulars who come in. It’s nothing too bad and the pay is decent for a weekend job that I use just for a little pocket cash. 

I want to leave because between my full time job and this one, I haven very little time to spend on chores, myself, and my boyfriend. I’m getting burnt out and the only thing I want to do when I’m home is sleep. 

Three new people were hired, one of them as a snack bar attendant, making three girls available including me. I’m torn on how to leave because I don’t want to leave the other two alone, especially when the new girl has only been here one weekend so far.

602,"So I am from Canada but am in the USA for baseball. My college I’m at sent out an email, and this was the exact wording (I won’t post the entire email/screenshot for confidentiality purposes): “As required by the [athletics association] before athletic competition could begin, gateway testing for COVID-19 was conducted on all 106 of our student-athletes and coaches between August 27-September 3. Yesterday we finally received the last of those results and we can now fully report that 0 were positive at the time of testing.” 

That’s copy and paste. However, they never actually did testing, unless you showed symptoms. Some kids on our team were even notified that they had been in contact with the virus, but when they went to be actually tested, they were refused, and were not mandated to quarantine. The coaches would just ask “do you show symptoms?” and took temperatures of everyone (not our coaches faults at all, they were doing what they were told by the school). I don’t know if that counts as “gateway testing” but to my knowledge, that should mean a legitimate COVID test, no? Many of my friends feel like we’ve been lied to, and we just feel like our school isn’t really doing what they should be doing to keep us healthy.

I don’t want to be rude or anything like that to her, she’s a nice girl. I go to a small school too, about four hundred high schoolers.

This is all over something that happened a bit earlier this week. Only one person witnessed this so that is probably an overreaction and it's actually very rare that I overreact. But that gives you insight on how big this is for me. I know how many more important things are happening and how trivial this should be. It is truly a privileged problem, but still being, I am genuinely struggling to move past it. It is just so intimate for me and I feel invaded on in a personal way that I was never prepared for. 

What happened just keeps replaying for me over and over until I literally, physically hit and slap myself over the head or in the face to ""shake it off."" Which is something I've never done but has suddenly become my new habit, where a few times a day I commit to this physical impulse to counter the intrusive thoughts I deal with. It's formed as a new normal thing I do without question, just starting back a bit less than a week ago and now it feels semi instinctual which I can recognize as probably a bad sign that my brain is treading on 'developing an unnatural reflex' territory. But I don't care much about that because I don't do it incredibly hard. I'm not getting brain damage over some light hitting. It just grabs my attention. There's never even a mark. 
I do this solely to distract me from what unfortunate image I was seeing (the event) and it does its job temporarily. I do have OCD and this is probably my latest compulsion but I have enough self control &amp; awareness to manage which obsessions and compulsions manifest in me long term vs short term. I can never stop or prevent a new O or C from forming of course, but I can for the most part have some say in what it will be. Such as a point in time where I had to count to a certain number constantly throughout the day until one day I flipped a switch and shifted from that to constantly scribbling on everything. I can fine tune and adapt what specifically will take over my mind next. So I don't fear that I'll fall into a self harm trap or anything. If I try enough, I can definitely get myself to not commit any violence against me. I have that under control and handled. I just don't want to stop that mild hitting tick I have going on until there is something better to keep me away from what happened aka another tried &amp; proven method that will keep my mind off what's freaking me out near 24/7. This sounds incredibly dramatic and I'm not sure I can excuse it, but I'm just being entirely honest at the moment. I can't say why I act how I do, so I'll just leave it at the 'how.'

&lt;Interlude over&gt;

The event being, that I'm pretty sure my relative saw my inappropriate search history. 

I know most anticipate being caught or that the odds catch up to them eventually, but for over half my life I've managed to avoid that possibility. I've been unscathed and so maybe I started becoming too confident and it made me messy, which got me to finally slip up recently. 

I truly thought I wouldn't have to face this inevitable day. As they all say, ""I'm normally so careful."" 
But in fact, there never was any personal, special porn guardian looking over me apparently. I'm 99% sure I'm plain BUSTED here.

I don't want to elaborate what sort of content I was searching but it is truly abnormal. No one would understand it with an ease or accept as an interest for someone they know--or that they thought they knew. This qualifies under, ""you'll never look at someone the same after finding out what they're into."" 
By far. 
No exaggeration. 
I'm not even the expected demographic to be into it. It isn't just kinky, but instead a pretty disturbing fetish (doesn't hurt anyone else/any breathing entity out there don't worry), that I'm aware to definitely stem from my prior experiences that started in childhood. I don't like sounding typical nor whiny but I'm sure it classifies as 'unresolved trauma.' And even if it doesn't count, I can definitely say that this fetish porn &amp; erotica I'm into is entirely a developed coping mechanism and has been for a LONG time.

A fetish that I can become too dependent on at times and even obsessed with at certain points. But I do really give my all to avoid that length of obsession, and also extensively usually try my hardest to keep a secret and unknown to everyone. I'm not self accepting of this behavior even though I constantly engage in it, or off-and-on engage with it these days I suppose.
I feel compelled to mention for full context that I DON'T LIKE how often it has been for me to chronically search this wild shit ever since I was only 8 years old. I really try to stay away and at times I do succeed. 

But when I feel I need it, I'm so indulgent and reliant on it that I can't just be satisfied by searching incognito or clearing my history afterwards. I can't just do ""a quick fix."" I have my favorite sources I like to go back to so I have many related bookmarks. And related, I somehow like subconsciously or something, believe that it is less risky to have bookmarks on your device than email yourself every link you want saved. With the logic that your device will eventually give out on you (2-3 yrs for smartphones usually). And that your phone will already not usually wind up in the hands of others, and that I keep a passlock on regardless which serves the same purpose. Whereas, it is a very regular occurence for email platforms to get hacked and for people to intentionally seek &amp; try to hack emails. 
Much more, than it is for your phone and computer content to get hacked or leaked. Random attacks are common for emailing sites. Not so much entire cell phones. I think of it like, 'Who's entire browser application gets compromised outside of viruses, or cause from government tracking purposes?' And it's not like I'm breaking the law so there isn't much likelihood the feds will randomly bang on my door one day because they've noticed I'm into weird shit, so all the same this is obviously not my main concern.

If this line of reasoning is very accurate I can't say. 
But that's my reason for bookmarking over emailing. And as for any other alternative, I'm not sure what that would be. Let me know if you have some.

How this went down was pretty simple.
An older family member (authority figure), pretty much decided to show me some options I have on my phone since we have the same model, essentially by force.

Why? They're just controlling like that to be honest. 

It wasn't very important but that's just how they are. And they wouldn't let me just follow their verbal walkthrough while I went along as I physically handled my phone myself, so instead I had to just stand by and watch what they did on it. And what eventually happens is... that they accidentally end up in the wrong place (too quickly for me to predict or process at first) and stumble upon one of my installed browsers where past searches or bookmarked searches pop up automatically the moment you enter the cursor or by the time the keyboard sensor shows up. That's hard for me to explain, but just picture yourself trying to type something into a search engine and then visualize memorized options popping up even before you finish your new search. 

So, yep. That what's happened.

And because my phone wasn't totally facing me, I'm not sure if they had enough time to see those options (the past searches that would show up would definitely be crazy/weird fetishes I've mentioned). But if so, they had approximately thirty seconds to read and interpret what they were seeing. And it was more than one search, which makes it very obvious that I was looking up this graphic &amp; bizarre material with complete intention. Therefore, it would be clear as day that I didn't accidentally look this stuff up or come across it. They would have seen variations of the same phrases multiple times.

Moving on...

They didn't mention at the time if they saw it and they haven't acted any differently since. But that could easily be explained by them wishing thay they didn't see it either. I doubt it's a respect thing in that case, because they never really regard me in that sort of way. Not even on the basic level often times. Along with that, they're not known to mind their business when it comes to me. So it's likely self motivated on their end to ignore the creepy and weird stuff they saw, if I'm to make that assumption. 

I try not to get caught up on the details of that moment because otherwise I will harp on it even more and feel excessively hopeless when I'm already discouraged enough, but I think I do vaguely recall their reaction at that moment; it was a minuscule and minute change in their face with a version of a blank stare as if they were surprised and quickly wanted to get away, and they seemed even more quiet than previously, as if they were breathing a bit less or something. Difficult to claim that since they weren't saying anything even before the searches (possibly) came up, but it seemed that somehow the room managed to get even quieter than before. This either genuinely happened or I imagined it. 
I don't know. 

But either way, they definitely had a very understated reaction if they had any reaction at all or if they even saw-what-I-think-did, to begin with.

Again, if so they tried to manage their definitely (would be) shocked reaction. I can tell that for sure because this was indeed a look of discomfort and 'just wanting to navigate away.' That's the best way I could describe it. And a minor and pretty controlled expression at the same time. I could translate their look to mean they had no desire to to make it clear that they saw it, or make any scene, etc.

So I guess that is the best reaction I could hope for, all considered. 
But that also sucks if I'm correct because that makes as evidence that they DID see what I'm afraid that they saw. If they didn't see anything strange, they would've had the same look they did before obviously, which would just be focusing on the task at hand instead of that change in reaction demonstrated.

One last time: there's a chance they saw, and also a chance they didn't have enough time to pay attention to it. 
Plus a chance that, at first they weren't sure what they saw but then they got to review and mull it over after I left their company or even some time later and ended up putting all the pieces together. 

This is a scenario I'm very worried about as well because my reaction was very quick and prompt but also maybe a bit obvious. Looking back, I remember that I was very quick to keep them away from the section/browser I observed them getting close to clinking on, to right before they finally ended up there. And once they did get there I was equally quick to explain that they were in the wrong place and needed to go somewhere else for what they were trying to do (the actual purpose to what they were showing/instructing me).

There really is no way to ever truly know what they did see. And there is no way to do damage control if they did see anything. 
That said, I'm at a loss for how to move on from this. I'm very private about what I find most intimate and this constitutes as one of those things for me.
On top of that, the person referred to is probably the last person I would ever want to know about this 'secret.' Yet, exactly the one to catch me. 

Is there literally anything I can do now? Or that I should do? A way to force myself to forget? A way to confront the situation and mislead them into thinking they saw something else utilizing some sort of explanatory lie, or even a manipulation tactic? 
What would you do? 
Keep in mind, that we don't have a good relationship.

Alright. Thanks, I guess.

Tldr; My fetish searches were likely seen by one--if not THE worst person possible. 
I'd like advice for what my next move should be in regards to action or even relieving myself of the associated stress psychologically. 

In advance, I'd prefer being told something outside of ""distract yourself"" or ""pretend it never happened"" &amp; everything related to that strategy. Speaking from my personal experience, I've found that really only works to an extent, over solving the underlying/deepest issue. And when there is a problem I like to legitimately solve it. So some longterm, solid, more concrete advice would be much appreciated.

Thank you again. And sorry this is probably an incredibly cringy and wack post. I know this looks really stupid but I couldn't be more serious here. 
I never want advice or help for all the heavy things I handle but for whatever reason this more light yet hard-to-predict-or-expect sort of occurence tends to always fuck me up and really stay with me. It lingers in my mind for ridiculously long and even brings out an emotional repsonse in me, even though that is so rare as I'm nearly never emotional or driven by emotions. I'm almost always with self control as well and my ability to compartmentalize assists in that. But that tool is useless during these moments.
Only vulnerability or the feeling that 'something has been taken from me' (privacy in this case), gets me to freak out like this.

We went on a few dates and I did not feel it at all so I ended breaking it off with her, we shortly got back together after another hook up and I just felt to bad to do it again. But one day I ended up coming around too her, I felt extremely comfortable around her. She met my parents and they loved her and I felt good around her. She came over every day we watched movies, went out, and had fun together. But overtime I started to have desires about other woman, and even made a few pit falls. I kissed another girl drunk, and immediately told her about it. She was mad ofc, but we ended up settling it. Things went back to normal until 2 months ago. I met this new girl and I feel a way about her I have never felt about my girlfriend, it’s a weird sensation. This girl likes me back, and thinks that me and my gf broke up(because I tried to the other day and ended up freaking out and going back to her, and I’m scared to tell this chick because I really like her)It’s only a matter of time before one of them finds out and I need to make a decision.

630," I'm 14, and for the last four years its just been a never-ending cycle of sadness, hopelessness, and unhelpful therapy.

The year ended not long after, quarantine started, everything started closing, and the never-ending summer began. My situation with family has always been horrible and crushing on my mental state. When it got so bad, I attempted to run away for good, and I only ended up being sent to a horrible psyche-ward where everything was the same as I got out. It didn't help, therapy didn't help, meds didn't help. As summer finally came to an end, and school started up again, I got a glimmer of hope. My first year of highschool, where I could finally meet new people that make me feel loved and be asked if I wanted to hang out for once. Due to corona stuff, the school was split even between last names. About half the students would go to school on Mondays and Thurdays, and the other half would go on Tuesdays and Fridays. I fall under the Tuesday/Friday schedule. Academically, it is hard. I struggle so much with self control and actually making myself do the work. Its all online, even when you are in school, its just online but you are forced to do it in school.

632,"So a while back I started to chat with this girl. I had known her for a while (mostly because my parents know her parents pretty well), but we never really clicked before about a month ago. I  was trying to get a few friends to gather and watch The lord of the rings trilogy together but when the day came she was the only one to show up. So we ended up watching LOTR together and through the next few weeks we repeated the idea watching a few other movies, bonding along the way.

Now, usually Im one of those stupid romantic heads that ""falls in love"" in the first date and thus proceeds to use all his will power not to say anything to prevent things of getting weird (while still making it weird). But this time, although we really bonded and share similar personalities, the ""Im weird and quirky"" and ""I don't care about what people think"" and ""beauty is subjective and shallow"" side of her just makes me cringe, so much so that any kind of romantic mood that I tried to build along the way just didn't survive, so I guess I have to friend zone her. But because I tried to get somewhere with this, Im almost positive that she is now very into me (maybe enough to even make a move in the near future).

637,"Hi,

I am torn about work at the moment.

I cannot decide what job to take. I work in before and after school care with children. This isn't my career goal, I am still in university. It is the same position at two different places. Here is my dilemma:

Place A - Pays $2-3 more per hour, don't enjoy being there as much as I don't feel close with my colleagues (have only started working here during the summer, it's really only been 1.5 months)

Place B - Pays less, love my coworkers, sense of comfort, more physical space (aka more space to spread out because COVID), I feel inspired to be better there

Granted, it is the same position at both places. I'm just torn on what to do. When I do the math, the higher paying job rewards me with \~$130 more per week, which equates to about $600 more per month. I'm a college student so yes money is important and I should start saving, but I've been at Place B for so long that I think a part of me is scared to leave?

Not an option to ask for a raise at Place B. The $600/month between the two jobs is quite a difference though.

I mention a sense of comfort at Place B - like I genuinely love all of my coworkers there and can trust them, whereas I do not trust the team at Place A at all. I feel like I'll be a bit more stressed at Place A, but I guess the extra stress can be compensated with the higher pay? I'm not sure. Maybe I just need to give Place A more time? Only been working there the past two months, in comparison to Place B where I've worked for 3 years.

Now with COVID and me panicking about the future in general in post-grad life, who knows? Should I go for the money? My parents are immigrants and I'm worried for them too, financially. 

Basically, my head says to go work at Place A, whereas my heart says Place B. Any tips on what to do? Do I do it for the money or overall good time? Hard to decide.",17Sep2020,1
638,"Hello Reddit! I've got a dilemma!

 I (23) go to a trade school, I am learning everything I need to know for my dream job and for the most part I'm loving it. After spending entirely too long in college having no clue what I was actually going to do with my life, I finally broke down to get the licensing for to become a cosmetologist and then I'm going on to barber school. I'm over half way done with the manditory training hours and am incredibly grateful for the opportunity I've been given at my school. 

The problem:

With the pandemic having hit, the school I attend was able to switch to half online, half in person instruction. That's not really a problem, but it does make everything more complicated with our technique training. Thankfully I was homeschooled through highschool so much of this is the same old thing to me. Buts it's difficult for my classmates. 

Many of them feel as though we are not given the full information needed to do well in our assignments. It kind of feels like we are being rebuked for not working with the system when most of us were not told how it works in the first place. And then we are rebuked for not knowing how the system works. 

 For instance, we completed all of the hours of our first phase of instruction without knowing that our online module quizzes were mandatory in to graduate. So none of us did any of them because they seemed to be optional, and no one told us otherwise. Once we finished Phase 2 of instruction we were told to complete any left over work we had from phase 1. None of us knew there was such thing as incomplete work. Out phase 2 instructor looked into our online work and told us that we basically had to do the entirety of our phase 1 online work again (70 quizzes, 35 assignments, etc.), or else we would not be able to graduate on time. We were then rebuked for not doing our work. When the instructor was notified that NONE of us knew that's how the system works, they were incredibly condescending and took no ownership of the fact that if we don't know something, we need to be told, we aren't omniscient. Basically treating us as though we are stupid. This has become a theme with all of our instructors.

They also take simple questions like, ""will you show me how to position my fingers with this hair to get that angle cut?"" As though we are somehow subverting their authority or we were just not paying attention the first time they demonstrated the technique.

And the instructors will talk poorly about the students to each other behind our backs, but within earshot. Not just the standard, ""Hey, this student has problems grasping x concept, how would you handle this,"" or ""Student X is a little headstrong, but works well when you explain things like y."" No. It's full blown ""Student X is a mouthy b****, you'll have fun with her in your class."" Complete with tsk and eyeroll. I find this behavior to be incredibly unprofessional.

Mind you, we are all women over the age of 20, and most of us are fully capable of completing any work given to us;  this being contingent on proper instruction. If it was just me I would keep quiet; I can deal with people treating me poorly, I don't care. But it's an entire class of 17 people plus similar issues from new classes coming in. My classmates are about ready to riot. I really want to help out in a manner that is satisfactory for everyone involved...

 I want to bring up the issues with administration and see if there's a way we can all work together towards a more healthy learning environment. I am incredibly privileged, and I'm an instructor favourite because I am a kiss-a**.  I know that I will get in the least amount of trouble when talking to administration about stuff like this. I am just not sure how to do it in a way that is respectful  but also effective. How do I notify administration, should I even notify administration? Help!",17Sep2020,1
641,"I need advice to help my nieces and nephews realize there's a life for them outside of their parents' isolation.
Let me preface by saying that these problems began many years before social distancing, I am in favor of wearing masks and being considerate to everyone's health, but once the pandemic's over, these kids will still be isolated as they always have been.

My brother and his wife have their issues in our extended family of abandoning their debts with relatives, guilting large sums of money and gifts out of immediate family, and seeing dollar signs when there's talk of a relative dying, which tends to be off-putting and intolerable after a while (this will be important later.) 

They have six sons and daughters between ages 3-17 that they homeschool.  I helped raise the two eldest niblings, but after they moved out and their third child was born in 2009, the parents began a trend to make it extremely difficult for anyone to spend time with the kids, which struck everyone as odd and made many family members upset/worried.

I've been especially worried because I've been allowed more contact than most, which isn't much.  Even when I am allowed to visit, the children are either sent away to a nap or promptly put to bed so they won't ""bother the adults.""  I have had the luck of some contact, but never any moments alone with my nieces and nephs.  What I find is unsettling, as it's clear their education lags behind their peers on the outside.  I've tried confronting my brother about letting the kids have a social life before, even offered to tutor the older kids on financial literacy, job hunting, demostic how-tos, anything, and they cut off contact with for at least a month every time.

Long before the virus outbreak, the kids were isolated; they've never been taken to public activities since 2009, where they can be social with other children, never allowed any social media or internet access, and the kids have grown with no sense of responsibility or accountability.
I've consulted friends at DSS, but there are no red flags of physical abuse with any of the kids, so nothing can really be done unless there's harm or neglect.

My girlfriend has been the only person lucky enough to be allowed to take the eldest niece (10) out of the house, without supervision, for a fun day.  When gf came home, she said they had a blast, but she soon started tearing up at how out-of-touch my niece was with the simplest things.

Gf said my niece had no interest in playing with any of the kids at the park, not out shyness, but out of almost disdain and active avoidance.  Gf spoke with her about the future, but my niece simply was clueless about any idea of life outside of her mom and dad's house; niece was baffled about the idea of going to the movies, never thought to think about what she wanted to be when she grew up, and didn't even know she had the possibility to drive a car or have a job when she gets older, etc, etc.

After that brief glimmer of hope, the pandemic hit, and my brother's family have doubled down on cutting all contact with the kids.  I understand no in-person contact, but they took away the 17-year-old's simple flip-phone and keep making excuses to not let anyone speak with the children on the telephone.

Through all this, my gf and I have been saving into a trust fund for the niblings to help them get education in trades before we see if they're interested in higher education later.  I have rental homes and small jobs I can set them up in if they need and place to start, but all this would only come with the understanding that they would need to be responsible and work for a better life like I had to.

The problem: We have no unsurveilled way to let these kids know that there is a life outside of their parents' house.  The oldest child will be 18 soon, and as far as I know, knows nothing about how to be an adult and has no comprehension on how to live without his mom and dad.  He naturally has gained a rebellious streak though, and I'm worried what will happen if they kick him out and he has no way to contact any of the family and doesn't know where we live, even.

 My brother and his wife have already told a few relatives and myself they want to borrow money from us to by a new car they can't afford (not happening), and that they're planning to take the land they'll be ""inheriting soon anyway"", selling it all, and using the money to move them and all the kids across the country and live off the grid, and they've told the kids nothing about this grand plan.

I need help.  I don't know what to do to let my nieces and nephews know that when they're old enough, there will be help here for them on the outside, if they want it.  I don't know how to tell them without my brother and sis-in-law flipping out and isolating them further, and cutting everyone off.

Is there anything I can do?",17Sep2020,1

I was about to start with my other project when I found out that our PE had given the project to my teammate(2). Now im not sure if he has given the project to teammate2 after i told PE about my ideas or PE just forgot that my ideas have already been taken when I asked him about it.

Teammate2 and i talk and i just let her do the project because i already have finished a project last month, and i want to be the bigger person even though her position is higher than mine. (She just got promoted and she also has a bad attitude, just to add) Do you think I shouldn’t have?

Im good at what i do at work and i dont know what boss needs me to do in order to have a promotion and i think i just blew my chance away when i gave teammate2 the project.

645,"Hi everyone. I'm from Mexico, M17. So, I don't want to brag but all my entire life I've been feeling soo bored about school. It's kinda sad because I see my classmates and how they are good students and do all of their homework, but for me it doesn't mean anything. It is not that I'm lazy, it's that I lack of motivation. When I used to get high notes at middle school, I used to feel very bored and numb all the time. I couldn't hangout with my friends or follow my passions because I was almost all day inside my bedroom getting tons of homework done. I don't have many friends on school, but I would like to. My school schedule is shit rn. I have all my classes from all my asignatures everyday. I'm writing this while my physics online class is going on. 

The thing is that I love music and art. I want to get a degree on digital art. I am the lead guitarist of my band. I really want to practice and improve my guitar and drawing skills. I want to do something with my life and my youth. I don't want to fail school for sure, but don't want get high notes because I never learn anything useful. I don't know why but my school leaves A LOT of homework but it's not that hard to pass with low notes at least. My mom tells me to achieve high notes but she doesn't hear me out when I tell her school is boring to me. I have to do five to seven homework tasks a day plus attend my classes. So achieving high notes is not easy. Also, whenever I get high notes, my sleep schedule and diet become a chaos.

646,"Hi! So basically I moved last year to a whole new state. I’m really introverted and shy unless I’m with people I know. So as you can imagine, the first time someone payed any attention to me I sorta latched onto them. 

But I often find myself getting really annoyed with them. I’ve concluded this is because we have really different views on life and nothing in common.

My friends like things that I consider boring and generally stupid. For example things like knitting, sowing, cooking, fashion, singing, geography, and Minecraft. Whereas I’m more interested in literature, coding, chemistry (but really just any type of science, except meteorology), robotics, Star Trek, just super nerdy stuff.

I genuinely care about them but I feel like they never really listen to me because they’re not interested in my stuff. Like yesterday I sent an article to the group chat about chemicals on Venus indicating possible life. Just got some yeahs and cools..

647,"My MIL and FIL divorced last December and ever since then she has become extremely attached to my husband she tells me off for anytime I need him for anything considering she in a ""rough spot"", apparently I need to think about her feelings to, which I have told her to come talk to me if she felt the need to vent, we have always gotten along but now she is calling on my husband more I feel like I need to compete for his attention.

I'm not the only one she does it to my BIL wife gets the same treatment as I do and we both feel like it isn't fair on us, MIL always over steps her boundaries in our marriages, she is always causing problems where she tells our husbands something that is completely not true anything and it's anything from the kids to finances or small things in between, if anything we both are now constantly fighting with our husbands, no matter how hard we try to explain ourselves.

For both of our husbands as well they helped a lot with anything to do around the house so we weren't left with kids and home on our own but that was before their parents divorce, I feel like now they feel like whenever there are problems we can handle it our selves, which isn't right.

Ever since everything has started to get back to normal after the pandemic my husband will work in the mornings but instead of spending time with his family he will take off to see his mom and doesn't return until after i'm in bed, he has missed out on a lot of social activities for our kids, but whenever I bring it up he always says his mom needs him.

There are some days when he doesn't see her that day and we are actually spending time as a family and are happy, but that always goes down hill at night when MIL calls to demand why he didn't come visit her, that's when our moods start to decline.

On some nights when the kids are in bed early we have time to ourselves, if we aren't to tired one thing leads to another and just when we are getting down to the nitty gritty things, MIL just happens to call, I swear she has a radar on these things, this has honestly dried up 80% of our sex life.

Recently my husband knows how frustrated I am about things and told me he has booked a little getaway for next week, The thing is he told his mom, and since then she has been raging at me how unfair I am and how could I take her son away from her, and how I need to think of other peoples feelings, she's made it clear as well she will make sure our little getaway doesn't happen.

I have told my husband but yet again the excuse of her going through bad times came up again.

To me if your in bad times doesn't mean you try and manipulate yours kids families as well.

I feel like she needs a therapist or something because this can not continue.

I feel like my husband is trying to mend things but I have this feeling his mom will get in the way of our little trip, I'm not even sure I want to leave, I did tell my husband this morning he needs to talk to his mom before we go away but since then haven't heard anything.

I know I should be able to just decide to get up earlier and do it but it feels like an impossible task. I'm always really tired when my alarm goes off at 9 and I don't like the prospect of rejoining the world yet so I fade back out for a few hours. I always get some cool dreams in that time. I just want to have more time in the day to pick up a hobby or something because I feel like that'd improve my mental state.

657,"I have a close friend that I’ve known since the 6th grade.
His wife recently asked to be my friend on Facebook and also to donate $5 to her Bible trip to the Israel. I accepted and gave her $200. But now that I’m her friend on Facebook, I see she is deeply racist. Not only does she constantly degrade African Americans, she also belittles and threatens Democrats with violence immediately followed by biblical quotes.

Months of this go by and one day she claimed “Leftists are Nazis”. For the first time I left a comment. I put “Trumpers” and shared articles and photos of MAGA supports waiving Nazi flags, giving Nazi Salutes ect. For example: https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5f1da4d8c5b69fd4730dc9d2
I did this as kind of a “troll” joke not really expecting backlash.

His wife (I believe) reported me, claiming “I was spreading hate messages / supporting Nazis.” And I received a ban. I’ve had Facebook for 12 years and they banned me for sharing Articles / photographic proof of Trump supporters supporting Nazis.

Below are just A FEW quotes from his Wife’s page in just the past 30 days.

“Democrats are wicked animals. We need to send these beasts to hell”

“Every single Democrat deserves the death penalty. They aren’t humans. They’re animals.”

“Democrats need to abort themselves.”
“There is a special place in hell for Democrats.”

“Black Americans are the biggest racists in this country”

“BLM are Nazis their lives do not matter.”

“Black Lives Matter and Antifa are savages.”

“Blacks Lives Matter is a terrorist organization. We need to deal with them like we dealt with ISIS. It’s time we purge these savages from our great country.”

I was pretty upset about the ban so I reported some of her posts to Facebook and yet Facebook refuses to do anything about it. Somehow her posts it doesn’t go against “one of the specific Community Standards.”

Facebook reports are anonymous so I don’t think he or his wife know I reported the posts but I can tell that my long term friendship is strained. We use to hang out everyday playing Video Games and now he will not even react to memes or game invites. Again I’ve known this person for ~20 years. He’s been a very close friend of mine and I don’t want to lose a good friendship. He is nothing like his wife, he is a good person. He is NOT a racist and he was even a democrat growing up. I do however think he does what his wife tells him to and that to me is worrying given her calls or violence and the fact they are both avid gun lovers owning semi-automatic rifles. I never knew this side of her until she added me on Facebook.
I want to do something about her posts because they are dangerous and I’m worried for the well being of my friend. I don’t want him to do something stupid just because his Wife says so. 

Am I out of line? Should I drop it? Or do his Wife’s threats warrant additional action?",17Sep2020,1
658,"Posted about her before... my mind is everywhere lately. I have had sex with This girl for 2 month ish, i know her very Well and known her for years. She broke up with her bf like 4+ months ago, they were together for 2 years. The reason was that she came out as bi and wanted to experience a bit...

So, she might like me, i’m not sure. She’ve done tons of things that would indicate that fwb is not enough for her, and she might be into me more romantically. 

A year ago while she had a bf, we were with some friends and she took my hand and we sneaked away. I won’t go in details but sure was something idk. 

- She have tried making me eat with her parents

- She didn’t want sex immidiatly (which i have seen girls do often when they want something serious) 

- Get jealous when she see snaps with other girls

- Got mad when i first told her we should just stay friends... and she constantly tell me that i’m still the second guy (after bf) she have been with and she won’t have sex with someone else.

We enjoy each others company a lot, share same hobby and stuff. On paper, she’s perfect. I would say i like every bit of her, except i Think she’s very immature, and her friends are scary (close to all of them, not those i’m friends with tho ofc). 

I have never been interested in her more than a friend, but suddenly after having sex with her etc., i just want it all the time. The netflix while cuddling and all that. I’ve also come to the conclusion that i really would like a gf. I used to not want that, but lately i just think it’s sooo lonely without one. I hope to find someone else, but i can’t deny i’m thinking about her/the kind of Company 24/7.

659,"This story is kind of complicated so bare with me. I (f18) dated my last boyfriend (m20) for about 3 months. I met him very randomly and had 0 friends in common with him. We started dating very quickly so I learned everything I know about him while dating him. I was STD tested mid way through our relationship and I was negative for everything.(this matters later). He broke up with me after his ex(f20) called him saying she wanted to get back with him. He was back with her that night. After we broke up I hooked up with an old partner/FWB (m19) from before my relationship. A few days after he called me to tell me that shortly after we had sex he got symptoms of an STD and got tested. He was positive for chlamydia. I was extremely confused because I was clean less then 3 weeks before. Me and him had relations prior and were very close friends as well, but nothing exclusive. I explained to him how confused I was and how much it mattered to me to know if I was the one that gave him the STD. He (FWB) told me that the last person he had had sex with was me before I got in my relationship. I believe him because he would have no reason to lie about it and was kinda embarrassed that he hadn't been with anyone else in-between. I got tested for chlamydia to be sure and I was positive. So I texted my ex explaining what had happened and he told me that he didn't cheat and that he would go get tested anyways. I have been thrown through a loop trying to think of any other way it could've happened. Mostly because I don't want to believe I was cheated on. He (my ex) texted me days later saying he tested negative. I know he could've just lied but I never asked for his results and he is not in my life anymore so he doesn't have much reason to update me on his possible STDs. I have difficulty dropping things and its all I can think about. However I also do not want to keep reaching out. But for my own sanity do I ask him for a picture of his results? Is that totally me invading his privacy? I dont really have a right to because he is no longer my boyfriend but I feel crazy not knowing. Or is what I know enough proof to just know he cheated and move on. Ive never posted on reddit before so Im sorry if this format is wrong and I can clear up anything if confusing ):

but, like even the most recent girl that has liked me at college... dunnoo... she always puts herself at a spot where i can see her (Does it in an obvious manner), or looks at me expecting me to look back, or tries to hold onto every possible opportunity to talk to me, like, even if i cough quietly, or make any type of sound that might sound like im saying something, she looks at me, probably wanting to respond or something... also brushing me off... basically, it feels like she wants me to pay attention to her, and it feels like she only cares about me just so i would care about her... yes, she's tried talking to me to, but whatever...

&amp;#x200B;

also, i've been told to model/act

&amp;#x200B;

but i still feeel like i look unconventional...

&amp;#x200B;

like 95% at least, says that im attractive, but i still feel like i dont have that conventional, modelish face/features...

They can afford any kind of phone and can DEFINITELY easily afford a new iPhone for me, especially since all I want is the bare minimum one since my current phone is pretty scratched up and slow and is two years behind on updates. They are super stable, just refuse to get me any more than the minimum. I’ve also tried to get a job, but I’m a minor and they won’t let me at all.

672,"Last school year, I isolated myself from my friends because everything I said and did came off the wrong way, especially because of high stress levels during the semester - I'm a confrontational and straightforward person who doesn't like to go around in circles sugar-coating things. But there came a point where most of those friends were bad-mouthing me and I didn't know what to do. So, to avoid offending people even more, I decided to just walk away from the group on my own. One friend has refused to talk to me since and has been very dismissive of me. The other friend is still recovering from how I hurt her, but we're talking a little. The last one was just caught in the middle of the crossfire and IDK where she stands.

It stings to see them in class. I feel so betrayed after I've always given them the benefit of the doubt, but couldn't get the same back without being stabbed in the back. If I have a problem with people, I usually go to them directly, IDK what to do. Should I talk to some of them or leave them be? If I should, what do I ask about? IDK how to go about future group works. Who will I go with? Do I just go with other people? Do I have to explain myself?",17Sep2020,1
673,"So usually I don’t let stuff from the past really get to me, but with all of this quarantining it gets tough to not think about the things we regret and ask about the what if’s. 

Backstory:
So there’s this person that’s been in my mind for quite some time now, I’ve knew them since elementary school,in where they were my first crush, but we feel out of touch cause I moved schools...until recently. Out of nowhere they followed me on my socials and after a few weeks we finally had a simple catching up conversation. It was cool to talk to them again after all this time cause out of all the people in my life they are my biggest what ifs. But our conversation didn’t last too long and once again we became strangers with the occasional simple reply/reaction to something we post on our social.

Situation:
Once again I try to not harbor on the past but a while ago they posted on their social something about me(without actually using my name) with the caption “Sometimes I still think about the guy I liked in elementary school. What would’ve happened if he didn’t leave”. I know it’s stupid but that caption has been in my mind for quite something, I really don’t know why...maybe it’s because of the what if of our “relationship”, but I don’t know if I should address them about it cause I don’t really want to sound weird about it cause we both have our own separate lives ever since elementary school, plus they posted this couple weeks ago...so this is where I ask on some advice on the people of Reddit on if I should just ignore it or actually do something or maybe another suggestions.",17Sep2020,1
674,"I recently moved into a pretty big sized 4 bedroom apartment with my girlfriend and her brothers and her mom. I moved in because me and my gf have been dating almost 5 years and I would have to say me and my gf get along for the most part (few times we argue like every couple but not excessively) but she’s not the issue. The issue is her mother, I try to be respectful as possible and I’m always gone for work and almost never here but it seems the few hours and days I am here there is always so “bullshit” going on. I feel as if everyday is some bullshit new. For example I never really eat at the house for the simple fact of she usually pays for food because of EBT and I don’t want to be blamed for eating here but when I get home from work she will always ask me to “help take out the trash” my issue is is she doesn’t work neither does her son and I don’t see it as fair I never use trash here and always work and then need to help take out trash but I do it anyways sometimes just so it’ll be “fair.” When rent comes by I work my ass off to pay for it while they get by by asking people they know for money and then ask me to “make sure I clean up behind me and do my dishes” which I already do so when asking me that really kinda pisses me off because she seems to be on my back for no good reason just to annoy me. I am starting to regret moving her because my gfs mother. I want to get my own apartment but I can’t lie rent here is not cheap for a one bedroom it’s still like $700+ ($700 IF YOU FIND A CHEAP ONE) and you need a deposit on top of that. I’m just tired of hearing nagging and don’t want to deal with her if avoided talking to her and anytime she ask me to do something I just respectfully say okay. But it seems nothing is changing am I being over dramatic or is there some type of technique to deal with people like this? She never likes to change her ways we have tried to talk to her but she doesn’t listen. Is there any way to go about this I honestly need help because I can’t do it anymore.",17Sep2020,1

Like a significant accomplishment or an interesting experience of some sort. Not something mundane like getting a driver's license, or getting a job. I wrote about rather mundane things that everybody does/did, so I'm rewriting my personal essay. However, the problem with me was that I didn't really accomplish anything noteworthy.

677,"Hey there! I'm quite confused on what I should do right now around handing in my notice at my current workplace.  


Quick information. Around two weeks ago, I received a job offer at a company which I took. I received the employment letter with the salary/ benefits/ contract on there. But I had no start date as I had to go through another hiring process on it to do background checks. I wouldn't receive my start date until this process has finished.  


The background checks had to contact my current employer, so they knew I was leaving last week. They wanted me to hand in my notice then, but i said i wouldn't without my start date. Background checks are now complete and im waiting on my start date, but my current company are messaging a few times from different managers to hand in my notice asap. A few of the managers dislike me at the moment so it does feel like they do want to get rid quickly, but that could be in my head.  


I've signed a contract so the new place can't not give me the job, is this correct?  
The main reason I want to get my start date too is so I can stay at my current company and finish the project I'm working on.  


But should I just hand it in to make the current company happy? I did ask them why they were so keen to get rid, but I understand they need to get new people in as well.

680,So my bf was watching porn like what men and females do. After he got a message on his phone from messenger from a person he added a while ago showing his face and his area. Now the photo was him watching porn. The person who sent the photos has an account on FB and she added me in a group chat and showed his face in it. I looked at her profile and she has no background just a cover photo that's all. Literally nothing. She's been blackmailing my bf threatening to put him on a pedo site if he doesn't give her 3000. He took screenshots of the messages and everything but I honestly think it's a bot. It keeps repeating it's messages about money and the pedo site. Then this bot or person made more group chats and added his family in it and his friends threatening him. Is there anything he can do? I told him to stop responding to the mad which he did and we went to the police since it has a pic of his area but they said they can't do anything because the post aren't public.,17Sep2020,1
681,"So a few months back my friend of 12 years needed a job and my place was hiring. She got the job and was working the exact same schedule as I was. She lived ~30 minutes away from work while I lived ~10, so pretty frequently she would stay at my place and we'd hang out a lot and bring her dog over so when her and I go to work, my dog can keep her puppy company.

Well about a month ago she started talking to this guy and so she went to a party at his place (during a pandemic, still goes to parties) after work one night and was supposed to come back to my place that night so we can go to work the next day. I didn't hear from her that night, thought maybe she got too drunk so she stayed the night there. The next day I still hadn't heard from her, and when I went into work without her, I found out that she called out because she was hungover. Now, at this point, she had just gotten back to work from being out sick with covid for 2 months. So I was annoyed that she'd call out her 4th day back from a 2 month hiatus, especially when money is a concern for her.

I was upset about it, but figured I shouldn't be and I'm just being irrational. So I texted her to see if all was well, and if she was coming back to my place that night since I have her puppy at my place. She said she was going to come back when I got off work. She said she was sorry about the previous night and would make it up to me by hanging out with me that night. Yeah, she didn't come over. Still had her dog at that point.

Again, thought I was being irrational. So I brushed it off. The following week, we had planned to hang out during our weekend (monday &amp; tuesday) at her place, so I made plans for my brother to take care of my dog for those two days, packed up my stuff and went over. While we're playing Jackbox games and chilling in her bed that monday night, she starts texting that guy. Then out of no where ""Hey hes coming over tomorrow night,"" and I responded with ""so I guess I'm going home tomorrow?"" She said yes. So she cancelled our plans for the weekend, while we were already hanging out for this guy. So this makes the second time she's cancelled plans on us for him without even considering how that made me feel.

I don't bring this up to her because I don't want to come off as clingy and I feel like I might be in the wrong.

Fast forward 2 weeks, shes now working a different shift so when she gets custody of her kid back from her ex, she'll have time to spend with her. It sucked for me because her working with me made the job tolerable, but she needed that shift for her kid so there's no way I will fault her for that. When she switched shifts, she started coming over only on tuesdays after she visits her kid and before work, so I get to hang out with her for 1, maybe 2 hours a week. We had planned for her to come over and hang out on monday and tuesday last week, but on sunday she came up to me at work and told me she forgot she had already made plans on monday for yoga/meditation. I brushed that one off too because I know she's been wanting to get back into it. So when she came over that tuesday night (she called into work so we could hang out that night and the following morning before I go to work), she got up from the couch and made the statement ""man I really need to get back into yoga and start meditating again."" I immediately caught that and thought to myself ""but...didn't you do that yesterday, the reason why you cancelled on me?"" but I didn't want to argue or anything. Then she talks about how her boyfriend was over at her place for a week straight and that he left when she left to go see her kid just a few hours prior to her coming over here. So she lied about why she had to cancel. I never lie to her, and she never lies to me (or so I thought), but as of lately, she has been, and I hate being lied to. I didn't say anything, though. I just bottled it up.

Last night, we had scheduled to play D&amp;D with some coworkers since we hadn't played it in about a month. She was on board, I told her days prior, she said yes. I even confirmed it with her 2 hours before hand, she said she was still down. Once everyone was online and ready to go, I texted her and told her we're all ready and for her to hop into discord. I had texted her that twice in 30 minutes with no response. I give her a call and she rejects the call almost immediately, so I get annoyed. She texts me after and said that she just smoked out of a bong and she's too high to play. She knew we were going to play soon, and she still did that.

She keeps saying she's sorry after doing these, but at what point do I tell her that I'm sorry that I don't believe her.

Recently shes been able to smoke again, and her current boyfriend is an unemployed army vet who doesn't do anything and just collects checks from the government. She was a very active and responsible person, but since she started dating her boyfriend, shes become extremely lazy. She used to always look forward to visiting her daughter on the two days a week that she can, but now since she's always at her boyfriends, she'll skip the visits because she's too tired. Now she's just laying in bed all day with her boyfriend, high all the time and being lazy about her life.

I want to confront her about all of this but I don't believe I'm fully in the right, here. I'm moving in with her in January, and I don't know wtf to do about all this. Am I in the wrong for being upset over all of this or am I just overreacting? Should I bring this up to her? Or is this really none of my business?",17Sep2020,1

Your parents are losers compared to mine who have worked really hard and no they are neurotypicals too and are more ethical than your parents. You are also losers. You are unhealthy cause you don't take care of yourself. You need to get a job. You need to focus on getting a better CGPA. You need to work hard. Your mom loves me more cause I deserve it. If your mom doesn't love you unconditionally she is a vain bitch and you should disown her. My mom loves me unconditionally. There is nothing altruistic about being in your condition. Stop being angry at me for being better than you. Stop trying to internalize that I owe you something if my parents and I and people around me have worked hard for what we wanted. I really think, deep down, had I been dealing with your health issues, dysfunctional family and rapist boyfriends, I would have committed suicide just to see if the karma cycle is true and I do not want anything from your life. Stop assuming just cause I am more hardworking than you and better than you I don't have to not treat you like absolute dirt, unless you are related to me. I am not responsible for your inner emotional breakdowns and self esteem breakdowns as you stand collecting food stamps hoping me and my family would die, cause you are eating your heart out as the government pays you rations from my family's taxes cause your family income is below the taxation level. Obviously. I just know. 

Which brings me to the last part. Your victimhood is pathetic and disgusting. The country we are in has trashy problems, but for you food is free from ration stores, Healthcare is almost free, rent is cheap. Public transportation is cheap. You are only miserable cause you don't get to show off and have to wallow being considered the poor one and also cause men dine and dash you. However, you get more things to keep you alive than that starving kid in Africa who doesn't get that and he deserves it more, he is less a parasite. I don't owe you money. I don't need to pay you a cent. I don't need to be leveled up so that you can feel in your communist utopia you have emotional equality. Your problem is your dreams are up to the sky and you are absolutely shit. It is how it is. I am not responsible for your dreams and for you to elected not future maid if she doesn't get sold to pimps career. Also drugs shouldn't be free from the government and its not my fault I'm pure. What filthy parasites. 

It's not my fault I'm doing better, my parents are doing better, we are all doing better and we are prettier and more perfect than you. Stop focusing on us.

OH and, this is really important. I don't care about your fucking FRIENDSHIP. I don't need your love and affection that makes me barf. I am not losing the most important people in my life or even my mentors or even my maid who has a better career than you, I CAN, I ASSURE YOU LIVE WITHOUT YOUR FRIENDSHIP. INFACT YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT YOURSELF. IT WOULD BE A NET POSITIVE IN YOUR LIFE. YOUR COMPANIONSHIP TO YOURSELF IS PROBABLY THE REASON WHY YOU ARE SO DEPRESSED.

You are only miserable cause you don't get to show off and have to wallow being considered the poor one and also cause men dine and dash you. However, you get more things to keep you alive than that starving kid in Africa who doesn't get that and he deserves it more, he is less a parasite. I don't owe you money. I don't need to pay you a cent. I don't need to be leveled up so that you can feel in your communist utopia you have emotional equality. Your problem is your dreams are up to the sky and you are absolutely shit. It is how it is. I am not responsible for your dreams and for you to elected not future maid if she doesn't get sold to pimps career. Also drugs shouldn't be free from the government and its not my fault I'm pure. What filthy parasites. You are being paid by my taxes and my family taxes to be kept alive. 

It's not my fault I'm doing better, my parents are doing better, we are all doing better and we are prettier and more perfect than you. Stop focusing on us.

OH and, this is really important. I don't care about your fucking FRIENDSHIP. I don't need your love and affection that makes me barf. I am not losing the most important people in my life or even my mentors or even my maid who has a better career than you, I CAN, I ASSURE YOU LIVE WITHOUT YOUR FRIENDSHIP. INFACT YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT YOURSELF. IT WOULD BE A NET POSITIVE IN YOUR LIFE. YOUR COMPANIONSHIP TO YOURSELF IS PROBABLY THE REASON WHY YOU ARE SO DEPRESSED. MY EXCLUSIVITY CLUB KIND OF THINKS YOU DON'T MAKE THE CUT, I WOULD PICK MY MAID OVER YOU. ""

693,"Hey reddit, I’m mentioning that this is a throwaway account and I’m on mobile. Please bear with me. 

I’m 20f, I’m Indian and I’m a finance + economics student. I have life figured out for about the next two years but I’m having a very hard time right now with my future goals. 

I’m going to be honest, I do not like living in my country. It is not safe, dirty and living here feels like doomscrolling but in real life. It’s very difficult for me to really life as freely as I want to. So I decided I would move to another nearby Asian country after I get my degree. I had shortlisted five; Hong king, Singapore , Taiwan, Japan and S.Korea. I already speak a decent amount of Korean and have taken formal exams to get certified.

Today however I was bombarded with stories of Racism (specifically against Indians) in Singapore and how finding and renting a house seems downright impossible. Singapore was my first choice. To hear such a thing has demotivated me quite a lot. I just feel incredibly sad.

Japanese is hard but I’m bucking up and learning it right now but things just feel so off. I’m constantly wondering if my ethnicity will come in the way of simple things in the future like renting a home or getting a loan approved. I just know that I have no plans of staying in India any longer than I have to. 

Any advice for a someone down in the dumps would really help
Thanks.",17Sep2020,1
694,"I had been living in an apartment with this roommate for about 5 months. We moved in together during the pandemic. We were both looking for a cheaper option because of layoffs and cut backs. I didn’t lose my job but I wanted to save money. She did however lose hers. Because of that I offered to pay 70% of the rent until she found a job. We knew each other from college. We were pretty close friends, we hung out at a good bit and were in the same friend group. I’m currently dating someone. They live a good 2 hours away so we have a long distance relationship. I don’t get to see them that much and they rarely come over. My roommate is not dating. I’ve always found her attractive but have never thought of dating her and I have never had any romantic or sexual feelings toward her. Shortly after we moved in she would make casual, kinda flirty comments that I never thought much of. I thought that she was just being funny. It slowly seemed to progress further where I started taking more notice to it. She’d make very sexual comments when she’d catch a glimpse of me in just underwear. It made me feel really uncomfortable.

There’d be many times that she would just walk around in her underwear as well. Sometimes she’d just come sit on the couch next to me like that and try to cuddle and get really close. When she first started doing that I would just kinda ignore her or say something like “hey friend”. But after i felt like she wasn’t taking the hint I finally reminded her that I’m dating someone. She said back to me “come on, you guys aren’t dating. She lives like 5 hours away. That’s not going to work out.” I explained that I really cared for the girl and liked her a lot. I also told her that I didn’t want to ruin our relationship as roommates and friends. She didn’t really say much to that. I thought that she would understand. Nope. She snuck into my bed a few days later while I was half asleep. I woke up to her grabbing onto me. I jolted up because I was freaked out. I sleep naked so she was right up against everything. I asked her what she was doing. She said that she was lonely. I got up, put clothes on and told her to leave. I explained that what she has been doing is totally inappropriate and just plain creepy. I told her that she was going to have to find somewhere else to stay. She was like “relax, I’m going back to my room.” I told her no, that she needed to leave right now and find somewhere else to stay, and if she needs it I’ll give her money for a night at a hotel. She kept begging me to stay. She said she has nowhere to go and that its unfair because we are in the middle of a pandemic. I finally threatened to call the cops if she didn’t leave. She finally did. The next morning I woke up to texts from some of mine and her friends. They were all saying I was a jerk for what I did. 

I feel bad that she had nowhere to go. Should I apologize to her for kicking her out? Should I make sure she has somewhere else she can go or help her out?",17Sep2020,1
695,"Okay so I(24/F) have been friends with Mike (24M) since I was 14, we’ve been in pretty much the same friendship circle for the last 10 years and are quite close.

2 years ago Mike and I started having feelings for each other which we quickly confessed, we said that we would date in secret until we were official enough to tell our friendship group. However, slightly before this I had a horrific psoriasis breakout all over my body (especially the intimate areas). 

Me and Mike would hang out 1 or 2 times a week which would would usually end up in us making out in his bedroom, whenever he would try to escalate and touch my skin I would push his hand away and say that I was simply not ready. 

I was expecting my psoriasis outbreak to subside after a few weeks or a month maximum but it got worse! This whole time I was still telling Mike that I wasn’t ready and he was getting a little frustrated. 

I was and am still painfully insecure of my skin, I believe my previous boyfriend broke up with me because of it and I struggle to even talk about it in person (most of my girlfriends don’t even know).  

After around 8 weeks of occasional hang outs, Mike straight up asked me why I wouldn’t let him touch me and I couldn’t tell him the truth. I said that I just wasn’t ready to be in a relationship right now so we went back to being friends.

Fast forward two years and we are still great friends who have dated other people (my psoriasis eventually cleared up), we spoke last week and both agreed that while we have great chemistry neither of us felt a romantic spark.

However, I was talking to my friend about the situation who said that if she was in Mikes shoes, she would have felt insecure and confused to be dating someone for 2 months who didn’t want to have sex with them. Looking back I do think that I did affect his confidence a little bit and I guess I just want him to know that it was never about him at all! 

Should I tell him the real reason?",17Sep2020,1
696,"Long story, so bare with me here. So I’ve had a crush on this guy at work for about 4 months. I couldn’t really tell him or get closer to him because he was dating some else. Plus that someone else was a friend that I worked with as well. Just about two months ago him and her ended things because they were involved in some heavy toxic shit. I had him added on Instagram and he had texted me first on day I was supposed to go into work but didn’t. This was a few days before they broke up. We talked all night that day till 4 am about super personal stuff. It wasn’t until he actually broke up with her was when we actually started to talk more. A week or two later I finally fessed up and told him that I liked him because he assumed that I liked someone at work. He told me he thought I was attractive because of my personality and that I was “pretty cute”. We continued on to be just friends snapping each other every day. Talking about giving “homie head” 😂. Talking about each others problems. He once for about a week straight gave me a ride to work everyday because I was having trouble with my car. It was nice we talked to each other and it was never awkward. We once just sat in his car outside my house talking for about 2 hours. A couple weeks ago he asked if I wanted to go bowling with him and I did. That was fun, we bowled, ate out, talked and laughed. We even told each other we’d do it again sometime. Now fast toward to the present and it’s been two weeks now where he’s been sorta distant. We haven’t been talking as much and when we do on snap it last for about four snap pics before he’s like “I’m tired”. At work we’d barely talk to each other and when we did it was about random stuff. I’d understand the work thing because we were both trying to refrain from telling anyone to cause drama. But we’d talk like we were actual friends messing around with each other and stuff. He does have problems at home sometimes and he was sick for a couple days but he talks to his other friends and I thought he would come to me as well. I tried asking if everything was ok and he just says personal stuff. I would’ve thought I was someone he could talk to but idek anymore. All we do now is send daily “streaks”. The other day I tried avoiding him at work but he found a way to talk to me. I wasn’t trying to act cold just trying to refrain from saying the wrong thing if I did talk to him. He asked me if I was ok and I choked. He came around talking to his friend when there was no rush and I came up to him and told I wasn’t ok. He asked if it was about him and I said stupidly yes. I didn’t know how to explain it at the moment so he told me to text him. I’m not one to talk about something serious over text, so I told him I don’t wanna text you about. Now i don’t know how I’m gonna approach him next time I work with him. I was thinking tell him “it’s not something you did. I just overthink things a lot when I don’t know the whole story. Sorry I worried you” but idk. Maybe he just doesn’t like me. Idk I need someone’s help, pls",17Sep2020,1
697,"Hi,

Hoping to get some advice for my dad, who is having problems with his insurance company. The company takes out monthly because he has autopay set up. He has 3 cars (2003 toyota SUV, 2015 toyota SUV, 2017 toyota truck). He was paying $280 a month for two drivers (himself and me, a teenage female). 


Yesterday, they took out $560 (his monthly premium doubled). Apparently, they added my 16 year old sister to the insurance plan, but she doesn’t even have her drivers license yet. A few months ago we emailed the company proof of her learners permit and that she does not have a license. 
Over the phone they said they were not going to add her until she has her actual license. However, after our email, nobody followed up with us. My dad isn’t great with technology and never looked into it. Also, they had me as a male driver, which was making our monthly premium even higher. In March, we sent proof that I am a female. They never fixed that either, and my dad never followed up with them. 


He talked to the insurance agents assistant and they said they don’t know if they can refund him the money for the extra $280 charge. What are his options? Should he try to do a chargeback with the bank? I was thinking I will email the insurance agent asking for a refund for my sister being added ($280) and a credit for the price of being charged as a male. If they cannot do that, I will tell them we will get insurance elsewhere. Thank you for any advice, I really appreciate it!",17Sep2020,1

700,"Hi, I'm thinking about going on leave for my mental health.

I am 22 years old and I deal with Borderline Personality Disorder, PTSD, and generally terrible anxiety.

I've took leave in my current workplace before during the height of COVID. I think about 2 weeks exactly. I was struggling hard with my asthma after contracting a pretty oddly horrific chest infection. I also had a sinus infection that I wanted to monitor closely incase it would become severe.

Not only do I suffer my some obvious mental health issues but also very obvious issues with my immunity.

Other than that, that is the only time I took leave.

I don't want to quit my job, especially since the store is quite understaffed at the moment BUT I'm having a pretty hard time balancing my mental health and my ability to keep my head on straight in the workplace.

""no, of course you shouldn't go, there's a bloody pandemic!"" is my and I'm sure most of your responses. So allow me to add some context :

I have gone out 4 times since 2017. Otherwise I haven't left home other than to buy food and clothes, which is already a tough mental challenge for me. I am ashamed of this, and have the desire and will to improve my life.

Every time I reject such invitations to social gatherings, my depression deepens for several days as I feel I have failed myself and my friends yet again.

However, I'm a strong believer in social responsibility, and while no one is going that knowingly has covid, we are all young adults, and could be asymptomatic. I could infect my parents, customers where I work. Is it unlikely? Yes. Can I rule it out? No, unfortunately not.

His new sister-in-law’s family are causing some issues with our guest list...because of our limitations we are only inviting close friends (most of the friends invited are all in the Bridal Party) and only immediate family (siblings &amp; their SOs, aunts/uncles, cousins &amp; their SO’s/kids, and grandparents). 
Now it’s become an issue because I guess the sister-in-law’s parents are insisting on being invited and claiming they will be offended if they are not allowed to go...This is creating tension with his parents, making his parents feel stuck &amp; even saying that they won’t go to the wedding so that the sister-in-law’s parents can go........
This is an expensive wedding with limited capacity and we have to stay within our budget. If we invite the sister-in-law’s parents before even inviting blood-related extended family would cause even more tension and hurt feelings. But apparently not inviting them would cause hurt feelings for them and the sister in law. 
Any advice? 
I set up to talk about it with my future sister-in-law but is that a good idea? Should we just invite them at the expense of offending extended family (great aunts/uncles; second cousins; etc) or should we stick to our original plan and only include immediate family and friends in the bridal party?

This experience has apparently fucked up my relationships until this day, I can't seem to be able to form a serious intimate connection with anyone that is important to me. 

My contact to my father has always been extremely sporadic, like since we moved into this other country we saw each other every other year at most. Now I'm almost 30 and haven't seen him for about 8 years. Since I still spend time in my birth place pretty often (I love the country and the culture nonetheless) I decided to give it another try and visit him again. He basically begged me to do it the last years but I actually didn't want to go visit him, remembering the last time we met has been awful, since we had a terrible fight and he basically treated me like shit the entire time.

I now decided to come visit him again though, he is pretty old and sick and I don't know how long he may have left to live basically. Considering that I developed immensely personally throughout the last years, I felt pretty confident to take on this challenge. I didn't have any great expectations, I was even pretty sure we were going to fight at some point, that's just the way he is wired and I can stand up for myself now. 

Yesterday my expectations came true. He started telling me I should get married and have kids, do the usual stuff and criticized me for several life and lifestyle choices, so I couldn't help myself - I just snapped. You know, I'm not against starting a future with someone, it is just not my top 1 priority in life and since he and my mother basically fucked up my psyche in early childhood, I can't seem to be able to form a healthy bond with the other sex anyways so how in the hell should I consider starting a family right now? The whole thing was just so out of place and insensitive that I snapped. He responded in the same manner, and it quickly spiraled downward from that point on.

He became verbally abusive, telling me I should get the fuck out of his country and that I'm not his daughter anymore, stuff like that. It didn't hurt me **what** he said (he doesn't have this kind of power over me) it hurt me that he said it at all, if that makes any sense. 

Fast forward to the next day, he seems like he has completely forgotten about this stuff. He is a choleric, so his wife told me to not give too much emphasis about what he says, but I don't want to forget about this. I guess I'm kind of torn between understanding his position (I read a lot about personality types and I know why he did it and so on) and just saying fuck it and leave him to his bullshit to never contact him again ever.

You are unhealthy cause you don't take care of yourself. You need to get a job. You need to focus on getting a better CGPA. You need to work hard. Your mom loves me more cause I deserve it. If your mom doesn't love you unconditionally she is a vain bitch and you should disown her. My mom loves me unconditionally. There is nothing altruistic about being in your condition. Stop being angry at me for being better than you. Stop trying to internalize that I owe you something if my parents and I and people around me have worked hard for what we wanted. I really think, deep down, had I been dealing with your health issues, dysfunctional family and rapist boyfriends, I would have committed suicide just to see if the karma cycle is true and I do not want anything from your life. Stop assuming just cause I am more hardworking than you and better than you I don't have to not treat you like absolute dirt, unless you are related to me. I am not responsible for your inner emotional breakdowns and self esteem breakdowns as you stand collecting food stamps hoping me and my family would die, cause you are eating your heart out as the government pays you rations from my family's taxes cause your family income is below the taxation level. Obviously. I just know. 

Which brings me to the last part. Your victimhood is pathetic and disgusting. The country you are from has problems, but for you food is free from ration stores, Healthcare is almost free, rent is cheap. Public transportation is cheap. You are only miserable cause you don't get to show off and have to wallow being considered the poor one and also cause men dine and dash you. However, you get more things to keep you alive than that starving kid in Asia who doesn't get that and he deserves it more, he is less a parasite. I don't owe you money. I don't need to pay you a cent. I don't need to be leveled up so that you can feel in your communist utopia you have emotional equality. Your problem is your dreams are up to the sky and you are absolutely shit. It is how it is. I am not responsible for your dreams and for you to elected not future maid if she doesn't get sold to pimps career. Also drugs shouldn't be free from the government and its not my fault I'm pure. What filthy parasites. You are being paid by my taxes and my family taxes to be kept alive. 

It's not my fault I'm doing better, my parents are doing better, we are all doing better and we are prettier and more perfect than you. Stop focusing on us.

OH and, this is really important. I don't care about your fucking FRIENDSHIP. I don't need your love and affection that makes me barf. I am not losing the most important people in my life or even my mentors or even my maid who has a better career than you, I CAN, I ASSURE YOU LIVE WITHOUT YOUR FRIENDSHIP. INFACT YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT YOURSELF. IT WOULD BE A NET POSITIVE IN YOUR LIFE. YOUR COMPANIONSHIP TO YOURSELF IS PROBABLY THE REASON WHY YOU ARE SO DEPRESSED. MY EXCLUSIVITY CLUB KIND OF THINKS YOU DON'T MAKE THE CUT, I WOULD PICK MY MAID OVER YOU. ""

Like this internal dialogue I have to win over your love to have self esteem. No I don't. You don't pay my bills. You don't do shit for my life. You don't even do shit for yourself. I won't do shit for you.

722," 

Spelling will be horrible, not a native speaker, so please excuse that. From India.

Two months ago my grandmother, who had been mentally unstable for a few months, died in our home. My mother is a general physician and as she had died in our arms, she saw clear signs of kidney failure that caused septisemia. Grandma had already been diagnosed and treated for a kidney infection 2 years prior. However due to personal reasons, we didn't get her tested for covid post-mortem.

For the past few weeks, my mom and dad have been very sick. Mother's pulse has been rising suddenly for a few days now, reaching the 100-150 range. Dad has been suffering from diarrohea, and some sort of gastroentitis problem. Me and my dad have a slightly strained relationship so I'm not very sure of his problems. Whatever I know is what I could muster from my mother. I have heard them discussing about the gall bladder, a bladder stone and removing the gall bladder.

Today my mom confided in me that she has been having pain in her lower back, near her kidneys, just like my grandmother did before she passed away. She had a urine culture test done, which she says indicates a possible kidney infection and indirectly told me that whatever happened to grandma could happen to her too.

My mom's pulse reached 150 a few days ago and dad rushed her to the hospital, but it had already reduced to a normal level by the time they left home. However, her pulse still rises to 100 nearly every day since. She says she's not feeling alright, but is not able to put it in words.

They have done a few tests,but I'm of the view that they haven't done enough. I am not able to bring myself to ask them about the results, as I'll explain why. They visited the hospital twice and always came back with a much better mood, but their problems once again start the next morning.

I realize I'm not very clear with explaining their ailments, but this is all I know at the moment. It is not easy to discuss this at home without one of us breaking down. Dad already has been on the verge of tears many times when he thought me and my younger brother weren't looking. I'm fearing for their life and literally have no idea what to do. With all that's happened this year, my anxiety is through the roof and I'm extremely tensed. If any, any of you out there who has experienced or known someone who experienced these health problems, please advice and suggest me what to do now. I am clueless and in constant fear.

In my panic, I posted this in each and every sub that I thought would be helpful. Dad and Mom are trying to be as optimistic in front of me as possible, but even their facade is cracking. I have no idea why I'm reaching out to strangers who read this, but please, please, please- If you can be of any help, please do. It would mean the world right now.

Tl;DR- My parents are both quite sick, but they aren't able to convey about it to me and neither I am able to ask about it to them. I only know the following key terms. Dad- gall bladder, bladder stone, diarrohea, endoscopy and gastroentitis. Mom- suddenlr rising pulse(reaching 150), lower back pain that is caused by(as a urine culture test indicates) kidney infection.",17Sep2020,1
723,"To give some background, my dad served a little under 2 years as an infantry assault man in the marine corps before he was honorably discharged (he was almost dishonorably discharged, but his father/my grandpa was able to pull enough strings to get that changed so that wouldn’t be on his record) and he draws a ton of his self-worth from being a Marine. He idolizes the USMC, immediately respects anyone who was in the USMC, and always emphasized the importance of the brotherhood/camaraderie that the Marine Corps has to offer.

Growing up, my Dad was my hero. I thought he was the coolest guy in the world. He’s a smart guy; he speaks 4 languages and graduated Magna Cum Laude, he’s a licensed skydiver, scuba diver and a BJJ black belt. He actually is a pretty badass dude. I idolized him and as such, I idolized anything he idolized. I wanted to be just like him. 

Obviously, that meant I wanted to join the Marine Corps so he would be proud of me. I never thought of joining the Marine Corps because of what they had to offer, all I could ever dream about was how proud my dad would be seeing the eagle, globe and anchor pinned onto my chest. Impressing my dad was the only reason I have ever wanted to join. Not because the Corps appealed to me, or I’ve ever wanted to join the military or felt some calling to do it. I just wanted my Dad to be proud of me. 

When I was younger, I told him I wanted to join and *already* he seemed more proud of me. He told all his friends that his son wanted to join, gave me all kinds of tips and pointers on how to be the best Marine possible, and he would take me to the celebration of the Marine Corps birthday with him every year where he would teach me about Marine Corps heritage, the importance of honor and legacy, and would talk to his friends about how his son wanted to be a Marine. None of that heritage, history or legacy shit mattered to me though. All I cared about was making my Dad proud. I wanted him to love me the same way he loves the Marine Corps and his brothers in arms. 

As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized that just wanting to make your Dad proud isn’t the right reason to enlist. Not only that, but the more I learn about the US government and some of the ungodly, sadistic things the military does overseas, the less I want to join. On top of that, my Dad has flat-out admitted multiple times that he’s a high-functioning sociopath, which would obviously make him a great Marine, but I’m the complete opposite. I’m a very empathetic and compassionate person and sometimes he likes to give me shit about it (not in a mean way, just lighthearted teasing like jokingly calling me a hippie or things like that) and I know I don’t have it in me to go onto a battlefield and ruthlessly slaughter everyone in my path. It would eat away at my conscience for the rest of my life. 

Ever since I’ve decided I don’t want to join the military I’ve barely been spending any time with my Dad because I can’t even bring myself to look him in the eyes. Part of the reason is because I told him I wanted to enlist right out of high school, but I ended up not doing that, and after a year or so I think he figured I didn’t want to join but I then mentioned enlisting AGAIN after a while and it seemed to reignite his passion and his pride in me as his son. So I feel like I’m just going to be letting him down twice in a row. I actually got pretty serious about it too- I talked to recruiters on multiple occasions and trained hard to get in Marine Corps shape. The whole time I knew deep down I never wanted to join, but I tried so hard to convince myself that I did. 

My Dad and I used to bond over BJJ (I’m a blue belt right now) but I haven’t even gone back to that because I don’t even want to be around him, which sucks because BJJ is something I actually really really love and I do love spending time with him when the pressure of enlisting isn’t involved. I know if I come clean and admit I don’t want to enlist he’s going to be really disappointed in me but I also feel like a piece of shit for not spending time with my Dad. I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

What should I do? 

TLDR: My Dad was a Marine, he idolizes the Marine Corps and respects Marines way more than civilians. I told him I wanted to enlist when I was younger so he would be proud of me and respect me the same way he respects the Corps but I’ve since changed my mind and I’m too ashamed to admit it to him so I’ve been avoiding him because I know he’ll be disappointed in me.",17Sep2020,1
725,"Typing this up before I go to sleep. Some notes, 14 Sep pics were taken, 16 Sep Science test was done, 17 Sep I break down on the inside further. Girl and guy that got caught, let's call em Jane and John. Feel like John started the rumour. I go to an Australian school so some stuff may be different to you.

I essentially want advice on what to do and how to react.

So basically our year, grade 9, had this science test we did on 16 Sep. Friend took photos of the sheet on the 14th when the oblivious af teacher wasn't looking.

The kid who took photos sent it to people who asked for it. On the day of the test, him and another student got caught cheating, then they found out that a certain someone had took photos of the unanswered papers and shared it to others either that day or the day after.

Here's where I come in. Someone, idk who, started that it was me that snitched. Me. A religious guy who helps people with schoolwork. Yeah I'm a dickhead sometimes but I think I'm aight for the rest of the time. I'm being asked casually by people I thought were my friends, others who are just curious and others I feel like were passive aggressive.
 
Ffs some even making assumptions of the scenarios, saying shit like I showed it to my parents... What kid gonna share test papers to cheat on to their parents? Then they say I posted it... I only have two Instagram accounts which both @ each other in the bio and people know those accounts. They also say I snitched to the teachers when how could I? My friends were with me during form, some guys saw me outta the toilets and walk to science with everyone else, and my whole class was with me during science so how could I talk to the teacher about something as crucial as cheating?

My gang practically got over it, barely use it to make fun of me. But holy shit, no offense to you white people but you're annoying af like y'all won't shut up and just wanna make a scene. I'm thinking of 3 whities when it comes to mind and most of white gang probs hates me by now. One is a squeaker acting like an Xbox live kid, messaging me shit people messaged to Etika and calls me snitch9 whenever he sees me. Another is an aight guy that acts up a bit but takes advantage of the situation to his benefit. Then there's the other one... He talks to my crush and knows her more than me and I believe he was talking shit about me to the girls near him during Health class. People be turning on their backs on me so quickly and immediately DM me ""why'd you snitch"" instead of even asking ""did you snitch"". Off topic, my crush may or may not have blocked me today idfk we've been through shit in the DMs and some people think sus between us like I like her, which I do yet it changes depending on what she does since she doesn't act like other girls. I mean a friend did ask her ""what's the deal between you and-"" and she cut him off at their table during recess so some people probs know. Neither of us have leaked DMS so that's nice.

I talked to one of the people that got caught, she says she's defending me against her girlfriends so that's nice. She's says it's her fault her and the other guy got caught. What else is there. Jane suspects some other people snitched coz everyone believes that someone snitched in order for Jane and John to get caught. 

I posted on my story on the 16th Sep my side of the story, with the clip of Ragnar slapping his 2nd wife coz loyalty and trust y'know. 

Think that's about it.

tl;dr I'm being blamed for being a snitch for no reason, feel like people turned their back on me especially when asking me if I was guilty or not and even having the balls to make up a process on how I did it. Due to this event, I'd like advice. Heck comment if your thoughts on the story of you want.

I feel like I fucked up with my crush again lol rip, I barely talk to her irl anyway, I'm honest to her but y'know she swore to god not to tell people bout our DMs. I'd talk to her but I'm awkward af talking irl to her. I can't even look at her coz I like her, I just break down y'know. Our DMs are too good tho so much jokes and honesty, mostly from me

Apparently we're gonna do a harder Science test now so that's nice. It's been Hamza, typing at nearly 3am, gonna work on his fucked woodwork task and HASS test on a WW1 poster tomorrow and do an English documentary pitch with a speech and PowerPoint on Monday with a useless partner / former close friend, and signing out.

Steve and I started off as friends earlier in college but we’ve grown apart since. It all started when Steve’s girlfriend and my girlfriend got in a fight about talking shit about each other lol. Things were said, some petty things happened but the main thing is me and Steve are NOT on good terms. 

It’s gotten very bad this year when we moved back to our house.

To make things even worse, my 2 best friends don’t even care about how awkward it is for me to be around them and often go out with them when they know I’ll be all alone. Anyways tonight we’re watching Thursday night football and I’m scared Steve and his GF will come down and watch it with us. Is it rude if i leave the room and watch the game in my room?

My mom who just wants to help me feels like a stranger to me. It’s like I don’t even know her?

Even friends and in my love life too... the people I use to love and look at with empathy and care I now look at as obstacles trying to annoy me. For example, my brother walked into my room today. He just sat on my bed on his phone, not saying much. For some reason I’m unaware of I start kicking and thrashing and yelling at him to leave me alone.

732,"Ok, bare with me. There may be some triggers/content warning, so please read with grain of salt, especially since I was a child and terribly misguided. Also this is a bit long but I’m sure it’s will catch your attention 

Context because It matters: 

When I hit puberty, my sexual urges were so strong. I also think my hormones were through the roof because I also grew facial hair exceptionally young (around 10 years) and would sweat profusely at times. 

Unfortunately one of my friends introduced me to porn at this time and within a couple weeks I had my first orgasm. I was hooked. 

Honestly I have not a single clue how this idea ever occurred to me, but eventually I started taking pictures of random women in public whose bodies I thought were hot, for reasons I’m sure you smart people can imagine. I grew out of this by college, but it’s still grossly imprinted in my mind. **PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT I DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THIS MEDIA ANYMORE. THEY WERE ALWAYS DELETED, AND TO ADD THEY WERE TAKEN ON OLDER, FIRST GENERATION PHONES THAT a) DONT WORK ANYMORE and b) I DONT HAVE ANYMORE. ITS ALL GONE.** No my parents never noticed. They barely paid attention to me. They never asked me about girls and crushes and never checked in on me during puberty. They were there but in many ways I was alone, not that I’m blaming them they are awesome. 

I know this makes me sound vile and I feel so disgusting. I don’t know why I ever thought it was ok, I just felt these urges and did them. And now I’m at a point in life where women actually want to be with me and I feel like me doing what I used to do seriously scarred me. Instead of being a normal boy and talking to girls I liked I would sit behind passively. I wouldn’t pursue my desires. At this point it sounds like I need therapy but I don’t even know what to do. I just feel emotionally damaged and wish something as simple as being cordial with random new girls was easier for me. I’ve made so much progress and I’ve managed to approach some girls and make friends but it’s so so hard at times. Nothing else in my life can freeze me up like this. 

What hurts me the most is with some of the girls I’ve been with, we’ve enriched each other’s lives so much. When I see/meet new girls that are into me, sometimes I just know we could make each other so happy and then I just freeze up and can never build anything with them. It pains me to no end when this happens",17Sep2020,1
734,"I used to be bullied during my whole childhood. Kinder-garden, elementary school, middle school, high school. I've never really fitted in. Now after some time, I see that as a kid, I really used to be quite socially awkward and I had weird artsy hobbies that others didn't understand.  Despite that I found an amazing group of like-minded people when I was about 17 and we started to hang out. During the age of 17 - 21 I spent almost every day hanging out with friends. There was even a time in my life when everything was just one big party, going to pubs, bars, concerts, drinking, making out with random guys, going on dates, having boyfriends... You know your average teenage/young adult stuff. 

It really helped my self confidence but one part of me has always been that bullied kid that nobody at school liked. Now I'm 27 and throughout past years my friendships have been slowly falling apart.  I had lived abroad for a while so I lost a lot of people during that time. I've chosen building a career over having kids soon and some of my friends already have family and I feel like they see me as irresponsible or childish for not having one myself. A lot of them have changed their values over time and I feel like we have nothing in common anymore.

I've tried to find new friends, but it's not easy. Of course, I don't want to be just friends with anyone and I choose people with whom I want to get close to, but I almost always feel rejected. A lot of people that seem interesting to me are kinda' arrogant, at least to me. Like they're all saying ""I'm way too cool for you."" At the same time, I don't get it why. I'm not trying to brag, but I really do have a better job and a better education than anyone I know. I'm good looking, attractive and pay extremely lot of attention to my fashion style, tattoos, hair etc. 

I admit I can be a little socially awkward but usually, people say it's really cute. I struggle with being real and spontaneous with people. I always feel like I need to watch myself so I wouldn't say something stupid, weird or inappropriate. I'm also usually a really serious person, but I can laugh and make a joke too. I don't really get it what exactly it is that I do wrong. 

Sometimes, I experience feelings of rejection even if they're not real. Like bullied kid flashbacks when I feel like people are silently laughing at how lame I am, even if they're not. Sometimes I can't say if the rejection is real or just in my head.",17Sep2020,1

My position is much more demanding of my time and by the time 5 o clock hits, I am ready to just relax and have solitude. But every day my phone rings and if I answer my friend will want to talk for like an hour to 90 minutes. I cant keep doing this. Theres no new information at all day to day and I really dont have much to say on the phone. I'll get a call sometimes at 9 AM right when I wake up and start my shift. Sometimes 5 PM when I just clocked out and am pooped. He'll call at noon during my lunch break when I'm just trying to have some fucking peace and quiet. 

""What you doing today?"" Staying inside. Eating dinner. Watching a show. Like the rest of the world has been doing the last 6 months. 

It wastes a large chunk of my day and if I play video games, we'll also chat on Xbox Live so I'm basically talking to this guy every day, seeing him at work, seeing him at meetings, seeing him online, etc.

Its constant exposure with no new information and I'm just getting kind of tired of it. I love my friend, sincerely, but I really value alone time, perhaps more than other people and I dread talking on the phone, not because I'm anxious but because I find it a complete waste of time. 

What's even more insulting is that sometimes we'll talk on the phone and he'll just kind of have me there on speaker while he needs to do something else or is only half listening. YOU CALLED ME. I basically get held hostage. 

I asked if he had depression or something because I figured these are stressful times so maybe it helps him out to call me, but he said he doesnt. I dont want to be a jerk and I appreciate someone would care about me that much to reach out to me so often but I just dont understand the volume of which this is happening. 

I also am never the one to call him unless I missed his call. It just kind of pisses me off because then I worry if I'm being a bad friend by never being the one to initiate. But at the same time, it's just not how I like to interact with friends.",17Sep2020,1

740,"Some days I feel confident and others I just feel weird. I feel like I have no idea what’s “normal”, and I’m not sure why I care. I just feel really weird sometimes around other people, strangers, friends and almost everyone. I feel really weird and almost rude looking at people if I have nothing to say to them, and I generally can’t talk to people unless they are looking in my general direction. Then if I am around someone I don’t really know, I feel rude asking them what they do  like or just making small talk. Are there any good resources on not being so socially inept??",17Sep2020,1

He has been working at his family store since then, and he has decided to keep running the store to support his family and let his little siblings study.

He had taken a college loan for 4 years, but he is quitting it midway, and has been trying to get the loan canceled. I really don't think the college will do this because the admin is known to be strict when it comes to fee. Is there anyway his loan can be canceled?",17Sep2020,1
744,"So my new roommate and I are going into our second year of college together, and during our first year we basically grew to become best friends and are part of the same circle of friends and all that jazz. He’s a great guy and we get along very well, and during quarantine from like March to August after we were sent home from school early, we literally facetimed almost every single day. 

But maybe that’s not enough context... when I first met him, he considered himself bisexual (i think), and at the time I considered myself straight but discreetly questioning whether that was true or not (or maybe I was just in denial). We got drunk a lot together with friends and whatnot, and after quite a few drunk hangouts, I started getting very subtle sexual hints from him, which I would kind of feed into very slightly, but I just figured it was us being drunk and all loosened up. However, sure enough, November 9th of last year (i remember the date lol oops), we had a drunk hook up, and honestly it was something that bothered me, while also turning into something that I wanted more of... 

But we just figured we were just drunk and horny (and that I should probably reevaluate my sexuality but that’s another story), so we just laughed it off and life went on as good friends. Then it wasn’t until February of this year where we found ourselves drunk hooking up once again (ironically enough on valentine’s day), and then 2 weeks later again, and then a few days after that once more. So basically in that timeframe, we kind of established that this is probably turning into a friends with benefits type of thing. 

The problem is, I really feel like even from the November hookup, I slowly, but gradually started feeling something a little more than simply just being horny. I think it’s a feeling I ignored or tried distracting myself from, but there was always a small pinch when he would talk about another girl he hooked up with or something. But that kinda faded away UNTIL the quarantine period of like March to August, where we were basically on the phone everyyyyy night just blabbering on about nonsense... it got to the point where he really started meaning a lot to me, and it would feel very weird for a few days to go by without getting a call from him. 

Not too far into April, we already started being sexually explicit over facetime, and at one point that even almost became a daily thing. The issue is he’s indecisive about his sexuality and making commitments, so the sexting was kind of on and off... which, to be completely honest, bothered me just a little... it kind of made me wonder if maybe he was not as attracted to me as I was to him. 

He also had a couple things with a couple other people over the summer, which definitely bothered me a little, and kind of reconfirmed that there probably was more than just sexual feelings that I had toward him. But I tried convincing myself that I was just horny... 

Then skip ahead and we find ourselves searching for an apartment together, and now the idea of the friends with benefits relationship continuing is overhyped from like July to literally our move-in date which was only a couple weeks ago. The sexual facetime calls commenced normally again, but with some hiccups in between because he found himself taking too long to “finish” over facetime, but he tried convincing me it was his personal problem and had nothing to do with me... but we decided to stop anything sexual until we finally were in person again.

Now we are here, and there’s already a mix of emotions going on inside both of our heads. It turned into WAY more than the original plan of just hookups every now and then... from an outside perspective, it might even seem like we are in a committed relationship. There’s casual kissing throughout the day, there’s these “looks” that mean more than just “i find you attractive”. Meanwhile, neither of us have officially determined our sexuality to ourselves, or anyone else for that matter. But I liked wherever it was (is?) going. The first eye opener (in a red flag type of way but also an optimistic type of way if we tread carefully) was when the L-bomb was introduced while being intimate. If anytnjng, I thought I would be the first to say it, but he was. After that point things started seeming more like a serious type of fling/relationship than just simple friends with benefits.

The main issue though, is that he has trouble finishing when we’re intimate, and it’s a problem he says he has had with a lot of his hookups/relationships of the past. It makes me feel pretty shitty, especially because I try so hard to help him finish, but he only did with me once. We still have so much fun in intimate settings, and he even likes playing with the idea of not finishing sometimes... But the other day it seemed to hit him hard, and now he thinks we should take a break... pretty short lived lol right? since it’s only like the third frikin week.

The thing is I’m really bummed out and distracted by it and I really am pretty hurt, because he’s always switching sides... one day he’s so touchy with me and seems to be more than just horny but actually seems to share the same sort of feelings i have, and the next he’s talking about girls and wanting to not make any commitments and whatnot. My head is spinning and I think i should give him the space he needs, but in a perfect world I would love to be in some sort of committed relationship with him... any thoughts or concerns or ideas or anything at all?? i can’t talk about this with literally anyone because no one knows about what him and i have (let along that im not straight) and i’m not ready to tell anyone... anything helps guys thanks so much",17Sep2020,1
745,"Hello! I’m in need of some advice here. Me (24m) and my girlfriend Sally (24f) have been having a lot of trouble lately. We started dating about 9 months ago, and to be fair a lot of these issues started with a mistake i made. I had a friend from work who i was very close with, we’ll call her Alyssa (24f). I used to always joke around with Alyssa who has a boyfriend of 5 years, that we should kiss or hold hands, like play flirting i was never really serious about it, but we hung out every week with some of our other friends. Anyway, these jokes kind of continued when me and my girlfriend started dating. 

Eventually 3 months into our relationship, Sally went through my phone and saw that when we had been dating for a month i texted Alyssa saying something like “see you tomorrow for kisses!” and needless to say, she was pissed. Ever since then, we’ve fought almost every day. I no longer keep in contact with Alyssa because of this and i’m pretty upset about that. Sally gets jealous if i spend time with my girl friends, including my sister sometimes which is a little strange to me. Ontop of this ive repeatedly said to her i want to take things slow, but somehow we end up spending every night at each others house, it’s like we already moved in. She lost her job during quarantine but i kept mine and have been working a lot and coming home to her. I haven’t seen any of my friends much because she complains that i’m always working and never spend time with her but i don’t get the free time that she does to spend with her friends. I feel trapped in a way, when i see her i genuinely love her so much and just want to hold her. When i’m not with her i just want to break up so i can do whatever i want. We’ve almost broken up multiple times now but every time i can’t stop myself from begging her to stay even though i know we might both be better off that way. She doesn’t really like my friends or like spending time with them and she’s very bad at hiding it. My friends all think that i’m in abusive relationship with her and that she’s cruel to me, but she’s not really. I’ve hurt her and she’s hurt me but she also has done a lot to comfort me and is always there when i need her to be.

756,"I work in retail full time and have been with the same store for several years. During this time a customer has repeatedly come in and was a regular before I started my position. This man is retired but lacks social skills and has no/little to no family or friends from what we have been told. He collects children’s toys like hot wheels cars. Up until this year this regular came in once or twice a week, put items on hold, then would come back maybe one more time that week to “check up on his hold” and often adding other items to it the hold before purchasing. Management put in rules that we couldn’t do this and he needed to purchase on the spot as other customers complaining they couldn’t get these items which is completely fair. 

This customers behaviour has changed this year especially since these changes and become quit intense with staff. He refers to staff members by name and often comes in requesting specific staff members. Instead of putting items on hold now he comes in with memorabilia from his childhood such as photo albums or clothing to show staff. He also acts inappropriately outside of our store - he has told us that he has been banned from two bars in our city that uni students frequent as he has tried to dance with the girls there and made people uncomfortable. 

In the last few months he has come in multiple times a day with new items to show staff members. My manager also is emotionally involved in this situation and he often comes in and requests to speak to her. He has brought her a bottle of wine and asked her to come back to his house to see his toy collection.  Some days he comes in and when his favourite staff members aren’t working he gets angry. He’ll often come back multiple times and ask for people on their days off - expecting them to show up.

This week he made a staff member cry twice because he started talking about his brother that died in infancy and she has a young son. Two customers complained to me as he was making them uncomfortable as he leaned on the front counter with his photo albums talking about people who have passed away from drug overdoses and death. I work in a nursery/ toy store. I went to management and relayed these complaints and I was told I need to be able to tolerate this man because he is just old and lonely as he spends a lot of money here. He has also told staff in the past that he has been suicidal. When this customer is in I stay away from him as I don’t want to get involved. 

The issue here is that other people are uncomfortable because of this man, and other people I work with are devoting all their time to him and his emotional issues and neglecting other customers or their own jobs. I also believe the people I work with are overstepping their professional boundaries by getting involved and I’m concerned that this could have the opposite effect given he doesn’t seem mentally stable.

769,"My friend told me yesterday that he did something illegal when he was younger, and due to that someone he knew from school hated him and held a grudge against him. He then went on to tell me that this person became wealthy and now has a large sphere of influence, and uses this to torment my friend.

He believes his phone is tapped, and that he's being watched via his webcam.

He thinks he's being physically followed sometimes.

He thinks that ""they"" (the group of people who will apparently do whatever this wealthy person says) have slowly told other people what he did, and now everyone around him, including our group of friends knows, and that everything we do is an attempt to mess with him.

He talked about the fact that our friend group might be a cult, and the sole purpose of the cult is to torment him.

He thought I'd poisoned him at one point because he had bowel issues after we'd been drinking together.

He quit his job even though he was struggling for money because he started to believe that his co-workers knew and were making veiled remarks at him to torment him.

He think the ads which show up on his phone have been placed there to torment him (""I see hummingbirds all over social media now and it's them telling me that they know I hum when I'm home on my own"").

He sees things that are aimed at him everywhere... An entire game app on his phone designed specifically for him, a video a YouTuber had uploaded about him, random things on TV and in video games.

Etc. etc.

It's all encompassing, he scrutinises every little detail of his life and finds tenuous connections to what he did, or ""them"".

He told me all of these details for 2 hours straight, and it was clearly just the tip of the iceberg.

He also told me he did something else illegal very recently, related to the original thing he did. He's now more paranoid than ever because he believes ""they"" know about this and are ramping up the torment.

First of all, is this psychosis or paranoid schizophrenia? He doesn't hallucinate as far as I'm aware, although it's possible.

Second, what do I do about this? He's told his mother all of this and it sounded like she just dismissed it all. I gently poked holes in his logic while staying sympathetic, and he came around to thinking that maybe I'm not ""in on it"", and that it's not completely impossible that our group of friends aren't either - but he's 100% absolute that ""they"" exist and are messing with him. How do I get him to get help when he clearly thinks it's real? He doesn't believe it's a delusion at all.

Third, even if I can get him to a therapist or call a doctor for him (which I'm not even sure it's possible for me to do) - what about the illegal things that he's done? What he's done seems to be the root of his delusions, but I'm worried if I pass this information on I'll get him in a lot of trouble. I don't believe anyone is in danger, and although the crimes aren't victimless, the harm that could have been caused to them is very minimal... However it could ruin his life if it got out. I'm aware this reasoning sounds very stupid, but I don't want to be responsible for ruining his life either.

I'm at a loss, any advice would be appreciated.",17Sep2020,1

Just started college, so I have more chances to meet people than I did before. Regardless of that, I'm not a very confident guy, as in I don't feel like I bring a lot to the table, so I feel like that shows when I'm interested in someone, if that makes sense? If I do have an interest in a girl, I immediately get nervous whenever she's around and I find it damn near impossible to bring up my feelings. If it's a girl in a class that I think is attractive or kind that I want to get to know, I just get really anxious and talk myself down from trying to start a conversation.

2. talk to mom

3. talk to dad

4. email anonymously to dad

5. email anonymously to mom

He also needs to apply for college and take the SAT this year along with the rest of the stuff. 

Obviously this would suck ass for anyone but he’s literally barely an adult and now has to deal with a heaping pile of crap. 

Our parents are typical baby boomers and have been emotionally unavailable at best our entire lives, so he really can’t talk to them about how crappy it all is. My sister moved out recently so it’s pretty much just me and him. 

Does anyone have any tips or advice to make him not feel so down, or at least make it a little more bearable for him?",17Sep2020,1

780,"I (20F) have worked for this company for 2, almost 3 years. Without giving away too much identifying information, it's a huge waterpark resort. I absolutely LOVED my job for the first year and a half, but recently corporate has completely ruined everything. I could go on and on, but my main issues are a complete lack of communication, lazy COVID procedures, and no respect for employees.

I take care of my grandparents on Sundays. My grandfather has cancer and his immune system is compromised as a result. My grandmother's immune system is also very weak. The lazy COVID procedures make me worry I'll pick it up at work and give it to them. This virus would be a death sentence for both of them and I would never forgive myself. 

Management constantly changes rules and expectations without telling us. Big changes. And then we all get in trouble or written up for not following rules and expectations we were not informed existed. 

As I said above, I take care of my grandparents on Sundays. They keep scheduling me on Sundays despite me telling them I can't work Sundays and begging them to stop. There's no one else that can tend to them on Sundays. They don't care. 

I have a new job and I start September 28th. I've wanted this job for a long time and its a huge step in advancing my career. My last day at the resort is September 25. The thought of having to stay until then is literally unbearable, but I really don't want to burn the bridge and leave on a bad note. I know that's unprofessional. I just don't know if I can do it. Is there a way I can professionally leave before my two weeks is up?",17Sep2020,1

783,"Hi! I made this account to get some advice on this. Recently I’ve realized I tend to tell white lies. I’m not even sure if I’m defining white lies correctly but let me explain. 

Throughout this week and next week me and a few roommates are moving into an apartment. I mailed something to my apartment and I realized the package would be arriving before I moved in. I got a notification that my package arrived, so I texted the roommate group chat to ask if they could take it in. 

But here’s the catch. Basically I said that the package would be arriving soon and if anyone is at the apartment, could they take it inside when it comes. I did this so no one would feel urgency/obligated to pick it up if they hadn’t moved in yet. I knew that the package may be sitting outside for a few days before someone finds it, but it was my fault for not timing the delivery.

^sorry if my explanation isn’t clear, but basically, I realized I tell ""lies"" or simplifications like this often, just to make things run smoother. Sometimes I feel like the whole story is more than what’s necessary to get things done. Do most people do this or is this something I should be worried about? 

All answers appreciated!",17Sep2020,1
784,"I'm currently in my second year of uni and I feel very depressed.

As a child growing up I was always praised for being intelligent and I always felt happy for being the best in my class at maths/english. I did very well on my primary school SAT scores (full marks in maths and very high in everything else) and went on to high school. In high school, obviously it was not as easy as before, but I was able to get good grades on a lot of work pretty easily with a low amount of revision. However, I remember lamenting in high school that I missed being a kid and having more free time. I passed my GCSEs with very good grades, A's and A\*'s in everything. In the last 1-2 years of high school I was going through incredibly bad mental health issues that made it hard for me to focus or concentrate in class, but luckily i have a good memory and still managed to get good grades in pretty much all my subjects with fair amounts of revision in the days leading up to my GCSEs.

When I got to college I was still going through the awful mental pain (for lack of a better way to describe it) and obviously because A-levels are very hard and you need to work and revise, my grades started slipping and I was getting a lot of D's, E's and even U's, especially in maths, my hardest subject. The bad grades in maths hurt most because I kept constantly thinking about how in primary school, I loved maths and was so good at it, and when I was 10 I even kind of wanted to be a mathematician when I grew up. In college now I was suffering emotionally and kept thinking of what my primary teachers would say if they could see me now, failing maths.

I was still in my terrible mental state at the end of college but ended up revising a lot out of sheer panic and desperation, aware that I was really messing up my life even if I felt completely unable to revise because I was in so much turmoil with depression/anxiety/intrusive thoughts and all sorts of other crap. I managed to get an A in one subject, B in another and, unfortunately, a D in maths. I feel that I could've gotten a C, I was several marks away and all of my friends agreed that the maths tests were almost unfair, people were saying they were possibly harder than the further maths exams.

Anyway, I ended up just choosing a computer science course spontaneously without giving it any thought, because I needed to choose something and this seemed a bit interesting I'm now in the second year and did alright in the first year but only with the help of my 2 only friends at uni who I feel like I basically had to mooch off of for a lot of the units. I'm starting to feel that life is hell and wish i could never have born. I have practically no career plans, little interest in my course, never had a job (trying to get volunteer work at the moment) and spend most nights lying awake wishing I was a young child again. I think back to my happiest moments and feeling like I was actually a smart person when in actuality I'm average at best compared to my peers at uni and those I met in college.

I'm lucky that I have some money saved (not a lot) and I live at home, I used a lot of money I received from an insurance claim (was in a bad accident when I was 15) and used most of it to help my mum buy our house, so we both own it and I don't have to pay rent. Thankfully I don't need money desperately right now but I'm terrified for my future as I have no plans and can only think about how much I long for the magic of the past, even just as long ago as 4-5 years ago.

Sorry if this seems like a rant or if I seem entitled or privileged, I don't mean to come off that way. I never try to belittle others or act like I'm more intelligent, because I'm not. I guess I'm just in a crisis since I was a 'gifted' kid and am now basically at a dead end in life wishing I was either dead or 8 again. Any advice?",17Sep2020,1

So as the title states: Another year of high school has kicked off yet again! I’m (16M) starting 11th grade this year, with a primary focus on Economics and Business economics. I love these subject very much, I enjoy learning and reading about them both in and out of school. 

Then, after I attended my classes it became apparent that I was the only male in these classes (about 20-30 people). This very difficult for me, as I do not connect to them well and I find basically no way to strike a conversation with any of them. My mates tell me I’m lucky, yet this just feels extremely lonely and I constantly feel like the odd one out. I work hard academically and have been successful on that front so far, yet I’m afraid this might seriously harm my self-esteem and work motivation.

My mom loves a local artist's first album from about 15 years ago that won a national award. He has released two albums since but never made it big. I decided to message him on insta yesterday to say how legendary his album is for my family, since he only has 2k followers and i figured he would see it. Well he was very happy to read my message and followed me back.

This got me thinking, what if I asked him if he'd play a show at my parents' house next spring, his first album front to back? I do not want to offend him by snubbing his more recent stuff, but i also think it could be a great experience for all. My partner who is a musician said that the first album is usually what the label wants and isn't the passion project so that is another factor of course.

793,"TW SEXUAL ASSAULT 


I’ve been working in a specific field for about 8 years. My last job in that field was my longest, most responsibility bearing, and therefore best on a resume. I was sexually assaulted last year by a coworker at an outing. I had a rape kit done, filed charges, and got a restraining order. I told our GM minimal details and provided a copy of the restraining order, since clearly he should not be returning to work while I am employed there. 

My abuser worked in a different department so the GM relayed appropriate details to his direct boss (DB) and told him to remove him from the schedule. Unfortunately DB was very good friends with many of his subordinates, including my abuser. Word of the incident spread like wildfire. Typical blame the victim stuff, I was lying, I wanted it, etc etc etc. 

I was humiliated and at the time I was living across the country on my own so I had no friends or family as a support system. 

I considered suing for hostile work environment but I made the *very* tough decision (please don’t attack me for this) to drop everything, including the assault charges, and move away to restart my life. 

It’s been a bit over a year and I’m doing better. I was in therapy until Covid and will be going back post Covid. 

My problem is this: 

I haven’t worked in that field since but I’d like to return. With out putting that job on my resume how would I explain this huge gap of time and experience to future employers? I excelled at that job and my bosses *would* have given me a glowing recommendation before everything. But now I don’t want to include it at all in fear of them contacting my bosses and being told the story or my bosses figure out where I’m living and tell my abuser for some reason.",17Sep2020,1

My dad is generally a nice, mellow guy. He sleeps a lot though.  
He had pancreatitis in march? may? I forget. Was this year though. Because he stopped drinking from the pandemic so fast I think.  
He promised my mom he wouldn't drink again.  


Around august, our precious doggie was not doing well. I caught him taking a drink of alcohol. He told me it was only because he was stressed out about the dog, and to not tell mom. Being naive and stubborn, and an idiot, forgot.  


Fastforward to last night. I got off a call with a friend, after playing roblox. After an hour or two, my dad fell while going to move the fridge to clean under it.  
He also put straight-out-of-the-freezer veggies onto a pan covered in oil on the stove that was hot.  
And after a bit, the fighting begun. He called her a b\*\*\*h repeatedly. Said she separated him from his family (his parents were racist as hell), and his friends (one of them sent p\*rn of two people mom and dad voted for to my mom because she is a democrat)  
My mom said today that our new puppy found 6 empty half-pint bottles of vodka in the bathroom trash, and that dad had been sneaking off to his car and lying to her face.  
She also said that dad had substance abuse.

So my plea to you strangers, how do I try to fix things up? We can't go home until he sobers up, and we left our musical instruments and puppy because we were in such a rush to leave. (However, he angrily said that we couldn't take MOM's birthday dog-)

Then it got to the point where she wanted money, sex wasn't good enough she more of less took 6000$ from my family specifically my mother, who I love so much. we broke up because she met a guy on gmod we'll call him mikey he was a year younger than me I knew she was cheating on me with him because it was obvious she denied such accusations. Basically she cheated on me I found out because we were supposed to go to a concert in arizona (where mikey lived) to see some rapper I cant remember who. She took the tickets and left without me and instead went with mikey, that's not the worst part she came back and insisted I stayed with her obviously I didn't want too while this was happening I had met my current girlfriend I won't say her name for privacy reason's she and multiple other people in this town and state had already heard of this alex girl and knew she was bad news as she had already fucked over multiple people before me and even ruined someone's reputation by calling a guy a rapist. my gf was explaining that to me obviously I believed her because why not and it turned out she was right, now it's been a year and a half since me and my current gf have been dating and I still think of alex, not romantically or sexually just hatred she ruined my life and it bothers me that she keeps doing it and nothing is happening to her, I went to a therapist for this issue she basically told me I was stupid and proceeded to call me a sociopath for still caring about this girl.

But this week we were supposed to have drinks at my friends house and the only day I said I was free was last night which she replied yeah I’ll let you know if we do it or not and then here’s me waiting for a message saying it’s not happening and instead she sends me a pic and a video at the friends house drunk having a good time. Like rubbing it in that they were having fun without me even tho I was supposed to be there? And today she’s not messaged me once which is not like her at all we message constantly all day cause we are really close but I think she’s mad at me for no reason. Should I say anything or should I wait for an explanation cause I’m sick of being mr nice all the time when someone hurts my feelings I never tell them And they end up doing it again or worse.

812,"**Some additional context:**

* There will likely be around 10 people attending
* The gathering would be in October, and where we live, it can be quite cold that time of year. Doing something outdoors is might be tough.
* Since it's my dad's 60th, *ideally* we would do something a little more special than what we normally do. Typically we would do a dinner, maybe some live music or something, and spend the day together. This is the tough part given the pandemic. Making it ""special"" is challenging this year, since restaurants, concert venues, indoor activities are essentially a non-option. 
* And unfortunately, it's not just that the extended family doesn't care for COVID guidelines, it's that they actively ""rebel"" against them and antagonize those of us who are trying to observe the guidelines. I'm trying to take the high road and not engage in any debate with them, I'm just trying to put forth a pragmatic plan that allows us to mark the occasion without breaking any guidelines.

I realize this is a tough question! If anyone has any advice for how to safely celebrate, it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",17Sep2020,1

818,"I originally made this burner account on July 27th to make a post about this same situation, but it's so difficult for me to put my thoughts into words. I apologize in advance for rambling on, since I've never talked to anybody outside of my family about this problem. And have been told many times in the past by my mother, ""Don't talk to anybody this family."" I honestly can't hold it in any longer.

**BACKSTORY TO THE PROBLEM**

I don't drink, smoke, or have done any drugs in my life. When people ask me why, I respond with, ""My family has a history of addiction and I don't want to fall into the same trap."" Which is partially the truth, but another part of it is that my mother is verbally and emotionally abusive when she does drink. Throughout my childhood and leading into my senior year of high school, she would only be drunk once in a while. With what I've experienced and seeing how she has treated my family members in the past while she is inebriated, it aided me in my decision to become straight edge. I don't want to lose control of myself; I don't want to risk negatively effecting the lives of my friends and family. I heard stories from my relatives at my uncle's funeral a few years ago about how he destroyed himself with alcohol. He used it to cope from his horrible marriage and ruined his liver as a result. I saw how his death effected my grandfather for the remainder of his life, and it baffles me why my mother would fall into the same vice when she saw how her own father (my grandfather) felt.

Last year, my grandfather died of old age and he was the last surviving parent my mother had. She took care of him during the last years of his life, and none of her siblings didn't bother to help. During this time, I was living with my siblings, but the situation got worse there once COVID happened earlier this year. Leading into my grandfather's funeral, I was contemplating about quitting my IT job due to the bullshit I was dealing with at the time. I was there for almost 7 years, my team (including myself) got denied our yearly raises, and my boss hated me because I never sucked his ass politically like many others did. I had strong work ethic, I was #1 in metrics every quarter, extremely reliable, and always stepped up to handle tough decisions and problematic clients when my colleagues didn't want to deal with conflict. After my boss chose some guy, who he never met before, who lived out of state, to take the promotion I should have gotten, and ended up having his subordinate tell me the news rather than tell me face to face... I decided to put in my two weeks notice. I explained the situation to my family and they fully supported me.

Despite the bullshit, I applied for many jobs, had the interviews, and came so close to being hired at a few of them... But it has always been, ""Close, but no cigar."" So instead of being unhappy and miserable every time I came to work, and waiting for an employer to give me a chance... I had to leave for the sake of my own mental health. All I've wanted for the past several years is to get a job where I can support myself, live on my own, have freedom in my life, and never have to deal with the toxicity of my family ever again.

Before COVID-19 happened, I was living with my siblings in my mother's old house for a few years, desperately trying to get a new job, and freelancing to earn some income for myself. She has been paying for my side of the utilities while I've been job hunting. Throughout that time, I always stayed in my room, in my bubble, minding my own business, and delved into my hobbies of content creation and graphic design. Once I found out that one of my siblings were going to have his daughter stay at our place because of the pandemic, I had to get out of there. She is a pain in the ass, a slob, and would constantly keep me up all night as she talked to her friends on the phone. Anytime my relative is criticized, especially about his kid, it would always turn into a yelling match. I had to share a bathroom with them. They never bothered to clean up after themselves, never bothered to flush the toilet, or pick up what they dropped on the floor. I got fucking tired of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**MARCH 2020**

When the pandemic happened, my mother reached out to me and invited me to stay with her. I didn't want to risk getting COVID from my siblings, and I wanted to help her get groceries to reduce the risk of her getting infected. My mother said she would pay for my food, I wouldn't have to pay for any of the utilities, and I would get to be with my dog (I gave him to my mother since she was living alone and brought up how lonely she was. When we lived together in the old house, he bonded with her more since she was at home often.) Sounds great, right? I brought all of my stuff over there around March, and the first month was great... That is, until she started drinking. It has been progressively getting worse and worse since that time.

&amp;#x200B;

**JULY 2020**

It reached its peak on July 27th when she got really drunk, I saw her cup of white wine on the living room table, threw it away, and went back into my room. After an hour of her banging against my door, telling me she supports me, and just a whirlwind of bullshit. She screams at me, telling me to get the fuck out of her house, take all my shit with me, and telling me that she hopes my computer breaks on the way to my relative's place. The one thing I own to help me escape from the shitty life I've been living...

I texted my second relative, who lives at the old house, about what was going on. The banging on the door, the verbal abuse, our mother being drunk, and etc.. While I was doing that, my mother was texting that same relative that I was the instigator in our verbal fight, which was the furthest thing from the truth. So for whatever reason, he didn't know what to believe. I told him that I had to come back there, which he responds with, ""Okay, I guess."" What the fuck...

I had to take multiple trips to bring my stuff to the relative's place, dealing with more verbal and emotional abuse every time I came back to my mother's to get the rest of my things. I was on the verge of tears the entire time. Once I finally brought my stuff over to my relative's place, he sends me a long paragraph how I have to pay my portion of the utilities since my mother would no longer help... To pay for utilities in a place where I don't want to live, living with toxic siblings, and having to contact my toxic alcoholic mother to pay for the shit. They are aware of my job situation, especially with COVID-19 hindering my job search, and are making the situation even worse.

Throughout the night, she bombarded me with text messages. Once I woke up in the morning, I texted her back, knowing she was sober, and I told her how she made me feel while she was drunk. How I was on the verge of tears, possibly never seeing my dog again, and just wanting to be happy with my life. My mother told me she wanted me to be happy with my living situation, and I responded that I was happy living with her when she wasn't drinking. I told her, ""You go from being a nice person to becoming a monster when you drink."" To which she responded with, ""You're a monster and you don't drink."" Basically deflecting the situation like a fucking child. With nowhere else to go and not being able to afford paying the utilities, I had to move back in with her.

I hoped and prayed to God she would stop the drinking. I'd rather have her smoke 100 cartons of cigarettes instead of tasting one drop of alcohol. Just like how it was when I first moved in, everything was great, and then my sister's car got totaled while she was working. So as a result, she had to borrow my mother's car for a while, which stopped her drinking for a while too. When my mother got her car back, I made sure I went to the store with her to ensure she wouldn't buy any alcohol.

**SEPTEMBER 15-17**

No conflict, no bullshit, no toxicity until my mother wanted me to bring old stuff from the garage over to my sister's house. Sure, no problem. Brought the stuff over, went grocery shopping, and came back to my mother's place to see her hammered... She went out to get booze while I visited my sister (Who is the most normal out of my siblings) and my nephew. She has been drunk now for the third day in a row and I'm just fucking done with this.

**WHAT CAN I DO TO ESCAPE THIS SITUATION?**

When she is sober, my mother can be a nice person. However, her bad traits outweigh the good, and the alcohol magnetizes those flaws. My mother can be controlling and manipulative. She refuses to take advice when people try to help her. Anytime she looks like the bad guy in a situation, she immediately wants to end the conversation. She will never go to rehab, and she is not the type who will seek help for her problems either. So that's out the window.

I don't know where to go or who to turn to. I just want to be free from all this, to start a life of my own, and stay away from the majority of my toxic family for good.

I don't have a college degree. I've gone back and forth over the years to get an AA, but it seems like employers want to hire people with bachelor's degrees for entry level positions, and then pay them shit wages. With how crippling student loan debt can be AND not even being guaranteed a job once you graduate as well, I never bothered to fully pursue it.

I have a background in graphic design, video editing, broadcasting, have a 90 WPM typing speed, previous supervisor experience, experience with deescalation in a work setting, and was in the workforce for 9 years until I had to leave my previous job. I built up savings during that time, but I'm trying to conserve every dollar I have, especially with this pandemic going on.

I know the solution is leaving my mother's house, but again, I have nowhere else to go. I don't want to go back to living with my siblings and STILL have to associate with my mother to pay anything. I want to break contact completely. This situation fucking sucks.

I know this post is insanely long and I'm sorry for that. This was insanely difficult for me to type up, and I wanted to make sure I listed every detail that correlates with my current issue.

Thank you to anyone who responds and comments. I hope you all have a wonderful day and stay safe with the current madness going on in the world. :)",17Sep2020,1

I have no problem with cleaning stuff obviously but I just have never used bleach, and have actually attempted to always use.  Anyway his response is completely dismissive, that ""I'm making it up"", and won't even hear out my reasoning on this.

I just moved back from a big city after finishing my studies and working for 1 year because I thought the best option to save up some money would be working here for months or a year at most and then with that I can decide where to go freely and having money saved to decide for myself.

What does it mean if someone says it this early? Is it too early? For me, it takes a while and maybe it's harder for me because we are not physically in the same city and we can't be near each other. So I can't intimately know his personality, querks, pet peeves, etc...As for my feelings, I really really like him, there have been no red flags, or anything alarming that has caused me to doubt his integrity. He talks to my family on WhatsApp and I have talked and video chatted with his sister, multiple times, here in New Jersey and with his mother.

The only way the police will do anything is if the residents press charges which nobody want to because they understand her mental health is deteriorating, but at the same time they’re all scared to death to be in their homes because of how aggressive and unpredictable she is acting. I called her emergency contact and they informed me that every once and awhile she has episodes like this and there’s nothing that anyone can really do. He did tell me she doesn’t have a history with violence so that is a plus. I feel like I’m out of options and I thought maybe some stranger on the Internet May have an idea of how to help in this situation. 

Thank you for your time.",17Sep2020,1
838," Technically, she’s my supervisor but whatever. This is her first time supervising anything. Her instructions haven’t been clear to me or consistent in the entire time I’ve been in this job. I'm following *her* instructions to the letter.

I have a seasonal job working for the state fish and wildlife department that started in June and will end September 30th. Basically, what I do for this job is the following:

* · Interview fishermen according to a rate (ex; interview 1 out of every 4 boats).
* · I check their catches, scan salmon for coded wire tags, ask about releases, catch area, etc.
* · Count the number of boats that exit the port.

Some of this is done in teams but the majority of what I've done has been alone.

Twice now she’s come to me acting like *I’m* being obtuse and I don’t think she’s knows why I’m so confused all the time. 

The first time she came after me was for a bunch of things we’d previously discussed and said were good ideas. She was…really, very confrontational about it…and it caught me so off-guard I couldn’t focus on work for the rest of the day. 

She wasn’t making any sense to me. I couldn’t ask for her to be clearer because she started with “you’re over stressing, overthinking, and you need to focus on doing your job.” Like, I thought I was doing that? Phrasing stuff like that is entrapment; anything I wanted to say after that conversation would just be proving her point. This was like 5 weeks ago, I think, and I was in the middle of a shift when we had this “discussion”.

The second time she came to me, which was the 11th of this month btw, she was much calmer and easy to talk to. Like, she was smiling and laughing so it was a lot easier to listen to her. She didn't bring up the same points but the message was similar. She told me I wasn’t focusing on the boats enough and that I needed to be prioritizing them. I desperately didn’t want to argue with her, because yeah I’m not perfect, but all the points she brought up were things I didn’t necessarily have any control over. 

* Example 1: someone once dumped a ***whole-ass eagle carcass*** in front of me when I was operating the whole port alone (part of the late shift, everyone leaves 2.5hrs before you). There’s no protocol for that. When I texted my senior co-worker (also my roommate) she told me to focus on the carcass and call our supervisor. I did that. I *only did what I was instructed to do.* But I'm the only one getting in trouble for it.
* Example 2: I found a seagull with a hook through it's beak struggling in the water a few minutes before my shift (not a sampling day, just counting). I kept counting boats as I collected this idiot and removed the lure. We ask about birds in our interviews so I, stupidly, mentioned it to her. 
* Example 3: reporting illegal/suspicious activity (I still don't understand her point here. She told me to do this.)

Essentially, during this conversation, I was told to stop asking her for help. ""I can't fix everything,"" she said, as if I'd ever asked for anything other than advice. I can't ask my team for help because they have literally never helped me with anything.

I’d be more receptive to her criticisms if she were out here working with us. But no, she only comes out once a week for an **hour.** 

As far as I can tell, she hasn’t gone after anyone else. She’s even gone so far as to tell me not to do something the whole team has been doing together (method to the madness, taking turns on who interviews the next boat kind of thing) and then turned around and said *nothing* when someone else does it right in front of her face. I've shared some of the things she's said to me with people who have known her longer and they always seem surprised. 

If she is targeting me, *why?* I am 1 of 3 newbies this season and I'm also the last 1 remaining. 

It’s very important to me that I finish this job without any problems. I've been trying so damn hard. I've interviewed well over 400 people in 30 days. I drive 2 hours and 30 minutes one-way to get out here for this job and I don't get paid for that. I don't have any cell service and they won't let me have a walkie-talkie. She knows about all of this. No-one who matters actually *cares* about these details, though. If I use her as a reference and she says shit like she has, that could cost me a job. 

I feel like I’m being paranoid and I want to communicate with her but what kind of image of me does that give her? Do I just sit still and keep dealing with it? Why is this happening to me?

TL;DR: my supervisor is making unjustified judgement calls on my work that directly conflict with the instructions given to me by either a) a senior co-worker, or, b) herself, and I ***need*** to be able to trust her as a good reference for my future chances. Do I try to talk to her about it or will that just come back to bite me?",17Sep2020,1

846,"My partner finished his education as a medical resident a year ago and moved to a new city for his dream job. He has been working very hard to pay off debts and save up for a downpayment on a house so that we can begin a family. I am also a professional and work in a small company that is highly specialized/specific. I was head hunted straight from my graduation program, so this has been my only employer in my professional field. No jobs have come up in this exact area in the other city, so I’ve applied to about 10 positions that are tangentially related. Nobody has even called! I am so disheartened, I’ve never had difficulty landing interviews in my entire career. I feel like I’ve pigeonholed myself. I’m still in my original city at my job because it is still a great place. My partner wants me to join him, but has never advocated for me joining while unemployed. Our expectation was that I would move when I landed a job, but neither of us expected it to be so hard for me. I’m getting more and more despondent over my failure to land a job in the other city. 

If I did move to join him while unemployed, my plan would be to invest in extra accreditations, and possibly more graduate studies, to help diversify my skill set and be more broadly marketable.

847,"My younger brother is 10 and for the longest time has had a horrible diet. He only eats unhealthy snacks, and never eats proper meals or anything substantial. Every time we sit down for dinner we try to convince him to eat but he just insists that he doesn’t like the meal, even if it’s something we’ve never had before. He just won’t try it. He also regularly claims tummy aches which mostly happen whenever we’re eating dinner.
I’ve thought that maybe it’s psychological - perhaps some anxiety revolving around food? But I’m not sure. Nothing we try will make him eat. My parents have tried restricting his snacks, making new meals he’s never had before, and encouraging him every time we sit down to eat, but he is adamant in his disliking for most foods.
I’m concerned about his diet, and it having a negative effect on his health. I know it’s also causing stress for my parents, and I just really want my brother to be able to enjoy food.

Before I'll do all of this I try not to touch my animals unless it's an emergency (read: my cat running away).

 She says that I'm stupid for thinking I won't smell when I'm wearing a jacket because my pants are going to smell anyways. I corrected her and reminded her that I also cover my legs so she started talking about how my hair is smelly and again I reminded her that I also cover my hair. She says that I should give up because it's not doing anything and I'm stupid for believing it does.


I honestly have no idea if what she's saying is true or not. It may be her just smelling herself since she's also a smoker and doesn't cover herself at all but I also felt like I can smell this junk on myself but I brushed it off as paranoya.

A bit ago I had one of my posts blow up and put me on the front page, I got a ton of dms, mostly just people gushing about cute lizards.

But then there was this other dude, who just wanted a friend. We talked, we talked some more, and then I didn't talk for a couple days or so cause I was busy.

 During this time his life fell apart, his girl dumped him, his dog died, and he just got very depressed. This is when I learned that he has had some serious childhood trauma, and is now pretty messed up cause of it. Also his parents are a bunch of douches, so that helps. So I talked to him, calmed him down, gave him some suicide hotlines and such, and just have him a shoulder to cry on.

Now I think I'm in over my head. He messaged me everyday, if I don't respond he panicked and assumes I blocked him, he has a suicidal crisis about once a week, the whole shebang.

He'll go on my profile and respond to my posts and/or comments and say stuff like, ""Hey, (Real Name) why'd you stop talking to me?"" I accidentally mentioned my first name, (not last) to him.

858,"I’ve viewed a few posts on this topic before, but I still have many thoughts and questions regarding the fetishization of Asians. 
I want to be more educated and I would hate to be the type of person that has any elements of fetishization. 

I just don’t know where the line is as far as fetishizing goes. For the most part, it’s very obvious. When fetishizing you prefer Asians, hold them to a higher standard, sexualize and objectify them. I do none of that. 

I think about people who are attracted to Asians in general, regardless of their physical appearance individually, and obviously you think of fetishization. However, that isn’t how I operate. I find certain people attractive, whenever and however that happens, like any other person. I myself cannot find an entire race attractive. 

*Sometimes, I’m afraid that my love for asian culture is part of the reason why I admire the idea of befriending of even dating an asian person. I think to myself, is THAT fetishization?*

*Sometimes, I think about their appearance, considering different races obviously harbor different common physical appearances, and I admire those specific appearances. Is it harmless admiration, or fetishization? Maybe there is an unconscious reason why I think about them that way.*

I am willing to answer any questions anyone has. I truly just want input. I don’t ever want to fetishize a human being, and if certain thoughts can seem to lead more towards fetishization, I want to unlearn those nasty habits.

866,"Let me start by saying there is a huge age gap between us, he is in his late 40's and I'm in my early 20's. We do have the same parents (I've been asked multiple times).

He's always kept his children as secluded as possible (in a creepy way). He allowed them to go to public school but they also had to go to seminary. a couple years ago he made his oldest daughter home school for one year and threatened to make the rest switch as well. This year they switched them all... 

due to him considering it earlier I'm not sure if he's really doing it for their own good or to just be more in control of their lives. He makes it clear he doesn't approve of any non latter-day saints friends, so much so his oldest daughter (18) whom I'll call J Is getting married February and he's trying to push her only to have family simply because he doesn't approve.

I very much disagree with many things in the latter-day saints church. J is mentally out of the church yet her father forces her to go, and has threatened to kick her out if she doesn't and to not let her see her siblings also.

J has told us very messed up things their dad has done, he has broken down J's younger sister whom I'll call S while she was changing. S asked him to leave and he said he'd do what he wanted. They've both said he'd do creepy thing like pretend to accidentally walk in the bathroom while they were showering and continue to stare and creepily smile before leaving.

J has told me and my wife she has nightmares of her dad coming in the room and smothering her to death while she's sleeping. These scare her so much she keeps a weapon nearby.  J has also said that her dad was obsessed with the idea that his wife may have cheated her and s say they hurt him beating her after a bad argument one night. 

They say she denied it and claimed it was makeup sex. They said she had threatened to leave him if he didn't stop accusing her of cheating. (I believe it would make since he was obsessed because before he joined their religion he had a wife and things didn't work out. I wasn't born yet so I have no clue) 

I hadn't reported anything at that point because I didn't see anything first hand and I trust my nieces but I wanted to wait for more evidence so my case would be taken seriously.

J had suffered with depression and cutting she said her dad would say the awfulst things to her and it was he was a big part of why she was depressed. They did church approved therapy. According to J the therapist noticed that none of the kids wanted to speak up in front of their dad and when he talked they all got quite I don't remember everything else discussed. 

But the important part is according to J the therapist said the way they were treating there children was abusive and if they kept going the others may end up with issues like J. So they stoped seeing the therapist. J was put into a mental hospital for a short period of time. Up to this point and before therapy, J's dad told her she was faking it and she should quit acting out for attention. While she was in the hospital she said they helped her a lot they weren't accusing her of faking and they tried to help her through her problems.

Her mom came to visit her they were in the elevator, and she told her mom she thought she was gender fluid and her mother started screaming at her ""WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS"". 

I've heard all of these things and more I'm sure I don't remember through the years some of this may be scatter brained but that is just how it came back to me. Another older brother agrees that things have always seemed odd and how secluded everything is. He recalls asking our Mormon brother when they moved into their new house why J's room had no windows, and he replied ""teenage girls don't need windows"". 

My younger brother and my wife have also witnessed several off things, as well as everything J and S has told us. Despite all this my brother as always acted like he's more noble than the rest of us J says it's a facade. 

I've seen his mask slip twice. The first was a couple years ago he took a cat from a co-worker it was his adult daughters, she had to give him up because her boyfriend was very allergic. It seemed like the cat was very loved and definitely an inside cat (I was riding with him and he asked me to help get the stuff) she didn't want to give up the cat and she was almost crying the father handed me the cat toys the food and my brother carried the pet carrier we drove back to his house

We got the cat inside and he let it out (my brother has seven children) so the cat ran to hide to get used to it's new surroundings and new people his youngest child ran for it and cornered it she picked it up and the scared cat scratched her. My brother picked it up by the throat and held it in the air and told the cat ""THIS IS MY HOUSE, YOU LISTEN TO ME"". the cat scratched him and he threw it out the back door. From then on it was an outside cat.

The second was the other day, I rent a 1 bedroom trailer and we don't have a washer and dryer I was out of clothes and didn't have enough for a laundromat. I called my father and asked to come over to wash clothes, he said they were over their cutting firewood but he didn't mind. I asked how long they'd been there he said since 9AM. 

Some info about my father he is late 60's on disability and lives in a 3 bedroom trailer he has degenerative spine disease. He is not supposed to do any heavy lifting but he does anyway he's always doing a stupid project that he shouldn't, firewood being an exception. They had him, my eldest brother, my brothers father-in-law, and 4 if the kids out there cut far more wood than he needs. 

Two of three of my nephew's ages (16)(13) where operating a wood splitter 20ft away from any adults by them selves. I despise their other grandfather he is very rude and hateful. As an example when we arrived one of my nephew's came to say hi and before he had been over there 60 seconds the grand dad rudely yelled ""GET BACK OVER HERE"". between that and my wife's over the phone doctor appointment I chose not to help. Remembering one to many days of forced child labor, I did feel bad for my nephew's and my neice that was their though. I spoke to my dad for a few minutes (while he was fixing a chainsaw) and went in

Despite everything I've said about my brother I didn't think he spanked. Everytime he punished his kids it was by push ups. Something as small as chasing each other in the house or taking an extra minute to come down stairs he'd say give me 20 and they'd do it. I thought it was hard but I also though whatever it's exercise it won't hurt them.

The kids particularly my nephew's kept sneaking inside it was hot out they kept there cooler inside with water. They'd sneak in pretending to get water get a water and rest for a few minutes, until he'd sent another to go get them. then another would come in get a water send the other out and sit down for a minute this continued until 4:30 my neice came to get my nephews and was acting very upset by them I told her that they would just keep doing it there kids and me and my brother did the same thing.

She went and told her father what I said and he came back in the house into the kitchen. the way the trailer is set up is you can see through the kitchen into the utility room door which leads to the door outside. my chair faced the TV away from the kitchen my wife was sitting on the couch against the wall and could see waist up through the utility door. The island cut off her view.

When he walked in the kids knew they had to go back outside. So they start walking to the utility room door. As soon as they walked through the utility room door according to my wife he raised his arm to the roof and swung the belt full strength and hit each kid. While I didn't see it I heard the belt and the squeal from each kid.  I was spanked my whole childhood and my father didn't go light but from 20ft away it was the loudest I'd ever heard a belt. He told them to get back outside and to not come back in.

He proceeded to come yell at me for not being outside helping and I told him I was an adult and it's my choice. He went back outside I called one of my older brothers to calm down and vent and explained what happened. I asked him if I should call CPS he said to keep a record and note things in the future. But that when I had a case he would give a statement as to the things he'd saw.

I messaged J on Facebook and told her what happened to write down everything from before and I was making a case. She showed her mom. Her mother said ""who knows with them"". This upset me because I expected her to know not to tell her mother. But J did say she would check for bruises. When her dad got home she confronted him about hiring the kids with the belt and he said it was his right. This upset her so she told him our plan... 

My brother called my dad who called me he said that I shouldn't do it. That I would tear his family apart and that he could lose his job (he works as a prison guard). And that how he disciples his children should be up to him. I said not if he's abusing them, I explained some of the other things I'd heard through the years and my dad said J was just trying to stir things up just for dramas sake. 
And that if they got taken away they'd just be abused by other people. And that I would ruin my brothers life If I did this.

869,"Hi reddit, I generally have no where else to turn and I'm kinda at a loss. I moved recently due to Covid and a few days ago I ordered a package to my previous address without even realising (I know I'm a moron). I contacted Greek God the delivery company to pick the package up for me and return it (all automated). It was just sitting outside the front door so I thought at least if it's returned, I can get my money back and order again. However, I mentioned my blunder to a friend I still have in the area and she visited the house and picked up the package for me.

All good right? I'll just contact Greek God and cancel having the delivery driver pick up the package? Absolutely not. I have tried every channel to contact Greek God - phone, email, automated bot and I cannot get through to one of their agents! The automated system said to contact the company I ordered from. Well they've ignored me too!

It's been three consecutive days and this poor delivery driver keeps turning up at a house where 1) I don't live anymore 2) I'm not even sure anyone currently lives there to answer the door. I keep getting emails saying they've missed me but no way to contact them about the problem.

I'm just completely stumped, I need to speak to someone to get this sorted but Greek God seems to have cut any and all interaction with customers. I don't know how to fix this. Reddit help! I don't know what to do.

i had to come on and say something because the craziest shit happened and I'm still kind of trying to comprehend what the fuck i do and what the fuck happened. so today i was in English, which is 4th period and i was moved next to some girl. she is pretty quiet and doesn't talk much or answer in class. The class was going fine until i look over and for a split second i thought i saw something. i look back at her again and she had a razorblade to her wrist. she was cutting herself right fucking next to me in English class. and I'm not talking little scratches. she was full on bleeding and i fucking freaked out. my body just went into fight or flight mode and i had 40 degree vision, i was feeling dizzy and kind of wanted to throw up. i knew i had to stop it but i had no courage. she would do it at random  intervals. it wasn't consistently happening, so after a few more times i finally mustered up the courage to grab her arm while she was doing it and pulled it away and just quietly said ""stop"" because i didn't want to alert others about it(out of privacy/respect). she quickly pulled her arm back, but luckily she stopped for that class. i asked her to give me the razorblade but she said ""no its fine"" or something along the lines of that. i knew i couldn't take it form her so i left it for the rest of the class. i kind of just zoned out for the rest of that day and tried  process the shit that happened. after English i just had business and i hated business, so i decided this was a good time to go find my guidance teacher to talk to him about it and get some help on what to do. he wasn't in the guidance  base so i just fucked off up to business and got in trouble. my mum already scheduled me to talk to him tomorrow anyway, so im wondering what i should do about it. im definitely gonna tell him but i hope i can help more than just that.

Both of us were dealt with bad hands since we were young. I always felt like I could relate to her and she would toss it off. 

When I told her my feelings in front of her lover, she tossed it off, and the craziest thing was her lover wasn’t mad at me, he was upset with her. (2017) 

In 2020, on New Years, my friend S seemed so normal but later when I left, apparently they all got drunk and this dude slept with the two women in our group, and S agreed to it because she felt emotionally vulnerable although she wanted to go back to her ex, and had feelings for this lover of hers. 

That tore our group apart and we all stopped talking until recently. I reconnected with them and told her lover that she tore the group apart because of her insecurities. 

When I wanted to reconnect with her, because I haven’t had any friends to talk to or hang out with, she says she’s upset with me and cried over it and I told her my side of the story and how i felt like she’s not being a friend if she never genuinely showed interest and she blames her insecurities for that and she’s trying to change and seeing a therapist now. 

I don’t know what to do. I want to see her as a friend but I know I have these attachment issues and I’m going to try to hit on her.

He becomes maniac about things and can spend his whole day planning stuff that never get to an end. He doesn't work, he doesn't have ambitions and is impossible to talk to.

I pay for his treatment but I don't even know if he's taking it at all. He changes the directions as he wishes. We've offered him all the help he needs, to pay for therapy, to help him get on his feet while he finds a job that he loves, but nothing works.

He supposedly started therapy a couple of months ago but I honestly don't know if he's going. According to him, the doctor told him he's is not as bad as to need weekly therapy and told him to go every 2 weeks. I really find this hard to believe since he's become more and more maniac and we don't see any progress. He always finds a way to manipulate my parents and they, especially my mom, believe everything he says though she does try to make him come to his senses.

I really don't know what else to do.

894," 

Hello,

I apologize for the length, but I could use some advice and outside perspective.

For reference: I am a woman in my late 20's, my boyfriend is in his mid 30's.

TL;DR: New boyfriend agreed to be official, said yes when I asked if he would be my boyfriend, and hasn't been in contact for several days. Should I be worried he is ghosting me?

Background info: I have been dating this guy for several months now. He's very kind and thoughtful, and has spent significant amount of time with me, at least 1-2 days a week since we first met. He lives a couple of hours away, and has consistently made the trip up to see me, and he has never once cancelled plans. He has shown me, through his actions, gestures, and the way he talks to me/about me, and by making plans for the future (short term future things - camping next month, dinner next weekend kind of stuff), that he genuinely likes me and can see a future with me. He's even thoughtful about the small things; for example, the last night I spent with him at his home, he made sure to buy my favorite apples for me to snack on, since he remembered I said they were my favorite in passing before.

The last time I saw him, I finally had the courage to ask him to be my official boyfriend. I know that is corny. But as we were parting ways, I told him I wanted to ask something, I was very nervous and stumbling over my words (my brain basically shuts off when I put myself in very vulnerable, high emotion situations like that), but I hugged and kissed him and told him how much I like him, and asked if he wanted to be my boyfriend, immediately after I said something along the lines of ""I know I'm the most awkward person in the world"" or some dumb shit like that. He smiled and said ""sure, yes to both."" I then asked if he thought it would be funny if I had passed him a goofy note like we were kids again, he laughed and said yes. Naturally, I had one prepared I would hand to him if he responded positively. So I handed it to him, he laughed, we hugged and parted ways.

This was several days ago now, about 5 days, and I have heard nothing from him. It is normal for us not to communicate or text for a few days (usually 2-4 days) as we have gotten closer to one another. He mostly only texts to make plans, discuss or plans, or check in between get-togethers. This is absolutely fine with me, we are both busy and I do not expect him to want to be attached at the head.

I sent him a brief text yesterday morning, wishing him a good day at work. He has not responded and I have not heard from him otherwise.

I have been ""ghosted"" several times over the past few years, and I have been in a borderline abusive situation that I fortunately was able to get out of before anything further escalated. Because of this, I know that I have some insecurity and overthinking, I am actively working on this in therapy and I was honest with my boyfriend when we started dating that I'm pretty shy and it can take me time to open up to people. He has been nothing but kind and supportive of that.

My concern is, I know that our last encounter was awkward (tremendously so for me, but I have a bit of social anxiety), and he acknowledged that it was, but not in a harsh, off-putting kind of way. I at least thought that he thought it was cute and endearing, and my friends and therapist both agree with this, and assure me it wasn't as awkward as I feel it was. I fear that because of this I caught him off guard and scared him away, or perhaps that I completely misinterpreted the conversation. At this point, I cannot tell if I am obsessing and making myself believe I blew it with him, or that I will never hear from him again because of my insecurities, or if everything is fine and he's happy and will reach out when he's free to make plans again. He has given me no reason to not trust him or to believe that he would ghost me. I can't think of a single red flag or concern in any of our interactions or dates; however, I can't help but wonder because I have experience being ghosted.

I work remotely, and he has even spent time just hanging out watching me work for a few hours on more than one occasion, because our days off don't usually align. He did just get a new job 2 weeks ago, so I completely understand being less available because of this and I am supportive of his job and career. I would never ask him to sacrifice that for me, and I suspect that he feels the same.

My question is, am I being insecure and overthinking? Or should I prepare to never hear from him again? I believe that I am stressing over this because of how vulnerable I was in our last encounter, and how much this means to me. I can't help but think he would not spend several months dating me, making the effort to see me regularly, and even spend time with me doing the mundane stuff like working or running errands if he did not like me enough to be his girlfriend. It's not like I'm convenient for him to just get sex and bail, but what do I know. Also, I have not reached out demanding a response or expressing hurt and anxiety or anything like that at all. I've only reached out to wish him a good day since I last saw him in person.

Any insight is appreciated. Sorry for the the length and the digression.",17Sep2020,1
895,"Hi Reddit, I'll be brief as possible:

My family (me, my two brothers and my parents) rent  currently and have for 6 years, going on 7. For those 6 years and a few months, our house was managed by a renting company I'll name ST. I found out a while ago from my parents that our house was given from ST to a new company. 

We live on a poorer side of town where our rent with ST was about 700$. But since our house was handed over, our rent went up 50$. We cannot afford to pay 750$ as the main money maker in the family, my dad, only works one job and from what I can tell, doesn't make that much. (We are considered lower-middle class.) 

My mom has to watch my brothers and I especially since we're all at home now for school due to the pandemic. And my baby brother (he's 11) has an extreme case of ADHD and school is very challenging for him, making my mom have to be a watchdog for him every day. So she can't have a job either. 

I tried finding one myself (I'm a 16F) but since corona decided to sit it's fat little self down at the oven endlessly waiting for the 2020 pizza to burn, I can't really do much. 

My dad is, needless to say, pissed off at the company. I don't know what the stance is on negotiations but as far as it goes, they aren't budging on the 750 first thing every month. He's so pissed off at them that he wants us to move. And we can't do that for several reasons: 

• Me and my brothers are only in our third week of school
• The housing market is abysmal currently
• Its hard to find renters who are willing to not just take us but my cat Sunshine in as well. 
And probably many more reasons. 

I'm stressed out, my mom breaks out crying a lot, and my dad's pissed. I just want help with how to deal with this.",17Sep2020,1

I have anxiety so obviously this meant that whatever I had planned for the day would be off the table whenever this happened.

So I rushed an academic a coed business right the first time last semester but I didn’t get in. I figured it was because my resume was trash.

so I rushed the second time this semester and I got a second week invite. So I’m basically a potential candidate at this point. I’m really excited but also really nervous because tonight I have my interview which will basically determine whether I get in or not. There’s also a lot of competition bc there r 30 rushes including me and im afraid theyre gonna knock me out of the competition. 

this is literally the only frat I want to be in. do u think the fact that i rushed a second time will get me in? i’ve heard some of the brothers say that they didn’t get in their first time but rushing their second time definitely helped them get in so im hoping I’ll have that to back me up.

However, I don't know how my mom (47F) would react. We've had some issues with communication in the past. Wasn't fun to deal with. I wouldn't do it again. It was some things involving my future plans. Eventually, that got ""solved"" in the best way it can. During lockdown, my mental health took a dive. It was not good. Luckily, it got ""better"". But during that time I thought it would help me to get a therapist. So I began looking into ones in my area who take my insurance and fit other things. 

But, I don't know how my mom would react to the idea of me getting therapy. When she found out I hurt myself, her reaction essentially was ""Stop hurting yourself"" and nothing else really. That was the end of it. Her idea of ""therapy"" is more like ""talk to me. I'm your mom. Why would you need therapy?"" Which, I do love my mom. And I do talk to her about certain things. 

But what is she gonna do when I tell her about my constant panic attacks? Fear of abandonment? Etc etc. 

I have my insurance card. I've considered just booking an appointment online and doing it all online. But I know her reaction if she found out about me doing it in secret would just make everything worse.

910,"My dad instructed by preteen/early teen aged brothers to “call 911” over a minor sibling brawl that he didn’t even witness

I am a 15 year old girl. Recently, with school beginning again I have been under a lot of stress. My classes are compressed into a smaller schedule and the course load is 3x as much, making my day very busy as I’m taking advanced chemistry and physics. I have had to switch to a new schedule where I only get 5 hours of sleep at most and I have to wake up early to get ready, commute to school, wait outside in the hot sun for 20 minutes, have a 4 hour class, another 75 minute class and the work associated with both before I get a break. I am not used to this as I have never been a senior student (I am NOT a senior right now). Naturally, this has exhausted me and I collapsed without finishing my work today around 4pm because I couldn’t take the tiredness and my brain wasn’t functioning properly. 

My brother, who is turning 13, is addicted to video games. He plays them while I’m working, and my work area is in the family room with his gaming console, along with the door to my bedroom which is against the wall of that room. I can’t change this arrangement. He constantly disturbs me during my online classes and I am patient with it because I don’t want to cause problems, although it is distracting and quite debilitating at times when I’m really trying to focus. Less than an hour into my nap he came down and opened his console, started swearing and screaming at the game, and woke me up abruptly. I was so tired that I tried going back to sleep only for a scream to jolt me awake every few seconds. Eventually the damage was done and I got up out of bed, when I saw him, I just lost my temper. I was disheveled, disoriented and tired and I began raising my voice, telling him to turn off the PlayStation and please allow me to sleep because I was constantly working and I needed it. To which he didn’t even remove his eyes off the screen and started swearing at me, telling me that I “got enough”. I got too close for comfort (didn’t touch him) and he started to get angry when he lost his game, screaming as well while raising his arms up at me. When he did that, I couldn’t handle it, i felt completely justified at the time in this argument as he is constantly playing and I rarely ask him to stop (if I do and he won’t I just shrug it off) I grabbed his arms and forcefully pulled them down, just desperately wanting not to be challenged by someone who was so clearly in the wrong. He started yelling and crying saying that I was “violent” and my dad came down, immediately took his side of things and then adding salt to the burn, telling him along w my 9 yr old brother who had joined the show to “call the police and get a physical assault on her (my) record”. What? Is that fair or warranted? I understand that violence isn’t the answer but I really didn’t hurt him (still shouldn’t have done that) and it was just a time of anger. Not to mention that he seemed like he was about to put his hands on me first. I am constantly trying to help my younger siblings and I singlehandedly taught my toddler sister how to read, write, and play the piano before kindergarten. I really don’t try to start problems and I actively try to fix them. Now my brothers are sitting outside my room taunting me with the call. I don’t think you should say something this sensitive to a 9 year old as they take it pretty seriously and he seems pretty excited to “call”. They keep calling me names and saying that they’re gonna play whether I like it or not and I am a crazy bitch.

I feel horrified. I’m just trying to live a decent life and become financially stabler than I am now within this family. If my brothers take this seriously and call the police over something that seems like a fairly normal sibling situation, that would ruin my life. I have been sitting in my room crying for the past hour because I feel horrible and I am scared of leaving my room. I don’t want to look at my family right now.

In case anyone wants to know, I am skinny, female and have a small build with an underweight BMI, I am not significantly stronger than my brother who is only a few years younger.

914,"Today, my mom and sister has a huge fight. Now, fights, even big fights that last a few hours aren't rare to see with my family but, this was just another level. My sister, twin brother and I were heading out to the library, and while we were getting ready, my mom kept saying how she couldn't find these furniture pads. They were in the garage but, my mom just couldn't find them. The garage had recently been thoroughly cleaned and organized by my sister, so my mom blamed her and said ""you made my life so much harder by cleaning the garage"" (My mom had been telling us to clean the garage for a long time now). My sister said, ""I just wanted to help you, it took me weeks to clean, and now you're blaming me?"". And it escalated and escalated so quickly and my mom kept hitting her (in front of me), and saying ""What did I do to deserve you?"". She kept saying she's the victim, that my sister is out to get her. My sister insisted that she just wants peace and a good relationship. This ""routine"" had been going on for about the past 3-4 years, and it didn't really effect me. Of course I was sad, but I was just so used to it. But then my mom started getting more and more violent, and I tried to stop her, but she wouldn't let go of my sister. My sister went upstairs to get away from my mother, but she just followed her. My sister started yelling saying I don't wanna be treated like trash please, why won't you just listen to me. My mom and dad have always treated her less than my brothers and I. To them, girls are not equal to men. My dad is much better than my mom but he's still makes some pretty bad mistakes. But he's no where near the level as my mom. She is treated like a little child, basically. Anyways, the fight escalated to the point where my sister kept yelling repeatedly, ""I CAN'T  TAKE IT ANYMORE!"", while banging her head on the door, making a dent. All this while my mother grabbed her phone and recorded the situation to use against my sister. She kept hitting my sister and insulting her. My sister said, ""Next time you find me, I'll be dead!"" She sounded so serious and I got so scared. I had always been afraid of this, and I broke down in tears. I kept begging my mom to help my sister, please, please help her. I don't want a dead sister, please! But my mom kept pushing me to go in the car and ignored what my sister just said. I eventually went to the car, still bawling, and my mom said, ""Shush! The neighbors will hear you!"" When we went to the car, my mom asked me, why would you want me to help her when she acts like that? I knew if I said anything to defend my sister, my mom will be mad at me. So, I said nothing. I told her I didn't want to talk, and we went to the house. I was terrified my sister meant what she said, it was my worst nightmare. I knocked on her door and thank god she was ""ok"". I was so relieved. My mom has always insulted us. My voice, hair, body, etc. She curses us, and her view is that children wrong, parents right. I had always hoped that my mom might suddenly realize what she's doing, and become a better parent but, that hope is almost gone. After today, I don't think our family will be happy anytime soon. I don't think I will be happy anytime soon. I can't take this anymore. I can't. I see other happy families all around me and I am jealous. I wish I could have a mom who supported and helped me with my problems. I wish my family could get along. I wish we could have a civil discussion. But no. It's always drama, yelling, not talking for a month, ""making up"", then all over again. I HATE IT! I want to run away, get a new family, and forget this horrible life I've been living these past 5+ years. But I know the police will just take me back here, so why even try? And even if I report my parents to some abuse organization, I know my big brother will hate me (he's always been loyal to my parents, as he has never been treated badly since he's the oldest and a boy) , and all my extended family will, too. My mom has made me cry and feel horrible multiple times, along with calling us ""trash from her stomach"". I don't know what to do. I hate living here. The thought of staying home 24/7 for the next 5 months (online school until January) is truly horrible to me. And then still living with this until college, I don't know if I can take it. My mom REFUSES to make amended and listen to my sister's pleas to sit down and fix their relationship.

918,"There was a situation at work where I apologized. The person who I apologized to (let's call her Susan which is not her real name) told me that they weren't particularly hurt by my actions. I thanked her and was glad things were okay. I acted impulsively and sent her two messages one saying that I really valued having a professional relationship and if she ever felt uncomfortable or upset at me she can let me know at anytime. These were within a day of this conversation. 

I felt guilty because of the situation and I left information out. Even though she wasn't particularly hurt, I feel I still did something wrong. I sent an email about 15 days later mentioning that I don't want her to respond, but I wanted to explain these few details about what happened and that I was sorry again. I guess I was feeling so guilty that I needed to let it out. She sent me a message asking me to stop sending her messages and stop. I'm gonna completely respect this and not message her at all. I really didn't want to harrass her and I wanted to respect her boundaries, but I can definitely see how that came off that way.

I blew it. How do I forgive myself for completely making a situation 10x worse? I just was filled with so much guilt and I acted impulsively. I really didn't mean anything negative by it and I don't really know why I did so. I just felt I wasn't giving her the full truth and she deserved to know.

924,"So my sister (F26), who is also my best friend, is gay. i've always known and something like 4 years ago, my mom and other sisters found out. At this point, everyone on my mom's side of the family knows. Everyone except my dad. 

For some context, we live in a south american country that is VERY homophobic. That said, my family isn't really like that. My cousins don't even consider it something to talk about, they are very open minded in comparison to the rest of our community, as are our sisters. My mom and her siblings are from another generation and even though i don't think they understand, they are still completely accepting, they all love her and don't treat her in any way differently, as they should. My mom does her best to understand and learn, she constantly worries about her out in the world because people here can be cruel. My dad is pretty much exactly the same, this would make no difference whatsoever to him.

I explain all this so that you can understand her better.  Years have gone bye and she has never even attempted to talk to him. She has admitted multiple times to me that she hasn't done it, not out of fear of rejection or anything like that, but out of awkwardness.  She has a really hard time communicating and talking about subjects like this. She is like this with multiple topics, not only this one. She hates stepping out of her confront zone. I have offered to help multiple times, but she completely shuts down when i do and gets irritated easily. 

The reason this is becoming a bigger issue than it should is because it's become a burden on my mom. My mom and my dad  are very close, they never hide anything from each other and always talk about everything together first. I have been watching as this becomes a weight in her mind. She feels incredibly guilty hiding this, and knows my dad will feel betrayed. She is scared he won't forgive her and i completely understand because i know that he will have a hard time, not with her sexuality but with the lies. He hates lying, and always have. Every mistake would be immediately forgiven when we were younger if we came up to him with the truth, but if we lied about it and he found out he would always be disappointed and said that the punishment was for the lie not for the act.  

But my mom is determined to put her daughter first, and knows she should wait for her daughter to do it herself. She has offered to help her but as always my sister isn't even willing to talk to her about it, she completely shuts her out for no reason at all when my mom only wants to show her understanding and compassion. 

i'm not sure how to help really. I'm scared my dad will find out from someone else, which would really hurt him. I don't know if she realizes how much she is hurting their relationship or how betrayed he is going to feel. In reality I think she knows but she cares about not feeling awkward than their feelings. 

If she in any way was scared to tell him, i would never pressure her. it's a process for everyone and she should take her time, but she has told me multiple times that she knows perfectly well that he will love her no matter what and would never treat her differently. She has even said that it's not out of fear but out of awkwardness and that she simply doesn't care to do it.",17Sep2020,1
925,"The situation: Surgery scheduled for Oct 16, so coming up. All four getting pulled/removed. Never been sedated.

So had my consolation today. Doctor said I could be sedated by IV, or I could remain awake. My hesitation comes from an experience four/five years ago when I got some blood drawn. I was 14 then, but I remember hiding in the corner and bawling my eyes out. I was really light headed and needed an ice pack because I was that worked up. I honestly think that was the worst day of my life because of how stressed I was. Shots are fine, but when I see IVs, I think of lethal injection and all other bad kinds of drugs. 

Back to today when the nurse was going through the option of IV, I started to get really light-headed and got so nauseous that felt I might have needed to push her down to get to the trash can behind her. I was fine until then, but my mind just lost its shit even simply talking about it. I wanted to run out of the room and get outside and throw up. It took me a minute and a few depth breaths to get back to normal. Most of the time when I get my physical, my heart rate is up and I get anxious, but never nausea and feeling light-headed. Today was different, and nothing even happened. 

Now the alternative would to remain awake. Doc said he'll have to use 10 shots to numb my mouth. Then he said I would be able to hear all the sounds associated with teeth removal. 

I'm thinking I'd rather go awake to avoid the mental stress. With IV's I fear losing control over my body and my consciousness state and being vulnerable. I also feel I could have a chance taking the physical pains a lot better than the mental stress, which I feel I have no control. I'm thinking if I understand how the teeth will be removed, the sounds won't be too bad because I know what's going on. Doc said the IV would be a lot quicker and easier. He's probably right, but I just can't get over that feeling. Although getting 10 shots in the mouth isn't much better of an option. 

What are some of your experiences? Am I being stupid, will I just be putting myself through worse by staying awake? I felt horrible today though... so your thoughts would be great. Thank you!",17Sep2020,1

932,"First time making a post like this, right now Im 20 spend most of my time on gaming (which I hate I want to quit but I have nothing else to do) and internet. 

The last time I had friends who would invite me out and actually talk to me and stuff was somewhere around 5 or 6 years ago. In high school I would just walk around by myself, I had a few people who I would talk to but none that I would interact with outside of school with. 

I attempted suicide once towards the end of high school and ended up in a psych ward for a few weeks. Once high school ended my parents didnt push me to start studying or get a job right away because of that. I didnt talk to anyone but them for about a year and just spent all my time on games, internet ect. 

But then I met someone who was in a similar position as I was, she became my girlfriend and we spent 2 years together, during that time I was friends with many of her friends and it was great to have people to talk to and I was always motivated. But after we broke up I remembered those people only spoke to me because I was dating their friend.  


Now I go days without even talking to people (let alone have a conversation where I can open up about my emotions) and when I do its just my mum telling me whats for dinner or something. I dont have a job and have no experience. I did really badly in school and it would be hard for me to get into uni.

I just have this overwhelming feeling that my life is too far gone, people will probably say ""youre just 20 itll sort itself out"" and stuff but I feel like people have been telling me that for years and years.",17Sep2020,1
