UPDATE POST: Overthinking and low confidence can be a deadly combination...

Attached below is the link to my previous post

https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ifeksw/overthinking\_and\_low\_confidence\_can\_be\_a\_deadly/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3

I felt it would be quite respectful to give an update on the position I am in as across the multiple subreddits I received in my eyes an astonishing amount of replies and key advice for my position. It’s been 3 weeks since the post and I’ll openly admit I sat slobbering around doing fuck all for a week and feeling sorry for myself before deciding to actually do something.

The first and most important piece of advice I received was ‘being happy with myself’.

I generally don’t think I was happy with myself at all and I was just hiding it completely under a big cover. To the extent where around my friends I was falsely acting happy in person, over message and gaming etc., but the second I wasn’t with them I felt a major extent of loneliness. 

To conquer this problem, I’ve decided to fulfil it with challenges that will benefit my future and keep me occupied in the near time….

I had a pretty solid gym regime before the COVID-19 outbreak and with this being taken away from me it’s kind of isolated most of my days which I had no control of due it being shut. I’ve managed to gradually get back to a fit state through the past couple of weeks, while the inclusion of dieting has helped massively with boosting my confidence and my overall appearance.

I’ve decided to pay for a course which will benefit my future through the similarity and association to my MSc course I will be starting in the next couple of weeks. This course was one I was looking at for the last couple of months and held of, so I decided ‘Fuck it I’ll do it’, spent a week doing it in my spare time and it was honestly amazing. While I also managed to get the grade, I wanted which was fantastic. (P.S It was a quite pricey course, that’s why I shit out of buying it multiple times)

Driving lessons… When I was 18, I got gifted a driving lessons and I shit myself on the day after completing one, the fear just ate me up and I’ve been postponing them for a while now. So, I’ve decided to get it over and done with now and I’m current 3 lessons in and honestly it’s not as bad as I thought. This has held me back quite a bit as obviously I’ve been getting a lot of lifts from friends and family etc, so I’m happy that will be in a position soon to be driving myself.

All of this with the inclusion of just little actions such as new hair style, going out with friends a lot more and looking forward to getting back learning in university have helped my confidence massively.

Finally, the main problem I had was with females as shown from the previous post…

I decided it would be for the best if I was too leave it a little longer before I actually feel comfortable to make an approach. I could comfortably say now I’d be able to message a girl however, I just want to be 99.9% ready. I have made a step in following the girl on ‘Instagram’ while she followed me back also, but I’m just going to leave it at that now.

I do understand the risk of me just not making a move as some people don’t wait around, but I think focusing on myself massively should be put first at the moment.

I can now say it’s only been two weeks since my first steps and am 10x happier than I was the night of constructing the original piece as I can remember being in a horrible place at the time… While now am sat chilling out listening to The Weeknd.

(P.S I’ll be massively amazed if anyone reads this post because to me it just looks like a lot of waffle, but from the bottom of my heart thank you.)",15Sep2020,1

So... Tittle basicly says all. 

I want to improve my small talks, learn it actually.
So far, what I forced myself to is being more talkative at shops. Small step but I had to start somewhere and somehow and I feel fine after this. 
I know that in order to improve I just need to start talking to people more but... How to?",15Sep2020,1

4,"My brother and his fiancé were meant to be getting married this month, but of course COVID interfered so the wedding has been moved to September 2021. My husband and I are both part of the bridal party.

Issue is we were planning on trying for a baby after the wedding if it went ahead this month. Now that the wedding has delayed, this has caused a little bit of stress with our baby planning.

We don’t want to cause any problems, or make it seem like we are taking the attention away from their big day by either having a baby or being pregnant at the wedding in 2021. But we also don’t want to put our life on hold. They have both joked that they don’t want anyone in the bridal party to get pregnant in the next year (my dress has been fitted) but we just laughed it off. We obviously haven’t told them what our plans are!",15Sep2020,1

I’ve hung out with my boyfriend in his dorm with his friends, but I don’t just want to rely on him for that kind of connection because then I’m just the girlfriends that hangs out with his friends.

7,"I recently lost someone very dear to me. We were never officially romantically involved but we would have been eventually if he had lived. I have no doubts in my mind that he was my soulmate. It just wasn’t the right time for us yet.

Everything hurts. There’s a pit in my stomach, a knot in my throat, a stinging in my eyes and sharp pain all in my chest. I can’t do anything without being reminded of him. I stand up, I envision him standing too. I eat something, I can see him biting into a sandwich as well. Every single second of every single day I see glimpses of him and it hurts so, so bad.

Sometimes I’ll be talking and yet I hear nothing but the drawl of his voice coming out of my mouth. I’ve started speaking slower now, to savor the moments when I can hear his voice again.

The music he used to listen to plays in the back of my head like elevator music. I feel like an empty shell of him, all his memories just echoing around me and I can’t do anything except bear the full extent of them. I feel homesick even though I’m in my own house.

I’ve dealt with loss before, but nothing has ever affected me as much as his. I suppose it’s because he passed before I even got to truly know him. I’ve learned so much more about him since he passed, I learned his star sign, and his Myers Briggs personality type, I feel closer to him than ever, even though he’s farther away than ever. 

The only thing I look forward to now is sleeping. Every single night I pray that I have a dream about him, just so I can talk to him once more. 

Apparently he knew that his end was coming, I think deep down I knew too, but it was still a shock to me that it happened so quickly. I constantly imagine what his last thoughts were in his last moments. I feel melancholy and nostalgic and so so empty. I don’t even think my written explanation could do my emotions justice, I wouldn’t even wish for any of you to understand or empathize with how I feel right now. It’s too much and I never want anyone to experience this misery.

How do I make the pain dull as soon as possible?",15Sep2020,1
8,"If this is not the place to post this please tell me where I can. I just want to get this off my chest.

This year started okish. I got a new truck. My Lyme started to get manageable (I had to drop out of college).  And then everything went to shit in February. Funnily enough Covid has hardly been apart of it.

In February Dad and I drove to Pennsylvania to visit one of his brothers (he's diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer). The trip started out great. Dad and I never got a lot of time to just hangout. So it was awesome to finally have a week with just him (Despite the reasons for the trip). Halfway there Dad started complaining of weakness in his arm and muscle spasms in his back. We just figured it was the shitty hotel beds. My neck and back wasn't feeling great either. We made it to Pennsylvania and had a great time with my uncle. It was nice to see my dad and his brother reminiscing and catching up.  

The week is done and we pack up and head home. This time I had to drive the entire way home. (16hr drive straight through) Dad's legs were starting to get really weak. We got home and a few week later things went from 0-100 in an Instant.

I think it was mid March. And I get woken up at 2 in the morning from someone screaming bloody murder upstairs. I run upstairs and Dad is writhing in bed. His back spasms were getting worse. I rush him to the ER and this is just before Covid. He gets admitted and they do a CAT scan and an MRI. the results come back and the doc says he has a Hematoma and prescribes him some pain meds. So we go home. Flashforward maybe 2 weeks later we are back in the ER for the same reason. Dad gets another CAT and MRI. And results come back the same. More pain meds. This happens maybe 3 or 4 more times. Obviously something else is wrong.

Mid-April we go back to the ER for more or less the same reasons. Except this time the MRI comes back and the results are a Hematoma and an inflamed Sciatica. 

Finally Mom and I convinced dad to see an oncologist. And whaddya know. The fucking hospital misdiagnosed him more than half a DOZEN times. He has cancer. Don't ask what kind because frankly by the time it was found it had taken over his body and was impossible to pinpoint where it originated. When I say take over I mean he was basically Deadpool without any of the cool bits. It was in his head, lungs, lymph nodes, spine, hip, stomach etc. They started him on radiation immediately.

The next week. My brother was harassing my mom and I blew up and chewed him out. He got pissed, went to his room grabbed his rifle loaded it and pointed it at my head and told me to get out or he'd shoot me. So I left. (A week or two earlier he told my father he wished he'd die)

2 weeks later Dad was attempting to use the bathroom and he fell and broke his arm. I meet him in the ER and the doc says they have to admit him to assess if he is able to come home or if he needs to go to a nursing home. And if he need to go to a nursing home they will provide transport. 

Well they didn't. They had my mother come pick him up. And when they get to the NH there's no-one outside waiting for him as the hospital said there would. Mom goes looking for a nurse. Finds one. And the nurse goes in to grab a wheel chair. Mom goes back to the car and Dad says he needs to go to the bathroom and can't wait. And asks mom to help him over to a bush. As he steps out he twists his leg and shatters his hip. 5 min later the nurse comes out just as the Ambulance gets there.

Back in the ER dad goes into surgery. Surgery goes surprisingly well. And is expected to make a full recovery.

Later that night 1a.m May 22nd I get a call from the hospital saying they just got my father's pulse back. And he had been without oxygen for 30+min. Says he won't make it through the night. I hop in my car and race to the hospital. Get to ICU and he's hooked up to all sorts of machines. I wait for my mom to show up. Mom and I decide to pull the plug. He wasn't really alive anymore. Just a husk. 20 min later he was gone. Never got to say goodbye.

Exactly one week later 2 of our dogs were put down. Both were very sick but were only holding on for my father's sake.

TL;DR My Dad got misdiagnosed with a Hematoma (it was actually cancer), brother threatened to kill me. I left home. And in less than 3 weeks my family was torn apart in almost every conceivable way and I could've done many things to prevent it.",15Sep2020,1
9,"I’m a 20 year old freshman in college. I took a gap year (2, really), so I’m a bit older than my classmates, but I look young and it isn’t really noticeable (or, at least, it doesn’t seem to be). My boyfriend is also a freshman. He graduated early, and is 16 years old, 17 in a month.

We’ve been dating for a few weeks. Although it’s been \*very\* short term, he‘s just amazing and I love to be around him. Neither of us ever would’ve thought there‘d be an age issue. He thought I was probably 18, and didn’t consider I might be a gap year. He looks younger, but so do lots of the kids here and I never considered he might be under 18.

It came up the other day when he mentioned he wants to have sex. Because of Romeo and Juliet laws, it’s fully legal here. And I wanted too, also. I find him very physically and emotionally attractive. But, knowing his age, I can’t help but feel, I don’t know, wrong I guess?

Is it okay go go ahead with this? Is it ok to keep dating? If neither of us had ever said anything, it would never have been noticeable. And I really don’t want to stop what we have going. What do I do?",15Sep2020,1
10,"Questioned my sexuality not because I wanted to do gay sexual things but the fact that one of my friends came out gay, never would've guessed. So I thought what if I am gay and so I started going down a rabbit hole about what if I am gay. I can admit guys are good looking but never think sexually about them. Still am attracted to girls. Recently though I guess the thought of if I am gay is in the back of my mind and when I see a good looking dude I don't really care but then I remember I was doubting my self, then the gay thoughts come. Like it is as if I am over analyzing it. I watched gay porn to see if I could get a boner and it honestly was disgusting but I felt my heart sink when I watched it. I don't know what I feel any more and am just confused. I can never see myself having sexual intercourse with the same gender. What do I do? I don't want to be gay for the record and I never have questioned my sexuality EVER till the thought came across my mind, now it is all I can think about. I get turned on by girls having sex period. If I watched gay porn my dick was just go soft but I feel weird in my chest if that makes sense. I only checked it out like 1 or 2 times but there was some good looking dudes in one video but like I wasn't aroused just couldn't stop staring lol. The weird feeling I had was like I was devastated or something not aroused if that makes sense. Like the 1 or 2 times I watched it for the short time, I felt disgusted looking at it, both at them and myself I felt weird though, not aroused. I can't explain what I felt partially because I didn't know what it was I felt. Nothing against LGBQT btw. What do I do? Am I overthinking? Am I gay???",15Sep2020,1

15,"I live in a smaller rural town but in the middle of the downtown area. The street parking in front of my apartment is limited so I often have to park around the corner in front of some other apartments. I parked on that road after coming back from some grocery shopping tonight and a lady comes out of her building and says ,”Hey Hun can I ask you something?” (Imagine condescending southern tone here)

I said yes and she said “You live on the street over there you should park over there instead of in MY spot”

If she had asked me nicely to refrain from parking in front of her building it might have been a little different but this lady was being an absolute bitch. Sometimes that is the only place that I can park. Usually she’s already parked there and I just park in front or behind her so I’m already confused.

I said, “Well it’s open parking so if that’s the only place left to park I’m allowed to park there sorry.”

Rude lady then said,”Okay well park there again and see what happens to your car.”

I then said,”Okay go ahead and do something and have fun when I call the police.”

I unfortunately am in a pretty dire financial situation right now so I can not afford to put money out for a dash cam of some sorts in case she makes real on her threat. 

Can I call the non emergency line and file some sort of preemptive report just to have it on record? What would you do in this situation other than park your car 5 miles away and have to walk? I honestly could care less if my car gets keyed or some crap but this lady seemed a little nuts so I’m concerned.",15Sep2020,1

(With my financial position I currently rent a property from my family just so u get an idea how involved they are in my life). My partner constantly threatens to ‘expose me’. He has even driven to their home phoned me and threatened to hurt them/ my siblings / burn down my house etc. 

I feel stuck. One part of me doesn’t want it to end cause I love this man and know if it does he’ll ‘expose ‘ me. One part wants rid of him and knows I can’t. Trust me. He has said over and over how my life will be ruined and I will cease to exist if we’re done. 

The smallest thing I do to upset him whether my tone, my reaction, how I’ve responded, how I text drives this reaction further and more intense. 

I’ve accepted my life is going to continue to be this until I’m dead.  But I am desperate for any advice about how to cope with this while I am here. Aka should I attend counselling? I’ve no friends or anyone , should I try make a friend ? So at least I feel normal for a bit etc.

20,"Throwaway account. 

My (19f) bday is 9/28. My older brother Lenny's (25m) bday is 9/26, two days before. My boyfriend Sammy's (20m) little brother Axel's (13m) bday is 9/28, so the same day as mine.

So here's the tea-

Sammy and I got together right after my bday last year, so this is my first bday where we're together. I'm used to sharing my bday with my older bro Lenny, but Sammy's little bro Axel isn't obviously. So to avoid drama, I told Sammy in very early in advance that he could spend the 28th (Monday) all day with Axel, and we could plan a date for the 27th (Sunday). I like to plan things early, so we decided on this like 3 months ago.

So about 2 months ago, Sammy and I get some free tickets in our names to this event for the 27th. At the beginning of this month, my parents tell me that they and my grandparents are making the 7 hour drive up to see me and Lenny.  Lenny lives close by just like an hour North of me. They are coming up on Thursday and staying until Sunday afternoon. They are gonna take Lenny, his wife and kids, and I out for a joint bday dinner Saturday evening, and ofc also invited my boyfriend. So we make plans that I'm gonna stay with them near Lenny's house Thursday-Sat. Sammy is gonna drive up Sat evening (the 26th) to join my family for Lenny and my's bday dinner. It will be the first time my bf meets my grandparents. And I'll ride back with him, so the next day we can do our Sunday date.

The problem is, Sammy and Axel's mom is mad that I am stealing Sammy ""all weekend"" according to her. Sammy is literally just going to leave around 5pm on Saturday for the Lenny and I's dinner, and Sammy will be back 4pm on Sunday after our date. So basically I get Sammy Saturday evening and Sunday morning and afternoon, and Axel gets Sammy Saturday morning and afternoon and Sunday evening, plus all day his actual bday on Monday. But their parents work during the week, so they want a whole day during the weekend to spend as family time for Axel's bday with Sammy there. 

They are starting to guilt trip me. Even Sammy said it would be nice to have a full day with Axel, but he wants to be fair to both of us (and I honestly just think that his mom is getting to him). He gets Axel all day on the actual bday Monday! And we are splitting the weekend evenly, plus he gets Friday. Plus his mom works from home and his dad gets home at 4 if not sooner every day, so they will still have plenty of time for the whole family to celebrate even just on Monday. I'm really excited about our Sunday date which can't be moved, and I definitly don't want Sammy to miss my family dinner on Sat, since we ALWAYS spend time with his family and never mine. And I know Axel doesn't mind if I steal Sammy half the weekend. His mom and I just never really get along, and I feel like she is trying to pick a fight.

WIBTA if Sammy and I stuck to our original plan? Or should I cancel our special Sunday date so his fam can have a full weekend day to themselves to celebrate Axel. My roommate thinks Sammy should come to bday dinner and Sunday date, because I'm being more than enough generous giving Axel equal weekend + the actual day Monday. Plus they can spend some one-on-one time with Axel. And I agree with my roomate, but I just don't want to be an AH by putting myself above the kid on his 14th bday weekend. What should I do?",15Sep2020,1
21,"Alright, I don’t know how to start this off. 2020 is not my year. Seems like it isn’t anyone’s year. Worst year to try and get your life together.

I bought myself my dream (project) Jeep and another beautiful Jeep at the end of last year, I have a good job and I had a great work vehicle (a van for my delivery job.)

Since 2020 started, I’ve had one punch in the guts after another, after another.

I moved out of my moms and in with some friends. We had a nice house. Everything seemed great. Then I caught them stealing from me. Multiple occasions. Caught on camera too. Nope. I was done dealing with the situation after just a few months.

While still living there, I got pulled over one night and arrested under suspicion of being under the influence of marijuana. I live in Colorado, and have a valid medical card, my car smelled because the house had very strict rules against it in the lease agreement, and the roommates were against it. Since it was a cold night I had decided to smoke in the car. 4 hours later I left to go pick up my girlfriend. I wasn’t high anymore. I felt completely sober. I got into my Jeep and left to pick her up. I stopped to get gas on the way, left the car running since I was just gonna be standing next to it, but turned off my headlights. I got out of the vehicle, pumped my gas, got back in and left. I forgot to turn on my headlights. I made it about 100ft up the road before noticing my mistake and corrected it. About a mile later a cop that was behind me ended up turning on his lights and I pulled over. He asked me when I last smoked and I told him about “4 hours earlier” and we went through the process. Absolutely nothing was in the vehicle. For those curious, the legal limit of thc in Colorado is 5 Nanograms, I was at 2.1 Nanograms. Less than half the limit.. I still have to go through DUI crap.

After moving out of that house, my girlfriend and I got a “alright” apartment together, and we’ve been living there since.

Then only a few months later, I wreck my work vehicle. My fault. No drugs or alcohol. Just wrong place wrong time. I rear ended another van and totaled it. Case luckily got dropped and dismissed, but I still had to pay $2700 for insurance deductible. Now I don’t have that van anymore.

Now months down the line you’d be wondering. “Hmm what could go wrong now?” My newer Jeep, wrecked today. A California driver made a left in front of me when I was crossing a intersection. Her fault. Her response to the accident was “I’m from California, I’ve only been here 3 days”
Ive contacted insurance and everything, the claim is being worked on. I’ve been paying my lease, but I feel like I’m not gonna get anything good back from all this.

I just feel like everything I’ve worked so hard for is being ripped out of my hands. I work my ass off and it feels like I have nothing to show for it.

My dream goal is to just get a big truck (a dually or something tough) and buy a 5th wheel and disappear. Move somewhere new and start over. Maybe trade stocks for a living. (Although to become a day trader I’d need $25k.) I don’t know what to do but I’m definitely tired of this..

What should I do? I’m so lost on life right now and I feel so drained and depressed. I can’t hardly afford any more expenses and that’s what this is all turning into. I luckily have a work van again but it’s older and has issues of its own. If anyone has any suggestions please give me some advice.

I’d love to work from home if I could afford to do so. I have a bunch of technical knowledge but no degrees or any college for that matter. Mostly a bunch of self taught computer knowledge and mechanical knowledge. But I want to get my life put back together. I was on the right track but life keeps punching me if not stabbing me in the gut this year. And it hurts. I don’t know what I did to deserve all this. Why me? Why this year? Please help me figure something out.",15Sep2020,1

25,"Long story short, I’m a 35m and my asst is a 22m. I’m a first year pool manager, lifeguard, and pool employee, period. Never worked pools before. He’s lifeguarded for a long time, his first management position, and he’s a college student with 2 other side jobs. He’s more qualified than me, I just give off a better manager vibe and people listen to me better. Anyhow, he’s sort of shit the bed this summer. He bit off more than he can chew and his heart is with his coaching jobs, not this. I get it. I have a second job too and I was a college student not that long ago, I really do. I like the kid, he seems like a good dude. I’d have a beer with him. Anyhow, as of today, my bosses say he’s not welcome back. He doesn’t show up a lot, not a strong leader (yet, I think he has potential), and he’s dropped the ball consistently on busy days. My hands are tied, I have to let him go. Of course I’ll offer to give him a glowing recommendation and use me as a reference, but I don’t want to seem like the asshole. Can you help me?",15Sep2020,1
27,"I found out the age of a boy I game with and talk to regularly (online) and I told my friend and she instantly started freaking out and judging me, saying it’s weird, I should block him and that she doesn’t even want to listen to me talk about it because that’s how awful/inappropriate it is?",15Sep2020,1
28,"This isn’t as tough of a situation as some other posts I see here but I’m struggling with it today. My ex wife and I broke up 5 years ago and we had been together for 10 years. We got a pet dog together and he must be around 12-13 years old now.

Her and I broke up under incredibly painful and complicated conditions but we still managed to have an amicable relationship afterwards. It’s even more complicated because she had followed me 6 times zones away for school and then 2 years later we were broken up. Then I moved a further 6 times zones away (12 times zones total) for research. 

She sometimes guilts me and says she cannot believe  I could move away and not want to see our doggy. First, the reason we broke up is because she cheated on me (and it’s actually WORSE than it sounds). Second, I don’t think I should be the one to put my future on hold especially because she’s the reason we don’t have a relationship. Third, I’m in a relationship here so I’m not tempted to return to where my ex lives. Fourth, I’m still a student and can not afford to live where my ex lives.

I know this is long and drawn out. But I just don’t know if I should be contacting my ex for updates because it brings back painful memories and also my current partner might get jealous. But I miss my doggy. Sometimes I just think about dropping everything and moving back so I can see him sometimes. He is getting older too...other times I just wonder if he represents all the pain and the memories and nostalgia of our lives together (doggy, ex and I)

I guess I need advice on whether I should be contacting my ex for updates and also if I should be moving back so I can see my doggy.",15Sep2020,1

30,"Hi! So a few years back I tried contact lenses after nine years of wearing glasses. I always struggled getting them in and the ones my doctor prescribed were uncomfortable, so I just gave up. Fast forward to now, I'm determined to make them work. I got a new prescription with a different type of lenses but I cannot.get.them.in. It took me about 20 minutes in the office the other day, and ever since I have not gotten them in. I either start blinking uncontrollably, or it gets caught in my lashes when I touch it to my eye and falls out. I'm not afraid of anything, I can go through the motions with no problem, I just can't get them to stick to my eyes. Help?!",15Sep2020,1
31,"So, a hair of background, I'm 27, currently working at a subway after getting fired during covid. Its the only other job near me, so I took it despite being massively overqualified, so for the most part my co-workers are younger, or highschool age. 

We recently hired a new girl, 22, who is incredibly vocal about ""her man"" and how possessive her significant other is. The problem is this: One of my 16 year old coworkers has been witnessed by me, and 2 other people, being obviously... Into each other, for lack of a better term. 

This 16 year old is asking for trouble. Not to mention the sheer illegality of their relationship, the fact that hes putting himself in that position is impacting his work, and potentially creating issues for Mgmt as a whole in the building. 
I know it isn't directly my problem, but I can't help but feel this is going to make a problem for our store in the near future. Should I tell my GM? Just keep it to myself? Not sure what to do, but outright ignoring it feels wrong.",15Sep2020,1
32,"This has happened a lot with several different situations, but this one is the easiest to describe.
So there’s a guy I’ve been friends with for years and we’re pretty close. I wouldn’t say I had a big crush on him, but I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t considered it. We’re similar in a lot of ways including our outlooks on life, so it was always natural to talk to him. One day I found out from a friend that he’d had a big crush on me for a long time. I sometimes thought this may have been the case as he had mentioned a few time he liked a girl (would never tell me who), but he was worried telling her would ruin the friendship. He brought it up several times so I started wondering if it might have been me. I started talking to him more, and thinking maybe I did like him and they weren’t just random thoughts. We would always talk late at night, like from 7pm-4am. And at night I would always think of how we would probably make a good couple, we get along super well, he’s one of my closest friends, I’m pretty sure he likes me, and I just couldn’t think of any reason not to go for it. Then eventually I would go to sleep, and when I woke up in the morning I would think back on what I was thinking the night before and just completely dismiss all of my feelings. I would feel weird even thinking about it, and I just decided I was just thinking too much since it was late at night. But it would happen over and over again. I’ve never “followed my heart” in my life, I always thought that it would just end up hurting me. I think everything through logically and make my decisions based on how I think the outcome would be. I dismiss most of my feelings for a more rational approach to everything, and while this is very helpful when I’m angry or upset, when it comes to things like relationships or ambitions it’s killing me. I’ve never been in a “real” relationship, as in the only times I’ve ever dated someone were when I was super young and we basically didn’t talk for a week and then agreed to just be friends, and when I had a month long online relationship that was pretty much just friends with a new title. I’ve been very reluctant to get into relationships because I don’t want to date for fun or because I’m bored, I want to date someone that I like, trust, and want to be around, not just for the sake of dating. I’ve had really bad depression from a pretty young age and while I’m much better now and no longer taking antidepressants, I still get into ruts and start thinking negatively. I never had social anxiety though. I always had a lot of confidence and didn’t worry too much. The pandemic and being isolated 24/7 has led me to overthink more and worry about harmless things, but it also allowed me to reflect on my behavior in the past and I noticed this pattern. I’m starting to think I may have relationship anxiety, it could have something to do with my far less than good relationship with my mother growing up. This has happened to me too many times for it to be a fluke, and I just don’t know what to do at this point.

TLDR; I have trouble getting into relationships. I know there’s probably no soulmate out there waiting for me, but I know when my time is being wasted and I don’t like being in time wasting relationships, but when I can’t tell if it’s going to work out or not I just give up before I even have a chance to try.",15Sep2020,1
33,"So my roommate and I are getting a place. I did the groundwork and went in person to tour and drop off the money because he hasn’t moved to my state yet. We chose rooms, he actually chose the one he’s in now. Now he txted me and asked if we could switch rooms because he said he needs rooms for his desk since he’s working WFH. He also said he’d lay $50 more in rent for the room. But I’m working from home too and need space for my desk, and we already chose rooms. What do I do?

41,"So my mother has gotten a bit sick showing symptoms of COVID and I have gotten really scared because if she got covid she would have a good chance of dying. She has gotten tested and we are waiting for results, but in the meantime I’ve been crying and thinking a lot of what would happen if she died.
Today I called my best friend to talk about it and I say why I’ve been sad. He then says after i told him what I’ve been feeling that he doesn’t want to talk about it with me, I ask why and it’s because he doesn’t think I should be sad about it.
I already knew that he thinks that and I wasn’t expecting him to give good advice or anything. I just wanted to vent and the fact that he wouldn’t let me made me feel so lost. 
he knows that I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this, he’s my closest friend.
A little about him, he is a bit weird in what he cares about, he thinks that there is a god but doesn’t care if he goes to hell, he doesn’t care about poor people or others suffering he’s only cares about the people close to him and himself, but wouldn’t cry if the end of the world was tomorrow because nothing would matter. 
when it comes to arguments he is happy to change his mind if he understands the other person point of view.
Now that’s very difficult with me because I care a lot about everything that has or hasn’t happened so I often can’t get him to see my side because I can’t explain why I care so much about people I don’t even know dying.
So yeah I just can’t explain to him way I’m so sad, he would under stand if we knew for sure that my mother has coivd, but because we don’t know for sure he thinks I’m being silly.
I just want to know if their’s a way I can make him under stand. I know it may be selfish but i want him to listen when I’m sad
Sorry for such a long post and if it was hard to read.
I’m dyslexic so my English is horrible. 
Please give me your opinions on what I should say to him about this.

42,"The firehouse near their house gives food to school kids if you go for lunch. My foster parents tell me I can go there everyday so they aren't refusing me food but it is just really scary to get there so sometimes I don't go. Sometimes I'm just tired and can't make it there. It is 4 miles away and I have to walk along the highway with the little kids in the house too. We don't get dinner very often but I try to cook things sometimes for my siblings but usually there isn't much food I can even make. There is way too many kids in our house and usually us older ones try to go to bed a little hungrier so the younger kids can eat but its just really hard. Sometimes I cry because my stomach hurts at night but I know I need to try to be grateful for what I have. They lost their jobs during the coronavirus so I don't think they want to starve us but sometimes it feels hard not to be angry too. Sometimes I feel like not having food has made my brain feel like foggy and think dark thoughts that I never even had before, even before foster care.

My foster dad sometimes touches me in ways that make me feel uncomfortable. He grabs my butt a lot and sometimes comes in to the bathroom when me or the other older girls are in the shower. He doesn't do anything but I still think it is kinda weird. I feel like I can't go to sleep sometimes because I stay up worrying about him coming down into our room. I don't know why I have been having nightmares like that.

I told my social worker and she said she would report it but nothing ever happened. She said that they are actually feeding us. I keep texting and calling but she isn't answering me anymore. I tried looking up other ways I can get help but they saw the internet history and it was a really bad situation for all of us. I feel so hurt being in this house but I know it isn't that bad compared to some other homes. Even though things are hard, all of us kids will get separated from each other and never see each other if we move but we mostly feel like a family together (not with our foster parents). They are really all I have. No one comes to see us anymore. I am just so tired of getting separated from people I start to love. I miss my family.

Does anyone have any advice on how to stay hopeful or maybe can explain to me when stuff might go back to normal with the corona virus? Is it getting better?",15Sep2020,1
43,"Ideally, I’d like a relationship, but I’m trying to keep an open mind and stay independent right now, like casual fun. 

I’m tired of feeling depressed from a lack of physical and mental intimacy while my friends are in relationships and having fun at this crucial time of development in life. I’m around Temple (Philly), which statistically is the most sexually active university in the US (afaik).

Dating apps haven’t gotten me very far. Usually ghosted, ignored, or unmatched very quickly despite being cordial, upfront/confident, and playful. Sometimes I changed my tone, texting style, bio, etc. Never makes much of a difference. I’ve talked to various supports around me, and they say it’s not me, but I always feel crushed and take things to heart.

I’ve been told time after time again how much I have going for me (talented, attractive, well spoken, driven, entrepreneurial), and I’ve gotten a healthy amount of glances/attention and positive feedback throughout my life. But I just can’t for the life of me make any more-than-friend connections. I think I’d prefer doing so in real life rather than online, but I’m open to anything.

Any advice is much appreciated. 😊",15Sep2020,1
44,"So, to make a long story short, I took interest into the med school path last year when i entered freshmen year of undergrad. I have recently started back into sophomore but I now do not know if that is what I want. I lost the spark I had when I decided to take that path. I wanted to go to med school as a physician but I feel that it just wont be worth it mentally in the end. I am a pretty chill guy and I want to do something I enjoy. What should I do? Should I just waste this only life on something that may pay well but mentally drain me or find something else?

45,"I just voluntarilystarted an intensive outpatient program, as therapy once a week wasn't enough for me. I met one of the psychiatrists today, the main guy who prescribes medication. (For background, I'm a minor, 16, and I've tried four different meds in the past year for depression and anxiety). 

It was all going well, but I told him that there was one medication I was NOT willing to try: Effexor. I'm an artist, and if I get tremors... well, that's it. It would make my depression so much worse if I can't do the one thing I love. I've also read that the withdrawal is horrendous, and that only 5% of people who go on it are able to come off.

He basically told me not to do research (which, no. I'm going to research things before I put them into my body. Yeah, a lot of times that stuff is negative, but I've also read positive stories!) and that we would talk about it more (we ran out of time). He then went on to say that he ""won almost every argument he had"". 

(I'd like to clarify that he didn't prescribe it, I brought it up because I felt it was important to tell him).

I'm feeling really frustrated. I don't think it's morally right to pressure someone into taking a medication, and this has kind of ruined my expectations for that aspect of treatment. 

So, can he force me to take a medication if I don't want to take it? And is it legal for him to pressure me into taking something I don't want to take? How can I make him understand that this makes me uncomfortable?",15Sep2020,1
46,"There's no easy way to say it. My (34M) girlfriend's (38F) breath is horrible. This isn't exactly new, but it seems to be getting worse and it's gotten to the point where I am just no longer attracted to her.  
We've been together for 3 years. Early on I expressed worry that one of her front teeth looks infected, but she didn't seem to be concerned - she seemed to be insulted that I even cared about her bad breath and that it was normal, and that I was too sensitive. She must be desensitized to it, because sometimes it smells literally like shit.  
On top of this she just loves kissing and being face to face. I understand this is normal in a relationship, but she likes it A LOT - so it becomes impossible to ignore her bad breath. She does not seem to take the hint when I don't kiss her on the mouth or turn my head away. I don't want to be rude or hurt her but I can't hide my disgust anymore. She also does cares very little about her appearance, which is just not helping. I have lost interest in having sex with her.

I know I need to talk to her, but having had no luck in the past, I am afraid that she will just get upset. She does not want to have a root canal and has had other teeth pulled in the past rather than save them with a root canal - which are far back enough that they are not visible, but getting a front top tooth pulled is just not an option. I know that if I express my feelings, that she will take it completely the wrong way, and even if she decides to have a root canal, the mere fact of bringing it up and asking her to do something about it is going to be a big problem for our relationship in itself.  


I love her, but I feel less of a romantic connection and more like she is my best friend. COVID and other factors make for a terrible rental market in my area, so breaking up would be a nightmare, as we would basically be stuck living together. Honestly, I would be okay with breaking up and remaining friends, but I don't think she would take it well at all.

What should I do? I feel absolutely stuck. I know I should talk to her, but I am terrible at bringing things like this up, and I \*know\* she will be very upset and almost certainly refuse to do anything about it.",15Sep2020,1

49,"I’m (F19) a classical pianist and I live at home with my family and my piano. I’m the only one in the house who likes and understands classical music, so the pieces i practise and like to learn/ play aren’t particularly what my family likes to hear. This makes me really self conscious when I practise and I hate practising when everyone’s home because of it. They much prefer to listen to my little sister who plays pop songs that are easier on the ears. It’s really irritating because I dont practise enough because of this reason, and I can’t bring myself to want to learn anything that my family likes to hear. I don’t want to learn or hear dance monkey or coffin dance or canon in d minor! Sometimes I just suck it up and practise my, in the words of my mother, “ugly” pieces (i’m playing beethovens tempest 2... how is it ugly?!) but I find myself making so many mistakes because I’m not focused and only thinking about playing softly so no one can hear me.

50,"Location, Washington, DC. Dupont Circle. 

I'll start by saying that I do have sympathy for *some* homeless people that are having a rough time and struggling. 

I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for homeless people who refuse to improve their lives and choose to mooch off of others. 

My neighborhood is one of the nicer parts of DC. I am very fortunate to live where I do and have a great landlord. 

The closest corner has always had 1-2 homeless residents that normally didn't cause much issues. 

In the last year this residential corner has turned into a campground. There are 4-5 tents in front of a grocery store, hardware store, and McDonald's. 

The 1-2 residents has grown to 8-12 on any given day. They occupy a large space with chairs. They refuse to wear masks and social distance and constantly harrass passersby. The owners of the McDonald's and hardware stores are struggling with declining sales in direct result of these aggressive homeless. 

On multiple occasions some of these residents have physically assaulted and robbed actual residents of the neighborhood at knifepoint. Police reports were filed and arrests were made and 12 hours later they come back. 

The Deputy Mayor for the District of Columbia Health and Human Services, his staff, and MPD are all aware of the situation. Another gentleman sends emails daily to the them urging action and CC's a large group of neighborhood residents of which I am one. The city basically refuses to do anything about it. They have acknowledged they understand the problem and concern and said that there is nothing they can do. 

-in DC, camping is illegal. 
-impeding a public walkway or sidewalk is illegal
-selling good without a license is illegal. 
-open drug use is illegal

Reddit, what ideas do you have for us to try to clean up my neighborhood? 

I’ve considered recruiting a group of people to occupy the space starting early in the morning to attempt a sort of sit in. 

I’ve considered asking the hardware store if we could blast obnoxious music during permitted hours. 

I’ve also considered offering to pressure wash the sidewalks during business hours. Yes, all day. In an attempt make the space inhospitable. 

I would feel sorry for these people but they're assholes. They've been offered housing and jobs but they refuse.",15Sep2020,1

Every time I go for a job or do an application I either don’t get called back or get beat out for lack of experience. I know I am a good teacher from substitute experience but have for one reason or another never been able to fully get in the door. Throughout all of this I’ve been running a pretty successful camp for my town and am now being offered a position leading a youth services division. At first I was ecstatic and jumped at the opportunity excited to “reach more children and families” than I potentially would in the classroom. As we came closer to the offer being official, a family friend reached out for my resume claiming they had a connection for teaching positions in town. Salary is almost identical and pensions are both as state employees. There was no guarantee just them telling me that they need people, but it spun me into a state of anxiety I haven’t experienced in almost a year. The attacks are happening almost twice a day and I’m in a constant state of nausea and overwhelm. I feel like on one hand I am walking away from my dream job but on the other hand I feel like I’m being rigid and not accepting an amazing change in direction and opportunity to do much more for my community. I am probably overthinking but can’t decide. Should I give the community position a go? I can always walk away after a year or so? Or should I just do what I’ve literally gotten certified to do?

On the first day, I came up a little less than $100 short. On the next day, everything was fine, but on the following day I came up $20 short. Basically, within the first week, I came up $120 short. My boss and I had a long talk about it, and they decided to have me work as a bagger instead. It's been about a month and a half so far, and there are no more complaints regarding my work performance.

However, I feel like shit at my job. From the time I started to right now, about 9 people in total joined the supermarket. Most of them were around my age. They all went through the same cashier training and have succeeded at being a cashier. I know this because I see them week after week after week and they are still there. I don't wanna sound like a jealous spiteful person or anything, but seeing them there makes me feel like shit because I was the only one who screwed up on that job.

Sometimes when I go into gas stations and grocery stores, I would also see fellow classmates doing the same cashiering job, and they are doing it fine with no issues.

I feel like an absolute dumbass who can't do anything right, and that I will never get anywhere. If I can't handle change properly, how am I supposed to succeed in harder things? HOw do I stop harboring this feeling of shittiness. What do I do?",15Sep2020,1

67,"First of all, I'm not a native english speaker, that's why you may see some errors in my speech.

Since I was 10, I have been great friends with this girl whose name I won't say for privacy reasons. We were both victims of bullying and many insecurities during our teenage years and i guess that's what made us stick together, we relied so much on each other, or at least I did. Girls bullied her because they were jealous of her looks, She was and is beautiful and because of that was harassed every day, making her depressed during most of the middle and high school years. Some days we talked about our feelings to try to heal the emotional wounds the bullies made, she helped me go through most of my difficulties in life like body insecurities, social anxiety and family problems, if it wasn't for her support I'd just not be here anymore or would still  be the socially awkward kid everybody messed up with. I feel like I owe her so much. She eventually fought the bullies and they left her alone and I can't describe with words how glad and proud felt for her success. Even though I feel guilty, because the advice I tried to give her wasn't nearly as good enough as the help she gave me. In 2019 she went to an exchange to Germany for 6 months, we were on good terms and she still gave me advice about what should I do about my body insecurities. During those 6 months I worked out at a gym to overcome those insecurities and now I can say that i'm proud of my body, but that's not the point. I was planning on showing her when she came back the person i became and how thankful i was for her help throughout these years. In February she came back but was cold as hell with me, Ignored me and blocked me on all media. I felt confused and tried to ask her what was wrong, if i did something that made her mad, she just answered ""no"" and went on with her life. To this date I don't even know what the hell happened, so i'm asking for advice here, I know that I should move on too, but it's hard considering how deep my frienship with her was.",15Sep2020,1
68,I work as a server at a restaurant while I'm finishing my last year and half at SDSU. I got a positive COVID test about 2 weeks ago and have since quarantined. I got the virus at a party and will continue to party because I'm almost done with school. I know that may seem selfish and so thats why I'm wondering if I should quit my job all together. There is so much uncertainty regarding the virus and just because I already had it doesn't mean I can't contract it again. I dont know if it would be right to continue working in a restaurant of all places with the ongoing pandemic and me still going to parties. What do you think?,15Sep2020,1
69,"I’m a 24F, I live with my boyfriend and his family. I just started working after dealing with covid. My job is great 8-4 M-F. 

But my mother is sick I’m not sure what is wrong but her mental health is declining, she thinks everyone and everything is out to get her. (She’s nothing special and has no money) she is also taking care of my 4 year old sister, but has a drunk stupid husband that isn’t helping her in anyway except pay half of the bills. She recently got out of the psych ward, which during family who we haven’t talked to in who know how long came into the picture “trying” to help, we’ll they aren’t in the picture anymore. I’m on top over her about her meds, I don’t want to lose her, I want her healthy for whenever I decide to get married, but a house I want her there. I think the best solution is to get power of attorney over her and my sister, help her get on a fixed income and get her a place of her own. Is it my job to do that? She’s only 20 years older than me. And I’m her oldest out of 6. 

As a young adult I don’t know what to do, I don’t know if I’m making the best choice. I want to go back to school and work toward being a psychiatrist. Or something with psychology. I enjoy how the brain works with individuals. But that’s 12 years of schooling. 

My relationship is toxic to so degree, we have been on and off. I love him but he doesn’t make me 100% happy. There’s so much more details, like the consistency in him cheating, him saying sorry it won’t happen again then him doing it again. One reason probably a wrong one for staying is I don’t really have anywhere else to go. 

I want a place of my own, I want to be happy, I want to be successful. But how can I manage to do that. 

What do I do, what can I do?

I then remembered how the executor of the will read my father’s reddit password out loud in front of my family so I think that someone in my family logged into my father’s reddit account before I could and then changed the password.

76,"My [16M] dad [45M] applied me for a job at a Panera near my house. I’ve wanted a job for a while because I need experience and money for college. I didn’t want to work here because my god brother [17M] worked here and hated the manager, who accused my god brother of stealing parts out of the vacuum cleaner (we still don’t know why he was accused lol). I went in anyways with an open mind because maybe there was a misunderstanding, but this manager is kind of a nut job. He runs 5 bakeries in the area, and runs each of them like they’re prestige 5 star restaurants and will only take the best service. He also competes with all of the other bakeries in the area, and made that very clear. 

My main problem comes from the fact that I am too kind for my own good and really awkward. I *somehow* managed to agree to work 18 hours a week, and he told me to come in for training on Monday. I also agreed to work the register, but my god brother said he assigns a shit ton of work for register workers. These are the main reasons, but the work environment isn’t what I want for a job.

79,"I'm writing this knowing full well that I deserve all the crap coming to me, but long story short, I had a teacher who, when I was in elementary, was the headmaster of the private school I went to (it was a kindergarten-12th grade school) and he was a notable presence in my life (to some degree) throughout my time at this school.  He was the kind of person who, when I was younger, would joke that I was one of a handful of people in my class (and the class above us I guess) he could see becoming president.  When I was a senior, he was my advisor for my senior thesis paper and was very kind and helpful to me.  

I didn't keep up much with him since, but in late April of this year, I saw a post on Facebook that revealed to me that he had unfortunately passed away.  However, at around this time, I was in the thick of grad school and having an immense amount of trouble with my final project and was extremely preoccupied.  Between trying to figure out the issues with my project and taking an ""Incomplete"" just to finish and taking on what would have been my final class and getting blindsided by how hard it turned out to be, I kept forgetting to do something nice for the family in memory of him.  

Now it is mid-September and all I've done is buy a sympathy card, but when it has been this long, what else should I do?  I'm not good with ""sympathy"" flowers and customs surrounding that, and I feel like I can safely assume they don't need money.  I want to do something that says ""I hope you guys are still doing alright"" without stepping on their toes so to speak (not be too overbearing, not come across as careless, etc.).

Well, I fell in love with a girl, like 4 years ago and also she fell the same, she said we should be something but I said no because I don’t feel really good with my self esteem, and I’m depressed so I said no (4 years ago) since those times she had other relationships but she still feel something, the last year I was dating another person and she was jealous (still feel something) and I disappeared (October last year and I back in May) I started talk with her again and I tried did some indirect and I realized she still feel something, I said to her in May I feel something and she said “I don’t feel the same”. I all the time did indirects to her and still jealous but one month later (june) I said to her “I want to  leave here” and she said “why?” And I said “I don’t feel good because you don’t feel the same” and she said “I always have been the same about you, I love you, I’m surprised that you had not realized” I fell happy but noticed she was confused and I don’t know...but she really feel happy thinking about say each other “I love you” so I disappeared again lol. I back in August to ask her “wanna be my gf?” After I said all the things I feel for her, and she said “no, I see you like a friend and I love other person” after I said “but you said you loved me” and she first said “sorry sorry sorry sorry” and after 10 minutes she said “It was your fault, you thought other things but I said it like friends” and she was confused again, she said she’d love dating me...etc so I said “I’II never come back” We discussed some things and she said “ I was nervous and I said I like other person” but I really decided go away from her, she said “don’t go please, you’re special to me” but I’m sad, I deleted all things about her, and there’s no way to talk with her... I want her to talk to me again but SHE, I mean If I’m important I want she text me again, not me, guys I back 3 times, I need she back...Since August 10th we don’t talk and guys I really love her, I did drawings, many things you can’t imagine, I want protect her, I want the best for her, I can’t get her out of my head.

I’m a liberal. My house knows love is love, science is real, BLM, etc. But we are surrounded by your typical farmers and small town republicans. There are like minded people here too, just not as many. 
This election cycle and administration is running me down. 
I won’t leave, because I know my state (ultra red) and community are better than this. But how can I keep going? Also, our school district has no tolerance for bullies or antagonists, so I know my kids are safe in that regard. 
I’m not looking to change people’s views politically, I just want them to wake up to the hypocrisy of it all. 
Case and point - there was a local news article asking to help identify the person who stole a Biden/Harris sign. The comments on the article were mind blowing after the last 4 years of “Everyone is so mean to our president! No one has been treated worse!” - nope.

87,"I’m 20 years old. Around a year and a half ago,  when I was 18, I was on a school trip going to Europe where we were visiting England, France, and Amsterdam. While we were in France, I got a bottle of captains Morgan’s. Some other kids on the trip had been drinking too, but they were better about the way they hid it and didn’t get caught. I ended up finishing the bottle one night, and the next day I was trying to get rid of the bottle so I put it in my drawstring bag and was looking for somewhere to throw it out. We eventually got to this church and we were going to go in, and they checked our bags, and I hadn’t found a place to drop off my bottle yet, so I wrapped it in a sweatshirt and left it on the ground. A teacher ended up saying who’s sweatshirt is this, and they’d figure out it was mine, so I tried to put it back in my bag but they saw the bottle in the process. I ended up getting sent home, luckily no one else did, because I was trying to be very clear that they weren’t involved so don’t send them home, to which they kept saying “that’s not your decision”. I ended up getting a 2 day suspension, needed to help around the school with trash and everything in the cafeteria while everyone was watching, needed to take a 5 week alcohol course,  and also had all my teachers notified about what had happened. Now in the moment, I was pretty pissed off, but I had broken the rules, so I did understand it. But then, I heard that these teachers had been talking about what had happened in Europe behind my back to certain students. Now I was livid. And I confronted them to which they denied it (several students told me otherwise, and I believe them over the teachers),  and on top of that, (this trip happened on February break), that April there was 2 other school trips, where I found out several students got caught drinking, and where belligerent and vomiting (much worse condition than I was in when I was caught, I was coherent and talking to them), and the teachers covered for them. And they got in no trouble at all. No widespread information on what happened to a large amount of the school, no suspension, no nothing. I was beyond furious about this. A few days after I graduated, I sent the teachers emails about how I felt about the situation. My emails were sent when I was drunk, so they ended up coming across as very unprofessional and cringey. I don’t regret the point of my email, but I definitely regret the delivery. They never responded to I sent a few follow ups, and then left it there. The next day I ended up getting a call from the police saying that they accuse me of harassment. Now I wanna be very clear, these emails were very unprofessional, but I made absolutely no threats or any insinuations that I was going to do anything to them. Nothing in the content of those emails was deserving of police action. Luckily, the cop basically said I don’t know what they’re talking about, just dont email them again. A few months later when I was very drunk as well, (by the way I’ve discovered I have an issue with drinking. I’m doing my best to get it under control) I called the school as a prank call and said something stupid about those teachers being mean to my kid. Now this I understand was completely out of line. I never should of done that, it was childish and stupid. You just have to understand I felt very wronged by this people and it ended up making me do some things I regretted.  The call happened almost a year ago now, and I haven’t had any contact with them or the school since. I haven’t wanted to either. Yes I felt like was one of the most unfair things I’ve ever gone through, but it’s been almost 2 years since it happened and I still can’t get over it. I still think about it often. I still really want an apology from those teachers, but it’s something that I’m not going to get. I really want to not let them control my mind like this anymore. I want to move on. Please let me know if you have any advice for me.",15Sep2020,1

91,"I'm a sophomore in high school and I have a lot of commitments and things going on this school year. I don't want to burn out and want to manage my time effectively while still having time to myself. Here's why this year is very busy for me:

Classes
________
-I'm taking pretty tough classes like APUSH and honors chemistry and english. Especially APUSH.

After-School Activities
________________________
-I'm part of student council and we have meetings twice a week, along with other stuff that goes into planning events, although there may be less work to do because of online school cancelling a lot of events.

Athletics
_________
-Once a week for the foreseeable future I have boxing classes at my gym, which take up roughly 2 hours of my time with transportation and all. 
-Last year I joined track but we never even had a season. This year I plan to again so I need to start getting in shape for it, especially because I have let myself go a little bit, by not working out for weeks on end. 

Work
_____
-I work in food service 6-12 hours a week. Right now its only been a few weeks of school but its close to 8 hours a week it seems although it could potentially be up to 12 hours.

Social Life
__________
-Coronavirus has been an interesting time for social lives. But for me though I think my social life has sort of gotten better. My life socially was only getting better and better before quarantine, then it took a dip in May but for the most part since July it is getting much better, at least for the circumstances. This is why I'm including the social life because I need to maintain my progress of making new friends and connections. Especially because it's harder to socialize in online school.

Personal Hobbies
__________________
-One of my passions is music. In the future I would love a career with music and working with my favorite artists or maybe even being one. That being said I want to work on and learn skills like mixing, mastering, and creating music.
-Another passion I have is video production. In the future I would also love a career working on creating and editing videos, maybe even combine it with music and make music videos. I want to learn/improve on my basic skills of video editing, and filming.

How common is it for this to happen in an apartment? I'm guessing the carpet is 4-6 years old. It is the cheap low-end apartment carpet. It probably wasn't vacuumed very well in the past. Carpet pad seems pretty thin too.

I dont know why I'm mean it just snaps for me and talking to my family makes it worse. This has been going on for years but suddenly got really bad a few months ago.
I have a really great family who love me but I can't talk to them about certain things and I think it's one of my triggers. I recently came out to them as questioning my sexuality and they put it off as a phase and experimenting. That really hurts and when we talk about it my dad makes a mean joke and my feelings get hurt. My mom makes me feel like I'm doing it for attention and that also hurts my feelings.
My brother I feel sorry for him I get on to him the most because I love him the most. He gets on my nerve so much.

I am so god damned jealous that bestie had a legit baby shower, her mom was there to support her giving birth, and she just has so many people in general who love her and are going to help, be there, and share the joy of a new baby with her. 

I’m so jealous but I do not want a baby. It’s expensive, stressful, and totally throws off my career. If I talked to my spouse about having a baby I’m certain he’d be on board. But I don’t want all of the bullshit that comes along with a baby again. 

After a few years I’m going to foster/adopt “older” kids because I like kids, just not babies. 

So, how on earth do I deal with this jealous and baby fever for a baby I don’t want? I have no idea how to handle these feelings. 

(Fyi, I am very positive and supportive with my bestie and not harboring any ill will towards her whatsoever even though I’m jealous.)",15Sep2020,1
97,"Hey, I’m 20, I’m a girl, and I don’t remember the last time I was true to myself. I convinced an entire class for a whole year that I am Jewish (I’m not Jewish), I somehow convinced my FRIEND GROUP that I am (was) Italian - I don’t really know if I’m Italian or not but that’s beside the point. I tried joining the military, I tried having a professional “big girl” job, I’ve now restarted to onlyfans, and I’m on unemployment. 

I tell everyone fake stories about myself and swallow everything that’s actually true about me. I’m embarrassed of who I am. 

Who I really am is a depressed, boring creature and I’ve been trying different medications for over a year now. 

Sorry that I am dumping my thought box onto reddit but that’s kind of all I got right now. I guess the advice I’m looking for is: how to be true to myself. What ways can I discover new things about myself? How do I be interesting?",15Sep2020,1
98,"Okay last week I was at my girlfriend's house and her 14 year old daughter told me that her mom was sneaky. Now this has been bothering me for a while however I don't know how to address it. I honestly don't know what to do, do I even say anything to her, or do I just let it play out. The conversation was about boys and girls being sneaky then she proceeded to say my mom is not sneaky, I then reply I did not mention your mom, she starts to put her head down and I asked her you know something don't you? She then puts her head back down. Right before she gets ready to speak her mom walks in the living room. I don't know what to do",15Sep2020,1

The worst part is when I'm Interested in a girl and find out they're taller than me...

At the beginning of COVID we both admitted having always generally been drawn to the other person.

103,"

A quick backstory in a levels I was always getting A-A* in every single mock I was putting so many hours of revision every day around 4 hours  each on sat and Sunday and 2-3 hours each day during Monday-Friday. I had applied to the top Uni’s in the world such as imperial and UCL and oxford. However when it came to my final a level test I performed  so badly and in my eyes I would consider it a fail till this day. I don’t know how it happen but I come out with BBC. Eventually I had to go through clearing and ending up getting into a mid Russell group uni Newcastle. The course I’m currently doing is electric and electronic engineering. 


 I want to leave  is because I feel like I’m wasting my skills I currently have a baseline of 82%.  The uni doesn’t feel challenging enough.  I’m scared this will impact my future when applying to big companies or for other uses of the degree as they would probably take someone who went to a better uni then me. I also want to go in research later in my life and hopefully discover stuff that’s never been discovered. 

Furthermore I just outclass my peers so badly that it just feels like the uni is full of stupid people. I’m not trying to sound arrogant and cocky it’s very true I’ll give a few examples.  S omeone asked me how to solve a quadratic equation are you serious how you can ask that question at university. Another example is 5 people asked me how do question 1 on a electric field test  which was computer based. Qu 1 was to work out the electrostatic force between two point charges. Come on this is literally the first thing you learn in a level physics lesson 1 of electric fields. What’s even worst is they even asked me qu1b which was is the electrostatic force between a proton and electron attractive or repulsive. That’s just a few examples. All of this stuff is repeatedly  drilled  in your head before uni there are literally no excuses for this. It feels like anyone with a pulse can just be accepted into Newcastle. The lack of drive of people around me is concerning as well they all want 40% which is just a pass and they struggle at that. I don’t understand how you can struggle to get 40% it feels like getting 40% it’s harder then 70% to get 40% you basically have to no nothing.

After reflecting the whole year I don’t feel like I have any true friends. People only message me when they something e.g help in a report. Ever since the uni has ended my phone has been so dry only 2 people from the uni message me. I got a message the other day and I thought it was someone checking on me but it was them actually asking me if I could help there friend in a retake test this message pissed me off much I just left him on read. I haven’t heard from you in 5 months and this is the only thing you want to say to me. What a fake and I can’t believe the audacity of some people. Not to mention I don’t even know your friend plus it’s his responsibility he’s retaking in the first place and he had 5 months to sort his problem by studying. My friendship group are the same people who at the start of the year  laughed at me for a month because I said I want to achieve 70% which is a first class they all told me it’s impossible and only the pro can do it. I’ve never got lower then 70% on anything and my highest mark is 88% at one point. These are now the same people constantly asking me for help they did apologise to me but that’s only because I brought the matter back up when I got 70% for the first time. I’m in such awarded position next year everyone just relays one me but I just want to ghost them now but at the same time I don’t want to be alone that would be the worst way to spend your time in uni. What should I do? Should I just start to act more stupid next year and tell people I don’t the answer to there question.  The group I hang with it’s very big they basically make up around 30% of the EE corse. I feel like I’m just being used here. 

. 
It’s been going on  throughout the whole year people asking me basic questions.  
I feel like I deserve to be in a better  and more competitive uni. A uni which will open more doors for my future cuz right now I don’t feel like I belong here it’s just too easy and everyone  else is struggling on the basics which just makes me feel like I should be at the top uni competing against the best of the best. 

It’s unfair how a few final test landed me here even though all my other test went flawless. How can the finals outweigh every single other exam I’ve done and determine my future. People can off days and bad days. Such an unfair system.  I want to leave uni so badly I don’t think that’s possible because of my a level grades I Can only go a lower ranked uni which I’m against.

104,"So, to be brief, I have an online friend a couple cities away from me, who currently lives with her parents. She's a minor, but she tells me all sorts of stories where her parents are downright sexist, unfair, and abusive. For example, she was beaten up for saying that it was going to rain the day that they were going on a trip, and they say things like ""girls should cook and clean"" almost all the time. She's being threatened that she's going to be sent back to her country (which has war going on) alone, and she is constantly told to kill herself almost all the time. I'm getting her to stop cutting, but I still really don't know what to do. Her parents aren't just saying things like this for show, as they have said it multiple times. She doesn't want to call CPS, however, since she knows it'll be over in a couple of years when she's a legal adult, though her parents won't let her work, so she wouldn't probably have enough funds to live on her own.

106,"So, short story short, I met this girl freshman year and we became friends instantly. However, I was never good at making good friends other than the ones I've had since elementary school, so of course I, for some reason, stopped talking to her summer after freshman year. Fast forward to the second semester of sophomore year and, after I had completely forgotten her, I saw her once and instantly fell for her. It was too late by then and she had met someone who she started dating. They dated for eight months until they broke up. It took me until the winter break of junior year to build up the courage to talk to her again. For the first month or so it was going great until, after I confessed that I liked her, she told me she had feelings for her ex. Fast forward to today. I'm a senior now and, although she is over her ex, she has suffered from depression for most of her life due to her shitty ass parents. Because of this, we never had the opportunity to date. (btw, turns out she like me from freshman year until she met her ex. ironic huh) Anyways, we established that, since we are most definitely going to separate colleges, we can't date ever. I completely understand, but in the eight months we have been talking we have become very good friends again and I've become friends with her friends. But recently I've forgotten how to be her friend. I'm so blinded by my feelings for her that I forgot how to be just her friend and her depression causes her to not have an interest in anything. She mentally cannot put in the effort to be my friend or anyone's friend. I completely understand that and I do not blame her. But I also feel as if I need to put my own mental health first. Trying to be her friend has drained me. I don't wanna sound dramatic but during all of this, I've lost three family members within 6 months, including my father, and I didn't feel anything. I don't know if it has anything to do with being emotionally drained by her or what but it scares me. I decided yesterday that I needed a break from being her friend. I've tried this before but ended up giving up my break early. But I'm trying again and this time I've blocked all communication from her which is the only way to ensure that I don't get tempted again and give up. I need to get over her but I can't do it if I'm friends with her. I've never done anything like this and I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. I'm sorry this is so long but if you made it this far, let me know if I'm doing the right thing or if I should be doing this differently because I have no idea what I'm doing.",15Sep2020,1

112,"Our first daughter (6m) was considered a easy pregnancy besides being high risk because she was small ( born 4p14o but I was unconcerned because my family naturally has smaller babies). However I did still struggle towards the end because she was super active so I was super uncomfortable no matter what I was doing. He was unsympathetic however, and continued to remind me how easy I had it so I needed to stop complaining. I felt bad, so I just dealt with it.
That's not the main issue though. After she was born I was breastfeeding and pumping every 2 hours or less so I literally would go days with a few hours of sleep the entire time because he would get pissed if I tried to sleep while he was up because he said that I was ignoring him. He helped somewhat during the day so I could do other things (besides sleep of course) but It got to the point that I was so sleep deprived from going weeks without sleeping more than an hour or two a day that I was putting milk in random places and started hearing crying when she wasn't crying. 
But what really scared me was I started hallucinating him walking around the house, things randomly moving when they weren't, and started seeing things I would dream happen in real life ( like I vividly remember freaking out because I saw my daughter get up and run around with some creepy shadows thing but of course it wasn't real and my two month old was sleeping in her bassinet). I started not being coherent a lot and unfocused. I would daily forget where I put my daughter and have to go search for her because I couldn't remember. 
During that time he refused to help whatsoever even though I begged him a few times because I was literally hallucinating but he told me to just deal with it and completely refused to help. I spent 3 months like that terrified that I would end up hurting her by accident until she started sleeping a good 10-12 hours at night which I was so thankful for for because I finally got some sleep though it took me another month before I was finally back to my normal self. 
Now were doing great with her so he wants to plan for another next year but I don't want to go through all that again and truly end up hurting the next baby by accident because he refuses to let me sleep or help me with he/her. He got upset and told me that as a mother I should be able to handle it. I told him I'm not worried about myself because I can deal with it, but I'm afraid that I'll hurt them by accident. He said I was overreacting and he would help but I don't trust he will because of our first. 
Is there a different way to go about talking to him about it? 
I feel he was super stressed at the time too because he was having issues at work but I still think he could have helped a bit, or at least let me sleep during the day when she was sleeping too. 
I am a stay at home mom and he works part time (he had a work accident so he's temporarily part time) so I should be able to handle taking care of her considering he also does most of the chores around the house because he's a perfectionist and gets grumpy if things aren't done a specific way. 
I do take care of her most of the time, I just feel like having a baby-toddler plus a newborn next year will be way too much and am worried about myself being able to trust that he will take over if I start having issues again.

115,"Hey everyone

So I’m living on a 3rd floor, top floor unit. I moved here from the first floor of another building. I like my apartment, despite the many insects. 

The issue I’m currently having is that my neighbor below me smokes. I used to only smell it faintly in my kitchen during the late evenings. 

Now it appears her car is always here, and I smell it often throughout the day. It’s still the worst at night. I still smell it in my kitchen, and now VERY strongly in my bathroom. It smells like someone smoked a cigarette in my bathroom. It makes me cough. 

I have a 4 month old baby. I’m very adamant about keeping him healthy and safe. I spoke to management, and they suggested air purifiers. Cool... but they don’t remove toxic chemicals from secondhand smoke. They also suggested I ask my neighbor to smoke on her balcony... which I honestly don’t think is my place, nor do I think she’ll agree to it when she’s been smoking indoors for so long. She’s lived here before me. 

What to do? I am my son’s sole parent so he is always with me. I can’t go knocking on her door to speak in person because she never wears a mask lol. Due to the pandemic, I was thinking of taping a note to her door, quickly knocking, and heading back upstairs. I was even thinking of including my phone number so we could discuss?

122,"Let me give some background first, I grew up with very Christian parents. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, however, due to that i had a tad different childhood than most. Spiritually in my family was more based on what media you consumed or what products you bought rather than your true standing with god. Because of this, I never quite knew when I was stepping on a minefield. A standout example is when I was a kid and my parents made me delete all the Star Wars pictures off my phone because they saw Darth Maul and thought he was demonic. Hell, all throughout my life my issues have been boiled down to me consuming “demonic media” rather than genuine and lifelong mental and academic illnesses I’ve struggled with. My issue is is that there was never a clear definition of “demonic” meant so I learned how to be secretive because if I happened to get into something they didn’t like it would be taken from me even if there was nothing morally wrong with it. Moving on to being a teenager, to make a long story short: I was depressed, I was a teenager, I got sent to a Christian rehab facility and spied on.

127,"\*big trigger warning// suicide\*

Hi, 

I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 13. Four years later, about six months ago, they were the worse they had ever been. It got to the point where I was writing suicide notes in math class. I was set to do z partial hospitalization, but due to COVID-19 restrictions and school being out, I never went. 

I recovered well over those six months. I started to feel good- I started developing a style and really doing things that made me happy. 

However, things are kind of weird right now. 

I was driving with my mom and she said something that struck a nerve, and I started thinking about undoing my seatbelt and crashing my car so I would go flying but she would be secure and safe in her seat. I find that this has happened quite a bit as of recent- any emotion I feel (mostly anger and frustration) I immediately want to self destruct. When I calm down I feel fine. I never feel violent towards the other person. Just myself.

The car incident happened today- three days ago I was counting out pills so I could overdose, and last week I put things around my neck to momentarily stop my airway (I don't want to specify what these things are because I don't want to encourage anyone else feeling the same way as me to do something bad). I am afraid one day I will just lose it and kill myself out of sheer impulsivity. 

I have OCD, but these are not the same as the intrusive thoughts I have grown used to- these have actual actions to them (counting out pills, restricting my airflow, etc.).

When I do the suicidal gestures, I'm alone so it's not an outward cry for help.

I don't know what to do- are these bad or dangerous enough to go to a hospital? If not, and I'd rather it be not, what do I do? 

I want to live 90% of the day. It's just these strong emotions make me self destruct. And I'm afraid that 10% will kill me.",15Sep2020,1
129,"So I’m renting a home. The lease goes for the next year. While they didn’t explicitly mention no dogs to me, in the lease the box saying that they agree to animals is not checked.

I didn’t intend to bring a dog. My parents dog had puppies, I was there through the entire process, including when they were all adopted. A few months after they were adopted one of the people who adopted them wanted to give it back. It had broken it’s leg in such a way that it needed to be amputated. They didn’t want a 3 legged dog.

The dog is not of a breed that people would like, he’s kinda ugly (it was an accidental pregnancy), and he has a leg that needs to go which comes with a ton of medical costs and PT. Its a lot of work. With only 3 legs and the breed he is, he’d probably end up being put down. But I love this dog, he’s the cutest thing in the world to me and I know I can give him a good life.

130,"I need advice reddit. I (23F) need advice on how to feel less guilt over moving out and leaving my family behind. I want to have my own apartment and focus on my own life along with my boyfriend (22) but I have my mother who financially relies on me and refuses to work at all. Over the years my mom has become more manipulative and I've been more aware of it since I've started becoming independent. When I got into a relationship and got my own job, my mom began guilt tripping me telling my boyfriend doesn't really love me and that being with him I'm going to start changing in a negative way.
She's also tried giving me a curfew despite the fact that I pay all her bills. She guilt trips me telling she does alot too like cooking and making sure the bills stay low so I have more money in my pocket, despite the fact she's asked me for several things like paying her phone bill and other things I refuse to do. So far I only pay rent light and cable to keep a roof over my head but feel angry that my mom refuses to work at all, claims she's sick and can't work, but I find it hard to believe. My bf was even suspicious that she may even be earning money and not telling me. 
I'm tired of living with this woman. I have my own room and my own space but I'd rather live away from her completely, she's been the source of my stress, insecurities, and suicidal thoughts and hasn't been supportive when I was seeing a therapist before. I have an older sister as well and my mom forced me to try to force my sister to pay for out internet connection and even now I feel like I should've agreed with my sister but felt too manipulated to do so and didn't see how my mom was. I haven't spoken to my older sister in years and don't blame her for not wanting to contact my mom. I feel guilt as well. 
I feel like no matter what I'm going to have to face the drama she causes if I want to move out but my mind is already set.  I'm moving out regardless. 
Redditors, anyone who's had narcassitic parents. How did you deal with them? How did you move away? I know I'm an adult that's capable of moving out but still doubt myself. Is there any advice you can give me that would help? How do I stop having the mindset that somehow my mom and younger sister(14) are my responsibility?",15Sep2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

I am a teenager who gets bored by school really fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of school, I am very curious, talented, and have learned a lot of skills by myself most kids my age normally don't have. These skills have earned me money and got myself very nice things.

However, I struggle to do homework, I get distracted a lot, and it just gets boring. 

Here's the thing:

 I love developing my curiosity.

And school just doesn't do it for me, it tries to teach me things i never use in life, and doesn't feed my curiosity.

There's nothing I have in my room that I have'nt dissassembled or tampered with. As such, I don't need to take my stuff to a technician, I have repaired countless computers, guitars, (or anything else I can tamper with my tools) by myself.

I like to learn how stuff works, mainly so I know how to repair it.

I love my hobbies, I have a natural talent for music, and have been around it all my life.

I am the guy to go to when it comes to computers, and a lot of other stuff too.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have bombarded my brain with dumb ideas such as the typical ""If you don't study, you won't be succesful"" and bla bla bla.

&amp;#x200B;

Easy now.

At 15 years old, I enrolled in a public shool studying as a mechanic (you know, the guys who fix cars).

As I saw and experienced the career in person, I changed my mind.

Work related accidents meant my integrity was in danger at all time, and for me, this is a no-no.

If I sustain an injury, I am worried for my life I will not be able to do many of my daily activities as I normally do, such as playing guitar (which I love), or basically anything else.

Oh, and back problems too, I had enough of em with my dad.

Nowadays I don't really like the school, either. I used to be a private school kinda guy, and I haven't really adapted to the change. It's just weird not having anyone that shares your interests, as they are in a completely different scenario in life. (I'm talking about money and their parents' jobs.)

The school is your typical academically demanding school, which nowadays just implies a fuckton of math, homework, 6 hours or less of sleep, and mental illnesses.

That school just breaks kids, and it's getting to me.

I know I am somewhat smart, seeing as how my cousins applied to the school but all failed.

But my mom is forcing me to study here, anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently interested in studying something related to computers and computer programs, mainly software engineer / dev. 

&amp;#x200B;

However I can't quite change my ""career"", since I flunked some assignments, which I have to study again, thanks to a depressive episode I fear is coming back. I really lack the mental strength to do homework as of now, but I'm usually fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I like nice things.

Nice guitars, nice computers, things that work and that don't generally break when you try to use them.

But I like my time too, and I enjoy my hobbies like no one else.

I see adults and watch as they don't have spare time for nothing but work, and it's just sad.

&amp;#x200B;

 I tried talking to my parents but they grew up differently, you know. This is why I come here.

So, here’s some background. 
I graduated from community college. 
I didn’t go to my own graduation because the rest of my friends graduated university on the same day. 
My boyfriend told me his graduation started at 10am or something (idk exactly at this point) but it was early enough that I could not reasonably graduate &amp; get my diploma and then successfully make my way to their graduation. 
However, we get to the graduation. The graduation doesn’t start until noon which means I could have done them both. I mean I’m kinda pissed at my boyfriend for not reading his emails correctly at this point but, ya know it’s a fun day. I’m calm cuz I know I’ll get a graduation in two years or so ect... plus I still dressed up all fancy &amp; took photos in a cap n gown &amp; took pictures with them. 
BUT NOW 
It is seriously looking like I will not get my own graduation because of covid. I’m trying to not be in a rage about it. I realized yesterday that I’m probably not getting a ceremony. But like, I am mad. It’s dumb to be mad but like... am mad. I am mad at my boyfriend too. 

How do I make my own graduation this summer fun for myself when I’m just going to be kinda disappointed that it’s not a giant ceremony??

My graduation that won’t happen because of covid is something I imagined I could invite all of my asshole family members and nice family members. And to the assholes id get to be like look bitches I went to college all by my own choice with absolute crumbs of help from you assholes. 
It was one of the petty bitch goals of my life lol. I’m not about to hang out with any of them, nice or asshole family, for more than twenty minutes so it’s seriously not like I can throw my own covid illegal outlaw graduation party. 

I really don’t have a group of college friends to celebrate with and well.. to be honest covid isn’t helping with that aspect. 

Do I just ask my boyfriend to make it up to me somehow just me n him??? Like I am not fricking creative y’all and I want to make the best of it even if I’m disappointed!

My only uncertainty is how the future looks for these jobs. How do recessions/depressions and pandemics such as the one we are experiencing now effect the amount of work these guys have. I'm sure it can also very by trade, in that case which skilled trade is always going to have plenty of work? Are there some union trades that will always have work regardless of the shape of the economy? I am also willing to travel state to state if I need to, to find work.

Most of the guys there are dickheads who don't care about me. I'm not good enough for anybody there and am super lonely. All I want from people is for them to tell me ""good job!"" or ""I appreciate you!"" or ""what would we do without you?"" The only place that I get this kind of basic human respect is my job. If I had the choice to just drop out and pursue the management position that they want to give me I would. No one at my school ever cares about me or my feelings, and I genuinely think that if I just disappeared one day or died then none of them would care for too long. No one talked to me over summer break, hardly anyone ever checked up on me or does.

The only place I feel wanted is my job.

The only people I care about or used to care about don't care about me. I've been so lonely.

Any advice from anyone would be appreciated about what I should do. I can't leave my school, nor would I. I try to something right and no one appreciates me or what I do.

144,"Hey guys, I’ve recently undergone a very drastic personality and lifestyle shift. Without going into too much detail I wanna downsize significantly and work/live a much simpler life. Currently I work in IT, I quit college after 2 years because I couldn’t focus on it, my company took me on full time and I’m paid what I would consider well for a young man living back at home temporarily, $21/hr, with benefits like insurance and anything I could need. I don’t have bills, I don’t have debt, and I lived in an apartment for a while but left because I wanted to save for a house, hence why I’m home.

That being said I just don’t at all feel like working this job anymore. It has nothing to do with my vision for the future (not my personal future). I’ve recently felt very compelled to help people and live a different life than I grew up thinking I had to live.

My family wants me to be happy above all but obviously push me to move up in this job and gain more certifications and such. Which I’ve done and gets me more money and success. I’m very well liked at work and regularly get raises and bonuses for my work. I should also mention how easy my job is, I essentially do mostly nothing for most of the time.

All that to say I wanna leave it and I wanna move away. Idk where, be it another country or another state where I fit into the culture better. I’m currently in southern states and I do like it here and love the people but I feel so restricted to Christianity and working in science or computers. I wanna live in a remote area where people leave me alone, with a job that has absolutely not major impact on a companies dollar. I wanna help my community or work a job that just pays my bills. I’ve completely forgone the consumer ideas recently after having embracing them for so long I’m exhausted.

This is very rambley but hopefully someone can provide me direction because it sucks feeling like I wanna leave a job that people would absolutely die to have and it was handed to me.

148,"im honestly so scared to post this because im pretty much putting out my whole childhood onto the internet but i have nothing else to help with this so- heres some backstory (its probably gonna be long but pls read)

when i (13F) was about in grade 3 i started missing out on some school. maybe once or twice a week throughout the year, we had assumed it was because my grandpa had recently passed away who i was very close with so we didnt think much about it and just got some help from the school with my catching up.

the same thing happened in grade 4 and 5, but way more often i just seriously didnt have the motivation to go and i had no clue why my anxiety was horrible and my stomach would always hurt, either actually or because of my anxiety. grade 5 we had a new principal he was absolutely horrible. on some of my bad days i would have horrible panic attacks and refuse to go to school, even though my school is right across the street. (at this point my mom had put me in therapy) one bad day i was having a meltdown and a horrible panic attack outside of the school office and wouldn’t go in. and this motherfucker called the cops. absolutely traumatizing for a 10yr old, the cops forced me in to go to school.

this same year my parents got in trouble with the attendance officer with the school board saying they could literally go to jail for not getting their child an education so this officer was literally saying go to school or else. once again very traumatizing and ALOT of pressure for a 10yr old. things werent going well. most of grade 5 was in my living room. at the end of the year my motivation came back again and i went maybe once or twice a week only for the last month of school.

throughout the summer i saw many many therapists and all sorts of people (none of them helped) ever year the same thing. go for a couple months at the beginning, then everything went downhill and my motivation just gave up. 

grade 6 was even worse though. i had only went for like 2 weeks until this happened again. 2 weeks i was in school, the rest of grade 6 homeschool because my other principal pretty much kicked me out. one time the paramedics showed up at my grandmas house and forcefully took my to the hospital because i said my stomach hurt too much to go to school. once again absolutely horrible for a 11yr old. ontop of that somehow a girl in my grade found out sbout my ‘issues’ and told the whole grade about it. because over these years obviously everyone was confused why i was coming to school only the beginning snd end of year. so thanks taylor &lt;3

grade 7, the same thing but a bit better. this year i didnt start missing school till about christmas break, but after the break i couldn’t go. i had an amazing teacher who helped alot with homework snd getting me back which was amazing i loved her. but still i didnt go back till the end of the year.

grade 8 was... interesting. once again i went st the beginning of a yesr for maybe a month but then around november my therapist told me i had to go to this ‘treatment’ school. not gonna beat around the bush pretty much a school for messed up kids with a fucked education like me. this school was horrible it was so small there was 7 kids in my class and they made us do ‘mindfull activities’ and treated us like we were fragile and like we were in grade 1. i hated it. 
one unfortunate day i was having a bad time getting to this new school still snd when the bus picked me up i refused to get on it. lets just say i caused a long ass line of traffic. unfortunately i had to graduate at that school and not with any of my friends at my old school who i still missed. although it wasnt a very good graduation because of covid. i never made any friends with the kids in that class either i just feel like it was a waste of time.

anyways this year. the big grade 9. high school. i dont think i had been any more nervous about anything else in my whole life than starting high school for so many reasons. i started school literally thursday. its now tuesday. i have school tomorrow morning and im chosing to write this in the middle of the night because i dont know what to do with myself. everyone always tells me high schools important way more important than grade school. if you miss a day it matters. with all that pressure and the trauma from my past is alot of weight on me. i hoped and hoped so much that this year would be different. i did that every year but this one even more. and now its my 4th day tomorrow. FOURTH DAY THATS IT. and my motivation for it is already disappearing. i dont wanna let my family down they all believe in me so much and my friends and all i want is to have a normal high school experience without cops and therapists and pills. speaking of pills. i havent taken my medicine for a while. i experimented over the summer my moods and how i felt being off and on of it. there’s absolutely no difference the pills are doing nothing i feel depressed. im starting to feel suicidal but im not sure yet. im having thoughts not actions. i dont want another repeat of the past 6 years of my life. i know probably no one is gonna have any advice on this but...

CO, USA. I work for a national restaurant  whose corporate offices are in Texas, so they don't give a fuck about the pandemic. Per corporate, we are getting rid of our host stand (we don't have plexiglass either) at the front and the host are now going to only have a ledge behind them for the phone and tablet to check for reservations. Not only does this sound insane because the host are now going to have to turn their back to the customers to check the tablet, but we're in a fucking pandemic! So, now there is about to be no barrier and on busy nights the guest are going to be able to step right up to them.  We already have a problem with guest pulling their masks down and leaning towards the hosts over the stand... especially because our table turn over rate is a lot longer because people are socializing more with friends (totally understandable).

We're worried about our safety and I don't know who to contact. The labor department? The health department? We can see up to 350 people (our restaurant is huge) on a busy Friday and Saturday (and let me tell you, we are seeing these numbers EVERY weekend).

151,"Reading some other people's posts, I (F-16) feel like mine isn't such a big deal but it's been weighing on my mind a lot so screw it. So before the pandemic, both my parents had good, decent paying jobs. A few months ago, the hospital my mom worked at had to let her go (she's a researcher and they needed to redirect funding to help with the pandemic) and now my dad is the only person with a job. Problem is, he doesn't speak English fluently, he's really slow with computers (which is basically all of his job) and is in his mid 60s. Because of this, he has to work 6 or 7 days a week to be able to meet his deadlines. This situation by itself makes me feel awful. He's working all week, 12 hour days, where most people his age are retired and relaxing. To pile on this, we have this apartment that we rent out to someone. Due to some frequent robberies nearby, the person is thinking about moving out (I don't blame them) which would be detrimental for my family. I like to think I'm pretty mature for my age and so does my mom so she's not afraid to speak openly about this stuff in front of me. She also suffers from depression so usually when she needs to vent, I like to let her. Don't get me wrong, she doesn't ""dump"" her problems on me. In a lot of ways, it's my own fault because I'm always asking to be included in family conversations.   My dad is stressed and has been experiencing a lot of physical pain from working so much. My mom has been looking for a job too but it's difficult when you don't speak fluent English (ive been trying to help with that by doing daily english lessons), your older than your competition, and you're a researcher and not someone who can help with the pandemic right now. The past few weeks have been really hard. I feel guilty over having one coffee outside or not getting a job to help (school is starting soon and I don't want to risk giving my dad COVID.) I don't want my mom to feel like she can't talk to me about what's happening, or feel like she needs to lie to give me a false sense of security, but I also don't think knowing all this information when I can't really do anything about it helps me. Should I ask my parents to stop talking about this stuff in front of me? Isn't it worse if I'm left in the dark? Is there anything I'm not thinking of that can help? Anyways I'm sorry if this was all over the place. This is my first post on here. I also realize that, especially now, there are lots of people who must feel the same way as me and that sucks.

152,"TL;DR: Old parents can’t or refuse to care for themselves, put all of the responsibility on me, and I’m cracking under the pressure. Do I continue to help them or walk away?

This isn’t something I expected to be going to internet strangers for advice on, but I really don’t know who else to ask for some completely unbiased thoughts and opinions.

I don’t even really know where to begin, so I’ll try my best to get the important points across. Sorry in advance if this is all over the place or I ramble, but I’m going borderline stream of consciousness here because I’m in a highly emotional and stressed out state right now. Another disclaimer, I know that there are lots of people, millions in fact, who are in a far worse situation than I’m currently in, so I’m fully aware that this might come across as whiny.

I am a 28 year old only son of two Chinese parents who are 72 and 69. Due to some health complications, my dad cannot look after himself due to health issues, primary of which is mobility at the moment, but there are some other things as well. My mom on the other hand can’t drive, is incredibly tech illiterate (more so than my dad), and continues to work 12 hours a day because she refuses to quit/retire. I’ve been paying for a large bulk of their bills (close to $1k a month) for a few years now. Thankfully, I’ve got a well paying, white collar job that’s allowed me to cover for their financial needs while saving for my own future (401K + IRA and savings for a downpayment for a home). However, the job I’m in is honestly quite stressful, and I’ve thought about shifting in some way to a lower paying but less stressful career and/or moving to a lower cost of living area. Unfortunately due to my parents’ situation, I can’t really do that, and our current situation is only making my work even more stressful as I have to take time off and fall behind to look after them.

In addition to my dad’s health issues, the other big problem are my parents’ finances and their housing situation. In the past, my dad had a gambling problem as well as a hoarding problem, so he hemorrhaged money while often being late on payments of various kinds. My mom on the other hand keeps squirreling money away for who knows what and doesn’t pay for their bills (short of food). The home they currently live in is incredibly rundown and unmaintained (broken/leaky toilets, broken garage door, no washer dryer, etc), is a hoarder nest (mostly due to my dad but actually in small part due to my mom as well), and is owned 4 ways between them and 3 other relatives of my mom, one of whom is now pressuring her for their cut of the house so that they can buy a different home where they actually live. 

On top of that, they have one house which has a half million dollar reverse mortgage (due to my dad first losing his job back in 2008, but then also due to the gambling and not making payments on it) which we are now trying to sell. They can’t really live in this home either because it too is rundown and now well maintained, but also because my mom is unable to drive and would not be able to get around in this particular location. There are probably a number of other things that I’m missing, but top of mind, these are the crucial factors in my situation right now.

There’s a lot of conflicted emotions here. On the one hand, I love my parents and hate to see them suffer. I just want them to be stable, self sufficient (self sufficient meaning with assisted care/living if needed), healthy, and happy. My ideal situation is just not to have to worry about their financial and housing situation, and just enjoy time with them without the other worries. At the same time, I’m incredibly resentful of the fact that they’ve basically ignored so many of their financial, parental, and household responsibilities for all these decades only to dump the bag of shit onto my shoulders which I’m not responsible for. I’ve told them for years now to please clean the house and get their finances in order so that I don’t have to worry about it, but they constantly said “Just give us more time” or otherwise deflected or ignored me. 

When my dad’s healthy and mobility issues started to get worse this year, I again urged them to please focus more on taking care of their situation, because at the moment, I’m shouldering all of these burdens, financial and otherwise. Besides just paying for so many of their bills, I’m constantly commuting to and from my parents’ home to help look after my dad (get him food, help him up and down the stairs if he can’t make it, organize his medicine, take him to appointments, buying my parents additional household items like toilet paper, etc). We can’t exactly get a home nurse or other assisted living professional to the house given the hoarding situation. I’m also coordinating the sale of the home which is an hour away from where we live. And of course, as with most people their age, they’re incredibly bad with technology and constantly need me to help them with things like filing government forms online, ordering inspections, etc.

With everything going on, I proposed a plan to my parents:

1. Sell the reverse mortgage house (which we’re thankfully at least in the process of doing) and pay off that relative who’s hounding my parents for their share of the money to the other home
2. Move my parents into an apartment to live, either short term or long term, OR same as above, but move my dad into an assisted living facility instead
3. Hire a hoarding cleanup service to clear out the house
4. Sell the hoarding house
5. Let my parents live off the remaining money (after relatives and banks get their cut) + their social security income for the rest of their lives, with me stepping in if they are truly unable to care for themselves

Besides step 1 to my plan above, they’re resisted or at least dragged their feet on everything else. I feel like I’m at the end of my rope and don’t know what to do anymore. I sometimes feel like my only escapes are to either just abandon them and move away somewhere, or just kill myself. I think deep down, part of me is looking for validation that walking away is morally and socially acceptable, but at the same time, even if it is, I know I wouldn’t be able to stop worrying about them and their well being if I did just walk away. Ultimately, the choice boils down to this: take care of my parents’ needs where they refuse to and delay my hopes for my future indefinitely if not forever, or just let my parents do whatever they want and basically leave them to their own devices because I can’t continue like this forever.

Sorry for the huge wall of text, but I had a lot of things running through my mind as I wrote this. I’m sure I’ve probably left out some details or some things aren’t clear, so to anybody who’s actually made it this far, thank you for reading, and if there’s anything I can clarify or elaborate, please let me know.",15Sep2020,1
153," I have moderately bad acne, it isn't really bad, but it could be better. My brother and my dad had far worse acne and both have scarring from it, and I think they had severe image issues from it that effected their mental health. When I started to get acne both of them were very aggressive to get me to deal with my acne, but I always remembered my brothers being far worse than mine, and secondly, I really didn't and don't care about it. I am a generally confident person and I don't have any issues with the way I look, nor do the people I am around, and I feel very mentally stable about it. However, recently, my mom saw some scarring on my face, and I'm not sure why but her speaking to me about it is really getting to me. With my brother and father I kind of felt they were just picturing themselves on me even though their acne was worse, but my mom's comments have really gotten to me. On one hand I feel that my mom is an objective point of view and maybe I should care about it, but on the other hand, I seriously before this had virtually no issues with my appearance, and neither do any of my friends or girlfriend, and I think she may just be worried that I may regret not doing much about it in the future. idk, advice?",15Sep2020,1

I’m a senior and because I didn’t choose athletics last year, I didn’t really get taught the basics. I was doing a poor job and it doesn’t help that I have an actual game next week, and that I have to practice another sport when volleyball season is over. I do have classmates that support and encourage me, and forgive me because I sound selfish, I feel like it’s not enough to keep me going.

Athletics took up so much of my time and I feel so stressed and anxious that I dread going to school, and yeah I do have moments where I didn’t want to go to school the previous years but this year is different.

i broke up with my boyfriend the second week of july this year. two weeks later i went in for a regular check up and found out he gave me and STI. he had blocked me on everything after we broke up so i ended up having to tell his mom about my results so she could follow up with him. today the second week of september he messages me over facebook and starts accusing me of giving it (the STI) to him and accusing me of telling his friends. when him and i first met we did not have mutual friends and we did not know mutual people because we came from two different parts of the state. i only told his mom because i had no other way of getting through to him and had at that point unadded all his roommates from facebook and hadn’t told anyone else but my close friends who don’t know him. 

i ended up blocking him and telling him to leave me alone. my friend texts me a screenshot and the photo she sends me is him telling her that i’m a liar and full of it and just goes on about how i’m this terrible person. he goes on to tell her that if she wants the “truth” to feel free to ask him. 

my question for you is that if he is sending these things to my friend that aren’t true is that considered slander or harassment? i just want to know if there’s anything i can do legally if he continues to spread lies about me because i support myself and this isn’t the kind of drama i want my job finding out about. it’s embarrassing and frankly childish and i upset at how this is being handled and don’t need this to bleed into my professional life.

168,"So in this story there are 2 people we will call them T(50f) and Z(25f) I'm (27m)

I met Z through T, were all coworkers and worked in the same area together. Now T is one of the smarter coworkers and when we worked together we could take control of a situation figure out the best solution. Turns out shes a gamer and she got some of the other people in our area to play a game with her, Z was one of those people. I ended up joining the little group, bought the game and played with them, group texts were set up and I ended up with Zs number. I ended up shooting her a text she if she wanted to play, from there we started texting and playing and got close. 

She deals with depression and other mental health issues, got her to open up and she told me and I was able to talk her into speaking up at her next dr appointment and she started going to therapy. 

At one point Z gets hurt and goes on leave for a few weeks and in that time she changed, I'm not saying she was wrong, she started calling me out on my shit, I complained about something and she reply in a bad tone and shut me up. It was weird, I asked another coworker about it and eventually he tells T and she texts me about how I made Z worse and that I'm too negative and so and so. After that text I stopped hanging around the group.

Eventually I text Z see if we can talk and she goes off on me, tells me essentially the same thing that T said. I felt like she got into Zs head and I felt... idk, disappointed? Hurt? I'm not entirely sure what I felt but I just said whatever and left it be and walked away.

A few months of not a text or a hello or a glance at each other Z is texting me again. I know shes alone, I know shes scared and wants/needs someone to talk to. I was able to let go and walk away, I'm deal long with my own mental issues and it's hard. I've kept my replying to a bare minimum, and eventually she apologized for how things ended, she realized that it wasnt right how things went down when we stopped talking, but... idk the apology felt empty to me? Her having said she was sorry didnt satisfy? I dont feel the apology did was it was supposed to?

What do I do? I feel bad if I just cut her off but I dont know if I can go back to what we were. I dont know if I'm capable of balancing my own issues and being there for her. I'm not entirely sure if I can be the friend she wants/needs right now",15Sep2020,1

So yea like. That sucks and my problems really don't compare to hers. Like that's rough af man. So thats why I feel like I should not be complaining. I got life pretty good compared to other people.

So yea to get to what I was saying. I have debt issues. Like I don't have debt but I can't stand debt. I'm still in university. The idea of being in debt makes me feel uncomfortable and slightly scared.

(The country supports free tertiary education for undergraduate degrees for struggling households so no I don't have any student loan debt if you wondering)

I am not an expensive person tbh. I dont care for much things. New fancy car? Fuck it. Top range smartphone? Fuck that too. I just want a decent 1 or 2 bedroom apartment. And amazing ass food. Going all out on boujee ingredients.

Like I am not an expensive person right. But I stress so much about finances. Like I have this pressure on myself to earn a shit ton of money but I don't know why. I am not an expensive person. I want to cram the investment accounts.

I am a 2nd year and I am putting a lot of pressure to find a job and earn some money. I need R60k (4500$) for my 4th year which is my honours year for residence. (Next year I can become a tutor and the university will pay off my tuition fees)

Anyways. I got this pressure to make so much. To find a job. To always be productive. To do a project when I have time.

And damn. It sucks man. Like I need to grind every working hour. I kind of want to do that but finding remote part time jobs as somebody who is still doing their undergraduate sucks.

Idk. Compared to other people I am doing pretty good. I got R11k in the bank so far earing some intrest. No debt. So why am I feeling like I am so behind in life. That I need to accomplish so much.

172,"The cluster diagnosis affects less than 2% of the population if you don't include comorbid disorders. Everyone you meet, 98% of the time it's just their personality. Cluster B people have differences in their brain. 

People are obsessed with putting my parents and (recently me) into cluster diagnosis cause they didn't expect that I would make fertilizers out of their rancid mooching asses. 

My mother and dad are very generous. Usually I'm grateful if someone does something for me, but these people just resent us cause we are better, we never faced a single problem in our life cause we use our heads and work hard rather than mooch and shit on opportunities on others and borrow stuff from people to cope. 

These people will never accomplish anything for the most part in their lives. Even when they do, their genes are so parasitic it is going a uphill battle against your own conditioning. They are already shitting and mooching off their own families since they were born. It's not just me. 

My parents are the most ethical people I've ever met. I'm not saying this cause they are my parents. I'm definitely the more evil one out of them. However, since I'm sweet to everyone, I get the perfect selfless card instead of my parents cause my parents are exponentially better off than them and have a much better attitude.

179,"My father is fifty and has suffered from bi-polar and depression for most of his life along with addiction. 

About 10 years ago he completely reinvented himself, got into JCP&amp;L, and became a lineman after a few years of school and apprenticing. 

Flash forward a few years, he fell into a spout of depression and addiction again abusing pills and smoking weed on the job. He had been put on the over night shift for over a year and his health and mental health were deteriorating. 

One night while on the job, he fell asleep at the wheel and crashed a work vehicle into a parked car. They drug tested him and found pot in his system. After this incident, JCP&amp;L fired him. 

It has been almost two years now and he’s been unemployed since that day. I have admitted him to the hospital twice for making suicide threats and every time they put him in an out patient facility that he checks himself out of a week later. It has been about 6 months since the last time I did this. The last doctor he had was also giving him a bottle of over 30 Xanax every month and he would finish the bottle in about 3-5 days. 

He was in another accident shortly after being fired where he crashed into another parked car and destroyed his own vehicle. 

He hasn’t showered in almost 5 months. His teeth are falling out. He only leaves his living room couch to use the bathroom and he hasn’t left the house since before the Covid-19  outbreak. He currently is not on any medication other than Suboxone. 

I don’t know what I can do to get him the proper care that he needs. I believe that he is past the point of waiting for him to want help. He needs forced care in order to get back out of this severe depression and needs to be properly medicated again.

I just want to bring back the loving good hearted father that I did have before he succumbed to his mental illness. He never let it fully bring him down and always pushed through and fought his hardest. 

We are from NJ and he does not have health care. 

If anyone has any advice for me, I would greatly appreciate the help.

183,"This is multi-layered. Parents sent me overseas to obtain qualification. Goal was for me to immigrate there. I finally get said qualification in foreign country. Never did anything much with life other than studying because I wasn't allowed to. By the time I went to university, the mental programming still stuck + I was so depressed I am amazed I am still alive now. Cut to present: Got said qualification and license to practise, but I was terribly unconfident, and had no idea how to sell myself because I feel worthless, and that's garnered by decades of conditioning that you ain't shit unless you get better grades that you would understand with hindsight 20/20 on your Asian parent's parenting style. I didn't believe in myself. My parents got more and more nasty with every phonecall. I had to starve myself to survive on meager meals and they don't know. You would think that starving would legit ""slap you awake"" from whatever silly depression you're suffering from, but nope? Still catatonically depressed. This went on on-and-off for about 2 years (I did Corona living conditions before it was cool) of unemployment and Visa's almost expired, I'm in debt to my landlord, I've cut voice contact with my parents for about a year because they just won't stop and won't acknowledge that they're hurting me. I wish words were as impactful as they are visible. I thought I could power through this. Now at this position, I found that I could not. I tried. My previous cover letters were all too much of fucking pleading trash pieces for a professional position; made me cringe, but that's just inevitable how I was then. Now I can write better cover letters and be more confident because I had to be my own therapist during those catatonic times and ""think"" my way out of this (to various degrees of success), and finally realized that I've been surrounded by people who were emotionally destructive to me all my life. The worst part is that they think they're doing me a service. It's surreal to me even now to think that I had to stop the phonecalls so that they'll just STOP. 

Their voices stopped, but their criticisms never stopped in my head.

Now Visa's coming to an end and I feel trapped; even in my survival mode, I know I don't want to go back. So far all I can afford is rent and food and mandatory insurance because my parents sent in money and that makes me feel so fucking bad, there is no expression I can come up with to tell you how entitled that makes me look and how embarrassed I am that they still need to feed me. I had to fight my head's intrusive thoughts every single day before I can even get up in the morning and I know it doesn't matter to the problem at hand, which is Visa expiring, no one employing, and I'm going back to the emotionally abusive environment that I fought so hard in my catatonia to cut off. With pathetic success, but again, I tried. I wish I can tell you how financially supportive =/= emotionally supportive and it fucks with your head and you excuse and rationalize their behavior that makes you want to off yourself. If I go back, there's no hope of moving out because of the virus now and the value of my home country's currency is turning more and more into piss as the days go by due to government money. 

I don't know what advice I want to ask, but feel free for some insights. I'm writing a certain type of style I almost never write in, because it's raw, and my lame attempts to be funny is mostly for myself and for me to cope. Part of me feels like I tried harder than anyone could ever fathom, but the more convincing part of me feels like I've utterly failed. I'm not demanding that people give me a job, but can't I just get a freaking break.

Funniest part is that they still think I'm just being lazy and livin' it large on their money.

I think I'm angry. I don't know why. 

Just... any advice.",15Sep2020,1
184,"I’m in chemistry 12 this year and last year I did honours chemistry 11 so I have a bit of knowledge of the grade 12 content. My current teacher highlights everything in her book and expects everyone else to do the same, even if there is only one sentence in a paragraph she will circle it, she literally has 8 different high lighters so she can colour match different subjects. Today we were going over some reading in our textbooks that we were supposed to have already read at home and answer questions on, during the middle of her teaching the pages we already read she stopped teaching because she saw me not taking notes or highlighting. She walked over and started to call me out saying that I need to take notes and that if I wanted to do good and get 90% or higher you needed to take notes and if I did what I was doing I would get 80%, she was on a real power trip and my parents feel I should just highlight everything so that she will be nice to me and not mark me down because she doesn’t like me, I think I should not do any notes at all and do amazing on the first test just to show her how wrong she is. I feel if I just start doing the notes she will have won, she will know if she wants me or anyone else to do what she wants she just has to get mad at them once and they will do whatever she says.

185,"Hello! It's my first time posting on this sub so I'm sorry if this question isn't suited for it or if my formatting is a bit off. 

I'm currently working at my second job ever. It's at a library and my main duty is sorting and shelving books. I love the work and the work environment, especially compared to my old job which was very fast paced. However, the pay and hours are pretty low and there's no real room to move up. So, I'm considering quitting and going back to my old job, which pays better. 

My issue is, I've never quit before. My last job had an attendance policy and I ended up going over so I was fired. I want to give notice and do it politely because I love this job, but I've never done it before. Should I write an email to my supervisor? Print a letter out and leave it in her mailbox? 

I'm also not sure what to say or what I need to say in it. Any advice would be helpful.",15Sep2020,1
186,"Yeah I know that’s bad, but hear me out.

If I get even slightly frustrated about anything I feel the need to complain about it to someone. Almost every day I’m contacting my friends crying about something or angry about something. I feel like a burden because it’s all extremely trivial too. No one else I know complains and cries about life as much as me. It’s healthy to share, but I feel toxic because of the immense amount that I share.

Are there any tips to handle things myself? To be stronger?",15Sep2020,1
187,"My mom has a friend that has some 3 kids, the oldest is currently 16ish? My mom has known them since the oldest was in elementary, so I’ve known them before I even moved out with my now husband. 

Idk what the kids life is like at home, he said he doesn’t want to live there anymore and has thought about petitioning for emancipation for a few years at least. He’s “friends” with my teenage brother just because they’re close to the same age, kid has stayed over at my parents house a lot, he would sometimes stay over the weekend, and also on most days he was off of school, which btw his family moved to another city a few years ago. He eventually started calling my mom and dad “mom and dad”. I think at some point he said his mom wanted to kick him out or something?

My family is toxic, including my other siblings and there’s other health concerns (abuse isn’t an issue) why kids shouldn’t be in my parents home. For school this year he’s been living with my parents, working here in this city, and idk if he’s been going to school or not. 

He recently called my husband, I assume because they’re both guys he trusts him and confides in him more than me. He said that his mom told him to go back home, he can’t stay with my parents anymore, so he probably had to quit his job too and idk what’s going on with school whether he was enrolled here in this city, or where his mom lives.

This kid is super nice and surprisingly well mannered. Me and my husband have always told him that we enjoy having him around because he’s such a good kid and we don’t want him to change. We both agree that we want to help him in anyway we can because we really care about him and for whatever reason he doesn’t want to live with his mom and he really shouldn’t be staying anywhere near my family. We would allow him to live with us and take care of him if we are able to. Idk about the process for petitioning for emancipation or anything about that.",15Sep2020,1
189,"I’ve had multiple jobs. For reference, I’m 19. Without both parents, I’ve had to contribute to bills and expenses for me and my grandmother since I was 14 and started working. (Not bitter, grateful that she took me in as a baby.) 
My first job was at a Greek restaurant. I got a second job at a pizza place to help with bills. I also got a season retail job that was only 3 months to help with Christmas. 
I had the two restaurant jobs for awhile. The Greek restaurant I worked at for about three years, it was sold my junior year, and the pizza place I worked at for 9 months. 
When I started college, I needed more money, per usual. I began to work at a pediatricians office who said it was fine that I couldn’t work 2 out of the 5 weekdays due to classes. That slowly became an issue, as there were only three medical assistants including me, who is uncertified and not allowed to work alone in the office. I also got another season retail job around Christmas time of my Freshman year of college to help with presents. I left the pediatrician because I didn’t have the availability they needed and couldn’t deal with the guilt tripping and scolding anymore. 
Now, I work at a bar where I serve. I’ve been there almost a year, and have to get a second job once again. It’s been really bad money since COVID. I’m really insecure with myself over it. Not even about needing money, but about being a job hopper, essentially. I’m in my second year of college and have to pay for some medical bills for my grandmother, more specifically a CNA home healthcare woman that her insurance won’t cover. 
Basically, I feel like I’ve always left jobs for reasons that aren’t valid. Money isn’t everything. But with me getting a second job, my availability at the current job I’m working at will be shortened. I just don’t want to make any one of my bosses upset. I would only be able to work one day a week at the bar and would devote my time to my second job because it just simply pays so much more. 
I’m only 19, and I feel like I’ve failed at everything with every job I’ve had simply because I left. I don’t want to leave the bar, and I want to have the new second job as well. It’s stressing me out because I don’t want to quit another job. :(( 

Please give me advice if you have the time!",15Sep2020,1
190,"21(M) In a deep depressive state due to being unable to choose what I want to do with myself. I like many different things (will list below the ones that I can think of), and am passionate (I think?) about all of them. But seeing as doing lots of things at once is not viable to make a living out of, I have to choose one, maybe two if I'm lucky, and the choice is impossible to make. I know I could be like ""what makes the most money? \*clickity clack\* oh here it is!"" but I hate that, I want to do things just because it's neat. Onto the list:

\- Mapmaking (I am currently working on an alternate map of the world that fixes ""mistakes"")  
\- Photoshop Designing (Designing logos, electronic Bob Ross, etc)  
\- Video Game Design (notebook full of game concepts)  
\- Astronomy (since childhood been fascinated with space)  
\- Painting (haven't done it in a while, but it's what started my art passion)  
\- Retro Music Collection (and maybe retro music production? not so sure)  
\- Fl Studio (aka beat making)  
\- Photography (landscape photography to be precise, though perspective photography is neat and related)

 I had a nasty break up with my ex a while ago now. I’ve been starting to move on. I’ve gone on a few dates with some girls with no dice or connection. Ive started being attracted to a girl that I’ve hung out with through friends a lot lately. We have gone out jus the two of us recently and have had a lot of fun. We have a lot in common. She’s super nice and sweet. Very attractive. Prolly a little out of my league to be honest. She’s got her shit together. Which I like. I don’t know how to approach it. I’m afraid of ruining the group of friends or making things awkward by saying something. But it’s come to the point where I’m not interested in hanging out with other girls or going on dates with other girls. I passed up almost a sure fire hook up with another girl to hangout and watch the Dallas star NHL playoff game with her.

 I really like this girl, but have no clue how to approach it. I haven’t got crazy vibes she’s interested or I’d make a move. I feel like she’d be somewhat interested if she’s wanted to hangout as much just the two of us...Any advice would help",15Sep2020,1
193,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this... I don't think I'm looking for advice but somewhere to vent off because I can't talk about this to anyone.

My dad used to work in another city and used to come back about one weekend in a month, when I was 7 my mother had a miscarriage and became really depressed. She cut off from all friends and family. Those few years were horrible, I was always locked up in my room whenever I was home. I had no one to talk to at home and no friends at school, because my hair were always messy, my uniform was never ironed, shoes were never polished.

I was really angry with everyone, I even hit a kid with a geometry box and was suspended. My father was told and he just changed my school. I used to insult and harass everyone at any chance I could get. I started playing volleyball and football, I didn't made any friends there but the team used to tolerate me.

Then my mother joined a church club with other woman and she improved quite a bit. She still didn't talk to me much, but she stopped locking me up and looked happier.

When I was about 14 my little sister was born, my mother was really happy after that.. My parents were told by a coach to get me to therapy for my anger.. I went their and it helped. I still was an asshole but I started staying quite instead of insulting others.

When I was 19 I got admitted to a university out of our city and moved to a hostel. No one here knew I had been to therapy or anything else so I felt alot better and made friends, was in the soccer team. I had to move back due to my house quarantine for 6 months after 2 years of being away for most of the time and I saw just how different my sister was being treated. My father was home, even when his work started he used to call often and spent a lot of time talking to my sister. My mother still doesn't talk much to me but she spends alot of time with her.

I started to think this was because my mother always wanted a daughter and not a son, I also noticed that since I'm being having such thoughts I'm getting more and more pissed off at things I shouldn't be angry at. It didn't help that during these 6 months at home I didn't have any friend in my city and I haven't played football for so long. When I returned home I used to play alot of board games with my sister but recently I just keep refusing her because I feel I'll just get more angry.",15Sep2020,1

We’re both 18 and I go to college in Chicago, so naturally I asked him if he was attending university as well. He told me he’s also a freshman and is taking online classes at UChicago. Since I was under the impression that we were both undergrads, I was eager to get to know him and possibly consider a serious relationship. He always talks about wanting to visit me, so I decided to search his other social media accounts just out of curiosity. When I finally found his Instagram, I discovered that he’s actually a senior in high school. Age isn’t necessarily an issue since we are both legal, so would he lie about going to university?

I was also talking to a different girl, ill call her A, whom I had no feelings for (I did not flirt with her in any way.) In hindsight, perhaps arrogant of me, I believe A liked me. B turned down my offer. A, after hearing about the romantic gesture, stopped talking to me, and skipped grad aswell, she is quite shy but I dont think it would stop her from going to grad. This was 2 years ago now, and looking back I must have hurt her, I realized this last year but chickened out of apologizing, as she doesnt use social media, so the only way to get in touch is to go to her house (she lives 2 minutes away from me.) Now she goes to a different highschool than me, and she has a new life which I dont have the slight clue about, so I dont know if I should bring up those bad memories. I do want to start talking to her, as selfish as that is, because she was an amazing friend. To clarify, its not something that constantly weighs down on my conscience, but I feel like she deserves an apology.

I am having the same issues and our other roommate Lucas (21 M) is never home because he can’t stand to be here either. I have no where else to go in my town, I don’t have anyone I can crash with like Lucas does, so I feel anxious and depressed the entire time I’m home. Sarah and Ryan made the house very much THEIR space, so when Lucas and I moved in we felt as if we were intruding. This feeling hasn’t gone away.

I have decided to move out and sublease from another person in my town, but how do I tell Sarah? 

I’m nervous that she is going to take my stuff when I’m not home or retaliate in some way, so I’ve thought about just up and leaving when she’s not there and telling her after? Though some people think I owe it to her and should tell her.

210,"I’m super disgusted. Today my mom put a new tube of toothpaste in the bathroom. It was a brand we have never gotten before but what really sketched me out was the fact it has very clearly been used and there are what I think are the initials “PA” on the top of it. My mom works in a nursing home. I’m afraid she has been bringing home peoples toothpaste that have either died or left the facility but forgot their toothpaste- or something along these lines. 

This isn’t the first random tube of toothpaste either. Last month it was a medium travel sized-ish one. I assumed it was one that she might’ve bought but never ended up using it so I actually used it. And a few months ago another random brand appeared in the bathroom, I assumed it was from some Ipsy bag or something. 

She isn’t poor so I don’t understand why she does this????? I also have a stockpile of brand new toothpaste I have bought that she’s never wanted to use. SO WHY ARE YOU TAKING FROM WORK?

I asked her about the “PA” tooth paste and she got really angry and defensive saying “she doesn’t know how it got there.” I even tried to get an answer by saying no one in the house would just random letters on toothpaste that magically appeared in the bathroom. She responded by trying to avoid the topic and shifting uncomfortable (the way she does when she’s lying) 


She has had most of her teeth pulled and has dentures because she never takes care of them/or brushes them. I think this may be why she is okay with putting random tooth paste and doesn’t see how gross it is? Because she’s not the one using it. I’m not being dramatic right? This is so gross especially with a global pandemic going on. 


I want to get an answer out of her but I’m not sure how to press without her blowing up on me for asking?  I’m not stretching either right? I’ll I need some confirmation because this is so weird I don’t even know how to feel.

i can’t focus on school anymore because my mom has people over from as early as 2:15 pm (my school ends at 3:25). now i have my cousins crowded around my zoom calls and whatnot. everyone stays SO late and when i try to leave the party, my mom threatens to take my phone or something. it’s as if i have to be there for every second so i can’t do homework unless i stay up late. 

what’s even worse is i’m losing contact with my friends because of these goddamn parties. i can’t hang out with them anymore because according to my mom, ""family comes first"". there’s this local hangout spot that i used to spend hours at with all my friends, but now i’m limited to 30 minutes if even that. just to make sure i’m home in time for the parties. it’s getting ridiculous. 

i’m so sick of them and my mom plans on doing them ALL YEAR. it’s going to drive me insane! i’ve already voiced my concerns but she just gets mad and thinks i just want to be with my friends and that i don’t care about family (which isn’t true, but she always uses that excuse).

i’m not sure what to tell her to get these to end, but i actually want to focus on school and i’d rather not lose all my friends just for some family get together. someone please help!",15Sep2020,1

215,I was with this girl and I really liked her but we had to break up because of her parents. I told her I would wait around for her.  After we split I was very hurt and started doing some stupid stuff. I hurt my best friend and I got in a couple relationships I wasn’t ready for after I told her I would wait for her. it hurt her pretty bad. I started dating another girl and it lasted ten months but it was a verryyy toxic relationship. I was just really insecure and thought it was what I wanted. I broke up with her and immediately started to feel better. I started to think about the first girl again. I started talking to her again and I still really really like her. It almost feels like I never stopped liking her but I just pushed it down and ignored it. Recently I told the first girl that I still like her and she told me she didn’t like me that way anymore. We still talked but it was super hard for me. Eventually I started talking about all the stuff I regret doing and how sucky my life had been that year. She was super understanding. I apologized for hurting her and all that and she forgave me. I told her I felt so bad cuz I thought I blew my chances with her. She told me I didn’t. I still had a chance and I was super excited. We kept talking and I made her laugh and my life was actually going really good. She still wasn’t allowed to date cuz of her parents and she was still tryna figure out if she even likes me that way and ig that was stressing her out. I kept getting super mixed signals. We talked about it tonight and she told me that she thinks I should stop chasing her. She said she didn’t know how long it would be until she could be with me or even be ready for a relationship. I told her I don’t care how long I have to wait as long as I have a chance. She seems to appreciate it but idk what I should do from here. Do I back off and give her space or what? I don’t wanna mess is it up or come off too strong or anything like that. I’m just really nervous. What should I do? How should I handle this?,15Sep2020,1
216,"For the longest time I've wanted to be good at drawing, I'd love a career as a concept artist and when I was a kid I used to draw literally ALL the time

I got sick for a few years so was unable to draw but I've been good the last few years, I've bought a few graphics tablets in that time, art supplies etc but when I come to the point of wanting to watch videos on how to improve at drawing I just distract myself on purpose

It's not that I don't want to be good at drawing, I really do and always have, but when I think about how long it'll take to be good enough to even consider making a career out of it and how much work it'll take I just distract myself and spend 12+ hours playing video games I hate but am good at just to avoid having to spend a lot of time on something I'm not already good at and have to work on

Discipline is something I severely lack in many aspects of my life, is there any advice anyone can give to help me overcome this, I've wasted years of my life doing nothing but playing video games when I could have spent that time more practically but just force myself to avoid anything practical whenever I get to it",15Sep2020,1

223,It’s a long story but basically we were all doing a study zoom. I’ll call my best friend A. So A was with us but he was the only one with his camera on. He was also not in the groupchat with my friends. In this groupchat they were saying stuff about him like joking but it would sound bad if he heard. It was because the zoom was awkward and he was just doing his best to lead it. His gf is also in this groupchat. He asks me if they were insulting him so I send screenshots. For example he had his camera off so one guy joked he was jacking off when he saw his gf. Now he is mad at his gf Bc she didn’t do anything to stop it and they may break up and he is mad the other people were teasing him behind his back. Should I have done nothing? The teasing was normal for the group although it was weird bc A didn’t know them.

224,"Around February I started wearing masks and I asked my friend (we’re also roommates) to wear one too when we go out but she always said it’s too hot and uncomfortable and only after I asked a second time why not, did she very grumpily put it on to stop me from “nagging”.

Everytime afterwards when we went out I only asked her one time if she wanted a mask (since I had a bunch of disposable ones) and if she said no I didn’t ask again. After it became recommended for everyone to wear a mask, she start wearing one without calling me naggy.

So a few days ago we went to Costco and got some food afterwards. I used hand sanitizer before I touched the food and offered her some but she refused. We each got a hot dog so I picked up the food and she grabbed the drink cups and condiments. But she was touching the inside of the cup and lid with her fingers. So I just asked her why she didn’t want to use hand sanitizer and that I didn’t want the drink cup anymore. She just started getting defensive and saying “then don’t drink it” and that I nag too much. 

She’s not an anti-masker or anything but I definitely don’t think she’s taking it that seriously. She’s the type of person until it affects her personally it’s not that big of a deal.

I have asked her about wearing a mask, washing or sanitizing hands, to not touch everything in the store, and that it’s not the best idea to hang around a large group of people or crowd. But apparently to her that’s nagging.

Am I overreacting and taking it too seriously? Am in the wrong here? If I’m not how can I approach this topic in the future from now on. Any mention of masks, sanitizer, washing hands or anything covid related from me is now nagging to her, so I don’t know what to do.

231,"I know this is going to seem like the stupidest thing to ask advice on, but I am the least confrontational person ever and I have no idea how to speak up for myself, so I am asking.

My parents have a very small cleaning service clean their house once every 3-4 weeks. We live in the same neighborhood, and my parents offered to pay for the cleaners to clean our house on the same day theirs is cleaned. They first offered when my child was a young baby, and I was so grateful because I hadn't had the energy to clean my house in awhile. Now, several months later, I have more energy to clean, but my husband is very ill and he has his own bathroom and never cleans it, and I don't want to even go in there, so I never clean his bathroom. It's nice to have a cleaning service come in and clean things that I don't get to very often (like cleaning our shutters and the shower floor, and my husband's bathroom).

I had noticed this before, but have noticed lately in particular, and my husband has even brought it up, that our house actually seems dirtier in some places after the cleaners come. It seems like they are reusing the same rags to clean multiple places in the house, or even using the same rags for multiple houses, and just spreading debris all over instead of actually cleaning. I have seen people's hair that is not my family's hair in sinks and tubs after they've cleaned, and the last time they cleaned my bathtub had what looked like dirt in it that was not there before, and my husband said his sink was streaked with dirt. My toddler's feet turn black by the end of the day after they mop our kitchen floor. I own a steam mop and usually steam mop 2-3 times per week, and even after 2 or 3 days this never happens, except after the cleaners come. I am usually watching the toddler while they clean the house, so I don't watch them too closely, but from what I've seen they don't do a great job in the kitchen with sweeping and mopping. It always seems like they start mopping without fully sweeping first, and just barely mop, almost like spot cleaning instead of fully mopping. In any case, they're really just spreading dirt around instead of cleaning, and many times I actually feel like my house is dirtier after they come, even if I haven't cleaned a lot myself several days beforehand.

They have asked us before to be completely transparent with them and tell them if we have any concerns about their cleaning. But I'm not sure how to bring this up, because I feel like it's going to get really awkward, even if I try to do it tactfully.

Should I bring this up to them? Should I just tell my parents to have them stop cleaning our house, and then have to explain everything to my parents and also know that my husband's bathroom will never be clean? Should I bring up the concerns to my parents and let them handle it since they're the ones paying?",15Sep2020,1

233,"I’m in highschool and I just started 10th grade, and my friend group is a mess. I’m in the gamer friend group, but everybody is kinda mean. We all make fun of each other, but I always feel like I get the short end of the stick. I tried running a dnd campaign, and basically they liked playing but still called it shit as a “joke” but it is really just an excuse for being mean. I have only one friend who I can have real deep conversations with, and even that is only when everybody else is gone, because guys can’t appear vulnerable in front of their friends. Here is the rundown of the group.

A-funny, all around average, stupid, kinda mean
Me-the smart but fat one that gives good advice, mean around the boys
B-the carry in games, toxic and kinda mean
C- good person, I can genuinely have a conversation with, but mean when everybody else is around. I met c through A and i think I will end up very good friends with C.

My issue is that everybody seems to be mean, A was labeled “dumb cunt” for a year, B was “highschool dropout” and c was “fuckboy” I was labeled “fat cunt” I got the short end of the stick. I have been struggling with my weight/self image my entire life. The rest of the nicknames were choices, b chose to drop out, c decided to dress like a hype beast, and a was only labeled stupid because he is the dumbest of the group, but by no means stupid. It was like having my weakness pinpointed and attacked without the, even knowing. And even playing games, if somebody dies, there will inevitably be a “dogshit” or a “you suck” and there is never any real positivity. I would bring it up with them, but I would be labeled a pussy.

I wanted to talk to him more just to get to know him better so i added his snap and we made small talk for about four snaps.

I was like okay whatever it’s just snapchat not a big deal and his snap score didnt change either meaning i knew he wasn’t purposely ignoring just me. 

However today when he snapped me and i snapped back, his snap score kept increasing meaning he was purposely not opening my snap. I want to get to know him better (not w any intentions of dating him i genuinely just wanna know the guy) but I can’t do that w the current sc situation.

So I (a gay male) have had a crush on my best friend victor (male) for about some time now. We knew each other since elementary school about 10 years ago. We were and still are really good friends. Just recently though, after coming out as gay to my parents, other friends and him, I started to have some feelings towards him, romantic feelings. I’m starting to fall in love with him. 

After we both graduated from high school last year, we haven’t really saw each other in person much, we text on Instagram pretty often. 

The thing that keeps me from confessing my to feelings to him is that I think he’s straight. As far as I know, he doesn’t have a girlfriend. I’m afraid that if I were to confess my feelings towards him, I don’t want to ruin our friendship.

244,"Starting around fifth grade I was starting to be with other girls and expand my friend group. Before this, I was just a quiet kid who had really good grades, a few friends, and I kept to myself. When I started expanding my social life always had the impression that some of my relationships weren't fully genuine. 

One of the main benefits of having a partner/friends is that you have someone to talk to and listen to your problems. However, a lot of my friends back then (and still up to now) would gossip and blab to others to earn brownie points with the ""popular kids""; this would tick me off. No one could keep secrets.

""Did you know that OP hates so and so?""

""Hey girl, you know once OP had a crush on so-and-so, but now he likes \_\_\_?"" ""OMG, really?""

It took me a while but I eventually cut off the unhealthy relationships, or at least I stopped trusting said people. I've always been a very forgiving and trusting person, so truly hating someone has never been my style.  

Nowadays, I try not to open up because when I trust someone I never know whether they will have respect for me and my privacy. I mostly hang out with people who are older than me. Combine that with my significantly higher intelligence than people my age (13), I consider myself to be more mature than my peers. I tend to expect most people to follow my moral compass, which is having decent respect for others and following unwritten rules among others. 

I'm scared to even love someone because then I would feel the need to tell someone, which could screw me up all over again. There's a new girl in my year who just joined, she's already giving off subtle hints she likes me, and I'm her closest friend in school so far. I'm not a hundred percent sure that she likes me, or even if I like her. 

Regarding life, my parents have always been the stereotypical traditional Asian parents who seemingly care for my well-being, but push me to be a lawyer, doctor, computer science, engineer etc. My parents are strict and the boundaries they set are far smaller than the ones my friends' parents set for them, and likewise with their expectations being much higher. I feel very pressured to do well in life, as they have always stressed how important it is to go to a good uni, get good grades, and be financially stable.

I have an idol, his name is Stewie2K (look him up), who was someone like me, but he overcame issues with his parents and defied all odds to pursue his dream. I wish I was like him, however I don't have insane talent or opportunities. I set my goal somewhere more realistic, of going somewhere in the technology industry. I'm worried I don't have the work ethic or the responsibility to go anywhere in live. In terms of academics, I have a lot of talent and knowledge however I don't put in any work.

249,"I’m not sure where to start. I don’t want to babble about my life story so let me break it down as much as I can on. 

Please don’t comment therapy and medication. 

1) I acknowledge I have depression. I’m functioning for work but I usually don’t want to do anything but sleep. I try to exercise 2-3x a week. 

2) To cope with self worth I looked for relationships. I recognize I validate myself through others. I been out of a relationship for 5 months and haven’t looked for a new one because I realized my problem. Also, what happened during the last relationship just makes me not want to try. 

3) I have few friends. They’re not always there but the occasional text and phone calls make me feel like I’m not completely alone. 

4) I still obsess over my past relationship. I finally admitted my feelings and accepted that I don’t want to let go cause I still have feelings for them and somehow makes me feel less lonely being able to obsess over them. 


If anyone can give me solid advice. I would really appreciate it. just feel so helpless and useless.",15Sep2020,1
250,"I’m a 21(f) and yesterday was my first day at a well known retail store that I was excited for. Throughout the day I began to realize how stressful and challenging it is to work there. I tried giving it a chance but It’s so overwhelming that I started to feel VERY anxious and scared. I felt nauseous and a tight feeling in my throat and chest after working one day there. I have never felt this anxious about anything before and this isn’t my first job either. Every time I think about the store I start sweating like crazy and begin to panic. I’m so terrified I couldn’t study for a big test that I have in one of my classes in college. 

Thinking about this store makes me feel sick and I don’t want it to affect my mental health. I also don’t want to let down my parents who were also so excited for me to get this job. I don’t know if I can’t take other day of working there. 

What should I do?",15Sep2020,1
251,"One of the primary reasons I'm upset it's because my parents (especially my dad) have never been the party-kind, and now all of a sudden is parties every weekend. It all started with this guy that recently moved in to the neighborhood and my dad's entranced with him because he's a musician like him. I normally wouldn't be upset at my parents for having friends, but since I live in a place where covid cases are still pretty high, I'm worried sick for my parents. I'm a student at the moment and I don't have a job, so if either one of my parents got sick, we'd all be screwed. Besides, I have pretty poor health so if I got the virus myself, it would probably hit me like a truck. 

Anyways, since meeting this guy my parents have been going out to these ""little reunions"", as they call them, with the neighbor and his wife. Sometimes they invite them to our house, though the neighbors never get in the house, just stay outside in the patio. What angers me is that no one wears a mask during these parties. My mom tries to assure me that they all keep their distance but how does that even matter if they're not wearing masks? They pass beverages around, eat from the same bowls. The first few times it happened, I burst out crying in frustration because it doesn't matter how many times I tell my parents how irresponsible I think they're being (adding the fact that my mom's usually very critical of people who go out during the pandemic), they completely dismiss and ignore my concerns. One time they even promised not to go out with the neighbors anymore, but my sister caught my dad sneaking out. It's like they don't give even a single ounce of a fuck. 

I'm filled with rage. It's gotten to a point where I don't even want to talk to them anymore. I feel like they don't fucking care about me and what I have to say at all, like they see me as a fool. It feels like I'm talking to a wall.  Every time I try to talk to them about how upset I am about this they laugh and tell me I'm being a drama queen. I feel like a clown. It's fucking frustrating how they don't take me seriously and it's even more maddening that my mom still has the balls to criticize people for not taking precautions while she's doing the same thing. I haven't spoken to them in three days and I'm still extremely angry but my mom's all resentful now. She says I'm blowing things way out of proportion and I have no reason to be this upset. 

Am I really being pissy for no reason? Am I being childish? I really don't know how to feel anymore. On one hand, I feel anger bubbling up inside me every time I see my parents but on the other I feel kinda remorseful and stupid for being this angry.",15Sep2020,1

253,"I’m 29 still living at home I never planned for my life to be this way! I always felt like life has been passing me by... all my friends live on their own if single, some have children married etc. I’ve voiced how bad I feel to my parents about living at home even in the midst of this pandemic I feel time is really escaping me!! I want to move out on my own I’ve wasted so much time !! The first time I’ve expressed my anxieties about this to my parents they said I’m over exaggerating and it’s nothing wrong with living at home with them , or they go to the extreme and take offense and say that I just don’t want to be around them anymore! 


Anytime I’ve mentioned getting my own they say it’s not time don’t rush! A few months back I was cleaning out my room to try and make my transition easier and I was actively looking, my mom walks by my room and says what are you planning on leaving !? Then she asked what furniture would I like to do to redecorate I simply said I don’t plan on being in this room forever ! 


She was offended and said she doesn’t expect me to be in there forever , but I should make myself comfortable! I said why wouldn’t you encourage me to have my own place! 

She feels it’s unsafe for a woman to live alone ! 

And why would I leave and take from them what I’ve been contributing financially, they are confident they will lose their home if I leave !!! This makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and I couldn’t live with myself if I caused them to lose their house!

They also want me to take over the note of a car they can’t afford anymore once I trade my lease back in!

I can’t shake this guilt I’ve asked so many people what would they do ? They say they would still leave and start their life !! My parents wanted me to continue having a location tracker on my phone to monitor if I make it to work “safely” they say it’s just love and concern!

Am I wrong for feeling smothered!? 

I applied for an apartment I told them I would move in by the 30th of September my parents did ask me to stay until March of 2021 I’ll be 30 by then and idk if I can stay living at home for 6 more months I feel so depressed! I keep putting off telling them
Because of their initial reaction!

254,"I’m 21, surface level things seem to be going really well for me. I have the chance to progress in my career with what I thought would just be a dead end job to get me through college. I have people that I can sort of call friends, and things seem to generally be going well for me. Internally though I’m a wreck. I’ve had some health scares recently relating to a chronic condition I have, as well as got a terrible opinion from a doctor that freaked me out as she basically told me I was going blind before she could diagnose me with anything. I’m at a point where I have to make a few huge decisions that can change the direction my life goes in, likely bringing me to better my life but I’m terrified of losing it all. I’m afraid of making a decision and failing completely, despite working my ass off to get to where I am. Throughout my life I’ve felt as though everything good that’s happened to me has been ripped away, I just want these few things to work out. I have a strained relationship with my mother, I still live at home because I can’t afford to move out. A lot of the time I can’t stand her, I know what she really thinks of me, she doesn’t believe I can actually do anything good with myself and she hates me. She constantly gives me back handed compliments, is insanely controlling, manipulative and I can’t stand her constant casual racism. She thinks she’s funny but she’s really not, it infuriates me. I’m over working myself and stressing over every little thing, I’m so unhappy with my life, but I don’t have anyone I can talk to about how I feel. I need to get out, I can’t take living where I am anymore. I don’t know how to cope with all this before I have a total nervous breakdown, I’m so tired and just want to give up, nobody really cares about me anyway. I doubt anyone outside of my job would notice if I just packed up all my stuff and moved far away without saying anything. I deserve to be happy for once. I deserve to be proud of myself and do what’s best for me but I don’t even know where to start.

258,"Okay so I live in a small apartment complex, where my upstairs apartment faces the alley. There is another complex across the way that has a living room window that lines up perfectly with my living room &amp; my bedroom window. You can see directly into our apartment from that window if our blinds are open. 

Starting late last year, my husband and I saw a guy, naked, jacking off while standing butt ass naked in front of his window with the slat blinds half open, staring towards our apartment. We kind of laughed it off, figuring he just didn’t realize he was visible. 

This continued, but got more and more frequent and the blinds were open more and more. It was usually later at night (10pm or so)... until it wasn’t. He would be awake  and going at it at 3 am when I was getting ready for work. (We usually have the blinds open because the air circulation is terrible.) I made eye contact with him and he did not stop. 

I became anxious and scared, thinking that every time I walked to my car he was going to try to assault me. Then finally, my husband shined a bright ass flashlight (like one of those suuuuper bright ones) in the window. I don’t know who else lives there with him, but I’m assuming he got snagged because he stopped completely for about 3 months. 

.... until tonight! I was working late so I had the bedroom light on and the blinds wide open until after it was dark outside. I got up from my desk and walked past the window, to see him sitting in front of his window, naked as far as I could see (the chest up). Just staring at me. This is the same night my husband is working late. 

Now I am extremely paranoid bc I feel like this guy is watching me and is going to start up again. I am worried that this is the beginning, and that he will escalate..I have ways to protect myself if he did try something but I don’t know how to handle this. 

Do I have my husband go over there and check him? Do I call the police? I have heard so many stories of people reaching out to the authorities and not getting any support until an assault actually took place.

When I got home my parents bought me a new phone for my birthday so the phone she gave me sat in a drawer. I ended up breaking up with her about a year ago and haven’t talked to her since. 

My iPhone got smashed 2 days ago and I’ve been stressed because I don’t have a job or money right now to buy a new one. I wanted to activate the phone my ex gave me but had some issues. I called the phone provider in Canada that the phone is locked to and they said my ex would have to call and confirm information and unlock it herself. My ex blocked my number so I sent her a WhatsApp message asking her to please call her provider and give them permission and get it going for me. She said no and blocked me on WhatsApp.

263,"TLDR: My neighbor sent me a text message intended for someone else calling me an idiot and say that she hates me because I'm a jew. Now I thirst for revenge. 

&amp;#x200B;

My partner and I went out of town last week and had our neighbor (75 F) cat sit while we were away. We paid her $25/day to come over once in the morning and once in the evening to feed our boy Turkey and change his litter as needed. Since we were returning Sunday afternoon, we told her she only needed to come one time that day. 

We arrived back home Sunday afternoon as scheduled, and by 6:00 I have my feet-up on the couch when I hear a key turn and in she walks. We have the following exchange: 

Me (smiling): We're back! 

Cat Sitter: I wish you would have called. 

Me: Oh sorry, I thought you knew we were coming back in the afternoon. 

... a few formalities about the cat and she leaves.

The next morning I text her to let her know I sent her payment (using Zelle as per her request) and followed it up with this text message in an attempt to be polite: 

*Me: Sent. And thanks again. Sorry I didn't call when we got in. We were pretty wiped and it didn't occur to me.* 

This is her response (I'm Dan): 

***Cat Sitter: Dan just texted sorry didn't call when home as I went up last night and they were home. What an idiot. Hate fact he's a Jew.*** 

It's clear that she was accidentally trying to text this to someone else, and it seems likely whoever she was texting is another neighbor that knows me. As of the time of posting she has not written again to apologize and it is unclear if she even realizes that she sent it to me.  

I feel a need to do something about this, and turning the other cheek isn't on the menu. Very interested to know how others might handle this situation. 

Here is what I'm considering: 

\#1: Raise A Ruckus: Loudly confront her outside next time I see her, reading the message aloud and making sure all our neighbors (it's a courtyard building so all apartments look out into a common area) know that she's a bigot. 

\#2: Social Subterfuge: Share screenshots of the text exchange with everyone in the building, but don't confront her personally, thereby secretly turning people against her without her being any the wiser. 

\#3: Make an Offer She Can't Refuse (okay... Blackmail): Confront her privately about the post and demand 1) an apology and 2) that she donates the entire $125.00 we paid her for cat sitting to a charitable Jewish organization (open to recommendations on which organization might be the most off-putting for an anti-semite).",15Sep2020,1
264,"I (16f) volunteer at a public garden area nearby where I live. There was a woman there in her late 40s/early 50s who barely ever showed to to volunteer (and eventually stopped entirely). She never got along with the other volunteers, as she insisted on voicing her opinions about uncomfortable topics in situations where they weren’t warranted. Although I saw her on occasion, we were effectively total strangers to each other. One day, I happened to be assigned to weed with her. I had to sit through an hour of her whiny rambling, but otherwise everything was fine. It was when we had gotten up to take a break when she made an offhand remark about wishing she was still “young and pretty like me.” It was a weird comment for an unfamiliar adult to make, but I figured it was meant as a compliment. That’s when she leaned in, put one hand on my bum, and squeezed. It wasn’t painful, but it took me by surprise. I offered a sort of awkward chuckle and walked away. Only later did it hit me how uncomfortable I felt. Maybe she was trying to be affectionate or playful, but it just left me with a pit in my stomach. I don’t know if I’m overreacting, or if I’m just letting it slide because she was a woman. I haven’t told anyone about this because I didn’t want to make it a big deal, and it’s been awhile since she stopped coming to volunteer at the garden.

We were just going to follow through the plans that she had for the date and get some dinner. However just two hours before the time we were supposed to meet she canceled. I questioned why and she said she was tired, and after I told her to not let what happened bring her down she replied that she was just gonna sleep it off. I didn’t want to pressure her so I suggested rescheduling a group outing when she felt up to it, and aside from an I love you (not weird from her) to our group chat she no longer responded. 

An hour later I found out she placed a suicidal message on her social media, after reaching out to her family we found out they caught her in an early attempt and she was taken to the hospital. I started questioning our earlier conversation and that perhaps I should have read more into it. I felt extremely guilty, and angry over what was going on. She ended up recovering and got discharged on Sunday. 

However today she messaged me and asked if I was available for dinner the next day. And the truth is that I’m not ready to meet her again. It’s only been three days since her attempt and I cannot just brush it off and pretend like it didn’t happen. I expected her to take some time to focus on herself and her mental health yet she already wants to hang out.

Should I tell her to take some time on her own before trying to get to “normal, or should I just agree to dinner and pretend nothing happened unless she mentions it?

270,"I need some unbiased advice. Please note some minor details have been changed for privacy reasons and English is my second language.

My oldest sister ""Jane"" (early 30s) and BIL have two children under the ages of 5 and both work full time. As the title suggested my issue is that Jane no longer makes any effort towards our relationship. Something you should know is I'm in my late 20s and there is a 7 year age gap between us, which means we weren't very close growing up. We both love each other like crazy but she was busy with uni/travel and didn't make much effort (outside holidays) to see or speak to me for a few years. Meanwhile I was growing up without her around but had a much closer relationship with my now estranged half sister who was 9 years older then me. 

Fast forward some and 4 years ago I moved into the same suburb as Jane and BIL. We grew closer then ever before and at that stage would text more and see each other every couple of months for family lunches. We even had some sister only catch ups a couple of times a year. Things were going really well and when I hit a rough patch in my life 3 years ago she was my rock. We saw each other every other weekend for months. The problem started slowly in 2018 when I moved in with my bf to a house 25mins away from where she and BIL are. It started small but I noticed she would take longer to respond to my messages and now it could be days until I hear from her, if I get an answer at all. I've always been the one to message first and organise catch ups between the two of us but I got tired of putting in all the effort a while ago so now we only see each other over family lunches and holidays. It's a bit disheartening to see her responding to friends of fb and organise play dates/dinners when I've been sitting on read for two days. 

Anyway, last week was my nieces fifth birthday and I've been asking her in person for months if/when they're planning a party or family lunch so I can get things organised, only to find out today (from my mum) that she's having a party with nieces friends and no family thing. Apparently my mum and dad were invited over this last Sunday because BIL was going to golf and so have already given their gifts. I'm really hurt at the moment and unsure if I should bring it up to her. She and my mum have always used excuses with me in the past when I complain about anything to do with her (kids are sick/kids not sleeping well/busy life with 2 kids and work) and I'm just not sure what to do anymore. I know some blame lays on me as well for stubbornly refusing to try and organise catch ups lately, but I'm just at a loss. I also wonder if I might be in the wrong because she has two kids, but my bfs sister has 5 boys and they still see/talk way more then me and Jane.

TLDR; Sister doesn't put in effort to see me and doesn't respond to my messages until days later. Always blames it on busy life with kids/work. Breaking point was my nieces b-day when my mum told me there won't be a family party for her and my parents were already over to give gifts etc.",15Sep2020,1

276,"I don’t know there’s been this sudden shift in me where I just don’t feel the need to hangout with my main friend group anymore. I just felt the last couple times I haven’t really enjoyed hanging out with them for some reason and i realized that I was hanging out with them sometimes simply bc I didn’t want to feel alone and wanted to feel apart of a group. 

I would leave hanging out with them feeling bad about myself sometimes and it was due to my feelings and not anything they did specifically. My friend invited me to have a little party at a house with only a few people but I just didn’t want to go and it just makes me uncomfortable now since I feel like I just can’t connect with them anymore. And not smoking weed has really cleared my head and I just felt like I was insecure  that I wanted to have friend, go out, drink, talk to girls and all that stuff, more bc it showed that I was cool and not bc I actually like it.

I think I was just too agreeable and afraid of change that I just kept hanging out with them constantly even though I didn’t necessarily want to. At the same time I just feel hyper focused on myself and I’m doing boxing, I’m working, I’m an engineering student, and it feels good to put everything into myself. 

Again I t’s like I just don’t feel the need to be around people but I like talking to people at work (I work on my college campus), the boxing gym that I go to has been very welcoming, and I just feel like maybe I need a new change of scenery or friends. Before covid hit I had some really good things going for me and I hung out weekly with this cool international student, I was studying with this one dude pretty consistently, and I had a chance to talk to different people and what not.

Now I just feel like it’s the same friends, doing the same thing, and I’m just tired of it, but at the same time I don’t want to cut them out of my life.

278,"I literally just made a reddit account bc I’m doing so poorly rn and I’d just like to hear some strangers’ advice. Sorry in advance for the length. 

Short story: I fell in love with my friend of four years and we haven’t talked in over six months (haven’t had a proper conversation for longer than that). I want to write her a letter as a last attempt to reach out. 

Long story: When I (F, 19? Idk how to do this) was fifteen, I met someone (F, now 19, but was 15 at the time) on Instagram. We were both into art and marching band and a lot of other things, so we hit it off pretty quickly. Our communication went from Instagram dms, to texting, to phone calls, and eventually to Skype. We talked about everything. Our families, our marching bands, school, friends, random shit. Something about this friendship felt so different (still feels so different) from all of my other ones. It only took me about four months and an entire sexuality crisis to fall in love with her. It started as a crush, but then as time went on I knew it was more than that. I started thinking that she had the best smile I’d ever seen, she was the most talented person I knew, and I wanted to talk to her all the time. Well as the years went by my feelings only grew, which kind of sucked because I live in Georgia, and for most of our friendship she lived in Missouri. My mom was very strict and never agreed to me and my friend meeting, so we just cried to each other about how much we missed the other and how badly we wanted to hold each other and experience things together. A lot of stuff has happened between us that I can’t possibly write down here, but basically after three years things started to change. We both got really busy, and we didn’t talk as much as we use to. Then, last year, a bit before high school graduation, she disappeared for four months. This happened after she planned to accept a job in a town a couple hours from me, which was super scary but also exciting. The fact that she disappeared without telling me whether she accepted the job or not didn’t make sense to me, and it made me wonder what happened. That was… a really dark time for me. I had no idea what happened to her, if she was ok, or if we were ok. But then four months later as I was trying to get through my first semester of college she called me, and we both sobbed about how much we missed each other. She said she would never do that to me again. So four months passed of us together again and things still felt weird, but we were kind of back to normal. We texted and FaceTimed as often as we could. We made another plan to meet, and it fell through because of my strict mother. That was in February. We haven’t had a conversation since. I’ve texted her multiple times (with breaks in between texts of course). A couple months ago I sent her a message on twitter with my concerns and my “I miss you, please tell me what’s going on” normal sadness, to which she responded saying that these past few months have been hard and she got a new phone plan and if I would text my number she’d call me in the morning and of course she missed me. She did not call me in the morning, or the afternoon or the night or any other time after that. It is now September, as I’m sure you all know. I miss her so badly every single day. I want to call but I’m afraid I will stress her out or be another thing for her to worry about. We use to write letters a lot, and I’m thinking about sending her one. I want to tell her how much I care about her, and maybe that I have bigger feelings for her. However, I’m not sure if she still lives in the same place as she did earlier this year. 

So my question is: Should I send a letter to my crush/best friend that ghosted me, even if I’m not sure if she still lives at her last address?

282,"

Ok so I’m a teenage female and I have this hazy memory of when I was really little being in my parents bathroom with my dad while he was washing up (a very common occurrence, my family was always very open when. It came to nudity) and me, being at the age where I was curious about anatomy and stuff, was watching him. I remember asking him if I could touch “it” (again because I was just a curious little girl) and him letting me. This happened maybe 3 times. He didn’t do anything else to me, just that. But I’m wondering if it counted as molestation of not, because I also remember acting very inappropriately with  little boys my age (trying to pull their pants down, trying to see them naked). I don’t think that’s normal behavior but I could be wrong. And then a few days ago I had a hazy “dream” of my dad standing over a younger me with “it” hanging out. This dream was *extremely* troubling because I don’t know if it was a dream or a memory. I’m also wondering if it has anything to do with the fact that flaccid penises (penises in general really) turn me on, and my probably concerning behavior. He has never acted creepy towards me, in fact I couldn’t ask for a better dad, but I’m still worried. Help me out here guys. I really need to know: is any of this normal? Was my behavior as a child normal? Was my dad just doing that because he understood I was just curious, or was something more sinister going on? 

I’m gonna go to bed. I’ll check this post tomorrow.",15Sep2020,1
283,"I have dealt with this long enough that I no longer think it's just how I am, I'm starting to think there's possibly a condition at play here.  

When it comes to creating, organizing, improving, rebuilding, etc any thing on any topic, I never actually make any progress on it unless I turn my entire life into that one thing.  

From the moment I have free time until I pass out at night, just doing that one thing until it's done.  

This is not healthy at all, because things that can only be achieved incrementally (daily health, exercise, etc) completely fall by the way side. Additionally, they're never really achieved because they're not generally associated with an all day activity.  

The best way to analogize this problem is comparing it to cleaning your home. Someone who behaves like I do will spend all day Sunday cleaning my house from noon to midnight, A to Z, making sure it's perfect.  

The person I want to become is the person who spends 20 minutes each day after working cleaning, and so the house always stays fairly clean and any tasks you perform are general cleaning maintenance.  

The reason I started to believe this is unhealthy, is because recently I asked myself ""I wonder if I can get physically healthier if I just become obsessed with it and do it 24/7 like other things I'm productive in""

284,"My boyfriend ghosted me last year because he was having family problems and he couldn't handle a relationship, but he didn't bother to tell me and instead just ghosted me, leaving me wondering what happened. During that time, he went on a retreat and kissed another girl, planned to meet up with her to do things that Jesus wouldn't approve of, but canceled that meet up last minute. He eventually told me he needed a break a couple weeks later, and we broke up for around 8 months before getting back together in March of this year. Just a few hours ago, he told me about the girl he'd kissed and had intended to hook up with on is retreat last year, saying that it wasn't ""overly sexual"" because it was just a kiss, and that I didn't need to worry because he still loved me and would never ever cheat on me.

Now, I don't know where to proceed. I love him more than anything, but what should my reaction be? Forgive him? Take a break? What sort of apology should I accept, if any? Am I overreacting?

285,"I'm in a relationship with a super friendly, super sweet guy. 

I understand that guys can have girl best friends, just like I can have boy best friends. I'm aware that telling him I'm not comfortable with the things he says and does with her. It's nothing bad, he gives her hugs, calls her for three hours, extensive conversations. Something typical best friends do. It's been over a year since we started dating and this has not been a large problem for me until the past 6 months.

But I can't understand why I'm so jealous. I've talked about it to him a bunch of times. I know for a fact that he'd never cheat. I know I don't want to keep him to myself because that's selfish. I asked him to tell me when he calls his friend and I felt really guilty about doing this already. I didn't want him to ask me if he could call his friend, I wanted him to just let me know, or shoot me a message. I wanted this so I could get used to it but it's kind of just eating away at me instead. He also stopped telling me when he calls her because he feels it's restricting, which I respect that he feels that way so I left it be.

It gets to the point where sometimes I'm sitting in my bed crying and hoping I could die (of course this also stems from SI and possible depression) so I stop having these thoughts of jealousy and thoughts of him one day leaving me behind.

Turns out, I’ve struggled with stress induced psychosis for years now and I am severely depressed (not a surprise), but the person I spoke to said that my symptoms aren’t as severe as they were before I moved to college, so I’m not eligible for the program anymore even though I’m so paranoid all the time, and I always see figures watching me.

295,"I am 18 years old class of 2020, throughout my High school trajectory I was a 4.0 student I excelled in academics and in sports. I used my grades as a measure of self worth. I come from a family of Hispanic decent and have two older brothers I am the youngest being 18, the middle one is 25 and the eldest who as an infant developed meningitis and is now disabled. I have always grown up on the ideal that my brothers were above me I’ve  been told they’re better than me. I however never cared bc I knew I mattered to my teachers and love pleasing those around me. But up until my senior year of high school I lost all of my friends because my boyfriend who has been my boyfriend on and off since we were 12 decided he didn’t like them. I know it sounds dumb but I love him and I didn’t want to loose him again after the many break ups and make ups. He’s been my first kiss first time and everything... he’s even the father of what was supposed to be my firstborn baby. I got pregnant my senior year and found out my boyfriend had been cheating on me before and after wards knowing I was pregnant . Knowing I come from the household I come from I decided mainly under his influence to terminate. I regret it so much but I did what I did. That led me to become very depressed to the point I couldn’t function my boyfriend persuaded me into staying with him and he begged for forgiveness. He’s been really good to be for the past almost year no surprised or nothing he joined the navy and is now doing very well I love him.

I got two and it would’ve covered almost all of my tuition but I didn’t take into account that the school I chose was requiring a year long lease on a dorm I can’t afford for first year students and it wasn’t enough so I decided to not go.

297,"Alright, a bit of background because I know this title is incriminating.   


I've (21F) been living with my mother my entire life. We have no other family by blood. Not so bad being so relatively young I guess. The only time I've ever lived away from home for more than a month was when I graduated High School and went overseas to a seminary for around 8-9 months. Anyway, money matters are tight as my mother is a retired nurse, retired when I was born and can't return to work due to her health, and I'm out of a job because of Covid. I use to be a teacher's assistant/daycare worker. We've lived in a one-room apartment since October of 2019. We share the room with two twin beds (no couch to crash on in the living room). Before that, we bounced around a few roommate situations that all ended terribly. After all that, having our own place was a blessing at the time. Now I hate it.  


I do appreciate having a bed, roof over my head, food— essentials I am grateful for. But lately, I've been struggling with a short temper and little to no empathy. I'm scared it's making me a bad person.   


My mother has multiple health disorders. I am not here to ask advice from a doctor, I know the rules. I won't be listing her health disorders either. She, my mother, with her medical knowledge + good ol' Dr. Google tends to do a lot of self-diagnosing on herself. And tends to assume the worst about herself. I hear from her that she thinks she needs to go to the ER at least twice a month. Of course, this would warrent anyone to think if anyone needs to go to the ER, call 911. It's *not* a life-or-death situation, and we already owe the state a crap-ton of money for previous ambulances.   


Most days I'm home with her. Where the fuck am I suppose to go? If it's not blazing the fire of hell outside (i live in a desert), I'll go for walks or to the store but other than that not much else to do outside. With the virus going on, and my mom's poor health condition, I don't go out for fun. I don't have an education over a high school diploma, and not a lot of offers on (safe) jobs. Can't go back to my old job because the private school I worked at thinks kids can't get Covid or something. I can't go far because I don't have a driver's license.  I'm basically one giant, lazy asshole.   


Every day I hear something that's wrong. With her, the apartment, the management, the community- she's always paranoid someone has it out for her. Plus she's 'back on' again with her on-again-off-again partner who's basically the only father figure I've ever known, but since he's been in and out of my life since I can remember I'm a little emotionally stunted toward him. Basically the story of my life there.  


A lot of times it's the same old stuff with my mom, other times she's theorizing she may have a new disease. If I don't react much she gets upset, accuses me of hating her like everyone else, says she wants to die. Naturally, I feel like the asshole. A big fear of mine is... will I be in this situation for the rest of my life? Being her nursemaid and sounding board? Obviously not *forever*, but... 

I want to leave because every day I hear how her life is miserable. By proxy, I'm miserable.  Just writing that makes me feel awful, I know. Is it selfish of me to want to leave? To live my own life? Is quarantine just messing with my head? How the hell do I get out of this? *Is this even the right subreddit for this?* Or am I just kvetching into a void?",15Sep2020,1

I'm reaping my faults now - I'm not fit at all and I try to work out, but mostly I skip it because it gets too late and I become too tired after work. I've been trying actively to make it a point to work out more.
The people who introduced me to workouts and gym were really good people. They were my college seniors and have helped me out a lot in case of academics. We have a group of friends of juniors and seniors and batch-mates who met at the gym and all studied in the same college, and me and another senior are the only people in there who do not workout daily or at least have an impressive physique. I realised lately that I become the victim of all jokes in the group, and I have told them repeatedly please do not make fun of me like that, and they think it is a guy thing to make one immune to butt-hurting jokes by making more of the same, at least that is what they behave like. The seniors start doing it, and the juniors follow along.
They know that I am a good person and a good friend, and they agree to it. But apparently they want to make me emotionally strong so I become the victim of their jokes. Their heart is in the right place, but their actions are not. I do not have any other close friends I can talk to regularly, and I'm so alone sometimes it physically hurts. 
All the times I've been authentic and left myself vulnerable to a friend I got backstabbed. I've learnt better now, so I carefully let people in but still try to hold back as much as possible. I think I'm incapable of making best friends. 

I realized that I have been escaping from all this brutal reality by delving into new books and binge watching netflix whenever they came to the forefront of my mind. But I know the importance of being mentally healthy, and I want to take action before it gets too late.

A few people still think i'm not doing the right thing though.

Several people tagged my sister in my post to tell her off but she has blocked everyone and called to scream at me for writing about ""personal information"", I ended up hanging up on her.

Her boyfriend who, doesn't go on fb that much was looking through posts yesterday to find all this drama, He called me and explained he, Had no Idea my sister even asked me, and even brought up finding a surrogacy with her but she always complained it was to much, and also brought up adoption a lot and she always said ""maybe"". He also told me that this was something he would have talked her out of if she brought it up to him. Needless to say he was very much against this idea.

My mom never commented on my post or said anything so I called her to get together for lunch and she actually agreed, But by the time I arrived she started telling me off for going on fb to complain, Apparently I should talk privately and this was a family matter, I then asked her how my body was a family matter, and all she said was ""I made you, so it's a family matter"".

I then went on to tell her how it wasn't and what would happen to my kids if something happened to me and all she said was ""they will live"", I could not believe the stubbornness of this women, I then went on to  tell her, that weather they lived or not, it was still going to break them, my oldest child would go back to her dad and the younger three would stay with my husband, separating them would break them even more.

She still said they would live, and then went on to tell me that I need to do the right thing for my family because giving birth to four kids isn't so a fifth wouldn't be a big deal, and I needed to grow up and act like an adult, At this point I pretty much  just got up and left I literally cried all the way home from how angry and upset I am with this women.

Not long after that my dad showed up at my doorstep and asked if he could stay for awhile, Apparently he asked my mom how our lunch went and my mom told him I was still refusing to do a simple task for my sister, and when My dad pressed her for information she wouldn't give him anything else, So he told her off for not thinking of all her kids instead of her ""golden child"" because things could end worse this time, and my mother only told him, That it's my fault then for not looking after myself, So my dad left her. We sat down and I told him what actually happened he wasn't happy at all.

My dad even kept both my brother informed to and they've tried talking some sense into our mom but she still isn't budging, In all honesty this has depressed me, I feel my mom is grandchildren hungry (If that's a thing) And isn't really thinking of the negatives here, She ruining relationships with three of her children and husband to make her baby happy.

In all honesty There have always been situations between any of us sibling where my sister gets away with everything my mom never told her no so she is differently a spoilt child. There would have been some point when me or my brothers wouldn't be speaking to our mom or sister, So it's now come to that time where everyone is starting to cut the off.

My dad has been living with me since he left my mom and the kids and my husband love having him around, I know he will eventually try talking to my mom again but weather they get back together or not just depends, In all honesty It seems like my mom doesn't care, And if they do divorce I'll probably be to blame (haha can already see it happening).",15Sep2020,1

311,"A few months ago, I found an interesting job posting that would fit my career goals, especially the degree I'm currently pursuing. It was in a different state, but  it is hard for a novice like me to break into this field, and I wanted to give this a try. I mentioned it to my mom, who was supportive.

Then my dad died 17 days ago. He's been ill, but we did not think he would go yet, we had hope. I didn't know how to break the news to my mom that I had gotten an interview offer to this place. I asked my cousin, who told me to try to delay it. I agreed, but of course somehow the news leaked and got back to my mom, though everyone, including my mom, denies it (gaslighting happens a lot).

I feel awful. On one hand, I have a young family to care for-infant baby and wife- and my current role is declining, less hours, no more upward growth. Which is why this position drew me in. I figured I would interview, see if it was a real fit or not, and decide then.

My sister stays with my mom and has plans to stay with her, but she's mad at me for considering moving away at a time like this. Mom and sister would like for me to let the job go. 

I've been asked if Ive looked for any local jobs- I have. but they're similar to my current one. This is a unique experience opportunity. I love my current company there's just no growth in it.

314,"I say “girlfriend” because officially I think we were only together for a month (she says differently). So I met this girl on tinder in March and we talked for about a month on snapchat before we met. We clicked instantly and I immediately fell for her. And then we went on a date and it was the most magical, most intoxicating date ever. It was the first time I really felt like I was connected to someone. I hadn’t had many lesbian relationships before, I dated some girls but none of them were serious at all. But man when I tell you I fell for this girl, I fell. About a month or so into our “talking stage”, she was over at my apartment spending the night and she starts receiving a bunch of texts and calls. It’s her ex girlfriend (who has her fucking location). She tells me the relationship is long over and that I had nothing to worry about. I tell her to answer her phone call and tell me when she was done (should’ve been the first and only red flag). Fast forward another month. I start to realize that their relationship is not over because the girlfriend added me on Snapchat. She asks if it’s okay for her and me to spend my ex’s birthday, all together. Long story short, we spend like 2 days all fucking. Fast forward a month later, my ex is spending more and more time with her ex. Getting off the phone with me to call her etc stuff like that. I confront her about it and she tells me that her ex has gone through some trauma and is experiencing a hard time. Having been a survivor of trauma myself, I knew how important familiar people and not feeling abandoned was so I let it slide. She first breaks up with me in September. Stating that she wasn’t ready for a relationship and wanted to be by herself. I respected this but then she would least come over and spend time with me and basically made it feel like we were in a relationship. This back and forth happens till December, where my ex announces to both me and her ex that she’s going to be celibate and that she was breaking up with both of us. She said that she was focusing on herself and her future. Which I totally understood and I told her that I would need space. I tried to keep my distance but she accused me of running away from my problems and made me feel guilty for wanting space and not sleeping with her or giving her affection. We carry on this back and forth until around last month. Where she says she wants to be celibate and won’t have as much time to spend with me (on her birthday by the way, after I tried to surprise her). However, at first, she didn’t act this way. She would call me and want affection and want everything you call a relationship, without the title. I fall back into it and she tells me again that she’s not ready for a relationship. She tells me that we had been in a relationship since January and that she thought she made it known that she had chosen me. Am I crazy? Because it felt like a relationship but all that time she would keep telling me that we weren’t in a relationship. Now that I’m sad about the relationship officially ending,she doesn’t understand why I’m so sad and why I couldn’t move on. I just want advice on how navigate this person and this relationship.",15Sep2020,1

316,"I (19M) have a little brother (16M) who’s addicted to video games. His addiction started when he picked up video games when used to play a lot when I was younger, but I stopped playing video games except very rarely about two years ago.  He’s played video games every day since he was about 6 or 7, pretty much all day except when he has school or has to attend a family event.  

He has no social skills whatsoever, he isn’t doing well in school and really never has, he neglects his hygiene, he never leaves his room at all only to get food or use the bathroom.  He used to play sports but hated all of them.  The worst part is my parents have never done anything about it. They don’t care he is constantly playing and not doing anything else. 

In fact, in about a year or two they are planning on buying him a gaming computer which I feel will just ruin him.  I know he will be addicted to that thing and become one of those dudes who just sit and game all day.  He’s getting more and more overweight and I fear for him, he has no plans for after high school let alone even thinks about his future, he is way to comfortable just being babied  at his age (16) by my parents and still acts like he’s way younger.

I don’t know what to do, I don’t want this for my brother but it’s all he’s ever known and he’s getting older now, he’s already starting his junior year and he still lives like he’s 10.  Any advice or similar situations?",15Sep2020,1

318,"For context, I‘m a girl and a minor. 

I have online friends I met when I was eleven/twelve. We’ve been friends for years and all trust each other. We’ve video chatted and sent pictures, thus confirming none of us are creeps. We trust each other entirely—maybe it’s not advisable but we all know each other’s last names. I know you’re not supposed to tell people online that, but what’s done is done. We plan to meet up and go on a fun trip when we’re all grown. 

My mom knows nothing about this. I delete Discord(which is where we talk) every night since my mom makes me leave my phone in the living room at night and I fear she’ll find out about them and be mad. I’m scared she’ll look through all our conversations(we all vent there sometimes and i’d rather her not see all the melodrama hahah) and take my phone and make me stop talking to them. 

My mom has always been pretty adamant about the whole “no online friends” thing and constantly tells me the dangers of it. I worry that she won’t listen that i *know* they’re not creeps because we’ve video chatted and proved that we’re not creeps multiple times. 

I’d like her to know about my online friends, though, that way I can stop hiding so much. I’m thinking about maybe having my best friend over when I tell her, as my best friend is really good at reasoning and we have each other over often when we have to tell a parent something big.

I've always been sensitive to strong smells, they give me migraines. So when I come home from work to a house that stinks of weed it's difficult to fall asleep because of the metaphorical ice pick through my eyeball. I can't say if the offending smell is coming from #2 or #4 so a direct approach seems unlikely to work well. Also I have high social anxiety and *hate* any sort of conflict.

329,"I (42) lost my mom  at the start of August. I am dealing with this quite okay, but I am experiencing flashbacks from like 16years ago. There was a girl I really (really!) was into. At that time I felt insecure and tried to date her. When we were together we had really nice conversations and a lot of fun too. She seemed into me too, but somehow it never took off. I don't have the feeling I want to be with her. I don't have her contact details anymore and I do not feel the need to have them anyway. What is this? There seems to be something that is still needs to be dealt with? What do I do with this?

I am in a relationship and have 2 kids with my SO. And don't feel any need to leave her for this girl/woman I am even dreaming about. I don't know much about her. Ofcourse I googled her and she's married and has kids. 

The only thing I feel is that I want her to know what I was going through. But's that's my thing. 7 years ago I ran into her by coincidence at a supermarket, but she completely ignored me. I did not said hi too. And I don't feel I want to contact her. 

I hope I still make sense.

330,"I’ve talked in previous other posts about the crappy shit that has gone on in my family, ESPECIALLY my mom

For the past one month I have been moved away from her, my mom has been constantly making random phone numbers from sites like TextFree, TextMe, Google Voice, etc after I block each phone number one by one, and will say crap like “You’re just gonna become a fake ass non-binary later just you wait”, “Go talk to your fucking brother, he’s a damn child”, “Give me money I don’t have enough you have plenty”, “FaceTime me right fucking now!”, “Remember when you were a girl? You were better off as a girl and now you just ruined your future”, “I will force you to donate your toys then”, “I will put you on a sex offender list if you don’t answer me”, “Good luck on living with your friend for 4-6 months”, “You won’t get into collage”, “You have heart problems and you are gonna be obese” and many more stupid or downright shitty texts

Example of a text from this morning:

Mom: Why in the fuck would you go away from me and your damn family?!??! So fucking if I was verbally abusive to you?? So what if I allowed your brother to “harass” you over and over and let him “invade” your space?? I won’t take you away from there but your a shitty fucking person!!!! Your health problems don’t mean shit and are just a reason to take medicine. You are probably damn allergic to the cats they have!!!

Me: Uh huh, I left you because you allowed my brother to touch my sister inappropriately and you laughed about it, you verbally and physically abused me and my sister CONSTANTLY, I finally ran some tests on my health issues! My liver looked like it was about to shut down, I was this close to getting heart failure cause you refused to help me seek medical treatment for a heart defect I had, I had Lyme Disease you failed to get diagnosed 8 years ago and now it sucks and most of my vitamins were severely low. So don’t you think this might be the reason I left you? I didn’t get myself diagnosed just to take medicine, I did it just so I could make myself feel happy and healthier again! So many other reasons I could give you for being the reason I left you

Mom: So what??? It’s the past and it’s fine now, your gonna start interacting with me after this!!!

Me: Nope, you’ve treated me shit my whole life, I am in no way obligated to talk to you again, your texts are not convincing in the slightest way, I am living a happier life, I am drastically increasing in height now, I have more energy, I in fact have a job interview coming up in a week, so how about that? And you say I will fail in the future just for being transgender?

Mom: Your getting good things now but wait for the bad shit!!!

Me: That’s okay! I can deal with those! Hey I think I heard something...I think I heard it’s time for me to block you, so see you!

^ I have tried multiple things to prevent getting these texts including changing my phone number and she still keeps finding me and it’s so ridiculous

Going as far as making Reddit, Discord, and Telegram accounts to message me

At this point, I mostly either reply with “Don’t care/I don’t care” in a voice recording in the tune of Anamanaguchi - Miku, a bunch of random memes, quotes about not being obligated to talk to people, or just straight up block her and nothing is cutting it

Although I am technically not emancipated yet but are 1 month in the process of it, I mentioned before I am living with a friend and her parents and paying for everything myself until I finish getting this nice house built and until I get emancipated, is there anything I can do about this whole thing?

I’m a 21 year old student at uni, and I’ve slept with this guy that I find super attractive, twice. We have only messaged the times before he has come over and initiated things on tinder. So we don’t talk other than when he asks to come over after a night out. However I know from my friends that know him that he gets around a lot so he may have a “thing” with someone else at the moment (the last time I got with him was over a week ago). So I’ve only slept with him when we have been drunk after a night out. It’s a Tuesday night and I really want him to stay for some stress relief as I have a lot of uni on at the moment. 
My question is, should I just ask him to come over even though we are both sober? Or do I not make a fool of myself as he is most likely getting with other girls. Not looking for anything serious but also don’t want to be rejected lol. Also how should I ask him if I do??

I am 15 M and in a very lost place right now. I am not suicidal though I do not mind the idea of death. I dont see and cannot find meaning in a world where everything that is in your immediate control is so fragile and easily lost where at the same time your contribution to society seems like nothing more than to keep the economy running. Is there actually something worth the stress and confusion in life that pushes us? If so what is it? Is it materialistic? Is it religious? Personally I am an agnostic and the only time I find comfort is in discord or chaos because I feel that if there is nothing to gain or lose there is nothing to worry about. I've never cried over the loss of a pet or a loved one because thats just part of a cycle and while I will miss them I've never felt impacted by someone's loss I feel as if I have never felt at home anywhere I've gone and that there is no meaning in this aimless existence.

i think of times when things were different, i don’t know if i’m scared of being alone. i have loved no one like i did my previous boyfriend before him (so my ex) and i think of him often, we ended on bad terms and he’s no longer in my life but i miss the fun times we had.

i feel like i just want to by myself, i work better as a solo person. i can go on long bike rides, meet anyone i want without having to tell someone. i’m so miserable, i just think out there must be more to life than this. i’ve just started college, and looking for a job. i don’t have time to maintain a relationship anymore

it’s happened several times, i’ll be a few months in and just get bored. the start of our relationship was so good and now it’s just the same. i can’t help but feel like i’m a terrible person, why do i feel this way. i’m so unhappy for a lad that loves me to bits and would do anything. i feel so terrible that i’ve fell out of love with the picture perfect boy but i’ve tried to break up but his mental health gets so bad.

it’s very true he has issues from previous girlfriends that’s come into this relationship. he is immature, he’s just got his own room in a house share and it’s filthy everytime i come and i have to clean it. he literally lives off garlic bread and i’m concerned for his health as he doesn’t eat any fruit/veg, just crisps and chocolates. he complains of headaches and stomach aches, plus an ankle injury that won’t heal. i’ve tried everything, he doesn’t manage his money well and smokes weed everyday.he doesn’t do his own washing, that’s my job too. 
he hasn’t got a bank account, or any form of i’d. i’ve pushed and pushed for him to sort this out but he just doesn’t, he’s not even applied for college yet. 

i was at his one time when i attempted to break up, i left in the morning with all my things. i left a note saying don’t contact me i’m sorry i don’t love you anymore. i blocked him on everything but his friend messaged me on his behalf and forced me to unblock him. i’ve tried so hard to end it but he just doesn’t allow it

So I(m14) have really struggled with a lot of mental problems for over half my life. Most stemming from some pretty bad family problems when I was younger and I guess some from genetics

I’ve always been pretty open with my parents about this, they know and try to understand what I’m going through, but I don’t think I’ll truly be ever to explain how I feel and think to anyone.

In the past few months it’s been really affecting me a lot and I’ve got into a few fights over it at school. So I talked to my gp about and he referred me to a psychiatrist. I’m having a video chat with her on Thursday and I’m stressing so much about it. I don’t know how to vocalise how I feel and I feel like if I can’t convey what I’m trying to say she won’t understand.

I really need something to get me out of this rut, my parents won’t let me get medication or smoke so I guess that’s out of the picture, I really just don’t know what to do

I feel often that everyone is judging me. I want to change this scary feeling. I am comparing myself to others. Just want to stop all this negativity in my head and be myself but I’m not comfortable being myself.",15Sep2020,1

But the minute she walks out the door for work, i get scared. I'm scared she'll have an accident and die. Or maybe she'll get cancer. Just constantly in a state of panic that i'll have to live my life without her. 

I don't know how it started but the past months i can't seem to get over it. It's even starting to get in the way of our quality time because i can't stop thinking about it. 

How do i get over it and just enjoy my life?",15Sep2020,1

So like I said, today is my practical driving exam and I‘m slightly nervous. My driving teacher always says, that I’m a very good driver and that everything’s going well with me. Still, I‘m slightly nervous today, cuz I‘m still scared that I might fail. It‘s not that I can’t do anything... it’s more like, I’m scared of doing mistakes. Maybe also, that we have to answer a few theoretical questions before we start to drive. I‘m sure I can do it, but I‘m still scared I might fail.

345,"I now have a really big sleeping problem where I sleep during too much during the day and not enough during the night. I do it because I’m bored, it feels good and I can “skip” ahead in time because time flies when I’m asleep. I live at a group home so I don’t have chores to do and I can’t go to work because if I work they take money off of my RSS, or else I would go to work. I want to cook for myself and can’t, I want to clean up after myself but can’t, and I want to farm but I can’t. Most of the people here are around 40-50 years old, and I’m 21 so there’s a big age gap. And being at the group home I don’t get out as much as I want to. Because I sleep during the day so much, I can’t sleep much during the night, as I am lucky if I can get to sleep around 3-4am in the morning, which doesn’t help my sleep schedule. During the day I sleep 7 hours and night I sleep around 2-3 hours. I would like to not sleep during the day and wake up at 8am and get 7-8 hours of sleep. Another problem is that I keep making excuses to sleep more. I would think to myself “I’m going to get up at 7am and not go back to sleep” and then wake up at 7am, and be so tired that I tell myself “I can sleep longer. Just a little more sleep.” and then sleep more, and then regret it afterward, and then repeat it the next day. I don’t have any trouble not going back to sleep when I have a doctors appointment or if I go with my Grandma or to church that day. I feel like I am seriously wasting my time sleeping, and I heard someone say I can sleep when I’m dead, but feel like I’m addicted to sleeping and am in a sticky situation. What can I be more motivated to do than sleep? And what can I do to not love sleep? Because I would love to keep myself busy without sleeping.",15Sep2020,1

349,"My wife misses her parents (in their 70s), who live out-of-state, and they'd like to come stay with us.  My in-laws have little concern about the pandemic and see people regularly, though they do try to wear masks.

I don't know how to navigate this.  I like her parents very much and don't want to stand between them all being together.  However, we don't all see exactly eye-to-eye on what this might look like.

I follow most guidelines pretty rigidly - let's call me a 2/10 on the COVID risk-taking scale.  I'd be happy to have them, provided they stayed in quarantine for two weeks elsewhere.  Or, alternately, they could quarantine in our home while WE stayed for two weeks elsewhere.  Or, they could wait a few days, take a COVID test, and (passing as negative) then come to stay with us. 

My wife is a little looser - say a 4 out of 10.  She doesn't love what I'm proposing, but doesn't have any better solutions - she's not sure *she's* okay with them coming to stay with us right off the bat herself.  But she also doesn't want any bad feelings - she wants to enjoy her parents and make them happy.

The in-laws aren't much bothered despite their age; let's call them a 7/10 on the risk-taking scale.  They'll mostly wear masks in public, but they go out in public regularly and eat out regularly, and see their son (my brother-in-law) who thinks the pandemic is a big hoax and takes zero precautions (he's a 10/10 on the risk-taking scale) multiple times each week.  My in-laws are super-nice people; they'd try to accommodate any requests we had while staying here, but I'm fairly certain they *wouldn't* quarantine for two weeks upon arrival -- too much of an inconvenience and costly.

As for *their* safety - we go nowhere public (only walks and hikes in empty places with masks handy in the rare occasion that we run into another human) and have most things delivered.  So they ought to be fine in terms of being with us.  

What should I do?  Just accept the risk and let them stay with us?  Insist they quarantine before visiting?  There doesn't seem to be much middle ground here that I can find (I told my wife I, personally, could leave the house for two weeks and return afterwards, since I seem the most concerned about all this, but she's concerned about how that might look, e.g., that I don't want to see her parents and/or am wildly neurotic)(and also, she would miss me).

Any thoughtful, civil, advice (including links pertaining to the topic from experts) would be greatly appreciated.  If you're hardcore Trumper who thinks the pandemic is a liberal hoax, please don't answer.  It's not that I don't value your right to tell me I'm a stupid sheeple, it's just that that isn't a helpful solution to this problem.",15Sep2020,1

352,"hey all. My friend (19M) has made it very clear that he is depressed, self harming, and considering suicide over the last few weeks. I (23F) am a trained crisis counselor (just for CTL, so not a mental health professional), and have been doing my best to support him but he refuses to consider professional help. Up until right now, I did not think he was in active danger so I didn’t want to overstep and jeopardize the friendship. I was planning to take him to the hospital for a psych eval sometime this week if I could get him to see me in person, but I think it might be too late. 
I just woke up (3:45am) to see he posted two song screenshots to his Snapchat story... “I’m sorry” by Joyner Lucas and “...and to those I love, thanks for sticking around” by $uicideboy$ about two hours ago. He’s not the type to post for attention, and I’ve known him for almost 2 years and have never seen him post anything like this. And, he’s not answering any of my messages. 
I don’t know where he is (I know him from college but I’m at home on leave this semester and he lives somewhere off campus and commutes back and forth from ~2 hours away on the weekends) so calling for a welfare check isn’t a possibility. 
Is this it? Does this mean what I think it does? I’m so very scared that it’s too late. As a 3x attempt survivor myself, (years ago but this is definitely triggering) I know that his pain is real and feel like I may have missed a bigger red flag or screwed up by not taking him in earlier. I’m already freaking out about what this means and know that I’m going to be struggling with guilt if my concerns are actualized. 
What can I do right now? Anything?? 😩😭",15Sep2020,1
353,"Hey y'all. I'm currently in a rough patch. I'm an 18 year old college freshman majoring in computer engineering at a uni. So far, I'm loving college. The classes are great and I actually feel like I'm learning something valuable...except with my math class. I'm currently taking Calculus 1 and for some reason, this is the only class I have trouble with. I can't stay motived or focused during class and it doesn't help that class is instructed remotely through Zoom. Unfortunately for the most part, I just don't know what's going on during class and I have trouble grasping the concepts being taught. At the end of class I just end up feeling discouraged and disappointed at myself. This is where the thoughts of me dropping out begin.

Alongside my Calculus 1 course, I'm taking an Intro to Programming course (for C++). The programming course is required for my major and alongside that course, Calculus 1 is a prerequisite. Initially, I tried toughing it out with my Calculus class in hopes I'd actually learn something but, eventually, I ended up failing a couple quizzes. Even after trying to do the homework and rewatching lectures, I can't seem to get by and it frustrates me. The obvious suggestion is that I should get a tutor. I'm currently looking into getting one but I'm afraid it may interfere with work. And earning money as a college student is essential, especially during 2020 amidst the pandemic. (I'll provide an update if I find a tutor and the results :D)

In any case, I was thinking ""Okay, toughing it out doesn't seem to work. What if I just drop the class, swap it with a different professor or a whole other GE, and just take calculus during winter semester?"" At first, that seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately for me, the other Calculus 1 classes INCLUDING Pre-Calculus classes were all closed. Not even accepting waitlisted students. In regards to dropping Calculus 1 and taking it Winter semester instead, that would result in me also having to drop my programming class (remember that they go hand in hand). So I'm essentially screwed.

Here's some lore about me: growing up with a love for videogames, I eventually grew an interest wanting to learn how to create them. This led me wanting to pursue a career in game development, hence why I'm majoring in computer engineering. However in recent years, I've involved myself in the world of Esports. I've hosted and competed and quite a few tournaments as well, and it's become a part of my identity. And I honestly wouldn't mind making a career out of this either. You can probably see where I'm going with this, but here are some underlying questions I've been asking myself: Is college worth it? Will it be worth it if I want to pursue a career in Esports? Can't I just learn how to program on my own? Is dropping out even something I want to do or am I just confused with my emotions?

I understand how important pursuing education is. And I love my other class. Calculus is just this huge barrier that's making my mental state deteriorate. If I dropped out, I'd be able to focus on my life in Esports as I already have that somewhat established. However if I dropped out, I could potentially miss out on valuable education that can benefit me in the long run. What should I do?

Thank you guys so much for reading this and I'M SO SORRY if this seems really unorganized and crappy. I'm just lost right now. Thanks guys.",15Sep2020,1
354,"I've never been good at putting myself out there. I was really insecure in high school and I only had crushes and talked to guys (but never really flirted with them) and nothing serious ever came of it. I don't do well with rejection in general, such as college and friendships, but I've never dealt with romantic rejection before.

I haven't been in college for that long, but I go to a super small school and my RA told me that relationships tend to progress really fast at my school just because the class size is so small. I met this guy 4 weeks ago, and we clicked instantly. Everything felt so natural with him. He is the perfect balance of funny/carefree and serious/vulnerable. The second time we hung out we went from laughing to having a really personal conversation to laughing again. He shows genuine concern, he's funny, he's smart, and overall just really really cool. All of our friends and RAs said it was really obvious that we liked each other and I got my hopes up. There's too much storyline to fit in here, but basically a few hours ago, he asked me to talk outside with him. He told me that he's really into me. But then told me that he couldn't see a relationship between us working out. He said it's nothing wrong with me, but just that he sucks at relationships and isn't ready for one. He also said that he thinks I can find a better guy than him. It sucks and I'm really hurt but also I know that I can't expect anyone to want or be ready for a relationship. I understand that getting into a relationship this early into college isn't the best idea, but a part of me was really hoping that it would work out. I asked if he would ever be ready, and he said he wishes he could say yes but he didn't want to get my hopes up. He said that he doesn't see a relationship between us working out.

363,"Some background:  
I was brought up in a farming family, my parents taught me how to be respectful to others and being honest. I moved on living on a bigger city, not far away from my hometown, got a job there, rent a house, became financially independent and subsequently an economical relief to my folks. We were quite happy back then.

The facts:  
A day came when my father came to my workplace, asked me for a mere 20.000, took permission to leave work and went straight to a bank where I took a loan and handed him the biggest brick of cash money I've ever seen in my life. That was it. He pocketed the money, turned his back and left without saying anything. I didn't have a call from my folks for the next few weeks so I decided to pay them a visit on a weekend off. They acted as if nothing had happened. They reassured me that they pay my loan and asked me for an additional 30.000 which I wasn't even sure if I could get them even by a second loan. Surely I believed with confidence their word, after all they are my parents so I applied for a second loan and it was granted to me. Gave them the money and... they bought a fancy car with it.   


I recently learned that I am fully exposed to the bank, since no payments were done at all and I don't know how to cope with this, mentally -of being ""betrayed"" or practically -with the money issue. I am not sure I am going through depression but I do know I isolated myself from others, I lost all self appreciation and the will to do things in my life such as friendships, relationships or my own family.

Now that you know the backstory, today I was approached during recess break about wanting to beat up 2 popular kids. I was approached by that popular, aggressive, druggy-ish type of friendship group. They make up a massive part of my grade’s demographic. I was approached by a crowd of around 80-120 students. It was based on messages that said “I wanted to deal with *insert name* and *insert name*” but it was taken as a threat that I wanted to beat those two kids up when I meant that I wanted to repair relations. These messages got to them because during the first 1-2 days after the scandal I was sending a few key people the messages to debunk and clear my name about the wish for rape scandal with limited success. This crowd went around the school in one massive pack and column asking where I was and telling them about how I am a pedophile (I know I’m not +18) and telling them about my incident less than a fortnight ago to literally everyone, and I mean everyone. It got really, really, bad. According to my brother “I am famous”. After I was approached I was escorted to the office where I explained myself and proved my innocence, they said the teacher said he will talk to the students involved. But nevertheless, when I went on a stroll with 2 friends around the school I was harassed multiple times. Being called a “pedo” and a “bitch” literally everywhere I went. People got out of there way to open windows and call me out on it. This is really, really bad and as you know I can’t move schools. What do you think?",15Sep2020,1

375,"So I have been in a relationship with my fiance for about 10 years now. She is my first and I love her dearly. We've had trouble with sex because she has a medical condition that makes it hard for her to have penetrative sex. I have probably I higher than average sex drive and usually handle my business through masturbation.  


However, she moved temporarily to a different city about 2 years ago (which I can still drive to, so it's not impossible to occasionally visit). I ended up getting sexually frustrated and long story short, visited various rub-parlours and escorts (went through my bank account and estimated about 11 times). On my last, most recent visit of an escort, I couldn't get hard because I kept thinking about my partner. I took this as a sign that I couldn't do this anymore both mentally and physically because I love her too much. I plan to get married with her after she moves back to my city but before that, I am on the border of confessing that I've cheated on her 11 times with rub/escort services.  


In the past, we've talked before about the differences in our sex drive and at one point I told her she wasn't satisfying me sexually. This really devastated her and caused a panic attack, but I told her that I was letting her know so we could work things out or come to a compromise. We did come to a compromise of sorts but it seems like it fell through since she moved to another city.  


I want to believe that I have decided to stop permanently, but not sure if stopping permanently requires one to confess. She deserves a lot better than me but I still make her happy, and she makes me happy.

I will immediately break into tears if I do something wrong.

I had a high stress/high reward job and saved up a good chunk of money and after a while realized I didn’t like what I did. I looked into a new career and fell in love. The new career is somewhat highly specialized and requires going to school. The money I saved up quickly went when trying to go back to school, (this crap is expensive) and now I’m sitting on a dwindling savings. I attempt to live rather frugally, eat once a day, haven’t “wasted” money in months, and I have an in between job. I make a decent hourly but with my school demand work part time. However the school I will need requires classes Monday through Friday 8-5. I can’t think of a reasonable job that can accommodate that while maintaining some semblance of health. 

I’m also going to be outgrowing my dads insurance next month (yay 26) and I’ll be lacking in a few areas. My job will provide health insurance but not much else for part time.

I’ll be getting a degree at the end of this semester and attending (hopefully) the specialized part of the schooling in the spring. 

I usually don’t stress or freak out about things but I’m honestly starting to worry a little about how I’m going to manage this. I’m starting to worry I put all of my eggs into one basket and the basket is on a dwindling ledge. 

Is there any advice out there someone might have? Easy side hustle jobs I can do while working part time and taking 20+ units at school? Maybe programs to help me out? To be honest I haven’t done a lot of research but I don’t know where to start. 

Thank you for any input or advice.",15Sep2020,1

I have a Diploma in welding technologies that I earned in High school through a community college. Obviously the last 4 years of my enlistment I haven't been able to practice my skill or earn certificates.

381,"A few months ago, I took a couple tabs of acid. I know that drugs are bad and it was stupid for me to even be doing that and that I was irresponsible, and I do regret that. I felt like I was starting to have a bad trip and I thought that going for a walk would make it better. I was tripping alone which was also a really bad idea. Anyway, in the middle of my walk I was tripping so hard and my hallucinations were so bad that I thought I was dying. There was a police car driving by me and I was screaming for help. Obviously the cop stopped and started questioning me. I was barely coherent, but I did tell him that I took acid and I need help. I also was saying a lot of random things that made no sense, but I did make it clear that I just needed help. Obviously because I was breaking the law, the police wasn’t there to try to calm me down, he just immediately proceeded to arrest me. I understand that by deciding to take drugs I chose to broke the law and I deserve to be punished, but the police officer didn’t need to be so aggressive with me. He tackled me and pinned me to the ground when he was handcuffing me (keep in mind that I am a 115 pound woman and I wasn’t doing anything to resist the arrest, so that was unnecessary) When he put me into the back of the cop car, I just remember everything being really dark and it was a small space, and I felt myself having a panic attack. I know I was tripping, but I just remember freaking out to the point where I couldn’t catch my breath and screaming. The officer drove me to the jail, and I was still having a panic attack. All of the police officers there were laughing at me the whole time. I understand that acting weird while you’re on drugs can look funny to someone on the outside, but I was extremely scared, and I never felt so dehumanized in my life. The first thing that happens when you get to jail is they search you, and at this point, I was out of my mind, and there were 4 male officers trying to search me. It wasn’t like a strip search or anything, but one of them did put their hand down my pants at on point and pulled my pants down to see what color underwear I was wearing. It’s standard procedure, but they do this out in the open and I felt very violated. The whole time, I was obviously freaking out and acting strange because of the acid, and the officers were all just laughing at me. Next, they made me take a drug test. I was not driving or anything when I got arrested, I was just going for a walk, so I actually did not have to legally take the drug test, but the police officers threatened me and obviously I was out of my mind, so I did. They made me pee in front of a male nurse for this. This could’ve just been because I was super high, but I just remember the man being super creepy and staring at my vagina while I was peeing for this drug test. I don’t know if this is normal, but I feel like at the very least they could’ve at least had a female officer/nurse instead of the creepy male nurse. This caused me to have another panic attack. The police officers clearly don’t know how to deal with people in a situation like this, so they just took me to the hospital. When I was at the hospital, I was handcuffed to my hospital bed the entire time, and there had to be a police officer (again, a male officer) in the same room as me the entire time, even when I was changing out of my normal clothes and into the hospital gown. The police officer told the doctor that I was also on meth and heroin as well as LSD. They made me drink a glass of warm tap water and then they gave me a pill. I don’t know what this pill was, but 3 hours later I started to sober up. I realized that I was in a hospital and there was a police officer in my hospital room, and I was so confused. I tried to just ask the officer why I was there and what was going to happen to me, and he told me to “shut the fuck up” and read me my Miranda rights. All of the nurses in the emergency room just looked at me like I was trash because I was in police custody. This was also something that was extremely humiliating. A little later the police officer brought me back to jail, where I was processed and put into a cell with 4 other people. Keep in mind this was when corona virus started to really blow up and nobody was wearing masks. I was released from jail with no bail due to corona virus allowing for people to be released with no bail. It’s been a couple months and I went through a misdemeanor diversion program to get this cleared from my record, and I finally paid my $2000 emergency room bill. I’m glad that this is all finally going to be over and I’ll never have to deal with it again, but this is something that I do feel truly traumatized by. I feel too embarrassed to tell anyone the full story, and people think I’m overreacting whenever I see a police officer in public and start having a panic attack. If I could erase anything from my memory, it would be this. I know that maybe this is all just normal stuff that happens when you get arrested and maybe it’s my fault for breaking the law, but at the same time I was doing something that wasn’t harming anyone else and I just made one stupid mistake and now I feel like I’m traumatized for the rest of my life. I just wish I could be at peace with myself, but I don’t think I ever will be.",15Sep2020,1

383,"Sorry in advance for my poor writing skills, I just really want to get this out.

So, I \[15nb\] met this person \[16F\] last year in June at school, and we quickly became friends. We were friends until July of this year, when she started becoming extremely rude and spread rumours and falsely accused me of something in a long paragraph to me, and blocked me before I could even reply.

About 2 months before she blocked me, she dyed her hair the same colour as mine, and got the same haircut as me. I didn't think anything of it at the time.

Then, a week later, she asked me for my Spotify playlist, so I gave it to her, thinking it was strange, as she listened to K-Pop and I listened to mostly Extreme Metal and Goth, which I knew she didn't like at all. I still didn't realise what she was doing. 

She started mirroring what I was listening to, ONLY listening to the bands from my playlist, nothing else.

A little while passes again, and she starts buying black and T-Shirts of bands that I like, buying all black clothes and dressing like a Trad goth, EXACTLY how I dress, and at this point I did realise, but I was too scared to mention it to her, or that it made me uncomfortable. I felt horrible, like I had to change, like I wasn't my own original person anymore, that there was something wrong with me. I still feel like that.

She started doing her makeup like me, Trad goth style. 

She started writing Google Translated Japanese in her captions and in her bios, and even started learning it, only because I could speak it, of course. 

She even copied my bios on my social media, the list of the same bands, written in Japanese, but of course her's was poorly Google Translated.

She even brought the clothes that I showed her and asked her if I should get them myself, and if she thought they would suit me.

I really don't know what to do. It keeps hitting me. I feel horrible. Like I'm not myself. Like I'm not original, and I have to change it, although I was perfectly happy with who I was until she copied me. It's causing me to doubt myself, depression, and insecurity.

387,"I'm 18 year old guy and have been watching porn since I was 12 I guess, but masturbated since I was 8 I guess (rubbing myself on couch etc.). This has gone to fetishes and stuff and I did some things I hate and don't know what to do about those thoughts. They give me stress and are stopping me from engaging in relationships and going out with girls. It makes me see myself like a disgusting person even if I don't do those things anymore. I quit porn and fapping completely for 90 days and will see from there. All this happened so fast (in last 2-3 years). I struggled with acne and self esteem a lot, didn't have much friends.

So here is a short list of disgusting things I did:
- I masturbated on Omegle and random video chats, roleplayed a lot
- Sent lot of nudes and sexted a lot with random girls on Omegle and Kik (some of my nudes were exposed online, but I got over it as people forget and I'm sure nobody I know will ever see them, but the fact that I did that shit is bothering me).
- When I was 16 I went through sister's things and sniffed her panties  (I know, kill me.)
- As I watched lot of foot fetish/femdom/humiliation videos, I actually decided to ,,lick' and sniff sister's shoes and some classmate's in lockroom while they weren't there and it felt pretty fucking weird and disgusting, I stopped it and will never do it again. Shame is here.
- When I was 12 or 13, being influenced by porn and hormones, I touched some of my family member's feet with my... well.. di*k while they were asleep and feel awful because of it.
- Few times masturbated to zoo and gore videos (never again, don't know why, I was curious and probably associated it with humiliation/taboo aspect.)

Well yeah, I will never do these things again and I read a lot of similar confessions like this and I'm glad I'm not the only one. These thoughts rush through my mind a lot lately. I know what I did is wrong and I'm sorry. I'm on day 8 from quitting porn and still get foot fetish/humiliation thoughts when I see hot girl, but it's slowly changing.

Hey so this is more of a rant and a post for advice 

So I(m14) have really struggled with a lot of mental problems for over half my life. Most stemming from some pretty bad family problems when I was younger and I guess some from genetics

I’ve always been pretty open with my parents about this, they know and try to understand what I’m going through, but I don’t think I’ll truly be ever to explain how I feel and think to anyone.

In the past few months it’s been really affecting me a lot and I’ve got into a few fights over it at school. So I talked to my gp about and he referred me to a psychiatrist. I’m having a video chat with her on Thursday and I’m stressing so much about it. I don’t know how to vocalise how I feel and I feel like if I can’t convey what I’m trying to say she won’t understand.

I really need something to get me out of this rut, my parents won’t let me get medication or smoke so I guess that’s out of the picture, I really just don’t know what to do

I don’t want to kill myself but if the psychiatrist doesn’t work out I don’t really see any point in trying",15Sep2020,1

396,"So at the start of the summer my mom received a call from my ""dad""(we'll call him Matt), I call him that because he took off when I was 6 months old and didn't want anything to do with me, But now he does because he has a wife and two other kids now, I would call him dad but I'm still now 

 My mom agreed only because she didn't want any drama, If anything they made an agreement that at first I could see Matt on the weekends, but after actually getting to know him I asked if I could spend one week at his house and then the next week I'd be at mom's house.

To me now looking back I am dumb because I only did it because of my ""dad"" and step sisters are nice to me and wanted to get to know them better, My step mom on the other hand was nice when Matt was around, but the moment he wasn't she is nothing but rude to me no matter how much I try to be nice to her, She's even trying to get the girls to hate me to but their 7 and 5 they don't understand anytime their mom is rude the always are around to give me a hug and make sure I'm okay. They are great kids I love them both.

For me for the last two years my mom and step dad have been giving me $400 very month, for doing chores before being told, picking up after myself, keeping on top of my homework, babysitting when asked and not being a stubborn teenager 24/7, Mostly I don't even spend the full amount, but this months I had to replace some really nice dresses and a rug in my bedroom, My step mom pulled out a couple dresses out of my wardrobe for my sisters to "" decorate""( that's my stepmoms excuse) and these are nice formal/ party dresses so they weren't cheap and my mom bought me, and one of my half sister's also spilt their drink on my rug, but My step mom wont get it cleaned and told me to just replace it, If anything now I'm literally have only $50 left for the month and it's upsetting that I had to replace things my step mom either let the girls ruin or didn't care about.

Just a couple days ago at school in one of my classes we were told we weren't going on any excursions but the class I was in was buying tools and stuff they needed for us to use during class, this amount was going to come to $100, now usually I would pay for or half it with my mom but this time I didn't have the money,So the next morning I asked Matt for the money I told him I would pay him back, But he told me not to worry about it, The moment he left for work, My step mom swiped the money up and put it in her bra, When I told her I needed it she said she ""needed it more"", So I told her to ask Matt for money herself and her only answer was he doesn't answer his phone at work. which I know isn't true, considering he has picked up for me in the past. I asked he to give it back and she told me to stop acting like a brat.

I pretty much to left after that and when I got to school, I called my mo, but she was unreachable but I called my stepdad and dropped off the money for me.

At dinner that night Matt asked if I handed the money in and I told him what my stepmom did, and then how I had to call my stepdad for the money. My stepmom started screaming at me I was lying, that she never stole it and I took my ""dads"" money and my step dads money and I was showing myself to be a gold digger, Which I then told her she pretty much took it the moment Matt left the house, she kept denying it and continued to call me a gold digger and all I had done was cause problems since I got here. That upset me and I ran up to me room, the fact that Matt sat there like a doormat and didn't try to stop it really has me worked up, I don't get why he hasn't bothered to stick up for me when his wife was the problem.

I'm back at my moms house now and I texted him what really happened and call me if he needs me to answer anything but he hasn't answered.

A couple months back Matt and my stepmom were arguing about money and how my step mom spends A LOT, but she didn't seem to care, AND SHE CALLS ME THE GOLD DIGGER!!

I haven't mentioned anything to my mom because I know she has seen these kind of situations as a kid, she doesn't want to cause drama between her and Matt and wants to keep things civil, I want to tell Matt I don't want to stay at his home anymore but I know I'll upset him.

I feel like if I try someway it'll set my stepmom off more and she will blame me.

Does anyone know the actual figures of how much the average person would save if they got sterilized/never had a kid? I think vasectomies/tubal litigation's would be expensive €500-€1,000 but that's pennies compared to the cost of raising a kid for 18+ years.",15Sep2020,1

There’s no reason for anyone to get involved with me. Nobody has ever really loved me and I’m never going to get to have that experience. The only things I ever wanted out of my life was to not be in poverty, and to have a girlfriend. That’s it. But I can’t even accomplish that.

I don’t have anyone to talk to about these things so I’m just posting it here. I give up. Theres nothing that inspires me and any light from my life is gone. The only thing I can do is just smoke pot and go to therapy until I die. I don’t know what kind of advice I’m looking for, but I appreciate you reading it.",15Sep2020,1
401,It’s 3am as I right this. Every night for the last 6 days I’ve woken up at around 2-3 and can’t fall asleep till almost 4. I took a magnesium last night. Clearly it didn’t help. Before I was waking up every night I would hear myself selling customers credit cards while I’m sleeping like I would be at work. But recently I haven’t been doing that in my sleep so I don’t know if there’s any correlation. I’m 17 female and I’m tired. I wake up and can’t go back to sleep.,15Sep2020,1

403,"I'm a minor, still living under my parents roof. My mental health has been suffering incredibly recently. I can't focus, I can't find a purpose in existence, I feel like I'm a terrible person, I barely leave my room and have been actively distancing myself from everyone. I feel these things happening but I do nothing to stop them. Everything has just been getting too much to handle recently and I feel like I'm going to snap. However, my parents are completely against mental illness, and do not believe it exists. They argue that those with depression have been too privileged in life, and making them go out with friends or watch a movie or something, will fix them. I'm not saying that I am depressed, I obviously have no clinical diagnosis, and am not willing to assume things based on random symptoms. However, I don't know what to do anymore, I feel so helpless. For so long I tried to ignore it because I was so scared of being labelled mentally ill. I hated the idea of that happening. I feel like I can't tell my parents that I am feeling this way, because on one hand, I wouldn't even know how to explain it, and on the other hand, they would dismiss it. On top of that, I don't want them to think I am just complaining for no reason, or that I am faking it for attention. I am so lost on what to do.",15Sep2020,1

405,"So I recently started my freshman year of high school and there’s this girl in some of my classes that I’ve kinda developed feelings for her. We can call this girl “(A)”.
I was talking with one of (A)’s friends and she said that she’d checked on (A) in March and that (A) wasn’t allowed to date anyone at that time.
I don’t know if this might still apply since she’s now a high schooler or if there might be any chance of changing her parents’ minds. Is there any way I could tell for sure or do I just have to wait until I ask her out?",15Sep2020,1
406,"Hi! This is a long one, but I really need advice on how to handle this. 

I have been hanging out with a group of friends/collegues for 2,5 years now (minus the last 6 months because of corona), in this group there is a couple (Simon and Sarah) and I no longer wish to hang out with them. 
Here is why:

2 years ago (before Sarah joined the group), I was out drinking with Simon and some other people, and I ended up kissing Simon for a while. The problem here, is that he was already dating Sarah at the time (I had never met her at this point). We were drunk, he came on to me and I said no (because I knew he was dating Sarah), but he kept asking me to kiss him, and because I was drunk and really sad that night he ended up convincing me. At some point I stopped it, and told him that we should just pretend it never happened. At that time I didn’t think it would be that big a deal as long as we just ignored it. 

Short time after that Simon and Sarah moved in together and she joined our group. And we have been hanging out the last two years every or every other week. And the more I hung out with them the more I started to feel really guilty and ashamed. I can’t even think about them without remembering that I kissed her boyfriend, and it has come to a point where I can no longer hang out with them. (i consider this one of the worst things I have ever done). 

I have never talked to him about it, so I don’t know if she knows, but I assume that she doesn’t. She seems to really enjoy my company and she is really a sweet person. 
I don’t want to start a whole lot of drama, but know that they want to start seeing us again (legal in my country, despite the virus), I realize that I have punished myself with shame and guilt for long enough and I need to move on, and I can’t do that if I am still hanging out with them. 

How to I tell them that I don’t want to hang out anymore without telling them the real reason? We have always had fun in the group and I really like Sarah (although we are not that close for obvious reasons). 

This was really long, if you read it all, thank you so much!",15Sep2020,1
407,"my dad is terrible but when my older brother of 9 years comes over for dinner every week with his girlfriend he acts completely different. he will suddenly act happy for them when they come over when he has been yelling and talking shit about me, my mum and sometimes my brother but not that often. so today they came over for dinner and i didn’t want to talk because my dad always makes me/my mum the face of a joke (like seriously making fun of + always calling me spoiled when i’m really earning my own money) where my mum, brother and seriously often brothers girlfriend laugh and make fun of me. so i ate dinner and left the table i then went back to speak to my mum after because she gets the same shit sometimes but will still often side with my dad so she doesn’t get yelled at by my dad, so i started trying to explain to her why i feel uncomfortable being at the table with them and my dad heard a part of it. he then went up to my mum demanding to know what i said, i said don’t worry. then he said i’m asking your mother aggressively yelling, i kept begging my mum not to tell him but she told him. he then kept muttering about me and saying how i’m trying to ruin the family and get what i always want. i then keep trying to explain to him what i am trying to say, he keeps looking at me aggressively making remarks. i keep trying to explain and explain, i say do you understand what i’m saying? please i’m not trying to do anything to hurt anyone he aggressively, sarcastically agrees with me because he wanted to watch tv. i can hear him talking to my mum about me right now too but i’m trying to block it out. i know it may seem really small, however there’s so much going on and it happens every week, it’s not as much that people here go through i completely understand. i’m just looking for some advice, please, i’m begging",15Sep2020,1
408,"My wife is 40, we were unsuccessful at using her eggs to produce a child, so we're heading to egg bank databases to find someone to provide maternal DNA for her to carry and for us to raise.

My wife is Ashkenazi (non-religious), but we can't find any Jewish donors of any kind.  She has fair skin, wavy brown hair, and hazel eyes.  I'm a western European mutt.  Together, we look like a white couple in the very white neighborhood where we live.

Egg Donor 1 is the practical choice.  Slightly younger, slightly healthier family, but her ethnicity is Arab.  She has curly black hair like my mother in law, and olive skin that's a little darker than anyone in my wife's family.  But overall, I give her ethnic similarity to my wife an 8/10.

Egg Donor 2 is my preference, and that makes me feel racist.  Donor 2 has my wife's hair and skin, but probably shares very few genes with my wife as a Spanish/Italian mix.  

Donor 2 is my wife's #2 pick, but I'm hung up on the word ""Arab"" in the profile of #1.  I worry that if Trump wins his third and fourth term as President, that's going to be a big liability.  I worry that people will look at us playing in the park ten years from now and speculate that we had to adopt.  I worry that our child will not be accepted as ""European"", which should not matter but clearly does in America right now.

409,"I was talking to a romantic interest the other day, and he asked what I was doing. I said I was in the middle of a 16. (For those of you who dont know, I was referring to a 16 hour shift). He asked ""What's a 16? Am I too brown to understand that reference?"" And I playfully replied, ""Oh shush, dont play the race card."" He then got very serious and said ""racial justice is at my forefront and I'm hyperaware of cultural differences between me and Midwestern White folks"".

I wasn't trying to be offensive, I was just joking. I asked a few friends about what they thought about the situation, and they think hes just being sensitive. Ive accepted the fact that hes ghosted me now, because he thinks im racist. Typically I dont get too butthurt anymore when I get ghosted, but this one stings a little more, especially because his reason for ghosting me isn't even true. I've cut out blatantly racist family members. My own father refused to talk to me for 4 months because I had the audacity to say black lives matter. I went to a local blm march (which was big for me, considering im a huge introvert and hate leaving my house). 

Looking back, I know I should've just left it alone and not even go there, but I cant do anything to fix it now. I already said it, I already apologized. Was I accidentally racist?",15Sep2020,1
410,"I need a job to support myself at university this year. I have been looking for jobs for weeks without a single response despite applying to tens of jobs. I find the process of looking for jobs to be soul draining. Today I finally got a response but it's from a overnight job. I have worked overnights before. I genuinely enjoy them but they are also difficult to reconcile with everything else in your life. Last time it was just not being able to talk to friends as much but most of them had bad sleep cycles anyway so I did alright and met new friends. 

However now I'm at university and living with roommates. I'm worried about how it will effect my studies. The classes are mostly online but it's still the difficulty of actually keeping up with assignments and lectures. Plus the whole reason I am living with roommates instead of just staying at home is because I like being with them but that's going to be more difficult when I am waking up at 7 pm most days. 

What a lot of people don't understand is that it isn't the Nightshift that fucks you up it's when you keep trying to switch between the two. 3 days nocturnal and 3 days normal just messes you up. 

If I wasn't worried about how it's going to effect my studies and friendships I would definitely take the job.

412,"Okay. So this girl and I liked each other months ago. Right when quarantine started. She was not looking for a relationship at the time which was fine. I told her I would wait. All I asked is that she would tell me once in a while that she still liked me, this is because I have a serious history of trust issues because of all my previous relationships ending in the other person cheating because they lost interest. She took this as me pushing her to do things. I didn't push. We hung out once and when she was crying about her abusive parents I asked if I could give her a hug. That is as far as we went. A few weeks later we were at a river with all of my other friends (for clarity sake I will call the next 2 groups of people Team A and Team B). Team A (the friend group I was hanging out with) had previously made me break ties with Team B because they had drama with each other. I chose Team A because the girl was in Team A and my best friend (at the time) was in Team A even if they were a more toxic group. So, we were at the river and everything was kinda off. She was acting weird towards me and had been for a couple days. I had been giving her space (only snaping for streak sake and no other texting) because that is how she dealt with things. Regardless it was weird and then when I got home I was kinda just feeling done with trying to pursue this girl who I was starting to lose feelings over. So I called her. I explained and then she went OFF on me. Saying how she has been dropping hints and stuff for weeks saying she was done with me. This made me pissed. Because she was yelling at me and telling me that I am such an idiot and that is just how she is at explaining her feelings. Needless to say, I didn't take that well and took drugs to try and keep myself from doing something dumb. But I did something dumb anyway. I started wandering the streets until my ex-best friend came and got me. The next day I went over to his house to apologize. For 1. Going on a drug trip 2. Getting pissed off at the girl (I know now I was in the right but our group dynamic was that I was the group bitch that always did everything wrong). Needless to say, I thought everything was gonna go back to normal. I was WAY wrong. She started to spread rumors about me saying I pushed her to do things. Then in about 2 days, I had no friends. I had NO ONE. And I felt so angry. Then something happened that would change my perspective. My ex-best friend broke up with his 6-month gf out of the blue. That is when I peiced shit together. My ex-best friend and the girl I had been wanting to date for MANY MONTHS liked each other. That is why he didn't take my back when everything went down. Flash forward another few weeks. My ex bff was going down to visit his dad. I was in such a state of shock that I hadn't told my parents about any of this. They still thought I had friends. So when they asked if I was going to the going away party I said yes. I walked for a few miles just crying and wishing I had anyone. Then I got to an abandoned building where I made an important call. I called someone else who had been kicked out of the group before me. He picked me up and became my new best friend. We spent months having so much fun. Then my ex-best friend apologized to him for kicking him out of the group and suddenly he was back in. Flash forward a week and he is giving rides to the girl who ruined my social life. By this point, I have been diagnosed with ASPD manifesting sociopathic tendencies. I was in the car with my new best friend and he sees that the girl who ruined my social life and his ex (who broke his heart) are hanging out at ****** so I make a joke saying ""we should go to ****** and beat them up"". Side tangent my best friends ex, dated my ex-best, friend and ACCUSED HIM OF RAPE and yet he forgave her and they still hang out to this day. (Back to the story) Me being a sociopath having no remorse or empathy so I just say what comes to mind most of the time. Me saying this reaches my ex-best friend and he goes BALLISTIC. Even though through my relationship before the girl he CONSTANTLY criticized her and called her dumb and said he hated her. He was one of the main reasons I broke up with my ex in the first place. He says he hates me on a live stream and I realize that I hate him too. He had just as much to do with my social life being ruined as the girl did. A few weeks later I get a text from him saying ""apologize to me and her or else"". And even though I didn't think I did anything wrong. I did. But nothing changed. My new best friend started drifting towards them and hasn't been the same. He texts me less and hangs out with them more. He also has stopped wanting me to talk badly about them which is angering because he is my only outlet. All of this has kinda come to a halt starting 3 weeks ago. I am constantly filled anger towards them and it only gets worse because I have classes with them. All I wanna know is should I stay mad out of self-respect? Because I know I can't be treated like this and stand for it. I don't wanna lie down and be their bitch anymore. Or should I let go even though every time my best friend comes over he talks about them and brings back the pain? I know them taking up my mind is bad. But it still affects me and I feel like I can't stop without someone telling me why.",15Sep2020,1

431,"Hi everyoneed advice/want encouragement regarding massive thesis panic. long story short: with a long ass history of debilitating mental illnesses, I fought nail and tooth to try to get my MA degree. I’m 31. You can imagine it came with a lot of pauses, stops, gaps. The last two years I haven’t studied at all because I was so depressed. I could always mostly drag myself to work, but my uni suffered a lot.  So then I decided to do therapy again this year, which was going ok, then my previous partner of 11 years decided to break up with me suddenly. It was very traumatic.

at that point I’d already registered my ma thesis. So I lost a month to looking for new accommodation, arranging finances, moving out, etc. then my boss tells me the job offer for next year I’d been assured did NOT rest on me graduating came with the condition that i bloody graduate. Great. Now I have even more pressure because I rely on the job for money.

Five months left, a whole month of six lost, and I hadn’t done a thing for my thesis... keep in mind I forgot how to study, am not up to date at all, am fighting mental illnesses on the daily.

now I started studying. it’s been 2 weeks. It’s slow, slow going. I dont have a specific topic yet, just a general topic, but I managed to read through the major work of that general topic. I guess I’ll read some more and then try to decide on a proper topic. I’m gripped by the panic and anxiety that I won’t be able to make it. How can I help myself  out of that?

I try help myself out of it by e.g. talking to my therapist about it or being kind to myself or making  little lists why I can do it: pros are I already do it before so I can do it again, I’ve always managed uni stuff even if it was hard, if others can do it so can I, losing one month isn’t the end, I’m not stupid and I’m energetic and I try my hardest, blah blah. Negatives are I’m too stupid, it’s too little time, I’ll never find a topic, etc.

my therapist very helpfully said well it’s just the way you operate. You panic, worry, freak out, in order to study. He said he couldn’t help me there. 

i feel very alone in this. I guess I want advice for any of this, or encouragement, or any positive words. Cos I don’t have them for myself, or if I do, I don’t believe them. I keep telling myself, Hey, others have probably written an MA thesis 5 months too, it’s okay, some people are actually just lazy and laze away a whole month or something. And I do believe that. I also do believe they still somehow managed it. But I can’t believe it for myself, given my history and momentary situation.

i also fight high ambitions and perfectionism and wanting to hand in the Best. Part of me though is like dude please chill, just see that you hand it in at all and graduate.

433,"So i’ve know. this girl for years , i dated her for a very short period of time, she found a better guy and we both moved in but we have always been really good friends. she’s been with this guy for about 5 years. i know him pretty well. 

about a week ago she texted me randomly around 11 pm while i was with friends, 
shes texting all this stuff about how she thinks i’m more attractive than her bf, she’s always felt attracted to me when she’s around me, i’m the only one that can make her smile all day. she said if she came over she would probabaly do something which took me by complete surprise. 

Now i know people change but this girl was never a slut, she never cheated before, she’s very innocent so for her to say this stuff really really took me by surprise. 

The issue i have is i still sorta have feelings for this girl and i’m worried that she was just Horny when she texted me this stuff. She hasn’t talked to me about it at all since? Idk if this is the right place for this, i just saw advice and was like fuck it. 

thanks",15Sep2020,1

435,"I should specify first of all this does not have anything to do with relationships. I have been happily married for a while now and dont see that changing any. What I am having a problem with is staying committed to just, everything. So many times in my life I have tried writing a book, or making a song, or starting a YouTube or Twitch, but every time i hardly get half way there before turning heel. 

I keep beating myself up over this day and night because I know I have some legitament talent and I want to share it with the world. I have a huge fear of dying with all these ideas in my head and none of it on paper. I often start a project, and then get a little bit invested in it, before I think that maybe it isnt worth it because what's even going to happen when its done? Who's going to care? Who's going to watch, listen, or read it? And even if I did finish it, it's probably going to be terrible and not get off the ground at all.

I have been out of high school for about 4 years now, and in between keeping up with a relationship, and struggling at a soulless job, this problem is getting worse by the day. I'm at a point where I'm just starting to feel numb and cant get motivated to do absolutely anything because I know I wont go through with it. Its eating me up inside, I crave artistic energy in my life, and I desperately want to share it with people who might like it even if it's only a few, but I'm caught in this never ending cycle. On my days off I sit on my couch, doing absolutely nothing but occasionally playing games that dont even give me pleasure anymore. For a while I thought this issue was just a little thing I do, i have many different talents and different ways to express myself and I just jump around from one idea to another, never focusing on finishing just one, and that wasnt a big deal. It was just into so many things and dabbled here and there. But now its killing me inside, and I dont want to go out without saying I did something. 

If there are any suggestions or habits you may have that I can put in my life please say them, I need help.",15Sep2020,1
436,"The cluster diagnosis affects less than 2% of the population if you don't include comorbid disorders. Everyone you meet, 98% of the time it's just their personality. Cluster B people have differences in their brain. 

People are obsessed with putting my parents and (recently me) into cluster diagnosis cause they didn't expect that I would make fertilizers out of their rancid mooching asses. 

My mother and dad are very generous. Usually I'm grateful if someone does something for me, but these people just resent us cause we are better, we never faced a single problem in our life cause we use our heads and work hard rather than mooch and trash on opportunities of others and borrow stuff from people to cope. They just make excuses. 

These people will never accomplish anything for the most part in their lives. Even when they do, their genes are so parasitic it is going a uphill battle against your own conditioning. They are already mooching off and parasitically ruining their own families since they were born and my fault is I'm in their radar of garbage storm. It's not just me. 

My parents are the most ethical and hardworking people I've ever met. I'm not saying this cause they are my parents. I'm definitely the more 'evil' one out of them. However, since I'm sweet to everyone, I get the perfect selfless card instead of my parents cause my parents are exponentially better off than them and have a much better attitude. It's not a diagnosis, it's 20 years of right decisions and hardwork and yes, raw intelligence. 

We are all neurotypicals, cause we checked, I checked more than twice, but that stated while I am not obsessed with people dynamics cause I'm my biggest fan, like you are not worth the attention in your own brain even for you, your brain tells you already you are garbage to focus at, which is why you can't focus on yourself. You all come from people who have spend their entire lives eating their hearts out when other people do well. You could obviously go for therapy for 'that' instead. 

What can I say? If I was born one day and I had the roles reversed and I was born in your life, I will commit seppuku or do everything I can to get back to my life. I am very happy with what I have. I have people literally running operations to win my heart for years so that they can buy into my lifestyle and mooch of my 'narcissistic' parents and then they wonder why would I stick with my teenage boyfriend who actually loves me for me and is not a parasitic retard.

I'm nice cause I think not having control over your emotions is for dogs, but I'm not gullible, and also that nice is a card for I don't shout, I 'kill' metaphorically, parasites.

Edit : Another thing which annoys me is why they don't understand that there is no such thing as a person with narcissistic, sociopathic, adhd and ocd traits who is also a psycopath. If you are gonna throw crackpot theories on me, atleast do your research. I don't know why they can't figure it out. It's either the reason people become flat earthers (they are the type) or they are retards, actual ones (the ones with brains that are developmentally impaired or having brain damage ). Every one of these diagnosis is not behavior dependent, the people who have them have a different brain type. So, let's say you meet a psycopath, chances he would also have adhd is zero, cause that's not his brain.

Mental disorders are not a way to have a different way to figure out people's astrological signs or myers briggs personality types. 'I'm an Entp and I'm also a sociopath with comorbid ocd' type - ish bs. It's not a way to define yourself and put yourself in categories of other people who also seem narcissistic enough. Most people who are narcissistic are not Hitler for example. It's possible someone may have a diagnosis and show no visible signs of it and seem normal. Infact I'm sure alot of people do that cause persistently acting disruptive only keeps people around you who don't respect themselves. You cant be having a raging meltdown like a dog every time someone gets your order wrong and also be considered a functioning member of society.

Another thing is, let's say someone is narcissistic, part of the 2%, or anything, they don't need to be maligned, they need to be understood and helped to get them treatment.

If you meet people who actually do have stuff like this diagnosed on them, you will find out they are very normal. They don't sit in a basement figuring out their next victim. With proper treatment and rehabilitation alot of them even don't have to suffer their conditions and put a face for the world. I'm not against people who have something diagnosed on them, but labeling their entire character or personality traits on just it being a disorder is wrong, cause alot of people live different lifestyles and its not a way for you to play victim or be a social retard.

Also since I do have friends with diagnosed mental illnesses on them, I don't see them as evil or with pity, unless they deserve it, I see them as people who are them and then this is a detail about their lives. You'd be surprised how normal they are. Which is why when I find some people acting brain damaged using the 'I'm a lunatic' card, I already know how that looks like in real life with people who handle it well, and I treat these people exactly how I would treat someone who is normal but behaving like they have social awareness of a rabid 3 year old.

It's not just the parasitic behavior. It's the stupidity at the point of being a retard comorbid with the parasitic behavior, being delusional and the dunning Kruger effect and they pedestalize me so much, I bet they spend 90% of their lives thinking about me, so also the clinginess. Bit like they are walking around naked and asking me to rate the stuff they are wearing and not expecting me to point out that. I also don't want to be friends or close to them cause of self respect reasons and I assure them as soon as I lose the power over their heads they would find out the best way to get out of the wasteland that is their life is to focus on it. And could you save saying this stuff for your diary or therapist or something? It was fun for a while, but now it's like you have down syndrome or something cause you have fixation issues and this stuff should be obvious to you and you aren't getting it for months or years and I don't want to interact with you.

Final aspect on this :If you are responsible for doing the same stuff as these parasites, in any way, I don't have to report you, I will, but I don't have to, but I am already taking down everyone else and you will go down in the garbage storm. Everyone who maligned me or was in association of the slanderers will also go down, cause I like to feel like I'm thorough on things. So your name will probably come up in court, and if it does, go through due process, if they put that record on you it's not my issue.",15Sep2020,1

I didn't notice this before (its a new feature) so measaged his sister and it turns out he committed suicide. I feel horrible.

439,"I've [26F] just moved into a new place and I often sit on the back porch to smoke, one time I was sat on there and saw a lady [50F] rummaging around in the garden next door and assuming that she lived there I got talking to her.

She was very weird and obviously has some sort of mental health problem, a lot of what she says doesn't make sense and she started showing me all of her ""treasures"" which were obviously just things she'd found on the street or taken from other people's bins. It was a strange interaction, but friendly. She gave me a couple of biscuits and went on her way.

The next time I saw her she was walking down my street with her luggage and no shoes, I asked if she was alright and she told me that she's homeless and she needs a place to stay. Not really feeling like I could just turn her away, I told her to come inside and stay for one night. She came inside and was very hyperactive and unpacked all her cases in my spare room but then disappeared for the rest of the night and didn't actually end up staying.

After that she started turning up at my house a couple of times a day asking me if I'd look after various things for her and going on long jumbled monologues that don't make sense and staying about an hour each time. She's also started bringing me ""gifts"" of pieces of scrap metal and asking me to borrow money (I haven't given her any, I don't have any)

This morning I woke up and she'd left three bags of trash in my yard as ""gifts"" , and a wheelie bin she'd obviously stolen from one of my neighbours. The trash is an inconvenience but if she's started taking things from my neighbours it becomes a bit of a problem.


I've tried talking to her about her situation and giving her the numbers for homeless shelter's etc. But because of her mental health issues I don't think she's really taking it on board. It's like on one hand she knows she's homeless but she also has this delusion that she's a rich entrepreneur and it's stopping her from reaching out to any services because she thinks she's going buy a house - she tells me she's on her way out to buy a new house every day after I get her out of mine.


I honestly don't know what to do about her. On one hand she's really exhausting and I'm not really equipped to be dealing with her, on the other hand she's just a person who needs a bit of help and I feel bad turning her away. I don't want to call the police or anything like that because I don't think it'd be helpful to her. Any advice would be much appreciated",15Sep2020,1

448,"Hi! So i’ll try to make this as short as possible. 

I am not a perfect person, and I am well aware of this fact. 

Recently, school has started and it’s being taught through distance learning (online). I am in my senior year and I’m a concurrent student. My college classes this semester are time-consuming and more difficult. I don’t have a job either so I can 100% focus on school and my future in college. 

Because of my schoolwork being all completely online, I find that I would be cooped up in my room for hours at a time. Sometimes it would be all day, from the moment I wake up (08:00) to until when the school day would normally be over (16:00). My mother gets irritated at me when I am locked in my room like this. 

I know I should be making more time to help her throughout the day with the younger siblings and chores around the house. But I can’t help that school just genuinely keeps me busy. Even though she doesn’t work a full time job anymore (she quit her job two months ago and does a side job like ubereats whenever she is available), I understand that I shouldn’t shrug all of it off for her to do. And I try not to. I do all the laundry in the house, I do dishes and alternate with her, I watch the kids when needed, and I clean around the house sometimes. Not so much cleaning or spending time with the kids when I am busy during the weekday, but I do during the weekend mostly. 

I try my best to be there for her, but there are many days where I need to be cooped up to finish assignments and meet due dates.  

My mother also makes me feel guilty and worthless whenever I focus on work.I feel like a part of her thinks I’m faking doing homework the whole time, and that’s why she’s so angry. But I do do my work the whole time. I give myself occasional brain breaks but that’s it. Whenever I give myself breaks and go out of my room, she would have anger written all over her face. I would ask her a question and she would deliberately ignore me. And only me. When she does answer my question (I ask her about her day, or what she had cooked. Simple things), she would answer in an unfriendly tone. 
This happens so often that I already know when it’s about to happen. What recently happened was that she told my sibling to act as if I didn’t exist, since I don’t help around the house anyways. I heard it from my room. She honestly makes me feel like a shitty person. But maybe I am and I deserve it because I don’t help her enough. I know it’s a stupid reason, but I feel melancholic when she treats me like that. I cry about it in my room and I am wondering how I can do better for her. 

Anyways, my question is what should I do to anger her less? For any parents out there, what would you want your eldest child in the house to do to in this situation? Please let me know how I can improve myself so I can avoid that kind of situation entirely.

459,"Extreme, right? I know. It's a severe accusation. This is what happened...

So (some backstory) this coworker is a devoted MAGA supporter. He's always going out his way to stir shit up with people for the sake of arguing with them. He's very well known for this behavior. His most recent thing is he's an anti-masker and refuses to wear one. So he got banned from going into the office unless he does wear one, but he thinks he won this situation because ""they'll have to beg me to come back to the office, and even then I won't wear a mask."" Reality check, everyone is happier that he's not around the office anymore.

So just yesterday he called me up to help him with mounting a new panel box outside a warehouse, pulling wire into it, and landing the connections. Just us two in a warehouse working together for hours. That's all well and good, whatever. The weather's bad and we're discussing how we're considered ""essential workers"" whereas most of the company has gone home.

This is when he begins mocking that scene in Schindler's List where the guy says he's an essential worker and gets shot. He's making a reference to how unimportant we really are despite being considered essential. I didn't laugh, so he doubles down and makes fun of that scene where the kid is missing an arm. Still, I don't laugh, but I said, ""The movie's a tragedy you know, right? It's not a comedy."" He laughs and triples down by referencing how he's been to the Holocaust museum in Washington and begins talking about actual death footage he saw, reenacting the people by pantomiming their deaths, and generally just making noise and laughing at his own bullshit.

I said, ""What's wrong with you? Have empathy for those people."" He then calls me a snowflake and begins getting into a really, really enthusiastic history lesson about how Hitler's Nazi party were socialists and not fascist, and the differences between White Supremacy/Nationalism and actual Nazis.

It was when he was talking about a Nazi parade in New York in the 1930s sponsored by Macy's that I shook off the shock a bit from hearing him talk like this and I began recording his voice on my phone. I recorded him giggling like a school girl talking about this parade and sent the audio to my wife. I told her to save it.

He began telling me that he has a buddy of his, a 60-year-old woman he straight-up name-dropped and said what city she lives in, has inherited her father's Nazi memorabilia. He said she has a whole room complete with a signed copy of 'Mein Kampf', a book he's read twice. I recorded him saying this too, but honestly it was inaudible due to how low he was talking.

He did all this while we finished up the job and I left. An hour later, I called our boss and told him this entire story.

Unfortunately I'm not at work today because my wife is having minor surgery, but I am sitting here in silence of the waiting room wondering if he was just bullshitting to get a rise out of me that I never gave him.

  Recently I moved about an hour and a half away for school. One of my best friends who I have been friends with since I was about 12 or 13 lives back home and I haven’t got to see her that much. She came to visit one time and had planned to stay the night but ended up leaving early due to family issues back home so I only saw her for a few hours. Since I’ve been here I’ve had classes every single day and after those classes I do the work I have for other classes so I don’t have much free time. I haven’t been texting anyone not even my parents due to my lacking in free time. 


  While I’ve been here I’ve gotten a new boyfriend and we’ve been spending a lot of time together getting to know one another and I really enjoy his company. My friend expressed to me that when she visited she didn’t like my boyfriend even though she only briefly met him. 


  Today I asked her if she would like to meet my boyfriend next weekend when I go back home and she left me on read. I texted her multiple times with no reply. She then replied and was angry with me and said she feels like I don’t care about her and that I care about my new boyfriend more than her. I had to leave my zoom class meeting because I was having a panic attack because she was causing me so much anxiety. 

  
 I have been spending a lot of time with my new boyfriend and haven’t been texting her as much but when she came in I left hanging out with my boyfriend to pick her up and hang out with her.

I got myself into a pretty bad situation. I was tasked with making a script for a video and I was really stressing about it and I just couldn't write anything down so instead of being a responsible person and saying that to my boss, I decided to find a video script online from a pre exisiting video and adapt it. I then submitted it and my boss approved it. I now have two things I would like advise on 1) I'm unsure if this comes under fair use as all the information is public, would say maybe 50% of the video script is the same and the video is educational (no ads) but it has like a 3 second ad at the end of the video. Does this consitute as fair-use ? 2) Do I tell my boss or just not tell him and hope he doesnt find out about it? 3)How do I tell my boss I need to change the script without making him think badly of me and I very much would like him as a reference for me in the future.

This will probably get lost in new but I would really appreciate your advice",15Sep2020,1

I would just like a little advice, i know there’s a lot of older and wise people out there. i’m 20 years old and for backstory, i’ve been overweight for most of my life, mainly late middle school and all through high school. having said that, i feel like i’ve missed out on a lot of things in life that i enjoy, i’m good with people and i’m not a debby downer by any means. but being invited to parties and going to beaches or even going to prom or homecoming were things i never did and i regret, i feel like high school was supposed to be the best years of my life and i missed out.

So i graduate high school, i worked full time until i decided with my parents with the support of them that i would start college, i finished 1 year and did pretty well passed all my classes. then my dad passed away december 30th of 2019. i feel like i was already upset about my life before and how things were going but seeing my dad pass away in that manner and having to try and do CPR on him myself to try and save him has scarred me to say the least. now at this point i’m really in a rut. i only took 2 classes after this event and failed horribly. i was forgetful, i couldn’t think clearly, i slept all day. on top of this i lost my job due to pandemic. my mother has financially taken a hit due to her business being slowed because of said pandemic and also because of funeral expenses. i’ve been trying to apply to jobs with no success and sometimes mother makes me feel like a bum for not having one when i feel like i’m trying. i didn’t ask for any of this to happen. I just feel like my life since middle school has been on a constant decline, from missing out on life’s great experiences and feeling like i just “exist” at this point, to losing my best friend. i feel like the only reason i’m still around is because i don’t want my mom to pay more funeral expenses. and i feel like that’s not the way to live either. 


i’m sorry if this was rather all over the place. i’ve not really been clear minded, since december, drugs and alcohol have entered the picture.

Today, one of my colleagues (60something M) from one of the smaller subsidiaries went on what I would describe as a passive aggressive mansplaining rant to/at my boss in a meeting, about something she obviously understands just as well, if not more so, than him. 

I don't normally do the ""take offense on other people's behalf"" thing but it bothered me, and has been bothering me since.

From what I've been able to tell, my new boss is a capable, strong woman who doesn't need my help. So there's that.

I also don't want to bring it up, if it's not something that has bothered her, or if she is handling it.

But on the other hand I dont want to make her feel like nobody noticed or cared, and I want to let her know that it bothered me.

Yesterday I came home and my boyfriend was crying and having an anxiety attack because he says he is not sure if he wants the dog anymore. He loves animals and he has his family dog at his parents house (we live in an apartment) and he said between school and work he doesn’t think he can take on another load. We got into a car accident a few months ago and he was hurt pretty bad and had to be out of work and today is his first day back. On one hand I think he is just overwhelmed and needs time to adjust but then he talks about how long we will have him and he is a huge responsibility. This is a fairly new relationship so I feel like we need to focus on each other before we bring another creature into this. Or maybe we just aren’t meant to have a dog? I’ve always said I’m note of a cat person and I’ve only had cats in my life but he is deathly allergic so that’s not an option. He’s told me he wants one really bad too but he literally can’t. Then I think about this pup and he’s so sweet but maybe I don’t like dogs as much as I thought I did? Little things keep making my disdain grow.

489,"First: sorry for any mistake, English is not my first language. 

A little bit of context here. 
I’m a student, my university is in another city so I moved from my hometown 5 years ago. This is gonna be my last year. 
I got a part time job in the field I’m studying for; I don’t make much but I’m happy (plus is perfect, since I’m still studying) 
My girlfriend is unemployed but looking for a full time job; she’s already doing a few job interview and we’re trying to stay positive. Sadly, where we live there’s not many opportunities, so it’s hard to find a good job. 

When I got the job, we decided to take the next step in our relationship and find a place on our own; is been two months I’m looking for a cheap apartment, and we stumble upon this house which is a real dream. 
But. 
But. 
Rent is a bit higher than what we wanted to spend; there’s a pellet stove, so warming during winter will be cheaper than having a centralized warming. Everything else in the house is electric. We’re worried for the electricity cost (like, there’s an induction cooker... And I know it get expensive on the bills). 
Everything is new, because the landlord recently renovated; so theoretically electricity shouldn’t cost that much with a new electrical system?? 

Besides that... is perfect. Is a small cute little house, is new, in a perfect zone of the city... rent is high, but we can still manage. The bills tho... are the real unknown. 

I should add: when I reach out to landlords I often get back a negative response, because we are a gay couple. Even if I don’t say anything, the moment I mention that we are two girls, they say no. We live in a very homophobic country, so I’m not surprised, but that makes the few places we see the only options available.

490,"Hey, looking for a little input or advice to ease my mind or something. 

I accidentally deleted this before so sorry it's a repost - Im new and clicked too much lol. 

So my current gf (L) and I met about 3 years ago at work, we work in a small business so we work together fairly often. I initially had feelings for her first, but when I pursued them she turned me down, I backed off but the feelings didn't go anywhere even if I had gone on a date with another girl that I maybe clicked with better or whatever, probably due to working together mostly but whatever. About a year later she confessed she liked me too, but wasn't sure if it could work so we were pretty on and off for about 7 months after that, it was draining but I had my heart set on her. I met a friend who worked down the street around this time, and we got really close, she had a lot in common with me and we just got on well, she did have feelings for me but she was respectful when I told her about L, we still got really close anyways and she never brought it up again. Anyways, L and I's relationship was really complicated, we could never hangout alone and we didn't have any mutual friends really so we didn't see eachother outside of work really, (It was religious reasons on her end) we did argue a lot about our religious differences because there was a lot of pressure for me to study the bible more, she didn't like me hanging out with other girls (before we even started dating). By the time L decided she wanted to actually date me, I was already feeling on the fence and we were fighting a lot but I was feeling better now that we were 'official' She wanted me to stop hanging out with my friend that had feelings for me, and who I was really close to and because of my friend's feelings I decided that was reasonable so we stopped hanging out but still talked online a decent amount.

I was initially upset because this friend and I were so close, but I understood L's reasoning, but it made me more upset when L didn't start hanging out with me to replace the friend, or just in general since we were 'dating' now, it felt lonely. I started to realize I had developed feelings for my friend but had pushed them down a lot, and being away from her made me a bit resentful in my relationship and I didn't exactly pinpoint why right away, but when I did I felt guilty and stopped talking to the friend as much. I felt as if I would maybe be better off with my friend after about 2 months of actually dating, I felt isolated and torn. I ended up breaking up with L and I didn't tell her it was because of my feelings for this friend, but because I felt we were incompatible (I think my friend really showed me this). After the breakup I spent a few days wallowing, feeling sad but also relieved and I ended up confessing my feelings to my friend, I told her I wasn't ready for something serious yet, (Although I do think I wanted that but it felt too soon) I don't know if I was just worried about L's feelings or what but anyways we ended up actually hooking up a few times and got really close again and it made me super happy for a while but I eventually crashed and ended things because I realized it was too soon and I couldn't give her something serious and that is what she wanted. Fast forward, It's been about a year since I've seen that friend outside of passing by, we haven't been close in about 6 of those. L and I recently reconciled, things have been so much healthier this time, she isn't as controlling, she isnt pressuring me, we see eachother more and I realized and worked on a lot of my own shit too. Before L and I got back together I did tell her I hooked up with my friend a couple times, and that I thought I had feelings for her, but I never told her that it had a lot to do with why we broke up and I feel guilty and bad for this, and like I left her for someone else and her not knowing that is being deceptive or something. Id love any input, or advice on if im being crazy or if I should have or should tell her this. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Back together with ex, hooked up with close friend after break up. I did tell my gf about the hook up but I never told her I had feelings for this girl before we broke up and that those feelings led to the break up too. Am I being dishonest? Should I tell her or is her knowing we had a small 'fling' after enough?",15Sep2020,1
491,"I applied for a major in my desired field. Notifications about whether you got accepted came in online. For whatever reason, I could not log in the last few weeks. Only yesterday logging in was possible. This was after sending an E-Mail on Friday and receiving an answer yesterday that there were no problems with my log in account. Anyway, then I realized that I would have had to print out the application and have send it to the university by the 8th of September.

I'm asking for advice on how to convince or what to tell them. A friend told me to just tell them that I sent out the application as they don't know if I actually did.

However I'm not sure but when I logged in yesterday, there was a notification that said ""  The submission of the enrollment application is no longer possible because the enrollment deadline has expired "".

The bedroom my brother (now 20) and I (now 19) moved into had a broken lock, which was a problem for me because I value my privacy and with the way MMH “parents”, I felt like he wouldn’t respect that privacy. And I was right. It was fine for a while, but recently he has started walking in whenever he wanted me or my brother to do something. I tolerated it for a while, but now I’m sick of it. I can’t replace the lock because I know that once he knows WHY I replaced it, he’ll just remove it. I can’t talk to him about it because my siblings and I have tried bringing up other problems we have with him, but he just doubles down and acts like he has authority over all of us just because we live under his roof. My sister (now 18) and I are planning to move out in January if all goes well, but how how can I stop this guy from barging in until then?",15Sep2020,1
503,"I know that I should not be hating on anyone but all my love for him turned into disgust and hatred especially when I saw him liking a photo of his fuck buddy and restricted my view of his FB. 

I broke it off as soon as I found out and blocked him entirely. It took that moment for me to realize how he played me and all my love for him. It was at that moment that I realized all the things I kept denying.

He is a piece of scum and I loathe him.😡😡😡

504,I (26m)just have a really dark childhood. My parents used to give me hell and I dread having the same surname as them. Am I being stupid in thinking I’ll feel a little better about myself if I change my surname? They are one is deceased and the other one and I don’t speak much. I just feel like changing my surname and being my own person. What’s all your thoughts on this?,15Sep2020,1

I am asking on behalf of a friend who lives in the UK. He suspects he has sleep apnea due to his symptoms and would like to know if the NHS provides treatment for sleep apnea. Will he need a referral from a GP? What are the cost for consultation and treatment?

507,So we meet through mutual online friends about 6-7 years ago. We hit it off when we first started playing and always looked forward to playing with each other the next day. I thought about her constantly and eventually added each other on Facebook and talked on there every night for hours. Skip ahead a few months and she got a boyfriend and I got a girlfriend. We kind of stopped talking and messaging because we agreed it wouldn’t be best for either of our relationships.(though still gamed and had a great time!) skip ahead again about 2 years and we had both broken up with our SO. We started gaming a ton more together and starting talking throughout the day/night. I woke up 1 morning and went to say good morning and accidentally without thinking said “good morning beautiful”. She answered back good morning with a smiley face and I said I was sorry and hope I didn’t offend her by saying that to which she replied that she didn’t mind and since then I always say it in the morning! Now the problem I’m having is I don’t know if I should ask if it’s something she would wanna pursue but risk making it awkward and losing one of my best friends. We live roughly 6 hours away from each other and she has already mentioned that she wants to come visit some time. I feel like we both have feelings for each other but I’m scared of losing my friend but would love to take the next step. Any advice or comments would be appreciated!,15Sep2020,1
508,"Hello I'm 19 and studying my first year of Journalism. I don't know if that's what I want to do with my life. Also, I don't know where to start looking in terms of jobs. I'm coming to Reddit because there are some very wise people here and I trust you guys and appreciate any advice. I also posted this to others subreddits...

I have a knack for creative writing but I don't enjoy talking about politics in general. (I took Journalism so there are more options for me) I am kind of an introvert so I started a YouTube channel, in hopes that if I talk over doing something I enjoy I could gain more confidence. I also started drumming recently because I love music (particularly rock).

Taking all of this in mind, is there a paticular job that I will do well in? If there isn't, I wouldn't mind working at something like a coffee shop or restaurant until I find something better. I'm not enjoying Journalism but my parents won't let me drop out unless I have some sort of plan. Also let me know if there are improvements I should make to the post.

511,"**Essential Clarification :** Answering my question, bear in mind it's believed that there is sound knowledge of grammar(upper-intermediate) and necessary vocabulary (about 1000-1500 words, maybe more, maybe less) of the studied language.  Also I cannot help saying that I do not speak English well, so be easy on me ;)

Long story short, I got troubles with my English lexicon, especially with complicated words like ""comprehensive"", ""concerning"" and so on. More precisely, I'm struggling with contex, I mean, in English there is diversification of translations of one particular word. There are some difficulties with pronunciation as well. Because of it, I have no idea If I properly use word. This problem is getting frustrating. It lasts for a long time, as long as I'm really through with it.    


And, frankly, I'm fed up with pointless learning various words, so I decided to learn English more passively, for instance, listening to English music while looking through translation of this song, or watching movies/Youtube with English subtitiles, while look into dictionary.  Eventually, crucial question - will there be benefit of such way of studying ?",15Sep2020,1

514,"Hello, I'm new to this sub and joined specifically because of this so hopefully it fits. 

I recent went back to work after being furloughed because of the pandemic, but I'm at a different location than I was before. I didn't think this would make a huge difference because it was the same position I had before and I thought I was pretty good at my job. 

I've been there two weeks now and I am constantly anxious. Not even because we are busy or anything crazy has happened but two of my coworkers (one at my level and one superior) are constantly stressed and anxious. Every time I come into work, it seems like there's something they're really worried about that ends up not being a big deal. There also hasn't been a time that I've come into work and not have them point out something small that I'm doing wrong. Something that if I did it at my old location wouldn't have been an issue. 

I feel like their anxiety is rubbing off on me where I am constantly worried about how I'm doing and if I'm doing everything wrong. I feel like I don't know where I stand, if I'm positively contributing to the team or messing everything up. I actually came home and cried last night because I was anxious about going into work today. I personally know that things aren't as bad as they seem and a lot of this stuff is blown out of proportion, but when coworkers act like its the end of the world I don't know how to not think of it that way myself.",15Sep2020,1

So I bought a new and great on for 1200, but the process is really frustrating and annoying. I don't know how to use the programs properly and I am spending too much time figuring things out rather than making things.

Learning the programs feels mind-numbing and I just can't concentrate. There some courses but you have to pay fir those and I don't have anymore money left.

525,"So my friend (and my sons godfather) has been clearly intentionally excluding me and my family for some time now. I thought we were back on track for a little while but now it has become clearly obvious that he's cutting us out. Really it all started a couple years ago when he just out of the blue called my wife, tore into her about how we never do anything with him and his family anymore.  He was pretty brutal about it and made her cry and she didnt know how to handle it, so I called him up and explained that because our kids were much older than his and were in sports one or both of us was always out of the house until 8 or 9 at night, and we were lucky to get one day during the weekend off.  Things got better for a while, then took a little dip again because one of our mutual friends committed suicide and that strained everyone, but we got through that.  Then this summer came around and he has been inviting all of our mutual friends to do things with him, going boating, dirtbike riding, bbqs at his house, etc, etc and hasn't once invited us. I looked back through my texts, and he hasn't texted me since may (I've texted him numerous times and he always responded, but as far as an initiation, he hasn't since may) and I know it sounds super shallow of me but he hasn't liked a single Facebook post of mine since april. It really pissed me off that everyone of our mutual friends first day of school kids pictures he managed to like, but couldnt find it in him to like his own godson's picture.  To be honest, I'm ready to just say fuck it and cut my losses because friendships shouldnt have to be this much work, but we've been friends for almost 20 years now, and my son looks up to him so much because before all this bullshit he was teaching him so much about motocross riding. I'm not sure what to do here, wife says let it go because whenever we get together with all of our other friends and hes there it'll be wierd,  but to me it's already wierd.

529,"In my career I am quite senior in an organisation that if I am honest, I have at the best of times minimal interest in and at the worst of times I loath it. I have over the past number of years earned qualifications in another industry &amp; am slowly moving to create my own business, I've taken small steps and have a handful of clients but so far it has been immensely rewarding but it is not yet financially supportive. That will take time and I accept this.

My request for advise is to anyone who might have done what I'm doing, how did you endure and maybe you did something else or figured out a better way of managing it? I'm a really conscientious person who loves to help people but am surrounding by people in an organisational structure that at times seems to thrive on malice and appropriation of blame. 

What has prompted this questions is related to my first child, born in May this year, a little boy he's doing great and to say I am crazy about his is an understatement of huge proportions. With COVID-19 I've been with him so much and it's amazing. 

For the first time since I lost my mother 10 years ago I actually cried recently. Why? I was holding my son and it hit me how happy i was then and there with him. Pure happiness. Conversely it hit me how unhappy I am in the job and have been for a decade now. I felt really ashamed and embarrassed. Sorry i might not be labeling the emotions correct but I think that's what it was. 

I logged into work that morning and sobbed uncontrollably (albeit quietly) for an hour. 

I have looked at moving to other companies in this space but it seems like it would be more of the same +learning curve +associated risks of any job move. In fact I moved internally recently to a new role and my initial positive attitude has been well and truly squashed based on what I have seen so far, more of the same and people just being terrible to other people.

531,"I really don't know how to deal with my stepfather at home anymore. I, (19F) cannot stand him. He is the most aggressive, disrespectful person that I know and I don't know how to handle it anymore.

He's about 20 years older than her, so age has always been a problem in their relationship. They've been married for about 12 years but things have progressively gotten worse. He's had brain surgery a few years ago and his anger and hotheadedness has increased tremendously over things that are very minimal. For example, my mother was going to spend some time playing a few games with me after I got home from being away for a while. She went and even asked him permission to do so since i guess they were going to watch a TV show, and he basically yelled at her and told her to ""do whatever the fuck you want to do"", and whenever she tells him he's being unreasonable he'll gaslight her and mock her, basically saying ""yeah you know what, you're right! I'm being so unreasonable. You're always right, I'm always wrong"". He does this so much, and it makes me feel so shitty whenever he talks to her like that. 

I avoid him like the plague and basically just never leave my room because I no longer feel comfortable in my house downstairs since he's always there. My mom thinks I am being unfair by not saying hello to him everyday or asking him how he is, but i just always feel so much resentment and hate towards the things he's done to me and to her. He acts like he has a say over my choices even though he isn't my dad. (I am still very close to my father, who actually has a say in my life). He's yelled at me in the past for hanging out with my boyfriend in my room with my door closed, even though I am 19 and have been with my boyfriend for years. He basically got up in my face and said how dare I do that, I trusted you, blah blah blah. He's said things about me which I've also overheard him saying to my mom before. He's basically called me a lazy ass before because I didn't answer the door when his amazon package arrived, because I was in the bathroom. Meanwhile, he's been retired for the 12 years they've been married and his day consists of him sitting on the computer, watching TV or eating. He has a dog too which is neglected. It barely ever gets walked, barely ever gets bathed and somehow will still have accidents inside because I guess he doesn't even let it out enough. He literally does nothing. My mom even drives him to every appointment he has even though he has a car and a license. 

Also, my mom works a 9-5 job but yet he still can't help out. He makes disgusting messes in the kitchen and will never clean up after himself. He shaves at his computer and leaves hair everywhere, never washes his hands (my mom actually has to fucking ask him to wash his hands which is disgusting). She should not be cleaning up after a grown man who has all the time in the world. 

I've also talked to my mother so much about all of this. I've told her that I wish she would see that she deserves better and that he does not respect her. It's terrible living here. She just makes excuses for him saying it's because he's getting older, which I understand, but when does enough become enough? How much can he get away with because he's old? She's basically admitted she isn't happy and he's threatened to leave multiple times but it always ends in saying that there's gonna be a change, he's gonna try this time. It never happens, always goes back to the same old aggressive asshole. The other day he knocked on my door and basically gave me the most half-assed apology I've ever heard. It was just a backhanded apology that ended with him saying I've done some terrible things to him (which I guess consist of avoiding him?) and he told me he wants to bury the hatchet. The thing is, I said sure, fine, but should I forgive him for the things he does? Especially if he is going to continue to be super disrespectful to my mother? Plus what am I supposed to do differently now? Pretend everything is fine because he said that and act like I'm his friend and say hi to him and converse? He's the way he is and he won't respect my mother or I anymore than he did before.

Any advice with this situation would be really appreciated, I just don't know what to do anymore. also sorry if this is all over the place, it's a very hard situation to explain.

Also just a note, things were not always like this. I was not bitter towards him in the past and he was welcomed with open arms into our family. Things got like this when he started acting like an asshole towards my mother and I.",15Sep2020,1

Anyway, my classmates are really good and I feel like I’m not, everyone in that class auditioned to be there and got a scholarship. So in my first class I realized that they were way ahead of me and it seems to be that my teacher asked the kid that sits next to me to tutor me. I told my boyfriend about this and he didn’t express any jealousy whatsoever. So this kid asks for my number so we can meet out of class, and we do . No flirting, in fact he calls me bro, pal, dude, kiddo, etc. And I do not feel attracted to him AT ALL he is definitely not my type. Anyway, he’s had my number for about 5 weeks now and we do not have any other conversations except for setting a meeting time once a week. I always ask my bf if he would like to come with, when I have class and even when I’m meeting with this kid. He says no. Yesterday after class, I get home and he messages me about a conversation we were all having, and I replied, he then goes on asking about music related stuff. Which I keep replying to because, I mean, there is nothing wrong with it I feel like. It’s not inappropriate, there is no flirting and it’s not like we talk everyday. So as I’m replying to a message, my bf sees this and starts freaking out. He starts calling me a slut and a piece of shit because I’m talking to other dudes. He said “you know better, you’re a cheater, no dude friends are allowed” I tell him that I don’t consider him my friend, but that it’s inevitable for me to not talk to dudes when I’m the only girl in that class. He reads the messages and sees that nothing inappropriate is said, but still believes I’m a slut just because I had a conversation with him. I honestly don’t know what the fuck I should do, I mean, I’ve told my bf about face to face conversations that I’ve had with this kid and he didn’t say nothing about it. like he doesn’t care that I talk to him in class or outside of class, but a conversation over text makes me a piece of shit? He even tried kicking me out of the house. I feel like he’s overreacting but obviously he doesn’t think that way. I really love him and this is the first time that something like this happens. I said I was sorry for not telling him that he was messaging me yesterday, and that I probably should’ve done that just so it don’t seem like I was being sneaky about it. He ignored me.

538,"I am a meat department manager for a small, family owned grocery store. I have worked at the store for almost 8 years, about 5 in the meat department and 3 as manager. There are three of us that work in the department. Me, a meat cutter and a wrapper. 

The problem I am having is that I end up doing at least 75%, if not more, of the work. Most of the time when we get done with our cleanup for the day, the meat cutter will go sit in the office and talk to browse the Internet. Meanwhile, I am filling the case, doing backstock or writing an order for the next truck. The meat wrapper is completely lazy and worthless. I do more wrapping each day than he does, and I constantly have to fix mistakes he's made when putting up the lunchmeat that we've gotten in or mispricing items. 

This is not something that I can go to the owners of the store with. They don't take anything seriously and like to either use passive aggressive notes instead of addressing individual people, or just completely ignoring problems until they become major issues (mainly equipment needing maintenance). Myself and the meat cutter are the only people in the entire store that known how to cut meat, so planning vacations or days off is almost impossible, and if one of us is sick the other one is screwed. 

My wife knows how much stress I'm under and how much I hate it, but she doesn't want me to try and find another job because I'll have to commute. We live in a small, rural community and I'd have to drive at least 30-45 minutes for a decent paying job. The only real benefits to this job is it's a steady paycheck, I get profit sharing, five paid sick days (which I never use) and two weeks paid vacation, I don't have that far of a drive, and it's almost impossible to get fired from here. But when I look at how much work I'm doing and how much crap I have to deal with, it really doesn't seem worth it. 

I don't know how to make my wife realize how much this is affecting my mental health (I've dealt with anxiety and major depressive disorder for well over a decade).",15Sep2020,1

I went through a breakup a few months back &amp; thought I may have had someone interested in me from work, but alas I was rejected not only by my ex who I loved, but by the guy I developed feelings for whilst with the ex. 

My relationship with my ex wasn't awful. He was one of the better things in my life, so when our relationship stared to crash &amp; I lost him I relapsed into a depression hard. It was sometimes great, but the passion just fizzled out &amp; we were both forcing it along longer than it should've lasted. As far as the crush goes, he was my boss &amp; he's still seems like a really good guy, although he did absolutely nothing with my number. I think he saw me for what I was, a wreck. I just want men off my mind. I don't want to tie my self worth to being unloved by men. I know not all men are bad, but my dad was pretty rough with me &amp; my mother growing up &amp; he physically assaulted me a few years ago. It all started with him.

My mother is on vacation and my grandmother is currently staying at my mother's house(lives with her). I've been going over to her house a little more frequently to check up on her and make sure she has everything. Usually I go over there every weekend though this week I came back to help her with groceries yesterday.  


She just texted me saying the police showed up to my mothers house saying someone ""called about being hurt"" and asked if she was okay and if there was anyone else in the house. They walked around the house a few times, then sat outside the outside for some time and left.

Now I dont want to assume any foul play on the cops, but I dont know how this could've happened. My grandmother is fine and no one was in the house we have security systems in place and they werent triggered.

Did some robbers  pull in the driveway call 911 then posted up someone down the street to see if someone is still there since now there arent cars parked outside the house at night?   


Did someone tip off the cops about something and they were just trying to access the house? If the call was that somone was hurt why were the paramedics not sent as well? only cops? 

Just trying to piece together why cops were called and why they said they got a call from my mothers house when I know my grandmother isnt in danger and is not hurt.

543,"Every few months, for seemingly no reason at all, I dream about my rapist. Trigger warning for anyone who needs it.

He was my boyfriend for a brief time in high school, and after high school we went out a few times but never made it back into an actual relationship. During one of these ""dates"", we decided to make out in the orange groves near our old school. Things got hot and heavy, and our teenage minds and bodies ended up in the back seat. Still mostly clothed here, I asked if he had a condom. He said no. I didn't have one either -- I seriously hadn't planned on it and had never had sex with him before. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason, he thought I was joking and laughed. I said I wasn't joking, and that he wouldn't dare. I don't know why he assumed it was a joke and took it as a challenge. He penetrated me. I was in shock, and when he saw my face, he withdrew. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not the most traumatic thing to happen, right? Afterward, he took me home, and never spoke to me again. I was hurt, confused, and very angry. I told one of our mutual friends. Over 10 years go by.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, every few months, I will dream about him. Vividly, and for days or weeks at a time. I don't know what triggers this. I would love to not think about him. I am not in contact with him, and would hate to accidentally run into him (unlikely, since I moved a thousand miles away).

I dont think they will be smoking in the house (the smoke outside when working on it and im pretty sure its illegal to smoke inside a sharef building) but anyone thats been to someones house who smokes knows the smell will come in on them and stick to the furniture. My concern is that it will travel through the ducts and stick to my furniture and other things (I love plushies and have a lot of them. I dont want them ruined). I'm not well off by anymeans and cannot afford to (nor do i want too) replace everything when i move eventually.

So why not move? Problem is my apartment is an absolute steal! I pay $950 all included, for a lot of space, a parking spot, and in a damn good neighbourhood. Anything comparable in size and area goes for $1200 with strings attached like gotta pay electical, and water. 

My apartment fits my needs so well. I planned on staying till i had managed to save enough to buy a house. And the new landlord is super nice and wants to do work on my apartment too without raising my rent.

566,"My mom and dad have always fought. As a kid, I was always trying to mediate and rescue them because I was afraid of being abandoned (sometimes my mom would drive off). This lasted until I was about 27-28. I’ve gone and picked up my mom who was drunk walking down the side of the road before. I’ve tried to give them both advice. Sometimes my dad makes suicidal comments but I think he’s just pissed and doesn’t know what to do. When my mom is drunk she’s really inconsiderate and wakes him up all night (she doesn’t work; he does).

I got divorced 2 years ago and had to move back in with them a year ago. Now I get a firsthand view of all of the crazy arguments and incompatibilities 24/7 again. I’m not a kid now, so I will not rescue them and I am not afraid of abandonment like I was. I know life goes on past divorce.

My issue is that with visitation, I have to keep my daughters at their house with me. Almost nightly, they hear my parents yelling and cussing each other out. As far as I’m concerned, these verbal outbursts are violence. And if my daughters aren’t perfectly quiet at night, they get yelled at and have doors slammed in their faces all night.

My dad resents having his sleep interrupted which I understand; however, we don’t get to establish the girls’ sleep schedule—that’s done by their mom. So they stay up a bit later than he’d like. That being said, he will let his temper go and be mean to my girls and act resentful toward me that I’m not spanking them and being mean at night even though those things will only make them cry, not help them sleep. Further, my mom gets herself and them in trouble when she’s drunk at night because she’ll stay in their rooms talking to them, drawing my dad’s ire. I remain calm for them every night to help them feel like there’s a peaceful environment and to help them drift asleep.

My question is: do you think this is a toxic, abusive place the girls should not be? It’s the only place I have so I’m not sure how I’d work around it. Plus they love nana and Pawpaw during the day...but at night, it’s not pretty.

567,"I love many things at once. One time I love to write and the other time creating videos. Sometimes I love to play guitar and after a while I wanna do something else for a change. Now, I just love writing this for a discussion, but it might not be the case tomorrow. Recently, I got hired in a factory and I am starting to like something that I never thought that I would live to do - Assembling mechanical stuffs and this created another desire in me - I wanna learn bike mechanism and hopefully build my own bike someday. I'm studying philosophy now and after that I wanna major in psychology. 

It seems to me that I'm constantly changing and I think everyone is. The modern society just want us to be passionate about ""one thing"" and it's even worse when you don't know what your passion is because you are seen as unambitious (because we really care about what other people think because we are social beings). But for me I think it's okay not to have just one concrete passion or not knowing your passion. I had trouble with this whole passion things because I was cocky. The more I dwelved in it, the more farther away my passions seemed. But when I stopped everything and started doing things that I thought that I won't like, I am liking stuffs like the assembling things. 

I think life is like that and it's okay to be like that. We all need to be comfortable in saying, ""I love to do many things"" whenever someone asks ""what's your passion?"". Its okay to shift through your passion and let go off any ideas about what you like or will not like. Because chances are you will like something that you thought you will never like and vice versa.

Tl:dr: MtF with stress- health problems struggling to complete PhD and transition while living with elderly narcissist parents - what to do?? 

Wall of text following!

To start with I know many people will think I'm a slacker still living with my parents at this age but oh well...

In our society many people continue to live with their parents, especially in large houses.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts come into my mind very jumbled and it's hard to write them down.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now 41 years old, struggling to finish my PhD and living with elderly narcissist parents. I understood they are narcissists only this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

One if not the main reason for my hurdles is that I'm transgender MtF and they are unsupportive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still haven't started HRT yet. Because of long term depression and other issues I've developed severe fatigue and other health problems. Some days I might be a little better but other days I have difficulty walking. Everyday walking upstairs is a struggle. My hands hurt when I try hold heavy things. I can't run or workout because I'll crash. I blead too easily. I used to be super fit few years ago. The downhill started from depression and over training. Basically my body has gone to shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I've been locked in a state of apathy for years and I feel like screaming, crying and breaking things all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mental/ intellectual state has worsened rapidly and with it my memory. I have an extremely hard time remembering anything. It's like my brain is mush. Now others PhD candidates continue working on protocols I edited and things I taught them. I don't want to fail.

&amp;#x200B;

For years and years I wished my mom would accept me as trans. I tried to convince them both by giving them books, papers, telling them to go to the therapist...all in vain, since they didn't want to understand.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasted all my 20s and 30s trying to please my mother and scared of the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has ""threatened me"" multiple times that I can't transition while living in this house. This was ages ago but it happened. Few years ago, before I got stuck in apathy, she threw away all my girl jeans/ clothes I had spent days choosing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now she keeps saying I still don't have money for a pension. I mean, yeah, I frickin tried to finish my (full time) PhD but you kept screaming and didn't allow me to calm down and work normally. She keeps saying i buy useless things ""just like my dad"". Every thing I've bought, I've researched for weeks and months before I've bought it.

&amp;#x200B;

I did try to work while doing my PhD but it proved impossible. The time constraints meant I had to be in the lab most of the time. Plus, around that time I started having really bad headaches but I dismissed them. That was my body's way of saying ""I can't stand dysphoria anymore"", but i ignored it and now I'm paying the price.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom sucks, my dad sucks. I know I sound like a loser. I let myself fail. I know I should have started working way earlier. I just let myself waste time. I still feel like a frickin child at 41. Actually I don't feel anything. I should have had a career long time ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad has left the house in complete disarray. It needs quite a bit of money to be fixed. The basement has humidity issues due to the floor not being insulated properly. I spent months cleaning the basement of his hoarding, deciding what to keep and what to toss, all for nothing. All this while my dad screaming I was throwing away his belongings (old broken junk). I did all this wishing I could move there and transition easier.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All the dreams I had go down the drain. I loved this house. It's in such a nice neighborhood, has a large yard. I used to go biking on Sundays, I can't anymore due to my fatigue. I thought I would find a wife, adopt children and live here. Just as I started to take care of the house and thought ""this is it. Finally I'll live happy here"" I get slapped on the face by all these obstacles. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody in my neighborhood helped their children and now they live together, married, in big houses. I'm not saying I wanted my parents to baby me, it just stings so bad.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom just tells me the house is too big and I don't even have time to clean the yard or work there. Well duh, under this depression and fatigue what did you expect? I did work a lot in the yard when I was ok. My dream was to have a large yard and live here. Technically the house is on my Dad's and my name, not in my mom's. Though my Mom has payed about half of the money for this house.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad sometimes sad ""When I die the house will be yours"". Yeah, the point was to enjoy my life here while they are alive. My Mom tells me they money they have saved is for me and for them in their old age. It's really tricky though. Turns out it's tied-with-strings.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't do this shit anymore, I really can't. I'm stupid for allowing it to go so far. How the fuck am I going to finish my PhD and transition? There is not a chance in hell I can repress my transgender feelings anymore and not transition. I keep on making mistakes again and again. I've been under tremendous stress for far too long.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have enough money to move but if I don't do anything I'll probably fail my project on my PhD and have to give back the money.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me says fuck it, I'll start HRT and when I'm more stable I'll see what I can do. I need some privacy, I want to have a stable job and then see what to do with the house. My parents have clearly shown me with their actions that they don't really care about me.

&amp;#x200B;

People tell me to ""put it aside"" and focus on my studies. Sorry but I just CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. I tried that for years but the only thing I managed was to waste years in an unfunded PhD.  Even now that I'm writing this I'm crying. Few days ago I had to stop while driving -while in the highway- because I started sobbing uncontrollably.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not going to end well at all. There is no way in hell I'm gonna be able to move in the condition I am. I need at least a semblance of stability. 

&amp;#x200B;

What the fuck do I do???",15Sep2020,1
570, My GF right now is in the middle of the path of hurricane sally with her older brother and they decided not to leave but it seems to me like she doesn't care that her life and all the kids of her brother's lives are in danger. They are assuming the storm will just go away and won't affect them and whatever I say she won't listen because she thinks I'm being stubborn when I just want her to live so I can see her again. What do I do?,15Sep2020,1
571,"I pretty much made an account on Reddit because I saw how so many people were able to receive help for different problems in life through this network.

Back story: My mom Is an awesome person, gives her heart and soul to her family. However, the strains of life are definitely having an impact on her. My grandmother just recently passed away, which took a toll on my mother, and her father is still alive and is generally not a good person and brutal father. He demands a lot of assistance from my mom (when he is actually in pretty impeccable health for an 88 year old). She usually has some patients for him, but when he really pushes her, she'll lose her temper, and then feel guilty for weeks on end for it. Guilt runs very deep in my families veins. 

Before Covid hit she was certainly having a hard time managing her father, dealing with the loss of her mother, and still working full time (plus trying to be everything for everyone). She wasn't doing great, but getting by. 

Then covid hit. 

Since then, the news and all of its fearful headlines has totally consumed her. She cannot get off her phone. Every single time we talk she updates me on extremely detailed facts about Covid. She knows everything there is to know about the current vaccine trials. She plays it off mostly like it's a funny quirk of hers, but I see beyond that, when she has fits of anxiety and can't sleep or do anything from all the fear. On top of that, the current political climate as well as the questionable economy has just added fuel to the fire. It's all she thinks about, daily.

All day long, she scrolls through the news and reads these horrible things. 

She is slowly changing from the mom I knew to this stressed out, anxious, angry and on edge person. She has stocked up our basement with rolls and rolls of toilet paper and paper towel (initially I thought the hoarding of the paper towel was funny, but I'm now realizing that this really is a coping mechanism for people who are experiencing distress from what is happening). 

I try to get her off her phone, offering to go for walks together, or to put on a nice movie, but she always goes back to it. She can't stop thinking about everything that's happening around the world. I even at one point got her to see a therapist for the anxiety, but it didn't last long. She goes back and forth between understanding there is a problem and thinking she has it under control. 

My approach is to try and be kind and understanding, but she brings up all these horrible news updates non stop, and I can tell even her friends are starting to avoid her because it's truly exhausting to be around. 

I really don't know if this is a common experince or an isolated problem happening to just my family. 

I'm hoping to get any peices of advice or tips on how to help her? It's really hard to help someone who doesn't want to change, but I just want my mom to be happy again, it seems like no matter what I do, she can't stop digging deeper into this misery and fear.",15Sep2020,1
572,"Hey guys, I(20F) started my first job as a technology associate in the subsidiary of a huge bank. I got placed before I even finished my college. I am eternally grateful that I'm still employed even during the COVID-19 crisis.

It's been two months since I started my new job and I must say it's really not for me. I feel like this middle aged character in a sitcom stuck in a corporate job without anything else going on in his life. I am from a country where students are made to study day and night to get into jobs like these and I honestly was pressured into choosing engineering because that's what everyone felt was a safe choice. I was young and dumb enough to give into peer pressure. It's never too late, I thought. 

But four years down the lane, here's where I ended up. I know I shouldn't be rambling because people who are far more interested in engineering and technology are still jobless and I should be thankful enough to recieve my paycheck every month. I'm from a middle class family, so for my parents, this is a dream come true.

But there's this void inside me and I feel like I should focus on my passion. I love writing and I have always dreamt of writing atleast a couple books and perform few stand-ups before I turn 20. But just when I thought I would give stand up comedy a shot, lockdown was announced nation-wide. I'm still working on a book, but sometimes I feel like no one would read it even if I do publish sometime.

And I'm really interested in jobs that require me to interact with people and get to know them better like counseling, life coaching etc. 

The problem is there are a ton of careers I would really enjoy and make money from, but I am so scared to take a leap. Every creative person I've ever known, had a nichè, they're either funny, or motivational etc. And I still don't know what my 'thing' is? My friends laugh at my jokes often and I really feel happy when people around me are. But sometimes I feel like I'm turning myself into a joke and I discourage myself from being my original self in the fear of being labelled as a try hard.


So yeah, there are numerous times I overthink about shit like this, and give up on my dreams. My fears got the best of me and I'm afraid to let myself go and be a little dangerous.

Anyone who went through a phase like mine, please help. Thank you.",15Sep2020,1
573,"Hi guys im a 17 yo guy, ive been bestfriend with this girl (shes also 17) since middle school where we were in the same class. At that time we talked pretty much every day and there was a good relationship between us (not dating ofc). Now we are in the same highschool but not in the same class. Over the past 3 years of HS we talked much less than before even if we kept in touch for some school stuff. I was starting to like this girl at the moment we started to talk less. Btw now in the present i was feeling pretty lonely, after a break up with my ex that happened a year ago. Because of that i was thinking that if i ever want to be with a girl, it has to be her (my middle school bestfriend) and now i started to like her fr. The problem is that for a while we chatted and talked only about videogames cause she is a gamer girl. The fact that shes into videogames does not bother me ofc, i love that, but i mean to get more close to her i dont want to talk about that topic all the time. Thats problem number 1: how can i change this topic to get more close to her? Problem number 2: in the next school year we'll be in the same building (cause my highschool has 2 different buildings dont ask why) and we'll prob gonna see each other often than before, so how am i supposed to behave with her? When should i ask her to go out? (Plus i know that she's going through a difficult time for a while now, i wanna ask her how things going but already once she said that she was fine and plus, i dont want to make her sad talking about that, so how should i behave with this ""problem number 2.5""?) Pls send some advices cause i rally like this girl, everytime her text pops up on my screen i smile and i feel like shes the perfect girl for me.

574,"How do you dress your newborns/infants/children too young to decide what they wear? 

Being pregnant, I have been thinking a lot about this lately. As parents we have an enormous influence on the lives of our children, especially when they are so young. How I dress them might influence their lives greatly. Do I impose my own view of the world on them by dressing them my way (be it goth, girly or green)? Will how they are dressed change their interaction with others - i.e. is daycare (subconciously) treating a toddler that looks 'upper class' differently from one dressed in washed-out hand-me-downs? Does that mean I should dress them a certain way so they have it easier? Should I impose my values with regard to fashion on them? When is the time when they choose what to wear and how much should I influence their choices? 

What is your opinion on how to dress infants?",15Sep2020,1
575,"My apologies. This is my first time using reddit so not really sure what the etiquette is. I am hoping for some outside perspective on this situation i find myself in. I have been with my wife for over a decade. Prior to this relationship I had a very complicated friendship with another girl, let's call her Kiko. We never dated but we always rode that border and she was my best and dearest friend. We had no secrets and she was there for me in ways that I could never explain. She was my first true love, and I she has always been the one who got away at least on my mind.  When I met my wife my friendship with  Kiko abruptly ended. I always just assumed she had no interest in me and just decided to move on. My wife let's call her Jane was 17 when we met and I was 20. She became pregnant our first year dating and we are still together to this day albeit not on the best terms. Fast forward to a week ago and I was cleaning out a desk and found an old picture CD burned by my wife. On that CD I found screen shots of messages from Kiko pleading for me to please speak to her. Telling me how badly she misses me and what I meant to her, and that my ignoring her was so painful and how she thought I knew how she felt.she ended the final message asking me why I hate her now. I was shocked. At first I was really angry then felt an overwhelming despair for what could of been. I then started to understand. My wife, GF at The time had hidden these messages, IMs, and emails from me. After a few days of trying to process this all I started to understand Janes motivation I think.  She was 17, kicked out of her parents, and pregnant. I don't think she was trying to hurt me, but protect herself. I can't help but feel deceived though and for the last week my heart has been aching. I found Kiko on Facebook. She is married with a family now and looks genuinely happy. I want to contact her to apologize and explain. To tell her I never knew and I wouldn't have ignored her if I had known. I don't want to cause her drama, or more pain. I just want to her to know I never hated her, could never have hated her. I'm being selfish aren't I? Is13 years too late to try and make it right. I don't know what to do. I feel like my soul is being ripped apart.

577,"It’s a long story but essentially, I was watching a sad movie, tears and mucus ensues, tissues are needed, throw them on the ground next to my bed because I didn’t want to stop the movie or get up, fall asleep at 2am forgetting about the tissues.

She somehow manages to turn every conversation we have political, and I listen and wait for her to finish and attempt to redirect the conversation to a different topic. I fully respect her opinions, and whole heartedly believe everyone believes what they believe for a reason. But, it is exhausting to be around her sometimes. She will even interfere when I am talking to my children and try to direct my explanations on things toward her political beliefs - for example; I explained we don’t get wildfires in MI like they have in CA because we get more rain. She interrupts and tries to explain the  environmentalists in CA have mismanaged and caused them.

Me and the wife have been getting along good until recently when she’s admitted to how she actually feels which I understand but she has told me that he doesn’t want to be in the delivery or on the birth certificate and I honestly have a hard time believing that because he acts as if he’s happy about the baby when I send him ultrasounds. That’s the only time me and him talk which is once every two or three weeks when I have appointments. I don’t care to talk to him much. She’s also admitted she’s jealous and I don’t understand why unless she thinks I want him but I don’t and I’ve made that clear so many times. I just have a hard time believing he’s actually said any of that and I’m too afraid to ask him myself in fear of causing problems for all of us. But it’s all making my pregnancy miserable because I wanted him in the delivery room only so he can be on the birth certificate. I don’t want child support money from him. I just want him to help out with things the Baby will need. The only way I will go after child support is if he doesn’t or decides he wants nothing to do with the kid.

TLDR; I'm tired of being sad and upset all the time but my plates so full that I don't know what to do to fix things. I can't really make many cuts in my schedule so I don't have much free time to myself. The free time I do have is spent with those I love because they make me happy in a way I can't seem to do myself.

I get sad really easily, and once I'm sad it's hard to feel better again. Bad things will happen and all day I'll have a heavy feeling in my chest, and sometimes even be on the verge of tears all day. I feel like it's affecting my relationship around me- especially with my boyfriend. He is super supportive but I end up crying like almost every time we hang out- I try so hard not to I just can't help it. He'll either say something super sweet that it makes my cry or I'll get disappointed. I realized last night that the only thing that makes me feel better 100% of the time,,, is cuddling with him.

However, he is his own person!! and I don't think it's very fair of me to expect that every time we hang out. I just wish I could make myself feel better- that's what I truly want. I just can't seem to find what does the trick, the things that used to work don't work anymore. I'm trying to change/work on my attitude to be more positive but it all crashes down the second I start getting super overwhelmed.  These college classes have been a hassle, on top of that I work 3 days a week (T,S,S), and babysit on Mondays. It doesn't sound like a lot... but I can't seem to bring myself to handle it. 

My room is a mess right now, and I feel like I'm not giving my guinea pigs and dog the time and attention they deserve. It's just that whenever I have time I spend it with either my boyfriend or my friends in order to feel happy. What do I do? I was debating cutting one of my workdays but I need the money. I can't cut school, and if I cut my time with my friends/boyf I get worse. 

   This isn't even really everything but the fact of the matter is I'm tired of living like this.... So if you have any ideas at all on how I can get better- please let me know.",15Sep2020,1
594,"I’ve been in a relationship with him for almost two years and he is the man of my dreams. I’ve always trusted him but last week I noticed he liked a few pictures of some girl on Instagram and I got a bad feeling about it. We talked about it and he said he doesn’t recognize her. 

It had still been bothering me throughout the week, and I decided to go through his phone this morning (for the first time in our relationship). It turns out last November he sent a dm to the girl that said “you looked beautiful last night” and he had also sent dms to other girls complementing them and trying to go on dates (including one on Christmas when I was visiting home).

I confronted him about it and he apologized, said he never met up with anybody, and explained it may have been a way for him to validate that that is not what he wants. (There was one girl who said yes to a date that he never texted back, and there was nothing indicating that they ever met up). This was also last year, in the first 6 months of our relationship. 

I just never thought this would be an issue and I planned on being with him forever and I still love him so much and really don’t want to break up with him. I just don’t know how I can trust him again and I’m heartbroken. 

Also doesn’t help that he’s rich and I’m poor so leaving him would be tough financially,  but even if I had money I don’t think I would want to still.

595,"I got a friend who l really think needs help, but he is also really calm. He has the worst luck and if atleast one of the things that happened to him happened to me, I would be fucking defeated. 

For example, he had a bad father, he got kicked out of his favorite program over some bullshit plagiarism case, had a false allegation of sexual harassment that honestly wasn't true at all, and was cheated on by his girlfriend. These are just a few things that happened and his bad luck extends further. He is an extremely good person and helps people as much as he can, but in this cruel world, he is the perfect person for people to step on. I asked him once why he is still nice to people and helps out even though there are people taking advantage of him, and he said something that belongs on a hallmark card or something. He said thst if there are 10 people that ask for help and 2 are scammers, he shouldnt stop helping 10 people because the remaining 8 still need it. I said, but if you know those 2 are scammers, why help let them scam you? He told me that unless they suck him dry of his existence and soul, they need some help anyways and him being a jackass to them might cause some other trauma that he doesnt want to cause.

This philosophy seems stupid to me, because he needs to take care of himself first instead of others. I just don't know how to word it in a way that is not offensive. How do I do thst?",15Sep2020,1

605,"So, unfortunately things got really bad recently. 

Context:I had tried speaking to my mother calmly about things that have bothered me and felt uncomfortable with in the past few months in the home we both pay rent for and she did not want to hear me out as usual (gaslights me). I got fed up and we both just screamed and insulted one another. 

Mother tried slapping me and kept trying to hit me while I blocked her hits and pushed her off of me. I’m 22, smaller in size(skinnier) so it took a lot of force for me and I only fought back because I’m an adult and I have the right to use self-defense. Of course I did not hurt her and whenever I pushed back she claimed I hit her but I was trying to push her off me.

She looked insane and looked like she really wanted to hurt me, for some reason tried kicking me out and “calling the cops” on me when she’s the one who hit me. I have bruises on my arm to prove it (from blocking her hits) She’s done this before to my sister and I when we all lived together and my sister moved out with her bf eventually due to my mothers controlling nature at the time 

Anyway now I’m left trying to do my job from home and school from home but my mother almost attempted to throw my laptop and keeps yelling at me and throwing stuff at me. My sister is not on my side and thinks I’m the one in the wrong. But it’s so strange to me because when we lived together my sister knew exactly how my mom was(I would sometimes even pull my mom off of my sister when she hit her too). 

I’m left alone and have no idea what to do. I’m waiting on what renters I applied to an apartment for say(if they accept me and my friend or not) but I have nowhere to go for now. I have my car but I don’t know where to go. My sister isn’t on my side , my dad lives in Vegas, and I don’t have many friends and the ones I do have , have their own problems I can’t bother them at all. I am scared for myself.

Does anyone have any resources I can call ? My last resort is stay at a motel but I’m trying to save money. I have no idea what to do. My job relies on me being on my laptop from 8am-2pm and my second job relies on me being online too as well as school. Idk what to do. Please help!",15Sep2020,1

We made out and did oral on each other. Afterwards we went home.

My girl best friend told me that it was a misdemeanor and indecent exposure for making out and doing oral on school property.

It makes me nervous now and have anxiety because I’m wondering, what if the school looks at the cameras and see me and him kissing, touching, dry humping, oral, etc.

The biggest thing is eating. He’s been a picky eater, we often have to make him food so he’ll eat. He’s stopped eating entirely now. Any food we put in front of him he just sniffs and looks at.

609,"I have two best friends. One is male and the other is female and they both have dated before. Let's refer to the male friend as R and female friend as B. They were together for a year and 3 months and R fucked things up thus them breaking up as of 5 months ago. R was trying to fix things, earn her trust back and whatnot but recently he met one of my other female friends and they hooked up.

I'm caught in the middle. I've known R for much longer and whatnot so I help him cover things up which I feel terrible about because B deserves to know the truth. I have been there for B for the past few months trying to help her overcome this the best I can but at the same time I can't help her figure out what's going on since that's ruining the code. She's even told R how it doesn't seem like he cares about her but I do.

B has done a lot for R. She taught him how to drive. She's taken him place to place when he didn't have a car. Shes a really caring and genuine person who tries to help everyone. Unfortunately that's most likely the reason I've started crushing on her. I've been denying it, but now that I'm really thinking about it, I am. It really sucks. I don't know what to do. I can't say anything about it to either of them for obvious reasons. I'm friends with both of them. R still has plans to get back with B at some point and B only wants R and no one else.

I was thinking about asking B for some time away, atleast a few months or so so I could hopefully get this crush to die down. Unfortunately it's complicated because I'm mostly the person who's there for her. She's been hurting a lot since she found out R is seeing someone else now and she just started college so she's been stressed. If I left her now I'd be a bad friend, but I have to figure out what to do about this crush... I can't say anything about this to either of them.. What do I do??",15Sep2020,1

613,"Im a 25f. I got married at 22 to a man. When we first started dating I told him I was bi. Now I am struggling with my attraction to women and wondering if i am lesbian. 

Trigger warnings: abuse and suicide

I have known i was attracted to girls since I was in 7th grade. I grew up Mormon and spent a long time struggling with my attraction to the same gender. I went through a deep depression in my teens and attempted suicide. My parents got me a therapist and I confided in him that I thought I was lesbian. He told me that I probably was confused and I should date men. I trusted him and started dating men. 

I went through some traumatic things in an abusive relationship. After escaping that I struggled with my trauma for a long time and was afraid of men. I survived another suicide attempt and decided to try and live my life as a lesbian. 

At the time I was dressing very butch as it made me feel comfortable and safe. I just dropped out of college and was trying to find a job and having a lot of problems with that. When I went outside I got stares and rude things shouted at me. My mom suggested I ""tone it down"". I hadn't come out yet and this shook my fragile confidence. I started dressing femme and suddenly people were much more welcoming to me. It felt like the world and everyone wanted me to be straight and femme. 

I started dating men again. I told myself it was my trauma that made me not want men and I had to get back on the horse. I met my now husband and got along very well with him.

My husband has always been accepting of my attraction to women and helped me with working through my traumas. He is my best friend. We have almost always had a very low key sex life often going weeks or months without doing anything. I have a normal libido but don't often want to do things with him. He has never pressured me for it. 

Constantly through our relationship I have had doubts about my attraction to men but my connection to my husband is very strong and I enjoy my time with him. However at the end of 2019 I reached a breaking point and confided in him I was questioning myself. Obviously this shook our relationship a lot and I decided to go to therapy. 

When I saw how painful it was for him as we discussed what we should do. It broke my heart. I can't imagine not having him in my life, he is my best friend. I felt I was ruining his life. My family is so happy to have a brother/son in law (we are 6 girls in total) and my dad is excited at the idea of grandchildren. I really want kids myself and have a lot of dreams of a happy family. The majority of my family is Mormon as well and there are a lot of expectations for het marriage and children and a lot of homophobia in that community.

I decided it was best to put aside my worries and concentrate on the happiness I have and not think about there being more out there. I told my husband I was over my worries and we have kept going with our relationship and discussed buying a house and starting a family next year.

But as we get closer to starting a family my worries are coming back. I can't shake this feeling of wanting to be with women and I don't want to start a family with doubts in my heart. But im afraid coming out will ruin my chances of a happy future. 

TLDR: Married to a man, worried I'm lesbian. Dont want to come out and ruin things if I'm not.

620,"So, life has really been dealing me some heavy blows lately. 

To explain my situation,

I recently bought a 1951 buick special 8 for under 10k. Condition was good and it runs fine. Just needed sprucing. We test drove it, all seemed well. 

So we get it home and when we popped the hood, the brakes suddenly broke and the car began rolling backwards. We tried to stop the car, but of course this didn't work and it took out my mailbox, a tree, and my neighbors car. Needless to say the car is beyond repair. 

This all happened before I had to be to work today. So, I call my job to explain that I will need to day to handle the situation. My boss tells me that although she understands the situation, she has to send this to higher ups because 2 call outs in 2 months looks bad according to her.

The first call out was a fluke because we ordered lunch from Carrabas at work and we all got food poisoning. Nobody came to work that day. Literally nobody.

My reasoning for being upset enough over this to feel like I want a new job or at the very least am really just not happy working this one anymore is as follows :

My boss and I became SUPER close from day one. We have hung out outside of work a few times. She's leaned on me when her daughter's dream car was totaled and the girl was devastated. Like her daughter was super depressed and crying about it for days. We supported her through that as a team.

She seems to favor all the other workers, but makes passive aggressive jokes at me about how annoying I am and how stupid I am. She tries to pitch them as jokes but I'm not that dumb. I'm sure comments like ""Your cologne is overwhelming. I can't breathe."" When nobody else in the center we work in even notices my cologne. Or ""Jesus I know it gets dicey for you when you have to count past 10, Shane but god!!!"" *playfully nudges me* don't really jive very well.

She tends to baby the other staff when it comes to learning things but when I ask for help or ask questions she acts annoyed and has to call a ""team talk"" to make sure ""everyone is on the same page"" but when other employees ask for help she cheerily walks them through it. No problem.

I'm starting to feel like she either doesn't like me and can't communicate it. I've asked her before if there is an issue and she swears I am doing great at work and there's no concerns on her end.

But the one day I needed support from my boss, I didn't get it and was actually punished for doing so. Because a report to higher ups about attendance docks any raises or promotions for an entire year with my company. So I just got screwed.

My family thinks that I am being a bit over dramatic and this is quite normal for the workforce. I think that's utterly ridiculous and kind of a hostile work environment to be in.

Am I justified in being angry enough to want to seek a new job? Or am I being overly dramatic and need to stick it out?",15Sep2020,1
621,"Hey! I’m gonna try to make this short as possible. I’m a 23 year old female who’s grown up in a very religious and conservative Muslim household.

My passions are history and philosophy. My dream would be to study law in the US. I'd love to work for the UN or some sort of international organization.  

However, currently I'm enrolled in a graduate program in Data Science. I love data and working with data, but I don't like programming.

In my hometown there is a lot of data related jobs and all are well paid. The school is way cheaper than any law school, unless I would get a full ride.

623,"I know my title sounds really mean but I'm so fucking done. Just for reference, I coordinate a school age care after school program. We are required to have teacher led activities ranging from science, active, cooking, to crafts. 

She is literally the dumbest fucking person. She used watercolors when painting rocks. I had to explain a pepper experiment using dish soap to her about 40 times and she still got it wrong. She consistently doesn't bring any activities to do with the kids, rather opting to say that things like 2-square are her hour long teacher led activity. She does the bare minimum and still fails wildly. Her job experience is basically sitting in a high school detention room and ensuring kids stay quiet. It's a wonder she's made it through adulthood. 

She was hired last year and we ran into the same issue. When brought up to my boss, she feigned some crocodile tears and gained a ""reduced"" position for the rest of the year, only coming in to cover. But with COVID we are at a loss for staff so she is now full time once again. 

I feel like because she's retired she is getting special treatment from my boss and is basically allowed to just be a body. No matter how many times I say I need more, she makes up some stupid excuse and wiggles her way out of it. I don't know how to move forward.

I do not have confidence she will watch the kids properly or even do anything productive activity wise with them. I don't know what to do.

625,"I'm 17 years old, and my dream is to become a competitive figure skater and to represent the middle east. I started skating once a week when I turned 16 in September of 2019, and in November I started going twice, taking a group class on one day and practicing on the other. I understand that someone who skates once or twice a week does not sound like someone who is serious, but during that time, I spent every hour of my days wanting to be on the ice, training off-ice, dreaming about it, sometimes even neglecting studying for it oops (I'm trying to do better with that).


In March 2020, my rink closed and I had to stop just before I landed my axel. I became MISERABLE. I had nothing to put all my energy into, and I felt worthless. I had already been dealing with anxiety and it got much worse not knowing what the outcome would be. I realised just how much skating meant to me.


Two weeks ago, a new rink opened in my country (there was previously only one), and I went there on the first day after begging my dad to take me. I had a 15 minute basics lesson with a coach there, and worked on crossovers and a few spins. I stayed for 4 hours afterwards to work on jumps, and I could only land 3 out of the 6 I'd learned before. I went again this week and landed a 4th one. The competitiveness and desire to improve myself had returned and I was in a state of euphoria.


Yesterday, my coach contacted me and informed me that the rink nearer to my house would be opening again on September 20th, and that she's now accepting bookings for private and group classes. I decided that I'd need to take a 30 minute private lesson once a week, and go 2 other days to practice alone. I knew that this would be terribly difficult considering a private lesson is $25 (converted to USD because I don't wanna disclose my location) and a skating session is $8 for 2 hours. I decided to call the owner of the rink, and ask if I could get a discount on the ice time if I came 3 times a week, and he said that it was definitely possible and that he'd get back to me.


Now the problem is... I asked my dad today which day and time is best for my private lessons, and when he heard the price he asked, ""So how many lessons are you gonna do? 2 or 3? You can skate well now, so you won't need many""

Me: I was thinking once a week, since I wanna keep improving, and you know.. represent *insert country*

Him: How long are you gonna keep playing on the ice? You're 17 now. I can't keep wasting all this money. You need to go to college soon.


The debate went on for a while, and he was yelling really loud, scaring my little sisters. He made it clear that I don't have his support, so I just walked away and ended up having a panic attack in my room. 


The thing is... he's right. I am too old to be doing this. I am too old to be competing against preteens doing triples, and I've always known that deep down. My mom (who is very supportive and the only person I can talk to) has always told me that I am determined enough to be the exception, and she's right saying that I'm determined. In fact, there are very few people more determined than I am, but even when I'm able to land triple jumps one day (I KNOW I can), these kids are going to be doing quads already, and I can never win.


I realised, no matter how much blood, sweat and tears I put into this, nothing can come out of it... I will never compete other than in adult competitions that no one knows about, and I will never be able to make a living off of this either... Hell, I can't even reach MY potential because I don't have the support I need.


I'm currently planning to start an artisan soap business to make some money out of this soap-making hobby of mine, so maybe by the middle-end of 2021, I'll have a source of income to spend money doing what I truly love (skating), but is it even worth it? I'm just so lost, and I don't know what to do.


Also, I've been seriously neglecting studying to the point where I'm almost a year behind. I've been depressed all year long, and I'm ready to get out of it, but I'm just so overwhelmed with everything. I just want to skate and be happy.",15Sep2020,1

630,"To explain this a bit, my mother is 49 and has a about 27 year old sister. Her sister, despite being a literal adult, that could do it themselves, gets everything she wants from my gramps. A new garage? Sure. A slide for her two kids? No Problem. A workspace for her to work on art? Ofcourse! (Btw. My Grandpa broke his toes and is still working on what she wants).
While my mother, never asks anything of him. She's been storing a Wagon of bricks for a brick wall there for a few months because she hadn't had the time to start working. Just now my grandfather called and shouted at her, telling her things like: ""Oh for gods sake! Just pick up the trash. I don't want it here.""  ""It'll probably be laying here for years!""  ""You're such a dissapointment.""

My mother, is a hardworking person and has 3 children (including me). My brothers moved out and we are 3 people in the house now. My father works 3 jobs to support us and make it possible for us to do as much as we want. My mother works everyday. Her sister, works a few times every month and even has better pay and still receives financial support from her father, while my mother doesn't at all. She also, despite being the oldest, will not inherit anything when gramps dies. 
My mother is a sensible person just like me. She taught herself from the age of 6 to pretend she is fine. Just now, after stopping the call, she shouted, went quiet and cried. I don't know what to do and it hurts to see my mother like that. She's always there for me so I want to help her. Any advice on what I can do?

633,"We're not in debt as far as I know, but the only retirement fund they have is from the government. I'm 16, brother is 21- parents are 52 and 65. Mum is self employed and dad is retired, still paying off the mortgage and my mother needlessly spends money we don't really have.

She always blames me for her spending, that I cost too much because I'm in college and need stationary/textbooks/public transport/clothes etc or because I don't eat meat, and cooking separate meals costs so much (I cook for myself, never use alternatives other than almond milk which we get for like 80p/litre from aldi..) but then she goes and buys tonnes of food for the family (£100+ per week for a family of four) clothes, shit for the house, meanwhile we can't afford to run the dryer in emergencies because it costs too much. We have a meter in the house to watch our electricity bill and she gawks everytime she gets charged then blames me for spending too much time on my phone/computer/existing as if I'm the sole spender on anything

If it was her money then she can dig her own grave I guess, but she's starting to use my brother too

He accidentally(?) let slip that he has a few thousand saved and my mum started crying because we're safe!!!! and she's never had that much money at once!!!! (not her money though!) She took his card and went to the shops for food, he knew and let her, and to her credit didn't go wild, but she still spent his money totally unashamedly and now whenever she's short/doesn't want to waste her own money, she'll go take my brothers card and use his then let him know afterwards, and if he's not ok with it she'll give him an IOU. She's in debt to both of us for £300+ each. I had to buy all my own clothes, stationary etc for college (started two weeks ago) and she said she'd pay but didn't have the money in her account at the time, and I really needed to order soon I couldn't keep putting it off. I put it on my card and now two weeks later no money to be seen and she never had intention of paying me back. 

I don't want to sound entitled or anything- especially not so when I receive my own family allowance grant from the gov to fund my expenses but omg I can't do shit with £84 a month and no help from my family. She pays for food, and I get stuck with everything else. Her defense is always I receive the grant so I should pay, even after she agreed to. 

I have no money, I probably won't see my money again and I was saving up to go to uni but that's all gone because of her fake promises and being shit with money

So when I was really young my they neighbour stripped me and touched me inappropriatly , he didn't rape me but I since then had a inbuilt fear towards other guys ,I felt ashamed of myself for years for being scared of my own gender ,in first grade a guys threw a brick on my head and I started bleeding and he left me like that I still have a weird hairline due to that , I was bullied a lot in my school most of the time other only ate my food and never let me play with them , so one day it so happened that I was sting alone while other guys were playing cause they never allowed me to play with them so girls in my class spoke up for me and fought with the guys , but that caused more problem now guys started grabbing me inappropriatly and say me they wanted to make sure that I was a guy , bullying went on but now I couldn't really care much ,I was hurt to that level 

Then is 9th grade I was selected for student body I was gaining popularity but happened next tore me apart , I came to know that my father cheated on my mother , they started fighting daily , they still fight ,they get physical ,my father broke my mothers finger on my birthday , one day they went so violent that I beat my father , he didn't hit me back but since then our relationship is not good , they still fight and each time they do my heart shrinks

Eventually it was shown in my face and my best friend asked me what happened , I was desparate for love so I told him everything , he started helping , he was a ray hope in the darkness ,he faced bullies for me but eventually he got a gf and drifted apart idk why but he even blocked me

I started going to school around 2011 and had to take one or two classes. Because of this, It's taking me forever to finish. Currently, I need 1.5 years to get my bachelor's in Computer Science. I live with my SO and have to work full time to pay for living expenses. I've been paying down my debts to increase my credit score. I thought this will allow me to take out a loan to finish school since I have no one that can cosign (My entire family credit score is pure trash). Currently, my credit score is 698, and it should go up by the end of the month since I paid down my credit card debts by taking out a loan with a lower APY compared to all of my cards (I'll end up saving money this way). This current semester I need to pay 7k for my past balances at school so I can register for this spring 2021. I entered a payment plan that it's for two years. However, I won't be able to register for classes until the 7k debt is paid. Hence why I'll need to take out a private school loan. To be able to pay for the past semester and the next one.

643,"Hi! For about 10months now my apartment experiences random vibrations throughout the day. My landlord is aware and has had three different plumbers check the complex as water hammer was their first guess. All plumbers didn’t find anything wrong. Although, around the time the vibrations started the property owner had just had all plumbing under the complex replaced (new pipes installed). There seems to be no pattern in when the vibrating happens. It happens morning, day, night. Most times it’s heard but not felt. It’s heard through the furniture, example my monitor shaking, my tv shaking, wine glasses clinking, etc. If I have a water bottle on my bookshelf when it occurs the water visibly shakes. Also, if I’m sitting or laying on my bed I can feel the vibration very strongly. Sometimes it seems like the vibration is stemming from the wall in my bedroom. I have experienced the vibration in every room in my apartment (kitchen, livingroom, office, bedroom) except the bathroom. The only other thing I remember changing around the time the vibrations started, asides from the plumbing work; is PGE changed out (2-3) telephone poles directly behind my unit. 

If anyone has any input or ideas of what could be causing this please let me know so I can pass it on to my landlord. Thanks!",15Sep2020,1

If I dropped it, I would still be taking 12 credits, making me full time.

646,"Yesterday i had a test and it was my last lesson so it was okay for me to do overtime but I took so long so my last questions had to be taken by saying the answers to her instead of writing it.

I don't like talking thought because it is so hard for me to describe and explain things irl.. but she said she knows and sees that I am knowledgeable about the subject and that i have done really well.. I did the test for like 2 and a half hour.

I do usually take my time but sometimes it's just too much like that and I notice that the teacher gets a bit annoyed. I write more than I need and explain things that actually don't need to be explained but I do it anyway because I am too afraid that I will get a bad grade if I do not. It's like I'm worried if I don't mention a certain thing even though I know it and I get bad grades because of it I will be so mad and sad about it.

I think it is good that I know alot and I want to show it. But taking more than 2 hours? Don't think that is so good.

I think the reason I do this is because the subjects I am less interested in I only give the answear they ask for and don't elaborate as much and I don't get that much of a good grade because of it.

I am even too much or too little and that's bad. Why do I do this and how do I help it? Clearly if I know much about a subject I wanna give everything I have. But I think by me doing that is making my teachers annoyed because I'm doing so much overtime all the time.

652,"The cluster diagnosis affects less than 2% of the population if you don't include comorbid disorders. Everyone you meet, 98% of the time it's just their personality. Cluster B people have differences in their brain. 

People are obsessed with putting my parents and (recently me) into cluster diagnosis cause they didn't expect that I would make fertilizers out of their rancid mooching asses. 

My mother and dad are very generous. Usually I'm grateful if someone does something for me, but these people just resent us cause we are better, we never faced a single problem in our life cause we use our heads and work hard rather than mooch and trash on opportunities of others and borrow stuff from people to cope. They just make excuses. 

These people will never accomplish anything for the most part in their lives. Even when they do, their genes are so parasitic it is going a uphill battle against your own conditioning. They are already mooching off and parasitically ruining their own families since they were born and my fault is I'm in their radar of garbage storm. It's not just me. These people do not work hard, at all. 

My parents are the most ethical and hardworking people I've ever met. I'm not saying this cause they are my parents. I'm definitely the more 'evil' one out of them. However, since I'm sweet to everyone, I get the perfect selfless card instead of my parents cause my parents are exponentially better off than them and have a much better attitude. It's not a diagnosis, it's 20 years of right decisions and hardwork and yes, raw intelligence. 

We are all neurotypicals, cause we checked, I checked more than twice, but that stated while I am not obsessed with people dynamics cause I'm my biggest fan, like you are not worth the attention in your own brain even for you, your brain tells you already you are garbage to focus at, which is why you can't focus on yourself. You all come from people who have spend their entire lives eating their hearts out when other people do well. You could obviously go for therapy for 'that' instead. 

What can I say? If I was born one day and I had the roles reversed and I was born in your life, I will commit seppuku or do everything I can to get back to my life. I am very happy with what I have. I have people literally running operations to win my heart for years so that they can buy into my lifestyle and mooch of my 'narcissistic' parents and then they wonder why would I stick with my teenage boyfriend who actually loves me for me and is not a parasitic retard.

I'm nice cause I think not having control over your emotions is for dogs, but I'm not gullible, and also that nice is a card for I don't shout, I 'kill' metaphorically, parasites.

Edit : Another thing which annoys me is why they don't understand that there is no such thing as a person with narcissistic, sociopathic, adhd and ocd traits who is also a psycopath. If you are gonna throw crackpot theories on me, atleast do your research. I don't know why they can't figure it out. It's either the reason people become flat earthers (they are the type) or they are retards, actual ones (the ones with brains that are developmentally impaired or having brain damage ). Every one of these diagnosis is not behavior dependent, the people who have them have a different brain type. So, let's say you meet a psycopath, chances he would also have adhd is zero, cause that's not his brain.

Mental disorders are not a way to have a different way to figure out people's astrological signs or myers briggs personality types. 'I'm an Entp and I'm also a sociopath with comorbid ocd' type - ish bs. It's not a way to define yourself and put yourself in categories of other people who also seem narcissistic enough. Most people who are narcissistic are not Hitler for example. It's possible someone may have a diagnosis and show no visible signs of it and seem normal. Infact I'm sure alot of people do that cause persistently acting disruptive only keeps people around you who don't respect themselves. You cant be having a raging meltdown like a dog every time someone gets your order wrong and also be considered a functioning member of society.

Another thing is, let's say someone is narcissistic, part of the 2%, or anything, they don't need to be maligned, they need to be understood and helped to get them treatment.

If you meet people who actually do have stuff like this diagnosed on them, you will find out they are very normal. They don't sit in a basement figuring out their next victim. With proper treatment and rehabilitation alot of them even don't have to suffer their conditions and put a face for the world. I'm not against people who have something diagnosed on them, but labeling their entire character or personality traits on just it being a disorder is wrong, cause alot of people live different lifestyles and its not a way for you to play victim or be a social retard.

Also since I do have friends with diagnosed mental illnesses on them, I don't see them as evil or with pity, unless they deserve it, I see them as people who are them and then this is a detail about their lives. You'd be surprised how normal they are. Which is why when I find some people acting brain damaged using the 'I'm a lunatic' card, I already know how that looks like in real life with people who handle it well, and I treat these people exactly how I would treat someone who is normal but behaving like they have social awareness of a rabid 3 year old.

It's not just the parasitic behavior. It's the stupidity at the point of being a retard comorbid with the parasitic behavior, being delusional and the dunning Kruger effect and they pedestalize me so much, I bet they spend 90% of their lives thinking about me, so also the clinginess. Bit like they are walking around naked and asking me to rate the stuff they are wearing and not expecting me to point out that. I also don't want to be friends or close to them cause of self respect reasons and I assure them as soon as I lose the power over their heads they would find out the best way to get out of the wasteland that is their life is to focus on it. And could you save saying this stuff for your diary or therapist or something? It was fun for a while, but now it's like you have down syndrome or something cause you have fixation issues and this stuff should be obvious to you and you aren't getting it for months or years and I don't want to interact with you.

Final aspect on this :If you are responsible for doing the same stuff as these parasites, in any way, I don't have to report you, I will, but I don't have to, but I am already taking down everyone else and you will go down in the garbage storm. Everyone who maligned me or was in association of the slanderers will also go down, cause I like to feel like I'm thorough on things. So your name will probably come up in court, and if it does, go through due process, if they put that record on you it's not my issue.

Major common points. They are obsessive about other people (envy issues), can't take criticism well but can dish it out, have no sense of gratitude, a victim complex, and are kind of stupid, take time to absorb concepts.",15Sep2020,1

654,"Hi. I'm a 21F and when I was talking to my mom about random things today, she told me that though I didn't notice her marriage with my father (this year they are celebrating their 25th year together), things a not going well for  more than a year at least. She says he is quite controling, and wants her world to spin around himself. 

I love him, but my dad is a very difficult person to deal with, usually he doesn't listen to anyone, and indeed is very controlling. The thing is she hadn't even told him about her feelings. As a woman who've been in a somewhat abusive relationship I couldn't help but agree with her, based on the things she told me, that he is abusive (no physical violence involved), and even though i didnt said with all the letters, it's obvious that in her place i would not tolerate such a thing, and would probably ask for divorce. I think she just keeps going because of me and my brothers, cause i doesnt feel like she loves and wants to be with him anymore ( she told me she actually been burring herself in work so she stays as little as possible around him).

I dont know how to feel about all this, honestly. It happened suddenly and I would never expect it. I feel sorry about my dad, but i also understand my mother point of view. I'm already struggling with depression, anxiety and my own personal traumas, and this just made things way worse than it was. 

I know that she needs support, and someone to talk to, and indeed I'm flattered that she trusted me for this matter, but at the same time I wish she hadn't involve me. Also, I think both of my younger siblings heard our conversation and since then home feels suffocating, things are weird and i just cant look at my dad as i used to. I told her that she needed to talk to him about those stuff, since knowing hear, im pretty sure she will end up losing her mind at some point and will break apart their relationship in a unhealtly way, also i advised her to look for therapy. I'm positive that my father would never accept counseling. 

I dont want my mother to be miserable because of family, yet i know divorce would completly ruin my father, and that my brothers and I would also struggle a lot with this. Honestly, i just wanted to vent, and maybe get some advice, i dont know what to do, nor think, and i'm feeling so confused I cant even focus on college classes. I'm afraid of how things will turn out, i've barely been holding on to life and now it seems as i'm going even lower. This may seem childish, but yes, it is what it is, unfortunately i feel like a 8 years old right now stuck in between their parents fight. 

Thanks for reading.

655,"We have been working together for five years he and I used to be extremely close and spent a lot of time together, talked often, and had really great communication...He’s been sort of a mentor to me. Everything I’ve learned Business wise I learned working directly with him I have a great deal of respect and admiration for him. However, his attitude towards me has shifted in the last year it has gotten to the point where he treats other employees of ours better than he treats me. 


I am the top earner for our business and have been for the last four years I work the most out of everybody but I get treated the worst... I used to be able to talk to him about what was going on in my life now I can’t get a response from him when I try to, he will literally not respond and then change the topic,  but just a few days ago one of our employees was in emotional distress he dropped everything to support them. I know he wouldn’t do the same for me but he would have in the past...Nothing has happened in the last year to make our relationship more Strained, this came out of nowhere...He’s been extremely forgetful lately and every single time I’ve had to remind him of some thing that he forgot he lashes out at me... if I tell him i’m not available at a certain time of the day for work he’ll tell me OK and then the very next day will try to schedule me for that exact time I told him I was not available and then he gets irritated with me for trying to remind him. 


He talks to me like I’m constantly doing something wrong but he’s messed up our client list scheduling and communications multiple times in the last three months to the point that I show up for a meeting and the client doesn’t show up because he told me the wrong day... he doesn’t even apologize or show any empathy when my time gets wasted...and he freaks out when I try to cover all my bases. if I confront him about it everything that I say to him he turns around back on me he uses my own argument against me and I don’t know how to communicate with somebody who will just flip it back on to me when I’m doing everything I can. For a while my other employees and I all agreed that it seemed like each month he picked someone new to have a problem with and it shifted every month now it feels like it’s just me all the time. 

I’ve been his top earner through the entire quarantine he wouldn’t have made any money in the last seven months if I hadn’t kept working and he treats me with such disrespect but I don’t know how not to take it personally anymore all I can say is I am trying to figure out how to get our relationship back on track and if anybody has any advice I would really appreciate it. have tried talking to him gently I have tried confronting him neither option gets me any traction.

I blocked them all on everything. Today, I woke up to one of their outside group members calling me. Basically, this guy was friends with the guys who robbed me. 

I later asked him why he called me? He said it must’ve been an accident. I felt like I needed to say something about the situation since I was talking to him, so I texted him “Idk how involved you were with those bitches who robbed me, but make sure they stay away from me or my property.” I also told him I wasn’t concerned or mad about the situation anymore because I’m doing better now, but that I would deal with the situation quickly if they try to get more from me. 

I told my dad, and he said I never should’ve texted this dude. I just felt this heavy need to say that to this guy, but I feel like it was a mistake now.

664,"I (f23) live across the country. Here’s the story. I visit home maybe twice a year. This year I flew home for my birthday and was excited to celebrate with my closet friends. My best friend (f23) has been dating a new girl at the time we’ll call her C  and it was also C’s birthday at the time. C’s mom had passed away a few years ago around this time so C said she was in a bad place and she did not want to celebrate her birthday. My best friend threw a party for my birthday and I said she should invite C because it’s her birthday too and she should have some fun. I’m generally a nice and happy person and this was my first time meeting C, knowing she was in a bad place I was trying to be extra nice to her. We’re all drinking and having a good time and I notice my best friend and C left for a while but I didn’t pay it any mind. We party the next couple days and now it’s time for me to fly home. 

I wake up in my best friends bed and she’s not there. I start packing and I hear her talking on the phone talking about how she’s so mad and she wants to FIGHT ME. I go into the living room and act as if I didn’t hear anything and try to make conversation with her but she’s being short and I obviously know that she’s mad. I broke my phone while partying and ask her if I can use hers she lets me and I go to text my mom her address so she can pick me up and I see that she had been talking a bunch of shit about me to her sister (whom is also like my best friend. We’ve all been friends for about 13 years). I don’t mention it, get my things and say good bye. We agree we’ll talk when I return home. 

I get home and she finally calls me saying that this raggedy girl C that she had only known for a month at the time tells her that I was flirting with her and rubbing her back as if I liked her. First of all I wouldn’t disrespect my best friend that way, we’re not in competition. Secondly I’m in a relationship and have a whole boyfriend. Thirdly I did hug her, I am a good 7 inches taller than this girl so my had probably fell against her lower back but I was only trying to make this girl feel comfortable in my friend group. My best friend talked about this to her ex girlfriend whom also told her she thinks I’ve tried to flirt with her in the past. This is all bizarre to me because I’m my opinion neither of these girls are cute and they’re basically (no offense to anyone) midgets compared to me. 

Now we’ve talked through this and my best friend asked me if I like HER like If I have a crush on HER and I confirmed that I absolutely do not see her in that type of light. We’ve gone from literally texting and FaceTiming everyday to maybe texting twice a week and probably FaceTime twice a month. It sucks honestly because she’s my best friend, we always called each other soul mates and we’ve always been able to talk about anything and everything. When we do talk there so much excitement and happiness on both sides since we have to much catching up to do but I miss the bond we had before. We haven’t talked about the situation again but I miss our friendship. How can I go about addressing this with her?",15Sep2020,1
665,"I am in a difficult situation that is a threat to my relationship with my parents and family. I am an undergraduate in a four-year Bachelor of Communications program that I had started after completing high school in 2012, of which I have completed approximately two years worth of courses. Through university and up to current day, I have lived in my parent’s house and haven’t yet moved out.

I have major depressive disorder, and for multiple terms during my tenure in university I was unable to complete my courses, and dropped them partway through the terms to avoid receiving failing grades for the courses. It was a rough stretch of time, to the extent that there was a course which I had taken and dropped three times prior, and only on my fourth attempt to complete the course did I see the course through to completion.

I was ashamed, and did not tell my parents of my dropped courses and that I was way behind in my progress towards graduation. I had achieved honours grades in high school, and aside from not telling them of my depression, I felt I could not tell them without repercussions to our relationship I wanted to avoid. So, I kept up the appearance that I was going to classes during these times, when all I would do is sit and sleep in the recreational area of the university.

I lied to my parents about my progress through the program. I had told them that having changed my major partway through the program, it added an extra year to my completion. This allowed me to continue the charade until the end of the winter term of 2017, which is about the time I was able to overcome some of my issues with depression. I have told them that I only had a work placement/internship left to complete the program, which is a lie.

I had the opportunity to work construction during the summers, which I then took up full time following the end of the last term I completed in university. For the following + three years up to the current date, I have been working construction while lying to my parents that I was procrastinating finishing my program because the pay was good.

Caught up to current day, I intend to move into a rental at the end of the year, quit construction work, and resume my university program. I have enough money saved to be able to sustain myself comfortably for the remaining two years of my program. I hope to continue to maintain my lie until I have completed my program.

The lie to my parents has grown so much worse than simply having dropped courses and being far behind in my graduation. I have been deceiving them while living under their roof for the better part of six years, have allowed them to tell friends and family that I’m on the precipice of graduation, and it is the deception that I believe is much more hurtful than the contents of the lie itself. I feel this lie has the capacity to permanently severe my relationship with my parents.

Now, I am seeking advice. I believe that time and space apart, as well as ultimately graduating so they don’t look like fools to family and friends for having told them I was completing the program. Does anyone have suggestions of excuses I can make so continue to cover up that I had been lying to them until I graduate?",15Sep2020,1

Anyway when I mentioned she may not like the gay skin ships, my friends started calling her homophobic and that upset me.

Context for my mom she grew up in a different country where I assume same sex couples weren’t common, so that’s why she may not be use to it, my mom is a sweet person she would never say something very homophobic and offensive, she would just say her beliefs “I believe that a man and a woman should be getting married as they are able to reproduce, however if two boys/girls want to get married, it’s fine they are happy with each other” 

However I feel bad I didn’t mention those bits to my friends, but they know she was raised in a different culture with a different belief so I feel offended they instantly came to that conclusion.

675,"when i was little i used to believe that i HAVE to like my mom and my mom HAS to be my best friend based off all of the tv shows i’ve watched and movies and things like that. my mom could be nice at times but when i was little she was a lot worse than she is now.

it was up until i was 11 when i realized i don’t have to like her and all this built up anger, pain, and hurt just reached the light. i’m a fairly sympathetic person so i tried to excuse her being a shitty person to me for something else like “maybe she’s stressed” or “maybe she’s having a bad week” stuff like that yk? and yk she was stressed but some of the things she yelled at me and my brothers for or hit us for weren’t necessary. 

i tried to be her friend still because i didn’t want to have a bad relationship with my mom and she even said “if you don’t want to have a good relationship we don’t have to” while she was yelling at me. i was a kid so obviously i was scared of that cus i didn’t know what that meant yk?

when i was 13 i decided to give up on being friends with her. we used to go out and paint our nails and get starbucks and talk. i stopped wanting to paint my nails because i didn’t like it anymore. i stopped wanting to go anywhere with her because she always had this negative connotation she carried with her. everytime she wasn’t home, i felt like i could genuinely breathe but the second she was i cooped myself in my room (my brothers did too, we all feel the same way) and i wouldn’t come out unless it were for dinner.

some more shit happen and i’m still sympathetic for her but everytime i say “i love you” to her i feel absolutely nothing. i say it because i have to say it not because i want to yk? i know the whole “if they were gone and you didn’t say i love you youd b sad” but honestly if she were gone and i didn’t tell her how she makes me feel i would be sad. she’s brought me down my entire life and all of a sudden she wants to act like we’re cool because i’m a teen? fuck that. 

what i’m really trying to know is, is it wrong that i feel nothing when i say “i love you” to her? am i supposed to feel something when i say that to my parents? do you guys feel anything when you say it to your parents?

680,"So I have always had anxiety, and I also have ADHD. I never went to a psychiatrist to confirm OCD but I think I have it as well, like intrusive thoughts and what not. So recently I have had a issue with my sexuality. It was a sudden onset of doubt that I have never had before, caused by one of my friends coming out gay, like I never expected him to be gay but he was, and that got me thinking what if I am gay? All of a sudden, I start second guessing myself, seeking reassurance to confirm my sexuality. Forcing myself to look at pictures of girls and guys and seeing how I feel and if any single slightly homo thought arises I question myself. I even forced myself to watch gay porn which honestly was disgusting, weird to look at, different for sure but I was not aroused. I worry about how I act or talk now, like if I say a word weird I question myself like what if I am gay. I was sleeping and was sleeping in a weird position like not manspreading or whatever and I think wow this is gay, I must be gay. These are just some of the thoughts I have. I never have ever questioned my sexuality, prior to this, girls was all I could think about, girls and sex and yea. Prior to this I could see a good looking guy and not question myself, I would just think like yea he looks good, wish I was that good looking etc... never anything homosexual. But ever since that ounce of doubt arose, it just feels as if it has been growing, it is constantly in the back of my mind ALL THE TIME. Some times I forget about it before remembering I am doubting my sexuality, and in the moments where I forget it, no homosexual thoughts come to my mind. But the moment I catch myself I remember the issue I am facing and instantly it becomes a battle with myself. I can't remember if I was homophobic, I think I might've slightly been, the way they acted and talked was honestly disgusting at the time but I know that that is wrong to think and if anything, this helped me grow as a person. I think that with me doubting my sexuality, I think I became more accepting if they were gay but not with myself, like I have this irrational fear of being gay myself. I question what if I am just in denial and I don't have HOCD, so many what if's etc... Before I was so certain I was straight but ever since the doubt came into my mind, it has been a warzone in my head and I barely get sleep. I cannot see myself having sex with dudes or being in a relationship with them. It is as if my mind forces me to question myself. The thoughts do not come naturally if you know what I mean, it is very hard to explain, like they are not true feelings but as if my mind forces me to think this to make me doubt myself even more if that makes sense. Do I have HOCD? Am I actually gay? What do I do? I still like girls and get turned on by them so its more like Bisexual OCD more than HOCD. I just have this obsession with my sexuality. If anyone can tell me anything or give advice I would so greatly appreciate it.",15Sep2020,1

It didnt even make a sound or defend itself when I got a pole and carefully pushed her closer and picked out of the water. I looked at the bird carefully but didnt find any injuries. I would feel bad leaving it out unprotected. 

I tried to feed it water and bread but it didnt take either.

To start this off I’m a 17 year old female. I’m in no means depressed when I say this, but I genuinely feel nothing. I don’t mean in a numb ‘depressed way’... I seriously feel bored all the time. I’m surrounded by loving and supporting friends and family but honestly? I feel nothing for them no matter how hard I try. Recently my mother asked me if I loved her and I couldn’t respond. She’s the most amazing and caring woman in my life and if I could love one person it would be her but honestly I just feel constantly empty and bored. I don’t want the human experience of being alive anymore, it’s so boring and I see no purpose in it. I’m not sad, and I won’t actively kill myself, but I have some worsening health conditions that are getting really bad but I just can’t seem to care. I think all humans, including myself are so disgusting... living insignificant lives with 9-5 jobs then dying. I don’t know why I’m alive, i feel nothing, I’d rather be sad than feel so bored all the time. Nothing brings me excitement or happiness, and this isn’t a recent thing. It’s always been like this, even as a child I’ve pondered why I’m here on this earth. I see being alive as a chore honestly. I don’t want the human existence anymore, everything from having to drink water, go to school, put clothes on is so so tiring. I’m not sure if anyone will understand my thought process but I am not sad. I know life is meaningless and I’m bored of it, I’ve lived enough to know that I don’t like it. I am comforted by the idea of dying and simply not existing anymore. I feel like I’m more than just my body, and I want to be freed from the human existence. I like nothing in this life, next year I’m going to university to study a psychology degree. I don’t like psychology, but it’s the only decently paying career I can get into. I’m going to live a boring life, get married to someone I feel nothing for and have a boring job then die, and for what. I truly have no passions and feel nothing and know there is no point to live. I’m not suicidal, but I’m writing this as a last attempt to find meaning and reasoning for existing, I’m so bored. Help.",15Sep2020,1

I personally don’t like it that much people say I haven’t given it that much effort but I’ve been here 2 years I would assume that’s long enough to know if I want to live here any longer. I don’t have any friends or family here at all.

I can’t move back home because there’s no jobs there I would love to, the only place I want to move is Auckland there are so many jobs there and I went to uni there I have friends and some family there and it’s only a 3 hour drive away from my home town.
My fiancé doesn’t want to but he needs a new job as he just quit his and is doing commission only he hates Auckland but if we lived on the shore somewhere it’s not that intense we could live in a more quiet area.

I’m not happy where I am but he keeps saying no to moving. I’m sick of just listening to everyone else and staying where I am. I want to just get up and leave if he’s not going to listen because I want to do what’s right for me

I decided on one particular girl I liked, we’ll call her Jane. She went to see the place, liked it and also looked at some places she had in mind and we decided on the one we wanted. Company checked our credits mine was lower 660 and hers higher 750. So the building asked for two months deposit and I’m like ok cool. That works for me, I have it.  Now she calls me and says “I feel really uncomfortable because they asked for 2 months deposit, I feel like your credit is not that good. I think we should meet and we’ll go through pay stubs and W2s”. Now don’t get me wrong, people should vet their roommates. I’ve had roommates before, we’ve always applied separately and gotten vetted by the landlord and move forward. They check credit, call former landlords and whatever else they do. I don’t like the fact that this girl wants to vet me on top of that and request to see my pay stubs? I don’t feel like I have to disclose my exact income to her. I’m the one that’s been looking for apartments for two months and looking within my range and now you want to double verify me because you have good credit and they requested a 2 months deposit?

He gaslit me by telling me I wasn't doing certain dance steps properly even though I 100% knew that I was. He then proceeded to grope me while pretending to help me.

While ""helping me"" he groped the shit out of me. And right then, I'm not joking,I actually felt like I could not move. I lost control over my body. 

I ended up reporting him that day and he got fired. A few days ago I experienced a similar situation. I thought that now that I'm a grownup, I'll be able to handle the situation better. Long story short an uncle of mine groped me and continued to feel me up for at least 2 minutes when our families were meeting at our house. 

I felt the exact same feeling. Lost control of my body. It was actually as if I was watching my body from somewhere else, unable to move it. At night I told my parents and now they're over at my uncle's place threatening with the police. 

So I am in therapy. Not for my assualt, but I've spoken about it to my therapist. But it didn't really help.

All I want to know is, why did I freeze? Why couldn't I have pushed them away the instant they touched me? I didn't grow up in an abusive household, I lived in a very safe neighborhood, I'm physically fit and have quick reflexes, but then why did i freeze? 

Is there anything i can do about this? To have presence of mind at all times and not lose control of my body like that? I'm still undergoing therapy,i just want to know why i froze like that. 

Hope this post doesn't get removed. Thank you!",15Sep2020,1
719,"I am a current high school senior and I feel completely lost.

A little background: (TL;DR at the bottom)

Since the 7th grade I’ve taken German, and had an interest in working in Renewable energy, or environmental sciences. I was pretty certain this is what I wanted I wanted to do in the future as well. I kept taking German because I knew it would help me reach that goal as I admired Germany’s far advance compared to the US in sustaining their environment. Last year after taking German for 4 years I got a full-ride scholarship to attend school in Germany for a year with a host family. It was an amazing experience although I came back early due to Covid. However, this big moment in my life revealed something. That I do not want to work in environmental engineering, sciences, or anything I’d thought previous. This made me have a little freak out since I had been so sure for so long and even prided myself in the fact I wouldn’t have to stress over knowing what I wanted to do in college like some of my peers. 

Now that I was somewhere in life I had always wanted to be but life wasn’t going to plan, I had a lot of time to think. One of the biggest factors into why I stuck with German was because a year before I reached high school my school cut Japanese from the program. My initial plan had been to study Japanese. German was meant to be temporary. I realized that if in such a short time of my young life I was able to commit to, and pursue learning German and visiting Germany I could do the same with Japanese and Japan. I am currently talking it online during my senior year (I only found out they had Japanese 1 online this past summer), and I am 100% sure it is something I want to continue and become fluent in just as I had with German. 

One thing I have to make clear is that I have no intention of becoming a language teacher or teacher in general. It is not something I want to do as a career. But I would like to have a job in the future which I could also do either in Japan or incorporate my language abilities into my work. 

I want to attend a college which offers Japanese as either a Major or Minor. I’d also would like to do an exchange to Japan during college. Not a summer exchange or trip, but an actual exchange where I’d attend a Japanese college/university. 

So what option are there for me, and what would be a good plan?
(I have and still am doing research but it’s very hard to find answers from people and not lists of majors and minors)

TL;DR
I want to study and become fluent in Japanese in college, what majors and careers should I consider that would help me keep doing this, that I could also work in Japan doing. (Careers, College, programs, or scholarships I should look into?)",15Sep2020,1

I[F23] have a boyfriend[M19] of less than one month and I really wanna make things work with him. It’s just that, I can’t shrug the thoughts about hooking up with someone else, it’s not just because we can’t see each other for now but it’s too hard to take off my head.

721,"I have a crush on my best friend - what do I do?

I’ve had a close friend that I’ve known for several years now through school, and we’ve become a lot closer as the years have gone by.

I’ve started to develop feelings in the past few months and feel like it’s reached a point where I’d like to let her know how I feel and ask her out on a ‘date’ of some sort.

Does anyone have any tips / advice on how to approach the situation?",15Sep2020,1
723,"We've been talking for a little over a year but haven't gone any further. We both like each other and see each other everyday at school, though we only ever text. We've never had an in person conversation (we're both shy).

We started talking less because usually if I was the last person to respond he'd initiate the conversation and vise versa. This is because I always have this nagging feeling that I'm bothering him (and other people) so him initiating conversation puts the feeling at bay (for a while).

He finally initiated after a week and I blew it. The nagging got to me and I became hostile towards him. As if I was mad that he took so long to respond. This happens quite often with everybody. I don't know how to stop it.

We're slowly drifting apart and to say I hate it is an understatement. One moment I think things are getting back on track the next moment we're veering off in the wrong direction. It doesn't help that few other girls like him as well. I'm scared that they'll eventually make their move and he'll get over me.

I know it's silly and selfish to want him to continue liking me because nothing will come out of it (probably). We've both never been in a relationship and I doubt he has any interest in being in one. I'm not good with interacting with others so being in one squeezes the shit out of me. Asking him if we can talk is completely out of the picture. 

I guess I hate the fact of finding out  that my personality is flawed. That it's not good enough to keep anybody interested in ME. I see this as my one shot at love and I'm watching it float away yet I can't do anything. I'm stuck between wanting to do something and being too scared to do anything.

Any advice on how I can handle/cope with this?",15Sep2020,1
724,"I'm not sure how to really start this, because it's been going on for a long time and I just have so many thoughts in my head that were bottled up, but I'll try to make this as short as possible. I'm pretty sure my friend uses Reddit as well, probably not as frequently as me, but still, I've done my best to make this as anonymous as possible.

 I first met R in grade 7, when I started a new school, and we were friends throughout middle school. She was very awkward around other people, so I was literally her only friend, and she would follow me around everywhere. However, in short, she started to become toxic, like *pretty* toxic. I could go on forever, but that sums it up a bit. I think the worst part about her was how she treated my mental health problems- she was very dismissive of them and even said that she couldn't be friends with someone who was so emotionally damaged. 

Eventually, that changed when she started to develop mental health problems of her own, mainly depression and anxiety. R's mental health first went downhill when I stopped going to school for a couple of months to seek treatment. I think it was because I wasn't there for her, I left her without saying a word and leaving her alone to fend for herself. Mind you, R grew up *very* sheltered, so she never really learned much about society or the media or how to interact with them. And I just abandoned her in that state. 

While I was in treatment, which started in March of last year and ended in August of last year, I first realized my friendship with R was toxic. And I was so upset at her for treating me like this. I cut contact with her for a few months to vent.  After the summer, I went to a new school, so of course I still didn't experience contact with her. One day, during the start of the new school year, I decided to come over to R's house for the first time in forever, and she was so excited to see me- I was really happy that our relationship is still strong. 

When she started telling me about what was going on in her life, my heart sunk. I learned that ever since I left, she became depressed and hasn't been doing anything with her life since, and she hadn't been to school in weeks- she was even admitted to a hospital once. And then she told me she was sorry. Sorry for ruining our friendship, sorry for dismissing my own mental health problems, sorry for being toxic. R admitted that she realized how toxic she was then, and was sorry. 

Obviously, I accepted her apology- I figured if she was genuinely upset about how she used to act then she deserved to be a better person. I'm really happy that she was able to grow as a person. And that leads us to where we are today:

Ever since that moment, I've been making sure to check in on her often, either through messages or in person.  And we hung out most recently in July on Canada Day.  After that, I stopped talking to her for about two months- nothing was wrong, but I just was always talking with other friends online and making new ones as well, and I didn't really think about our friendship for a bit. One day I decided to do one of my usual checkups, and, after saying that her mental health was getting better, she went on to say that my life would be better without her, and that I shouldn't worry about her because she was a ""bad friend."" You probably get the idea, I'll try to post screenshots if I can. 

**Now I'm not sure what to do. She's in a bad state right now, and while she is getting better, I can't help but feel like I still need to support her, even though we really aren't the same friends we used to be. I can only trust that she talks to her other friends now, which is good, because it shows that she's working on becoming more social again, but still. I don't want to let go of our friendship yet- she isn't as much of a burden as she thinks she is, but I know I can never convince her otherwise. I want to be there for her, because deep down, I know she can still use my support, Throughout her entire journey I was the only one who was there for her, I've made an effort to help her.**

726,My younger sister (21F) I’m 24F got upset with me because I told her I wanted to decorate my room with a theme that has sparked my interest lately. I’m into crystals and moon vibes. She told me she wants to do noon theme and I told her that’s cool and how mine might be a little different. Then when she heard I wanted to buy crystals she started to attack me by saying how I don’t know about that stuff like she does and she assumed I don’t know about charging crystals. (I do) then when I told her I’m an earthy person and how I’ve always been intune with nature she was like disgusted with me because she thinks I’m copying her when I’m not. Like I know this is childish so I told her it’s immature of her to want to claim things. Then she kept telling me to stop talking to her when I was sticking up for myself and giving examples to why I am intune. Then she stormed out and 15 mins later she comes back and hugs me and I asked her what does she want? Then she asked me why I’m sensitive and still upset about what happened and I told her she started it. Then she goes to my room and asks me if she can borrow my leggings. I told her no because she was fake kind to me just to ask me to borrow my leggings. Then she started to yell at me and say she hates me and how she hates living in the same roof as me because of me. She said how she hates her life because of me. How selfish I am because I won’t let her borrow my leggings and how she let me borrow stuff in the past. She said I’ll never make it to the real world because of my princess behavior.,15Sep2020,1

731,"So I've been out of school for about 8 months. I graduated with my bachelor's in December 2019 and had some time to think about what I really wanted to do. Since I was a kid I've always dreamed about becoming an English teacher. I love to read and write and I truly don't believe there is anything else on this earth that was made for me to do (at least I don't have an interest to do). I've started my grad program and it's been 3 weeks and I find myself stuck between actually believing I am capable enough to be here and if I have the ability to make it through. 

Like I said it's only been 3 weeks but I am required to keep a certain gpa and the work I've been receiving back is very well considered failing or not up to par with the grad school standards. Whereas, in an undergrad program it would be considered passing. I obviously want to keep going but I definitely fear that if  I'm not made to do this I'll be wasting loads of time and money. 


With that being said, looking to hear some advice from those who have either been through this process or are in this process. 

How can you know if you're truly prepared for graduate school? And what advice can you give me for just starting out??? 

Please refrain from rude comments I'm really just looking for honesty and a bit of compassion I guess.

733,"Hi all. So to start off, I wanna sayme and my boyfriend have been together for almost 5 year, and we are very happy with each other.

But the thing is, I have started to feel like that he does not feel good about telling me how he is feeling. He keeps it to himself. I have started thinking that maybe he just doesnt know how to express himself. And maybe he always feels like he has to be a provider and take care of me, you know, not be weak and show emotions to much. 

My boyfriend and I was laying in bed one night, and he was holding me. I thought to myself maybe I should hold him, so I asked, and he was like alright. He legit feel afsleep in my arms. And as he was laying there, I thought to myself that he must really like this. He when started to wanna be hold more and more, and I started thinking more and more about why he liked it so much, so suddenly. I asked him, and he said it was nice being hold, he said he felt safe.

And thats when I really started thinking a lot, how guys are not really ""allowed"" to show weakness, how they must be strong, and take care of others. 

As a little time went by, he started telling me more and more about how he is feeling, and how he feels like he has to be strong. And sometimes he wanna cancel plans, but dont wanna tell me, scared that I will feel sad we cancel. 

What I do now, is offer to hold him everday, and ask him from time to time how he is feeling. Stroke his hair, and tell him how much I love him. Make him morning coffee, and dinner.

But I wanna know, mostly from guys, how can I, as a woman, make my boyfriend feel comfortabl telling me how he is? Maybe even advice on how I can make sure he is not feelings weak. As I said in the title is has asperger, and may take things to litteral. So maybe words to avoid.

736,"We met a couple of years back on a date. After our second date I wanted another and he didn't, but we ended up staying in touch. A little bit awkward at first, since he knew I was interested, but we got over it and became close friends. 

About a year back he started dating someone. Recently, it's become more serious. He wants me to spend time with her, but I really don't want to. I've met her before and we really didn't vibe (she's kind of immature, clingy, &lt;insert other negative descriptors here&gt;). Of course, my feelings of jealousy don't help.

So I don't know what to do. He's aware that I don't particularly like his girlfriend, but he thinks I should be able to better tolerate people I don't like. Which is true... if not for my feelings, maybe I'd still dislike her but I'd be able to grin and bear it. 

I think he's starting to feel hurt that I'm reacting so strongly against her. We fought about it recently, and it's not the first time it comes up. I think he's becoming convinced that I'm a close-minded, awful being that refuses to get past my initial impressions of her -- which I realize is in part true, but it's also because seeing her really hurts. 

I don't think he's aware that I like him. Being interested in someone after a date is different than having feelings for them, so I don't know he's really made that connection. 

I've thought about talking to him about it so he understands why I'm acting the way I am, but it seems wrong. He already rejected me, for one thing, but it also seems extra messed up when he's already in a relationship. Not to mention I'm afraid of mucking up our friendship. 

I'm dating others. Most of the time I'm just super happy and thankful that he's in my life and that I can call him my best friend. I'm happy that he's happy. I'm fine hearing him talk about her. I'd like to think I'm a good friend otherwise and most of the time I'm not totally stuck on him, but spending time with her is a level I'm not at yet.

Do I let him keep thinking I'm a bitch who can't play well with others? Do I suck up the pain and try to spend time with her? Do I explain to him what's happening and hope for the best?

Lately there’s been a few red flags about his home life. He lives with his mom, which isn’t surprising and he always talks about how amazing she is. How she raised him and how much he loves his mom. It’s actually the sweetest thing in the whole world not going to lie. So we got to talking one day and he mentioned his mom doesn’t work. He said “My mom worked her whole life to take care of me, now it’s my responsibility to take care of her” which is like, omg so messed up. But I also assume there is some government assistance to help out but it was still odd. Then one day I asked him what he had planned for the day, he said he had to go clean his house. That his mom was really messy, and that it’s his job as the son to ensure her house is clean. Again saying “she raised me all those years so it’s his job to take care of her” 

Those are just two examples, but he’s always bringing home supper for her, talking about how he cleans up after her and is working 30-40 hours a week, and it appears she takes all his money.

752,"In a group of friends since hs. Me and one friend got in an argument. Found out he started following my ex (broke up a few years ago but I called her a bunch last month [im over her idk why I did that]) on a few social platforms. I came off too aggressive messaging him because (though I'm over her) I didn't know I was being backstabbed by my friend. He kicked me out of the group chat and then sent them our exchange of texts (Which, I came off aggressive)

The texts between us also included us talking about problems between me and my ex had (including when I was clingy, constant calls I called last month and she called the police tell me to stop [i know, it's bad]) and my toxic behavior I did with my ex when we dated. No one has invited me back in. I messaged him a few days an apology for coming off too hard but no response. 

Any advice?",15Sep2020,1
753,"A couple weeks ago a very close friend (24M) and I (22F) mutually decided we needed space from each other. I was in a bad head space with depression, and I still don’t know what exactly was going on with him but I know he wasn’t in the best head space either. Tension had been building between us for a couple months and resulted in a fight which ended in our separation.

We both left it open ended with the possibility of becoming friends again. “I know this is a rough patch in our friendship but I’ll always love you” is how he ended it, and “I love you but I need to do what’s best for me. I hope future circumstances will allow us to come back together again in a more positive dynamic” is how I ended it. 

I’ve been writing and editing a letter to him the past couple weeks, mostly for my own processing. If I do send it, I’ll allow myself more than 2 weeks before I do. I’m just not sure how much good it would do? My reasons for sending it would be to get some things off my chest that I never got the chance to say in the heat of the moment, and maybe to get some clarity from him about what he feels went wrong. He said and did a lot of hurtful things during those last couple months and especially in that last fight. He’s a good person, just very clueless when it comes to certain things, and like I said I think he wasn’t in a good head space. I was very upset and confused, so I couldn’t express myself properly.

Pretty sure he has me muted on social media (but still following and not blocked) so until he unmutes me I’ll take that as a sign he doesn’t want to hear from me. I’m okay with that, I have him muted too but I’m just not sure if it’d be smart to send a letter while he has me muted. Would it be okay to text him asking if he would be okay with receiving a letter from me? Or should I just leave it alone completely until he shows some sign of wanting to revisit it?",15Sep2020,1

Well last night she said that she wanted to get a tattoo at some point and asked if i would really break up with her over it. I said i would be sad and angry that she would knowing what i said day 1.

756,"I need some help picking a new job. Right now I work in animal medicine as a veterinary technician. I decided that this wasn’t for me and have gone back to school for nursing. Right now I’m doing my pre requisite classes for a nursing program and haven’t applied yet. 

I applied to a few places for part time work and have two options now. I got the job for a sex shop (part time, $14/hour plus commission). I’d be working nights and 20-30 hours a week. 

The other position I received was as an in home caregiver for elderly patients. I’d make $14/hour and it would be based around my schedule; 
“Are you available for a client from 6am - 1 pm this week”?”

I’m really torn as I loved the sex shop, the employees were wonderful and management was great. Having day time hours free would allow me to study, clean and take care of my routine things before work. I’d also have steady hours and know my schedule. 

Caregiving was appealing because of the flexibility of hours, being able to make my own schedule essentially. I’d make the same amount of money and it is more appealing to nursing schools when I do apply.

758,"My college career thus far has been pretty rough. While I'm not doing awfully per se, my mental health has been poorly managed and even since seeing a psychiatrist several times and getting on a medication plan that has helped somewhat, I still have trouble functioning regularly. The beginning of this semester has seen skyrocketing anxiety (which I thought I had more or less under control), to the point that I'm paralyzed and have trouble working unless I have a rare spurt of motivation. I've missed several assignments due to this fear, and I'm worried that with the combined stress of the world right now, online class, and everything else going on in my life I won't be able to salvage this semester.

The problem is, my parents are helping me significantly through college, and I don't know how to tell them I might not be able to do this. I know they love me, but I'm terrified of disappointing them or putting additional stress on them in this rough time with my own struggles. 

Should I try to just apply myself, or should I drop my classes and talk to my parents? I really need help/guidance, I'm just feeling crushed under the weight right now.",15Sep2020,1

* I have not been able to (and will not be able to) get work experience before the reapplying deadline in January. 
* There is not one degree currently that interests me enough to do. Art and Design is one I've thought about, but the career prospects aren't great. I don't have much experimental experience or techniques that you need to create art of that standard.
* I'm worried if I take two gap years I'll be too behind everyone else + I think I'll lose motivation to ever go to uni or do anything towards my future.
* I am having to resit my physics in 3 weeks. The workload is overwhelming I have no motivation and no teacher to help.

At first, thanks for reading this 💞

So, my problem is with my personality: sometimes I feel like a completely kiddo, I watch AT, draw frogs, wear fun clothes and being childish, but sometimes I feel extremely cottagecore old lady, who loved to cook and do her embroidery, I wear vintage and beautiful dresses and skirts, being nice and read a lot, and on the other hand, sometimes I identify myself as a Writer, bc I actually write for like 7-8 years straight and - don't wanna be selfish - but im pretty good at it, me as a writer : very chaotic, talented and dramatic, really deep and sensitive,

771,"Title says it all. Both in our early to mid 20s and live together. It’s been 2 weeks since we’ve had sex at all (usually it’s multiple times a week).  In the past month we’ve tried three times and he couldn’t finish/stopped midway. The other night I asked him if everything was ok, and he said he’s not sure but every now and then he loses his sex drive for a bit and it eventually comes back. On the other hand, he admitted that he’s been masturbating once or twice a day but doesn’t seem to think that is why because he’s always masturbated throughout our relationship. Said he’s gonna try not to do it this week. 

He also went out on his own and bought this herbal supplement that’s supposed to boost his sex drive and said he really hope it works. Not sure what to think of it all- how can his sex drive be gone if he’s still masturbating so often? I also found 3 different sex toys in his closet.

774,"I work for a governmental organization in a HCOL area and have been there for almost five years. It’s an okay job and the pay and benefits are great, but the workplace is super toxic and the cost of living is just far too high. I have actually been applying for jobs all year and had one lined up in March that was cancelled due to Covid. 

Finally, it’s seeming like I’m going to have a shot at a job offer for a similar position in another state. The pay would probably be a 15-20% reduction, but the total cost of living is about 45% lower - mostly from housing which is about 60% cheaper and is my biggest expense now. Debt is very low so the only other expenses are just daily living expenses. However, the median home price in my area is over $1M, so I’ve given up on owning property here. Overall, this would equate to getting like a 20%+ raise in my current situation. On top of that, it’s a place I’d actually like to live unlike where I do now. 

However, I am concerned about making a move like this during these Covid times.  In my current job I have security - we’ve already been told that there will definitely not be job cuts in the next 12-15 months which I feel can outlast Covid. However, if I move to another organization I could be the first fat to be cut. Both are essential governmental services, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be staff consolidation.

The next day we get into another fight. We were just talking about our relationship in general. She tells me she is “done”. I have heard this so many times in so many ways from her...

I have told here multiple times I can have her just give up like that. I told her fine, I’m done. She freaked out and starts crying. I tell her to go home I’m worn out.

782,"I am a 19 year old living with my adoptive parents. 

I want to state in advance: my childhood was really, really awful. I have RAD and spent at least half of it in foster care. It wasn't fun, everyone has their bad times. Mine just lasted a while and have had some devastating long term effects. 

I'll be leaving for school hopefully next semester, around January, and it's 4 hours away from home. Last time I tried to move away for college, my dad kept playing at my emotions until I came home because I was terrified and possibly not ready yet. This was a year ago. 

I recently, like today actually, dropped out of my current college (technical school) not only to prepare for this but also because it wasn't what I wanted to pursue at all, not even close. I have a passion for medicine, but I keep getting shoved into computer science and stuff. And yeah, I'm good at it but I do not enjoy it. It was making my life miserable on top of other garbage. I haven't told my parents yet, as I'm afraid they'll kick me out now and even with 10k+ savings I'd be screwed. Deal was I'm here through college. 

My dad is abusive as hell. I had to call 911 over it once and I just got sent to a hotel. (where my dad then persuaded me he was sorry and 2 hours later was screaming.). My mom believes nothing she's ever done to me or my dad is wrong, and him and I both know this is bullshit. If you couldn't tell from me saying all this, home life is toxic and unbearable between all 3 of us despite how much my dad tells me he loves me.

Good lord, not only was the building smelling disgusting, but the apartment we put a security deposit into wasn’t even ready like they said it would be by then. We checked out the one they had available but when we saw it, it had bed bugs all over the floor. Literally a line of them shits coming out of the wall. We were disgusted and pissed.

Things get harder when my strict parents refused to let them stay at home until we find an apartment. Not only because they’re elderly and fear Covid, but because they’re Nigerian and saying no to their kids is in our blood.

After hopping from hotel to hotel, I realize how much more annoying these two really are together. I was already used to my boy since we’ve know each other for 5 years. Even his girl ain’t bad. But them together is just so obnoxious after time.

But here’s the kicker. They got mad at me for admitting that we weren’t ready or should’ve prepared better for the situation. (We thought we could get by with unemployment before we jobs...) I still haven’t apologize because the next day, his girl not only forgot $200 worth of rent money at the hotel, but apparently didn’t even have her social security card with her??? God knows if she even knows it by heart.

To make matters worse, his girl mostly paid for the hotel. But needs me to pay back at least $50. I have a savings but went broke from all the gas, food, and bud we went through. Bad move on my part, not the best with money. And I have to pay up for a speeding ticket next week. He wants to call me “inconsiderate” despite telling him my situation and finally getting them to my family’s house while they’re all away so we wouldn’t have to put up for hotels anymore. I just want them outta my hair at this point because I’m starting to resent the shit outta them.

Am I the asshole for wanting my half of the security deposit back?

TLDR: Picked a shitty apartment, had to go hotel hoping, got yelled at for being right, called inconsiderate for wanting my half back.",15Sep2020,1

Alongside this, I begun having doubts with what i want to do with my life and if computing is right for me or if i should switch to a school that is closer in which i can do a levels.

On the other hand, i also applied to do A levels (Business Studies,Psychology and Biology) I've always been interested in business and Biology and passed both at a GCSE level. Currently, i'm in the process of ensuring i still have a place there, my thought process being i can use this time to truely decide what i want to do with my life and therefore have three pathways to follow to either university or employment.

At the end of this week I'll be moving to a new country, partly for work, but also for the experience itself. In a lot of ways I'm super excited to do something really different and engaging. My mental health was worst when I was relatively isolated in my family home with nothing to do.

792," 

A little about me: Male (49), Married (20 years), 2 kids, good job until COVID, mostly happy but sometimes deal with seasonal depression. Love my wife, my kids and my home.

I sometimes (about every 8 months) get angry with my wife and yell at her. When it happens I can't control it. I'm reading advice about anger management and it always starts with ""count to 10"". With me there is no counting to 10 because it's like a switch goes on and I can't turn it off.  

Anything can trigger it - Kids, if she teases me (she is kind, I take her playfulness the wrong way), etc. Nothing big has to happen and she is certainly not abusive.  

This has also happened in the past with road-rage, it's not just her that triggers it but again very infrequently.  

After these incidents she is upset and I feel awful. We talk about it and try to sort things out. Why did it happen? And I never have an answer. We are on year 20 and certainly don't want to split up, I want to make this better. She doesn't deserve to get yelled at and I feel l terrible for weeks after I do this.

802,"17M here. I am just starting my senior year of high school and I have had this massive crush on a guy in my grade, who we'll call ""C"", since the beginning of 10th grade. I am actually not sure if I should call it a crush because I don't really know anything about his personality, just something about his physical appearance infatuates me to an extent that I can't even explain with words. I don't think it is relevant for me to explain his physical appearance, but to me he is the epitome of perfect. Strangely enough, I am the only person who seems to find him attractive. My friends don't really think he is anything special, while I have never been so attracted to another person in my life. It is to the point where I feel like I can never be attracted to another person ever again because I will always compare them to C. I'm sorry if I sound creepy. I don't think I've ever actually spoken to him in person, although I have had classes with him. I am so tired of being in love with someone who barely knows I exist, as it has really wrecked my perception of love, has made me hate myself for being bisexual, made me feel like an unattractive creep, and makes me feel like there is something wrong with me because I simply can't just forget about him.

I know this may not sound like a serious problem but it has just caused me so much heartache, has made me pessimistic about my future love life, and has intensified my insecurities. It makes me sad knowing that I can never have him. Perhaps you are reading this and wondering, ""If you like him, why don't you try to tell him? How do you know he doesn't like you back?"". Here's how I know he doesn't like me back: as I said we are both boys. I am bisexual and I am 95% sure he is straight. He is part of the more popular crowd in my grade where being anything but straight is unheard of and is most certainly unacceptable. I have heard many boys from that crowd say terrible and homophobic things. It hurts me knowing that he is probably the same as them, but I can't really express my feelings openly as I am still largely closeted. I am no longer in denial about my sexuality, nor am I insecure about it, but I just don't know how to be open about it as I have spent so much time closeted. Only my close friends know about my sexuality. Anyway I feel like this is less relevant to the story.

Due to coronavirus, him and I will be separated as there are smaller class sizes and we are in separate groups, or ""cohorts"" as they call them in my school. I will not have any classes with him at all, and it is highly unlikely that I will see him at all. This is our last year of high school before college, so I may never see him again for the rest of my life. That makes me really sad but it is a sign that I need to forget about this guy and move on with my life. Thing is, I have tried to do that, but...I don't really know how to forget about him nor do I know how to go about moving on. I have been very bummed out lately because of that. My friends know about how I find him attractive but they don't really know the extent of my infatuation. I won't tell them because it won't help me at all, it will just make them think I am weird. Because of that, there are so many pent up feelings and emotions that come to mind when I think of him. I don't feel any anger or resentment towards him whatsoever, just thinking about him makes me feel sad and insecure. It almost makes me feel like I am trapped as this has been going on for two years and I can't seem to snap out of it.

I stalk his social media frequently, look at his photo in our school yearbook all the time, and think about him CONSTANTLY. There is something seriously abnormal about this, and to be completely honest, I have actually gone through something very similar to this before. However, that is a completely different story. I bring that up because, although I have moved on from that previous ordeal, I feel as if I didn't deal with it properly or effectively. If you have read this far, thank you so much. I know this may not seem too serious but I have just felt trapped in this obsession for so long and I desperately need to breathe again. I just need happiness and clarity. PLEASE give me your advice on how to move on. Have you guys ever gone through something similar? Please feel free to share your stories and how you dealt with them!!!!",15Sep2020,1
803,"Slight backstory -   
I'm very heavily visually impaired, legally classified as blind although I can see enough to get around by myself, if a little awkwardly. For the last year or so I've had a 'kindle fire HD 10', it has a really big screen which helps immensely when I'm reading powerpoints on it for uni etc.  


Now recently for whatever reason the charging port has become more and more broken, going from having to insert the charger in at a certain angle to rarely charging at all, finally it just stopped working so I had to get it repaired, my father was heading into town (Guildford, Surrey in the UK)  so he dropped it by a local, new, repair shop, and gave them my number for them to text me when it's ready. They then gave him a piece of paper with the order number, what device it was for and the price, £40. He then gave me that paper when he got back home.  


A few days later got a 1 second voicemail message from the shop, then a call saying that my order was ready to pick up. I went into the shop, gave them that paper which they promptly scurried away with and got my kindle back, then when I paid they actually put £60 into the cash machine instead of the previously agreed £40, I assumed that this was the correct price since I hadn't actually been told the price and couldn't read what they'd written on the piece of paper. So I paid them that.  


Now this by itself is just a silly 'haha should have made sure I knew the price before I paid' sort of thing, but the worst part is that when I went home and turned the kindle on a few hours later, I moved my finger across the screen and felt a sharp pain in the tip, they'd given the screen of my kindle a big old spiderweb crack, which I didn't see at the shop because of the whole blind thing. Now I have a big cut in my hand from cutting it on the cracked glass, and I had to fish a little shard of glass out of my finger.  


I'm gonna go into the shop tomorrow in full 'blind person getup', aim for some pity points, and ask them to fix the screen, I don't really care about the £20 other than the principle of it, it's kinda funny anyway, but not being able to use my kindle for fear of slicing my finger open is gonna be REALLY troublesome. However if they're prepared to give someone a kindle which has clearly been broken I reckon there's a good 90% chance their answer is going to be 'lol no'. So... what the hell do I do now? I could phone amazon support, I hear they're pretty happy to replace broken things, might be worth giving it a shot anyway. Any other ideas? I could just go to another repair shop, but then I'll be forking out a whole bunch of money again",15Sep2020,1
804,"Hi, 
 I got asked if I could go into work tomorrow for a meeting. Issue is in the past I have been fairly unwell (h1n1, sepsis and two skin infections that tracked up my lymph nodes and made it hard for me to use my hards for a while due to swelling) which made me a bit paranoid about getting unwell. I told my boss this last week and he said it's fine and I didn't need to go in but this week he asked again.

I feel bad for saying I don't feel safe because I really want to go in but I am too worried about getting unwell again. I also feel like he doesn't think covid is such a big issue and tries to get the entire team for get togethers which I want no part of.

I also feel like covid is ruining my life a little bit as well because I am worried to go out and meet people at all, worried that I might get it. It has also started to affect my mental health a lot.

806,"So last year I adopted a 5 year old cat from a local rescue centre. He was found in may 2019 and I adopted him in June. He was reported to have been wandering around a nearby village for months. I love this cat, he is the nicest cat you could come across, he’s so big and cuddly, I would be lost without him. 

It’s always been in the back of my mind that I’ve wondered who his original owners were. About 10 minutes ago I had the idea to search on Facebook “(village name) missing cat”. Lo and behold one of the first posts was from 2017 and it’s without a doubt my cat. His markings are so distinctive that it is 100% him. I looked on their Facebook page and saw they have kids. I feel so guilty like it’s a big dirty secret but he’s my cat. I paid for him, I look after him, in every way this is my cat. 

My conscience is weighing on me. If the situations were reversed I would want to know he’s okay. If it were me I would want him back. I’m afraid that if I reach out to them that they will want to take him away from me which would devastate me.

810,"I've never realised how controlling she is until I list everything she's restricted me.

In my country, you can get a free scholarship to study abroad debt-free since our universities are not universally recognised or something. My friends work multiple jobs to afford this and I've always thought I was lucky to have this without a pricetag. Now here's where my mom comes in. She encouraged me to study hard to be certified for the scholarship, being like ""Think of all the places and new friends you can meet!"" I worked my ass off, even became a straight A+ student and earned multiple 4.0 GPAs at one point. Once I graduated she refused to apply me for the scholarship and instead wants me to study in a local university. It's also not ""internationally recognised"" meaning I cannot study overboard for my masters either. When the wishlist for university came in, they sent it to my mom's email and she filled it in and sent it without my permission or approval, now I'm stuck here about to enter a university. She still has no valid excuse for me not to study overboard beside her not approving and wanting me stay. I know there's any empty nest syndrome here but manipulating me to stay against my will and lying is NOT the way to deal with it. I have a small close friend circle of 4 people and they're ALL travelling overboard to an internationally recognised university THEY CHOSE studying majors that THEY CHOSE because they LOVE it. Me? The exact opposite of the entire statement. Yet everyone thinks my mom is an angel doing the right thing because she cares about me and my future.

I'll never remember that one time I asked a relative what she'd like her son to study once he's done with high school, her response was ""Whatever he wants to!"" and I literally felt goosebumps because I've never been told by mom that I can live my life however I want to. It's something so normal and acceptable yet my mom makes freedom of choice seems like something I should be on my knees crying to live my own life to achieve.

If this isn't enough, she's also been trying to choose MY major. MY future. The thing I'll be doing for the next half century while she rots in her coffin happy I'm in her dream bubble of dentist/engineer/lawyer. I browsed the majors and went through all of them, and she always has an excuse why it's not suitable. She wants me to have the highest paying job whether I enjoy doing it or not. She practically made my mentality explode by mentioning dentistry. She'd call my friends and beg them to bring up conversations of dentistry, think of the pay, think of the salary, and more rubbish.

She'd bring up paying for my private school and tuition for guilt-trapping me to become a dentist/engineer/lawyer and it's not even her who's paying. She's a housewife and all this money is coming from my dad who encourages me to study what I want yet won't speak up against my mom. I personally want to study marketing, I have a decent foundation and a big interest in the subject, I love its combination of psychology, design, and literature and it screams perfect for me. My mom's response? It's a subject for those who failed at school and is an embarrassing major to choose from when everyone a mechanical engineer or dentist or other high-paying crap. Next week I'm intentionally failing my science aptitude test to guarantee I'm not going for the engineering/medical field.

Sometimes all this makes me question my value in life to see her writing up my future without checking up on me to see if I'm happy or not. Money and salaries really screwed up her mind. If I speak up, I shout. I shout, she loses her shit. But she goes ahead manipulating me, lying to me, forcing me with what to do with my future and expects me to be okay with it. It's so bad sometimes I wish she gets hit by a car or something so I can be responsible for my OWN future. I no longer want this maniac in my life or I'll be living unhappy.",15Sep2020,1

812,"So my parents have pushed me to the point where I want to cut contact with them and Was wondering if it is justified and how I can do it successfully.

Onto the reasons why,So when I was younger my parents used corporal punishment which is slightly normal where I am from so I do not really blame them for it but they had parenting magazines and chose to ignore the content and use the African way. My earliest memory I remember is my Dad hitting me and me crying in pain as I did not even know why.When I got older and joined primary school,I used to fear coming home from school as my dad will go through my homework and hit me for every mistake,I mean every mistakes, a letter ""a"" is a bit. disfigured, go get the laptop charger and I hit you a couple of times.He would count out the mistakes I made and multiply by 4 and hit me.He hit me about 40 times for each homework I had and I could not cry as he would scream ""You are a man how dare you cry!"" and hit me harder.This gave me a fear of mistakes which I still have today,I also thought violence was the answer for everything and was quite violent till I learnt there are other ways to solve problems than fighting from my friends.I also have low confidence, he hit me and it made me feel weak and helpless which I think made me have low confidence.I remember one New Years he left me with my year old sister and I wanted to talk to go outside and play with my friends, so I asked my mom if she can take care of the baby and she agreed, when I came back home he hit me so hard I hard scars for a long time because I had not taken care of the baby then at the end of the day when it was time to bathe my sister I did not know how to fix the water heater as it had a certain issue and my mom punched me,culturally the beginning of the year can signify how the rest of the year goes so I was scared as I had a national exam that year and was so scared I would fail and not make it through life.

My parents make fun of me a lot, not like in a joking way like friends, in a way that is supposed to hurt you. They have called me fat a lot and I am starting to starve myself because of this comments,I am 5'10 and 60kgs which I don't think is that fat but my parents think otherwise.Like when I sit on a chair and it creeks they start making fun that I am so heavy and fat.When I am fitted they touch my stomach and comment on how fat I am.The thing is, the only reason I am fat is because I used to be thin and they encouraged me to gain some wait, they would say stuff like.You are so thin, gain some weight while you are still at your moms house.I hate it.Once at a social gathering, he called me a loss of value and not worthy of his surname(I hope to change it later).I had studied hard to get good grades so I would make them proud of me and that was his response.

My parents just put me down a lot.When I was young I had never been on a plane and I really enjoyed seeing them fly as we lived near an airport so I wanted to be a pilot and I committed to this by learning a lot of Math,Science and Geography.I was a happy 8 year old when I learnt about planes from Youtube and XPlane 10,I was able to get the mod and start a Boeing 747 from scratch.I enjoyed flying around and seeing mountains but my dad and mom told me that it is a really boring job and it is just turning on autopilot and monitored the systems which is true but who tells that to an 8 year old.I actually would enjoy doing that but I did not think so when I was 8.My whole world was destroyed and I decided to take my own life my ingesting insecticides that we used on crops(My parents told me it would kill me).I was so sad when I woke up that I had not died.Then I discovered Discovery Science and fell in love with Physics and wanted to me an Aerospace engineer at NASA. Again I committed to this by learning basic high school physics when I was 11.My parents told me that I would not make it because the Americans hate black people and I would not be hired.They said""Uncle John went to MIT on a football scholarship and could not be hired because they hate black people.""I was devastated.Then I fell in love with computers when my friend told me to join coding club in school.It gave me a sense of control I guess and I loved it.We did basic python before the pastor of our school(our school was a school owned by a church) said it was evil and stopped it.I am currently trying to self teach html css and javascript(any help with this will be great).I wanted to become a game developer but my dad thought he would give me some helpful advice by telling me to choose finance as I would make more money because there is no money in game development.I have never cared about the money but what will make me happier. He said""Let me give you my wisdom, you know in life their are easier ways to make money and there is a lot of money in finance,game development will not be there in the future, you have to give money to the church and take care of your family""(I do not really want a wife or kids but I a wife would make me happy but even without a wife I will be happy).My friend told me to do computer science or software engineering because I would be able to make games but also find great jobs if their are no game development jobs available.I loved basic programming anyway,I would watch people code on YouTube and enjoy it and try to follow along.

My parents are some of the most hateful people I have met.Super Rich? Illuminati,Not Christian Illuminati,LGBT Q?Illuminati.I think they are suck so much that their only way to gain validation is by judging others and making themselves feel holier.My dad once came home proud and said that he met a Muslim at work and challenged his religion, according to the way he told the story the Muslim did not want to engage. The Muslim guy was clearly uncomfortable and was not even his friend. His friend smuggled Bibles to a country where Christianity is not allowed I think and put the small bibles in peoples bags, correct me if am wrong but this can me dangerous I think.He tried to intstil hate in me but reddit helped me understand that I should respect peoples beliefs as they are part of their life ,for example a Christians life might be a bit sadder if an Atheist proves them wrongs they believe they will see their loved ones who have passed in heaven. I respect everyones beliefs as long as they do not harm anyone.A few years ago the loud house came out in my country, my dad and mom banned us from watching it as it Lincoln had gay parents( I am not sure).I did. not even know that.He tried to instil homophobia but I did not really care about who people have sex with as long as their is consent. I look up to Larry Page and they claimed he became wealthy because of Illuminati and it pissed me off.They say all white people are racist but I know for a fact this is untrue,I want to move to Germany when I finish high school and live there and they told me that. He work for an Italian guy who gave him a job when he was jobless for a few months and gave him 3 months of pay beforehand to get him back on his feet and he has the nerve to call the guy a racist.The Italian guy trusted him enough to do that.

I am quite knowledgable on some topics and this is a typical stupid conversation with me: \[MOM/DAD\]Stop watching that halloween episode of a show.

\[ME\]Give me one logical reason why.

\[MOM/DAD\]Halloween is evil as it has terrible origins.

\[ME\]:So does Christmas,yet we celebrate it.

\[MOM/DAD\]:But the intention is what matters.

\[ME\]:So kids wearing costumes of their favourite fictional/real character is evil.

\[MOM/DAD\]:Their are more deaths during Halloween.

\[ME\]:Kids are walking around in the dark what do you expect?

\[MOM/DAD\]:Illuminati do witchcraft during halloween.

\[ME\]:Speechless.

The last reason is they treat our maids like trash.Our maids come from very poor families like 100USD a month is a good salary poor and my parents blame them for everything and shout at them instead of pointing out the issue and talking calmly.I have formed a bond with our maids and they like me. My little sister beats them up and they cannot do anything about it and my parents do not do anything about it.I have such a close bond with them that if I could afford to take myself through high school and college and I had two choices,Kill my entire family or my one maid(I call her aunt) I would choose my aunt 10/10 times.

I just need to see if I am just a hormonal teenager or I am justified in feeling like cutting contact with them .At this point it feels like I am just staying until I am old enough to move out and get my own place.I think I have a love for them at the bottom of my heart but I hate them as well.I am quite religious and I am really scared that if I cut contact I will have a short life""[**Exodus 20:12**](https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm)

813,"I’ve been struggling to find things I’m interested in. I’m undergoing a career change because after 6 years, I realized it was no longer my passion and Covid times seems like as good as ever to start over

My problem is I have very few passions in life. Things don’t interest me. I try things, but if I’m not good at them I just don’t find them to be worth it. I understand that in order to be good at things, you need to work at them over time, but I can’t find anything I feel like putting effort into. I just spend all my day on YouTube, Reddit, Twitter and Instagram

I’d consider going to school, but for what? I want to go with an intention and understanding of something I am working towards. I just don’t find anything really worth working for.

814,"I(26F) work for my dad at his small company. I mainly work in the office and take care of inventory. He has been super stressed because his retirement relies on how well this company does. He has said to me that my actions can mean the difference between him retiring or not. 

I love my dad and we have a great relationship aside from work. I have multiple mental illnesses, which is why he hired me in the first place (I had a really bad burn out breakdown and we made a deal with the psych hospital that they could release me on the condition that he watched me 24/7 for my safety, so we live and work together). I got out of the major depression I was in, started taking medicine and really became a productive human. I have no doubt that had I not worked for him, that would not be the case. But now his stress is taking a more serious toll on me. 

I don’t want to be the reason my dad can’t retire. I feel that if I stay, it won’t happen and i would feel guilty forever. If I leave, he would be upset but also understanding and our relationship would repair itself over time. I would have to train someone to replace me, but in order to do that, I have to open up the conversation with my dad. How do I tell him this?",15Sep2020,1

So about a week ago I called in sick because I was feeling nauseous and fatigued, after calling in sick I got an email from my company saying that I could not return to work for 10 days because my symptoms were some of the symptoms of COVID (if you want to read up about how I felt about the whole thing just look at my other post). So anyway, yesterday morning I get a call from the company and they ask how i’m feeling, I say i’m fine, so they clear me to go back to work on the 17th. I check my schedule to see what i’m scheduled for and I see that i’m scheduled for a shift tomorrow on the 16th. I’m really not sure what to do in this situation? Should I just go to my shift, and if i’m not allowed back yet just let them send me home. Or should I contact my store and ask if i’m allowed back for the shift tomorrow (though this option scares me a bit because i’m afraid they will be angry with me for even asking).

819,"Hey guys,

So I'm in a bit of a panic. I have just graduated with a BA in Economics and got an offer for a Masters in Economics too. However I was already working full-time at a company and I was well on my way towards building a career...well until I was let go because of change in business needs due to COVID-19.  Also, Economics wasn't really something I was passionate about and I'm wondering how well will that go with a research paper that I will inevitably have to write. I was always about maths but y'know, mistakes were made I suppose.  


I was quite depressed in summer because of this and I forgot about my Masters offer. Now I just panic registered for classes because I needed to do something right, couldn't just do nothing and with the job market in a weird state, job search does seem to be even more difficult than usual for fresh graduates.  


Now I'm asking you guys for advice because I want to know what would be the best way to go professionally since I do not plan on going for a Ph.D after completing my Masters.  


The current options that I have in mind are:  
\-Do my masters, tough it out, finish it in Summer 2021 and then look for a job with (perhaps) better qualifications; I was thinking of taking courses related to Stats and Big Data since I have no real interest in macro or micro-econ.  
\-Look for a job right now, risk wasting time when I could've been working towards an MA. Mind you that I can work towards completing a SAS certification exam since I was working as a SAS programmer before COVID and then perhaps keep looking with that certification (probably) make my job prospects a bit better.  


What do you guys think? I realize that this is extremely specific but the gist is that I'm not sure if an MA is the right idea for me and I feel like I'm making panic decisions right now. Do you guys think that there are other options I'm missing out on too?  


Thanks!",15Sep2020,1

Maybe 'following' isn't the right word but I hope you'll get it. So I decided that I should try and make the most of my last year of high school. Decided to go on a diet and eat healthy, try being more social and less awkward around people and ask out my crush of eight years (I know it's long please don't ask me why). I'm in pretty good contact with her and I decided for the first time to ask her to go do something together. Just the two of us. This is something I never had the balls to do and I'm happy I made the first steps. Unlucky for me though she was too busy and didn't have time. So I decided to give it some time. Greet her when I see her and try to have some small talk. A while later I tried asking again. This time she was in a group so I asked her if I could ask her something again (which was again a first for me. I don't have the guts to just go to a big group and talk with someone like that) but she was busy again. My friends say that maybe she's lying but I'm very gullible. Though despite of this I still feel like she's honest. I just don't want to walk after her for I have no idea how long. If it was up to me I'd wait till she says she's less busy but I have no idea when that will be. I get it if it's maybe me and maybe want to ask her if it's me that's the problem as well but she is always so busy I can't ask her  That's what I'm here to ask for. What would you recommend  in this situation?

I usually don't do this so please be kind and if you have any questions please feel free to ask me. If I come across as an asshole or anything close to that please know I'm sorry.",15Sep2020,1

826,"I've been dealing with depression for a long time now, and I use reddit to kind of vent my frustration. 

I will make memes on r/2meirl4meirl or vent on r/vent, r/ventart. It's a way for me to cope and feel connected with people. 
I will sometimes exaggerate what I feel, or post something that I myself dont really relate, but I know others will. 

I first found out when she started talking about me eating, I've been looking on r/edanonymemes, and posted some memes about it. Out of nowhere, she starts talking about it... I never told her or showed her anything that would indicate that I'm getting an eating disorder. 
a couple of hours back, we went to the psychiatrist to change my meds, I was nervous, so I started fidgeting. She gets nervous when i do that, so she gives me her phone to distract myself. 

I noticed she had reddit, which wasnt really a suprise, since I've introduced her to it. But as soon as I got in, her feedback wasnt what I was expecting. 
r/ventart, r/selfharm, r/help, r/madeofstyrofoam, r/edanonymemes and others. 
all the subreddits that I use... at first I thought it was just because she felt like self harming, but the majority of the subreddits weren't famous, it was 1k subreddits that I follow.... 

and after looking at her profile, she was following my main account u/moon-lover. 

I felt so angry... and I still am.. I know it's stupid but I use reddit to vent without being judged or feel bad, I feel secure in posting how I feel because I know I wont have to deal with others crying or trying to make me talk. 
I feel naked, like my feel of privacy was stripped open... 

I tell her when I'm not ok, I told her how my meds dont seem to work anymore, and how i need new ones... it's hard for me to tell others that I'm not ok, so telling that to my mom took a lot from me.. 

I know it must be frustrating for my mom, since I'm not able to be head on with her, but this just broke me... 

Now I'm thinking about other places I vent, I'm thinking if my mom read my journal or got into my computer and saw my dialogue with people... 

I'm thinking about being passive aggressive, maybe posting something and see if she sees it... there are so many posts that I would never want my mom to see...

The thing about that is I have a company vehicle for my job, and I only use my personal car about once or twice a week.

831,"On Sunday my (22 m) brother (23 m) attempted suicide by jumping off a bridge. Thankfully he has survived with only shattered heels.

I will call him Adam and myself Brad for anonymity 

I called yesterday to try to speak to him but was advised he is very drowsy and wouldnt be a good time to talk so I left my number for him to call me back.

I didnt receive a call so I called again today and actually spoke to him.

A bit of context is needed here - my brother has been completely disowned by my family for previous instances (stealing, lying, drug abuse and manipulation to list a few) so I havent spoken to him in over 3 years.

When I got through he asked who was calling I said  Brad your brother. He responded my real brother? ""Yes"" my actual brother Brad? ""Yeah mate its me""

He then broke down crying saying how its so good to hear my voice and he never thought I would call him and it was one of his ""friends"" pretending to be me to talk to him.

We spoke for a bit and the majority of the conversation was him apologising and thanking me for calling and we ended the call by him asking if I could ask my mum and sister if they would call him. I did this for him and both have refused understandably after everything that has happened between our family. (My sister has since called him and put a massive statement on fb about it trying to be the perfect family member after screaming at me for even bringing it up)

The issue is that while my family know I'm in contact with him since this has happened they are concerned its just another manipulation however I honestly dont think it is.

He has said with the time he's had to reflect so far he needs to get away from his toxic environment but also has 2 kids and a third due in a month so its not as simple as that.

I want to help him but I have seen first hand how slippery that slope is and how it drags everyone down with him and I'm afraid that if I offer any signposting to help him his pride might get in the way and he refuse.

He has been to prison multiple times and it hasn't straightened him out however i do feel that this is different, the drugs aren't as easily available and he's being monitored because of him jumping.

Does anyone have any advice on how to help him without destroying my own life.

Extra info- 
This is in the UK.

I live 160 miles away from him.

833,"For the past several years (since I was 12, I'm now 17) I have been on Prozac for my depression and anxiety. Over time, my pediatrician has had to up the dose several times, until we reached the legal limit. For a while, this worked for me, but things have changed. There was a separation in my family, we had to move, and online school made my depression hit me like a truck. The decline started in March, but continued on for months. I had several panic attacks, and eventually ended up having a complete breakdown.

A few weeks ago, I finally went to the doctor and explained what had been happening. She changed my medication to Lexapro. I'm currently on the 10mg doseage, but it's come with some unwanted side affects. The mild one was weight gain, though it's hard to tell if it's because of the pills or beginning to eat semi-regularly again. The main problem, however, is my sleep. Since switching to Lexapro, I've begun to experience what could be called narcoleptic tendencies. It started with being difficult to get up in the morning, but by now I feel exhausted all of the time. The best description I can give is that it feels like there are weights strapped to every limb and both my eyelids. I find myself nearly falling asleep in class or missing them. Not every day is particularly awful, and I'm trying desperately to push through it, but I honestly don't know what to do.

Nothing makes or made me happy, not even gifts(which I didn't receive many, so it makes it even more strange).  I have no faith, no God, idol, favourite music or food or anything. 

Probably becuause I see the things that others call ""seeing the beauty in simple things"" as meaningless.

For example, I have weeks when I don't eat because I'm not hungry, so why would I exceed if I can live with very little to nothing? 

Or my last relationships, which were ended just because I couldn't feel anything. I simply didn't. And I must admit I was loved a lot. So I thought ending them was the most rational and helpful option for the other one.

I know this is the way I am, I'm not mad about it, but what's the point then? Of being like that?

835,"My boyfriend is a very lovely guy i’d say that, but theres one thing that really hit me about the relationship is He is living a very unhealthy lifestyle, not as he smokes everyday or have bad social circles, more like he overeats and is obese, he can eat a full dinner and the next hour eating a bucket of yoghurt, I know that him being obese or unhealthy is not MY problem, or MY issue, only that sometimes I feel that how can he let himself be so unhealthy?  

I’ve talked with him about it, the whole point of my concern is not that he is fat or obese looking, but more like his health and wellbeing, if we have a family few years later, Id be very concern about his health especially when he becomes a dad to kids. Everytime I tell him about this, he says I’ll go to the gym when “I have time”, and he spends hours on phone watching memes and he says he dont have time. He promised to go back to gym after we rebuilt our house, and become a healthier person, but now the house is almost done and he still says “I have no time”

This really hits me and it is most probably my problem, my point of view and my issue on trying to change someone, but thats not my goal, my goal is to let him understand my concern about his health in our long term relationship, we’d have a family and he might have a heart attack when the kid is 2 yo, cause based on his health performance now, its not good at all.

840,"Not sure if this is the right place to post (I'm new at this).

Back in March when COVID hit, my company was greatly affected. We are part of the travel industry and we were hit quite hard. At that time more than 60% of our workforce was placed on furlough with another 20% being let go. The furloughed employees still had benefits paid for by the company, but lost their salaries. I was kept on, but my salary was reduced by 25%. We were told that period would last for 12 weeks, after which they'd reevaluate.

After the 12 weeks, we were told salary would remain reduced at 12.5% to 25% depending on how much you make. My salary was then reduced to 12.5% instead of the previous 25%. This took effect on June 29th. 
The next end date for salary reduction would be 12 more weeks or September 21st.

Today, we had a company wide meeting where they didn't mention salary at all, just a throw away comment that once Q3 is over, they'll begin to look at salary. I reached out to HR for clarification and to let them know not informing anyone they are extending the reduction period and expecting us to still work 12+ hours a day is extremely unfair. I also made it clear that I'd be looking at my options if they couldn't provide an update.

HR instead of emailing back, called my manager who is now very unhappy with me for going to HR and not her. I'd asked her numerous times about salary and she didn't know. I figured it was more of a question for HR since they are the ones sending out the reduction letters, but company structure doesn't work like that. I guess I'm supposed to go to my manager who will then reach out if she can't answer or fix my problem. Employees are not supposed to contact HR directly. I can honestly say I've never in my career been told anything like this.

To make matters worse, after the first 12 week period, the company brought back 15% of the furloughed people, but they gave them full salary to return. Everyone else was let go. Maybe 5% are still on furlough to be brought back October 1st. So...while my colleagues and I have been working 12+ hours a day on reduced salary, anyone furloughed got to come back at full salary. Talk about a slap in the face.

I guess what I need to know is if there's anything I can do. I know legally the company can reduce salary or let me go for no reason at all. But...it's completely unfair that they aren't providing updates and are bringing some people back at full salaries while the rest of us suffer. I know the obvious thing would be to look for another job, but I like working from home and my job isn't that bad. I'm at a loss of what to do. Do I wait it out and continue to allow the company to overwork and underpay me or do I move on? And is there anything I can do in the meantime about the salary reduction?",15Sep2020,1
841,"I (17F) have been waking up with panic attacks and feeling like I am going to throw up every time I wake up from my alarm or if somebody texts/calls me.

I don’t have any past trauma or negative experiences with loud/disrupting sounds that I’m aware of, so I don’t know why I react this way.

I can’t just get rid of my alarm because I have to get up for school, work, etc. But how can I get around the panic attacks, nausea and anxiety that it gives me?

The last 6-9 months has been a lot better, rocks are no longer thrown at me and everyone at school basically got over it. 

I posted on r/niceguys a few days ago, regarding a recent encounter I had. An adult man had tried sexualising me, and come onto me- I’m 16. There was an entire debate on the post questioning if he was actually transphobic. 

1) he referred to me as ‘she’. (I’m a trans guy) and 2) I’ve gotten a lot of transphobia towards me- saying that I am not a man, and I am a freak. 

It’s made me feel icky and uncomfortable these last few days. My dysphoria hasn’t been so bad lately because I’m on a waiting list for testosterone- and it’s been keeping me in a good mood. But these comments are freaking me out and I’m breaking down.",15Sep2020,1

She said that she is off her period by 9 days, she's nauseous, and she's experiencing weight gain in her stomach.

846,"Cross posted

I've been dealing with a full plate of stress and anxiety over the last 6 months or so and I know it made me break. The intensity of the stress has made me act so out of character. I started seeing a therapist and thought I was on the right path, but still learning to handle and deal with my triggers. 

Recently, I fucked up really bad. I broke the trust of someone I care a lot about, and ultimately lost them from my life. It was something that was so unlike me to do and it's sitting so heavy. 

I've owned up to what I did, but the guilt is overwhelming. The shame I feel over what I did is making me doubt who I really am. I know I'm a good person who just made a bad decision, but this makes me feel like all of my good qualities are negated and who I truly am is no longer. I carry so much regret over what happened. I feel like a horrible person. 

I don't entirely feel worthy of healing from this. Like carrying it should be my punishment. I still hold onto hope that one day I'll be able to make things right. I don't know how to begin forgiving myself so that I can heal from this. But I know I need to figure it out so I can move forward with my life and to show I've made good on my word to do better. 

How do I learn to start forgiving myself when I don't feel like I deserve it? Any words or similar experiences are appreciated. Thanks for reading

TL;DR: high stress made me act irrationally and out of character, resulting in me hurting someone I care about and losing their trust. I don't feel like I deserve to heal from this, but know I need to figure it out to move on and hopefully have a chance to make it right.",15Sep2020,1

The first time, it took us a couple days to move past because she’s a bit insecure and thinks that my friends girlfriend may have a crush on me. Today when it happened she started crying and hung up on me. I won’t give their names but they have matching syllables and the names sound almost identical other than the first letter.

848,"Okay to begin with i don’t really know if Im posting on the right subreddit but maybe someone can give some advice on what to do. 

So Im a big Football fan or   ”Soccer” fan like you would call it in the US, and i like to express my opinions on the internet regarding Football and that often leads to arguments, one guy replied to one of my comments very angrily as he obvs didn’t agree with me and i mildly roasted him by calling him a plastic fan and moved on, the next day i got a message request from a mysterious account saying that my details has been sent to some people and that i shouldn’t call people plastics online and that i would get a visit from some guys in a couple of days. 

My first reaction was to get a little scared but eventually laughed it of and moved on, however i did look back on that comment and i checked who the guy i commented on was. He was a young guy from another country with very bad grammar on his posts desperately trying to write in English but was just so bad at it, (he supported the same team as me from England) and he followed some very strange people with creepy accounts including the account that messaged me. 

After that i really didn’t think much more of it since i just thought he was being salty for my comment and wanted to scare me a little, 10 days pass and i get a call from another country (the guy i roasted came from that country) I got a little shook and didn’t answer but somehow he had found my number since i have never got a phone call from abroad before and it was just from the country the salty guy was from. 

Anyway move forward a couple of days and i started getting weird messages, for example: ”your tires are ready for pickup” This was weird since it came from the other half of my country and i haven’t ordered any tires, this message was followed a couple of days later with something saying that my password to my house alarm has been changed, i didn’t even use this brand of alarms and didn’t think more of it but got mildy scared i was hacked but didn’t seem so. 

BUT TODAY at night when i was brushing my teeth in my kitchen a guy was literally staring right at me through the window and someone he was with instantly tried to hide behind my car, but that other guy just STARED right at me for a good 6~10 seconds before he moved on and the other guy started walking as well. It seemed like he was looking for me. So maybe that guy who sent people on me wasn’t joking? I’m very scared and i don’t really know what to do. Should i call the cops? 

Because he technically he didn’t do anything illegal he was just staring through my windows so damn cold for a few seconds before his friend who attempted to hide followed him. I took my car and attempted to ask them who they where, (maybe bot the best idea but i just couldn’t help it) so i drove around the neighbourhood but couldn’t find them. Now in sitting in my bed scared, what should i do? Maybe they are actually after me?

Her brother isn’t very social and tends to keep to himself, not necessarily rude but never really tried to engage in a conversation (at least when I’ve been at her apartment).

Anyway, in February, I was at her apartment with some of our friends and for some reason (I literally have no idea) he slapped her and split her lip.

We all confronted her brother (one of our guy friends was going to hit him) but she stood in front of us and yelled at us to leave him alone and that it’s “between family” or something along those lines.

I believe this wasn’t the only time.

My friends and myself tried talking to her but every time We’ve brought it up she’s been defensive (not aggressively) and either changed the subject or something.

We’ve given her domestic abuse numbers and everything.

We all stopped going to the apartment because of him (and obviously now because of coronavirus) but I worry about her being by herself with him.

852,"A bit of backstory to add some clarification to the title. 

Ted - moms partner 
(Obvs not real name) 

My (25f) mom had an affair about 5 years ago with Ted who was a family friend of about 2 years at the time, I was as well at the time an adult living independently (with my partner, not at home). 
My dad is great. Was brilliant husband, and the best dad you could ask for. My mom told us about the affair the morning before we buried my paternal grandfather. Obviously this caused resentment, and I have thankfully been able to rebuild the bond with my mum since this happened. I have never referred to Ted as my stepfather, and we have had the discussion that he’s not my stepfather. He’s my mums partner. 

Today Ted broke his glasses, and me working in an opticians, he rang my workplace for a callback to replace them. When my manager rang back, he introduced himself as my stepdad (I heard as at this point I’d finished work and went to visit them on my way home). I didn’t say anything as I understood it wasn’t out of malice or disrespect. It’s just easier to say “squeakygiraffes stepdad” than “squeakygiraffes moms partner”.
It still made me uncomfortable. It’s a non-issue I know. But he is well aware it makes me uncomfortable, and as I said we have had this conversation before.
I also have never referred to my dads partner as ‘stepmom’. Neither set are married I would also like to add. 

As far as our relationship goes, if my mom goes out and I’m there, we don’t talk. We don’t really get along. We are civil, and I try not to argue but he’s the type of person who will find your buttons and push them just to get a reaction. And I guess I’ll always have some level of resentment against him for being part of my parents separating which is probably the true reason why it makes me uncomfortable. Both my mom and him are very hot headed people, so the smallest thing can become a big family fallout. 
For example; we had a big family quiz night on zoom and he hung up because I told him his answer wasn’t right. He’s also told me to “shut the fuck up and get the fuck out of my house” when at another quiz he got an answer wrong and I was explaining the answer to him (it was something like how many studio albums does Metallica have). 

The friends around me with 2 sets of parents, they were always present and involved in raising the child. That’s always been the connotations I have with the term. Ted didn’t come into my life until I was an adult.

I want to approach this with him, but I also don’t want to cause an argument and a fall out after spending so much time building a relationship back up with my mother. I have never really had one with him. It’s always been strained because we just clash as people. 

Have any of you guys been in a similar situation? It would you have any advice on how I can explain to him that it makes me uncomfortable without causing a fight?",15Sep2020,1

854," I'm 19 years old and I have lived abroad for 18 years. We have invested into real estate so we visit my home country from time to time. Anyways, when we do so we meet with my mother's friends too. My mom met this woman in the hospital who was laying in the bed next to my mother, this woman was about to give birth to her son and my mom was about to give birth to me. Anyways, they are friends till today, she is one of those friends we visit when we are back in my home country. They have their own driving school and her husband is often not at home.

The last time we have seen her was maybe like 3 years ago. Anyways, we just came back from our visit to my home country and I have felt like something was off with her. The thing is, I used to be a chubby kid and that's how she remembered me. In those 3 years I have consistently visited the gym, lost a lot of fat and gained, i'd rather say some amount of muscle mass.

So, my mom decided to take her to one of our vacation homes. So, I was the one driving them/us there and back. Once we arrived my mom went in the house and I went into the garage because I was going to mow the gras with a weed cutter. As it was like 35 degrees, I took off my shirt and started putting on the belts of the weed cutter. My aunt was quite surprised because I guess she noticed how I've lost weight and gained muscle mass. So, later she touched my arm and said ""so, you've been working out now?"". Once I was halfway cutting all the weeds, I sat down on the doorsteps to take a break and she sat directly next to me and basically kept leaning on me, it felt quite weird.

Once I was done, we went for a drink in the evening to a bar next to a lake and she insisted on taking a few pictures with me. When we were posing she put her arm around my waist and pulled me towards her as close as possible. I understand that taking a picture is not weird at all, but we were never that close, so why the sudden change?

Anyways, what do you guys think what's up with her? Do you think she became sexually attracted to me? I'm not sure what to think, but I'm stuck with this in my head, so I need to hear what other people think.",15Sep2020,1
855," 

Forgive me this may be a long one but I want to provide as many details as possible. 

I (22M) joined this online friend group a few years back. Most of us didn't know each in person and we communicated entirely through the internet. When I first joined I became friends with one guy that I'll call Steve. Steve was great about welcoming me in. He had previously brought my two real life friends into this group which is how I learned about it in the first place. I even met Steve in person and we got along really well. 

That said Steve and I are pretty different people. He's an atheist left wing guy. I'm a Mormon right winger. We've butted heads more than once in the past. Despite our differences I consider Steve one of my best friends. He was pretty supportive when I got diagnosed with depression and dropped out of school and I would like to say I've been a shoulder to cry on for him too when he's dealt with his own issues.

Then COVID happened. I know being locked down hurts mental health.  Heck it hit me really hard myself. But Steve seemed to take it really hard. He got angrier, more aggressive, quicker to inject issues into ordinary conversation.Then the race riots and protests started happening. Steve is a pretty politically active guy so that stuff wasn't helping even a little. He kept spiraling. Every time he spoke it was usually about how angry he was at something. Lockdown, an opinion someone had on a movie, everything. 

I had watched lash out against things in past and normally they deserved it so I didn't think much of it. Then Steve got in an altercation with another friend I'll call Jake. Jake said the n-word once and Steve tore him a new one for racism. Only problem here is that Steve is white as the driven snow and Jake is black and definitely is socially allowed to say such things. That was the first time I realized that Steve's anger was getting out of hand. When he realized his mistake he didn't act with humility. No ""Aw dang ain't I embarrassed. Hope you can forgive me pal."". None of that. Instead Steve fled to a different group chat that Jake wasn't in. Every mention of Jake after this that Steve heard generally ended in Steve calling him an asshole. 

Steve was getting rapidly and angrily close minded. Any criticism of his conduct or behavior met with insults and attacks. I tried to remain friends. I argued that he's just having a hard go of it with everything On right now. He was still the same friend I had all those memories with. Then before I knew it I became a target.

Flash forward to  a couple weeks back. DC comics had a big event called Fandome to announce their stuff and as a die hard fan I was pumped. I was talking about it in our group chat, specifically about how excited I was for wonder woman. I have a massive celebrity crush on Gal Gadot. 

Steve, however,  took the opportunity to restate his view on the Israel-Palestine conflict by making some rather off color jokes about what the Israeli Gal must enjoy doing to Palestinian children. I thought those comments were uncalled but I didn't want to be a buzzkill so I responded with what I intended to be a good natured jab on Steve's sexual preferences. I said something to the effective of, ""you just don't like her because she's not a black girl"". A preferences he had admitted to more than once.

Steve went off. It would have been one thing if he talked to me and said ""hey that was wrong. If you could not"". No instead he attacked my religion in a blind rage insinuating that all Mormons must be racist bigots (won't pretend we don't have a checkered history in that department but find me a 200+ year old organization that doesn't). He called me all sorts of horrible things id rather not repeat. 

After he calmed down we didn't say a word to each other for about a day. Then I realized how tired walking on eggshells in a minefield named Steve is and left that group chat. I haven't talked to him since. A lot of my friends said he was in the wrong and offered advice and several brought up their own similar issues with Steve. 

Things have calmed down since then and one of my friends with the biggest gripes with Steve said he was able to patch things up and said I could probably do the same. He hardest part of this whole thing is i still consider him a good friend. I'm unsure how to proceed and was hoping outside opinions might help.",15Sep2020,1

I looked for jobs around here, but there's really nothing, and I don't particularly want to get stuck here if I'm being honest.

I’ve worked in a plethora of different industries. From technology to politics. The longest I’ve managed to keep a job is 9 maybe 10 months. I either quit when I have something lined up or I’m fired. Ultimately the reasons for being fired or quitting are always roughly the same. Which are “for not executing my job functions within guidelines or within some regulatory capacity” If I can take advantage of a situation in or outside work it’s very difficult for me to show restraint. In a professional environment if myself or the company stands to benefit I will do it. But I’m not reckless, I’m cautious, careful and try to minimize risk. Especially working in a sales environment where what goes in my pocket is on the table. To my friends, family, and co-workers I’m a very kind and loving person but in truth I have very little regard for people. I believe in doing the right thing when it suits me and helping people when it suits me. I don’t believe in hurting people unnecessarily. And ultimately I don’t need to hurt other people to get ahead. The biggest person I’m competing with is myself and I am my biggest competition. In my opinion it’s counterproductive to inflict damage when it’s not needed. I think it’s possible I might be a pathological liar, I don’t lie about things just to lie but I lie to on a daily basis in order to avoiding being questioned. Or because it’s better than the truth. If I have a goal I need to accomplish and the truth could get in the way of it I will lie, regardless of the situation. I’ve stopped and started college a few times but I can’t stay focused or motivated. And I’m not willing to put myself in that level of debt. I struggle with ADHD/ADD so I take medication for it. I workout everyday and am extremely active because I have a lot of energy. I feel extremely lost and am really not sure where I am going or where I CAN go in life. I’m not sure these are behaviors I can grow out of or that I can control. 

Additionally I do have a psychiatrist and therapist but I’ve never and am not sure I ever will be 100% honest with them. Not because I’m afraid of what they might tell me but because I don’t see the benefits in exposing myself to this degree. I’ve never exposed my true thoughts to anyone entirely and I probably won’t. Being on this site allows me to hide behind anonymity. 

Does anyone have any general advice for someone who is trapped in this cycle?",15Sep2020,1

871,"I have been sending nudes w ancouple guys and it went alright. I never shared my face.
Yesterday I was chatting w a girl and she asked for a 'verification' pic with my face on it,,, and I walked right into her trap. Afterwards I sent two more videos also w my face on it. I know it was fucking stupid and careless. 
How much should I worry about this?

Details:
1. We're both minors (based on what she told me)
2. We don't know each other personally nor have each others media. We are from different contries (don't know where she's from)
3. The only info she had on me was my snap @ and my face.
4. She threatened to leak it 'into the dark web'.
5. Her condition was to keep sending more videos, including one of my full room and excessive stuff.
6. After she threatened me, I blocked her and deleted my account immediately.

I don't think the nudes will reach here, but I'm still worried since they clearly have my face on them. 
I'm uncertain between talking about it with my parents since there's nothing we can do, since there's no proof nor nudes leaked yet.
7. I looked up in sevral nude trading/porn platforms and couldn't find anything yet. I also looked up my @. I think even if it leaks it'll be difficult for me to find out.
8. this was all trough snapchat, I thougbt you couldn't save those vids but she clearly did.

please give me advice on what i should do?

872,"In high school, I got suspended for drinking on a school trip. I ended up getting super mad about it because there were other trips where kids got caught drinking and didn’t get send home, and the teachers who suspended me talked about the topic amongst students. 

At the end of the year after I graduated, I ended up feeling the need to send them emails on how I felt about the situation. Although I still think they were in the wrong, the emails I sent were very unprofessional and unnecessary. I didn’t threaten them or anything crazy like that, but I did say they should be ashamed and a bunch of other stuff. I also prank called the school and made some dumb joke about them being mean to my “kid”. Like I said, although I still believe they were in the wrong, I feel like I should apologize for these emails and phone call. Unfortunately, they blocked my email, so I can’t. What should I do.

873,"So I need some advice for what I should do with a very strained friendship. 

For some backstory, we went to the same college a couple of years ago but never spoke until about a year ago. We have similar interests so conversations weren't too hard to have until recently. One thing that was ringing some alarm bells was that he was friends with people who treated me so poorly that it sent me into a bad depressive episode, but I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as he wasn't giving off any direct signs of treating me the same way.

A couple of my own friends noticed how much attention I was getting from this guy on different social media sites and felt it was really odd considering he never spoke to me to such a concentrated degree before. I didn't see it at the time because I was feeling good about how well we were getting on as friends, however I will admit that we were getting on a little 'too well.' 

I had broken up with my ex and was super bummed, considering it lasted a couple years and we were both super committed, but we decided to end it amicably. A couple weeks later, he decides to confess his feelings for me and I'm enraged. I told him numerous times how broken I felt over leaving my last relationship and that I had no interest in meeting anyone new and that my top priority was to heal, but apparently that must have escaped his memory. I felt so uncomfortable but decided to leave it there. 

Fast forward a couple months and he excitedly confesses to me that he had a one night stand with someone who shared the same name as me. Cue me feeling extremely uncomfortable. 

Over the next few weeks, the atmosphere between us is starting to get more and more tense as I explain to him about my boundaries. Ending up with him throwing a tantrum about how he really respects and trusts me and doesn't understand why I'm giving him grief over setting down boundaries. 

Right now, the 'friendship' is at a point where he will send me messages to get my attention, then delete them before I get to read them. It's more exhausting trying to be his friend than actually being his friend. 

Can any of you give me some advice on how to deal with this? I appreciate what ever you can give.

874,"Recently I’ve been really craving doing SOMETHING creative. I think it would help me de stress, but also give me a vice other than food. Because I tend to run to food when I’m stressed and I’m looking for something to transfer that comfort to. I’m not good at drawing or painting, so I’m having trouble finding something to start up. So if anyone has a hobby suggestion that isn’t super expensive, lmk!

Some back story if anyone is interested:
I’m in love with photography (more so photo editing) but my issue is that I don’t have much time since I work and have a 1yo. When I get the chance to do a shoot, it’s usually because I have a creative vision that I want to execute and I find my models. I unfortunately don’t have time to do it full time, and it’s not exactly something I can just do to take my mind off of things. So, as much as I love it, I’m looking for something I can do that’s easier to pick up and drop whenever. I have noticed that I have an unhealthy relationship with food, and one thing I’ve been recommended is finding something that makes me happy and free and trying to run to that when i feel the urge to eat (outside of when I’m actually hungry ofc). I also think I’d be happier if I had a medium to express myself outside of my occasional photoshoots. If anyone has suggestions pleeeease let me know! I know there are thousands of creative hobbies like what I’m talking about, but I’m having trouble thinking of them. Thank you!",15Sep2020,1

877,"Sorry for the long rant.

I’m 20F. I grew up in a loving family, until I was about 8. My father had to go work in a different country and when he came back 2 years later things were different. He turned to alcohol a lot more frequently and I just distanced myself. Until around middle school, I had excellent grades, honor student, all that but then, what I know now to be depression and severe anxiety hit hard and I went from brilliant to mediocre and my parents (mostly my father) took that hard. I went from being very precious to just being. My mom did her best to help me but my father always turned something positive to a negative thing and I would dread nights because I knew another lecture on how shitty I was would come. He said things like I was good for nothing; like he wished someone else would be his daughter instead; that when they died in many years the house would not go to me; etc etc. About 5 months ago, our house went under renovations and he’s done most of it on his own as that is his profession. Since we’re staying at my grandma’s place, I haven’t seen him as often so the lectures and etc have not been a thing until today. Me, my mom, uncles and godmother usually go on a night walk with our dog for about an hour or so but today I wasn’t feeling so good and I didn’t went, I stayed in bed. He had no clue I was home so he told my grandma how I’m ungrateful and never do anything he asks and say I’m not his servant (not true, I’ve helped as much as I can to my abilities and never complain); he says I’m 20 and have no clue what a job is (again, not true, I’ve worked multiple times at a fair in the city during my summer vacations, enough to pay for a driver’s license (i live in Europe) and to pay for a few debts my family had) and overall that I’m a fuck up and that he will not leave his house to me. I’ve went to therapy but it didn’t work out and I can’t bring myself to ask my mom to try another therapist. If not for my gf, I would have quit life a long time ago.

881,"For context, me [F15] and my friend who we’ll call N [F15] has told me she is being abused.

To run things back a little, I was first told about this last year where on her birthday I found out all she got from her mum was a card. Her family isn’t the richest but I found it weird how she got nothing, I pushed that aside until a day later N confessed to me when she went home her step-father  would hit her. She begged me to not tell anyone, so I didn’t. 

For extra context, N has told me in the past she is suicidal, well, I saw what was on her wrist and N provided context behind it. Which makes me think her self harm is because of what’s happening.

Because of Covid, I haven’t really had the chance to talk to her or see her in person and just assumed she was doing fine now her step-father was out of the picture. But, now we’re back at school N came in with a black eye and bruises all over her face. I asked her what happened and she told me her mum had beat her when she went home to grab some stuff. She had been living at one of her friends house’s for the past 3 months.

Social services have been aware of this situation for years and haven’t stepped in, N has asked me not to tell anyone or report her mum because, in her own words “it’s my mum.”. I don’t know what to do.

Should I betray my friends trust for her own good or just do what I can to support her emotionally? The last time teachers got involved, things just got worse, so I don’t know what the best option is.

884,"Some background. My boyfriend and I live in a two bedroom apartment. Almost two years ago, my boyfriend's youngest son moved into our second bedroom (16/17 at the time). He's always worked or been in school (or both) while living with us. He now works and pays rent, his own phone bill, his own credit card.

Shortly after he moved in, my mother's pre-existing back problems caused her to have to go on long term disability/leave her job at the time. She then moved in with us. We gave her our bedroom and moved our stuff into the living room. She pays her own phone bill, buys some of her groceries, pays her own credit/debts etc.

She then enrolled in an online course. She's at the end of it now, and over the past month has been under some stress.

For reference, I am in school and work. My boyfriend works a full-time job, plus does most of the cooking, and most of the bills come out of his earnings. I give him most of my paycheque to cover my part. His son and my mother both pay $300 rent. My mother took it upon herself to do all of the dishes in the house (we never asked her to - especially considering her back problems near the beginning, which have gotten better since she hasn't been standing on concrete floors 8 hours a day).

Another thing you should know is that I have generalized and social anxiety.

So, to the actual problem.

Two things my mother has said to me recently have caused me to have quite severe panic attacks, and when I am able to think clearly I do not think her attitude is fair.

The first thing she said was, ""Do you ever think, while you're sitting in there, Oh! Maybe I'll help Mom with the dishes while she's doing her schoolwork!""

Again, we never asked her to do the dishes. She's the type of person who will do them ASAP - we're the type of people who can leave it soaking for a day or two before doing them. Who do you think gets to the dishes first? Her.

The second thing, she said to me today. Often, my boyfriend and I will order dinner in for ourselves, since we both work/have school Mon-Fri. My mother said to me earlier, ""Do you ever think when you're ordering dinner for the three of you that I might be hungry too?""

I told her we don't order for the son. He generally eats on his way home from work anyway. And if my boyfriend orders himself something and doesn't finish it, he'll then give it to his son. After I told her that, I said, ""And I think we figure since we're the ones that cook and buy the bulk of the groceries, we're the only ones we order in for."" Since COVID-19 especially, ordering food has become incredibly expensive.

Both she and my boyfriend's son have made food for themselves quite a lot. But never for the household. The only ones who ever cook for all four of us are myself and my boyfriend.

What am I supposed to say? She's my mother. How am I supposed to have a conversation with her like that? We charge her the minimum rent - in reality it just pays for her storage unit - and *we gave up our bedroom and all of our privacy* so she could live with us. Our door is a makeshift piece of plywood. 

And even if I knew what to say - my anxiety would make it nearly impossible to say it. Even the thought of having such a conversation with her gives me bad anxiety, as I'm typing.

I'm in my 30's, boy it doesn't feel like it though, its like I went to sleep for a moment and woke up and it was ten years later. I've been working minimum wage jobs since I was 16. I have a useless AA in humanities, and never went to university because I was afraid of drowning in debt for a degree i would never use, like some of my family. I dont have any marketable career skills beyond soft skills. I dont have any friends, family, or connections. Im not particularly clever, or smart, or physically strong. I only have 7k in savings. I finally was able to buy a car after 4 years walking to work. I didnt want to buy one without some money in the bank in case something went wrong. It did actually, I had to spend 4k on my car after getting into a crash the month I bought it. It was my fault, I skidded on ice, now my insurance is sky high. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thats my rough situation. My problem is, I have been trying, for years, to educate myself. I have dual interests in art and programming, and I understand the fundamentals in concept. But when it comes to practicing, its like trying to draw a mural on a beach before high tide. I work all day, 9-10 hours, then I get home and I am so impossible depressed and tired that even when I force myself to study or work, I just want to break down and cry. None of it ever sticks, I cant tell you the number of times I have done the same programming and drawing courses. I just cant retain it. I have had some improvement, so i know i can do it, but the only time i have improved was when i had time off between jobs. AKA when i wasnt working myself to the bone and spending all my energy at a mundane job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know what to do. I feel very alone and unloved and worthless. My efforts mean nothing except my continued existence, and as long as i work to perpetuate my existence of mundane work, I will never have a chance to learn a better way to provide for myself. After a decade of trying the ""work and study"" approach, I have accepted that i am not one of those super humans who is able to work a grueling job while learning new intensive skills (props to you if that is you, especially if you have kids and debt on top of it). It's just not how my brain is built though. I have very little energy, and even less endurance for prolonged intensive study with no alleviation. Maybe minimum wage is all I deserve then. Im running out of time though. If I cant break into the industry soon, I will never be able to compete with the 25 year olds who have been coding on their parents laptop since they were 10. Im stuck, and I dont know how to get out. really I have tried SO SO SO hard to do it, but... it just doesnt work. All I can do after work is make some tacos and curl up in bed.

889,"so for my whole life I’ve always had trouble reading and writing. But it is starting to become more troublesome for me in university. It can take me up to 3-4 hours to read through 30 pages of a textbook and take notes. This happens because I am constantly screwing up. Sometimes I’ll be writing down a point and I end up mixing up 2 lines of text together. It’s also very hard from me to read the next line of text in my textbook, I often skip lines or spend time trying to figure out where I was. After all that hoopla I’m normally left with a headache. 

For writing it’s more noticeable when I’m doing maths. Say I have got my answer on the calculator and I’m going to write it down on my exam. I’ll end up writing the numbers in a completely different order, I don’t even notice myself doing this and when I go back to double check I don’t even notice the mistake!! Sometimes I write letters backwards, especially b and d, I get those mixed up a lot. 

On top of all this I have an ungodly bad memory. I’ll think of something I have to do and immediately forget it, cant remember directions, cant spell for the life of me, cant remember definitions for exams. I also struggle with my rights and lefts a lot.

890,"Trigger warning for depression/suicide 
I’m 17f, 18 this Friday, and I’m very suicidal. I know there’s lots to live for but at this point it’s not worth it. I have a past of being passed from family to family and now I live with a legal guardian (no blood relation) who despite her claims of love, lightly emotionally and mentally abuses me. 
My mother was my main caretaker growing up but after lots of drugs usage she abandoned me here where I’ve been for nearly 4 years now.
I have asked my legal guardian for therapy as my friends and I agree that I show major depressive signs and every time she denies me saying she can’t afford it when she herself gets therapy. 

I don’t know what to do. She won’t let me get a job and has sabotaged my attempts to do so, so I don’t have any money to get myself my own therapy. 

I have contemplated suicide in the past, but it’s more real than ever now, I’ve thought about talking to people around me about it but I don’t want to go through the trouble of “nooo you can’t do that, what about the people who care about you” when the people who care about me only cause me pain.

I only have one close friend, and I’m fading away from them so soon I’ll have no friends. No ones going to miss me except for my legal guardian whom I don’t like. I don’t know what to do. I’ve suffered bullying, sexual abuse, mental abuse, and many other traumatic experiences my entire life and I feel so alone yet don’t want to reach out.

I don’t know what to do, I don’t even know how I’d commit suicide as I’m afraid of pain. 

I can’t even move out at 18 because I don’t have anywhere to go, I don’t have any money, and my guardian will make it too hard. I’m stuck and am in pain.

The thing is though, because of the stress my mind was still stuck that it was August, even though it was September, her birthday. I had no idea which date it was, and i felt horrible when just before going to sleep she decided to bring it up and start arguing about it. We didnt talk much until later on the day yesterday (the 14th) and we were able to fix everything, and i did lots of small things to make her happy and apologized to her in a sincere matter.


Now today I’ve been around, sweet and loving, and just before her going to sleep while i was cooking dinner she asked to see my penis, and i said no, because i was starving and just wanted to eat dinner. Then she sounded grumpy as hell and when she woke up she’s somehow still argumentative about it. She blames me for how she’s acting and says “if you just showed me your penis things wouldn’t have been like this” but i just seriously dont understand. 

She’s extremely childish even though she’s 23 years of age, like whenever we argue she will remove my nickname on Facebook, or change Bitmoji on Snapchat.

893,"Hi, so my parents argued a lot when I was a kid. I hid myself away from the arguments as kids usually do, however since I was really young it always effected my mood. I remember going to school and not wanting to go home because my parents would fight, my mother got really strict and took her anger out on everyone else and my dad has anger issues and sometimes loses his temper and breaks things (does not hit anyone). But it was a scary environment. 

When my parents are not arguing, they have a very loving relationship and I am blessed to be brought up by them, but they both have some bad traits...

My mother is very ungrateful. She does not like birthdays/christmases because she never likes what she gets and usually sends stuff back. She always wants to speak to the manager (her name is not Karen) 

My Dad is very stubborn, he likes to do things his way and he doesn’t think about anyone but himself. 

Tomorrow, my parents would have been married for 25 years. I am an adult now but I see a big argument coming. My mom has bought loads of gifts for my dad. My dad took her on vacation for the weekend but she won’t have anything to open tomorrow morning as he hasn’t got her anything because he didn’t feel like he needed too. 

My mom is expecting gifts to open (even if their small) but my dad has put minimal effort in, and now he feels like shit since he knows my mom has done a lot. I’m sort of freaking out. 

I am an adult now, but I still get very anxious over my parents fighting. It will effect my mood for days and I will not have any interest in doing the things I like because I’m too worried and stressed and idk why.",15Sep2020,1
894,"I recently had someone post Libel against me on a neighborhood networking platform.

Without getting too deep into it, I posted about a stranger hanging around our neighborhood who was acting strange to see if anyone knew him and to keep everyone aware. 

Another neighbor didn't like what I posted, and in an effort to force me to remove it she posted some pretty serious Libel against me (child predator) with the caveat that she would take her post down if I took mine down first.

I contacted her employer via email, without being too specific about what happened, saying I wanted to speak with them about her actions (shes a teacher). I then messaged said individual letting her know I would take legal action against her if the post stayed up. She removed her post, but the employer emailed me today to discuss what happened. 

Moral dilema: do I just let it go, tell the employer its handled, or do I objectively give the story  (i took screen shots) and let the chips fall where they may?

 I don't want to ruin this lady the way she could have ruined me, but she needs to be accountable for her actions. Not sure what to do at this point.

895,"Me (32F) and my best friend of 7 years ""Emily"" (29F) became friends when I got pregnant. She and I quickly became best friends, and spent a lot of time together. We are both weird and creative types and enjoyed berry picking, costume making, crafting, and long talks about weird things. I trusted her completely, which is something that I have a lot of difficulty doing, and we spent a lot of time together. She was very understanding of my social anxieties and issues, and never made me feel like I was anything other than awesome. She also knew that I had issues with intimacy, and had a really hard time admitting if I was attracted to a guy. Enter guy ""Jim"". Jim was always very sweet and nice to me, and I developed a crush. Emily knew about it, and teased me, and even invited him to a party ""just so I could get to spend some time"". Her words exactly. I never made a move on Jim though, because I was and still am a wreck when it comes to men.

About a year ago, Emily and her shitty long-term boyfriend broke up. I honestly thought they should have broken up years before they did, and I was totally supportive of her. One day shortly after the breakup, as I was helping her pack up her stuff, she told me that her and Jim were dating. I...didn't react well. I managed to force my way through the rest of the visit, but had a breakdown pretty much immediately afterwards. I remember having a phone conversation with her where I told her how hurt I was, and then I continued to help her move, but once she was in her new place, I stopped reaching out. 

Since then, in the year since, Emily and Jim have broken up (after only a couple months actually), but my friendship with her feels over. She still reaches out to me, but I can't seem to want to talk to her. I just don't trust her, but I feel like I am making more out of this than it is. 

What do I do? I don't know what I should or shouldn't do, and I don't even know if I want the relationship to be over or not, but I feel crappy every time I think about her.

Basically, I’m a freshman commuter, and all of my classes are online (I did have one in person class for the first two weeks, but that got moved online too). In the beginning, college was alright because I hung out with this girl who reached out to me online and her group of friends (they’re all dorming for context). They said that we should hang out again, so I invited them to hang out about a week later. I had a lot of fun the second time we hung out, and they seemed to as well. However, none of them have asked me to hang out since then, and I don’t want to ask them again because I don’t want to seem clingy. Also, I reached out to this one guy online (who is also dorming), and we talked for a while, so I asked him to hang out. We hung out, and he seemed to have fun. However, it’s been a week, and he hasn’t texted me since. I’m apprehensive about reaching out to him again because I was to one who contacted him in the first place. 

Basically, I don’t know what to do because all of my friends from high school are at far away colleges (I miss them :((( ), save for one thankfully, and now that all of my classes are online, I don’t know how to meet new people, especially as a commuter.

916,"So I am asking you some advice about my relationship with my now ex boyfriend. 
Context: we’ve been together since December and honestly this whole relationship has been a roller coaster... let me explain. 
We first met on a dating app. We’ve been really close and deciding to meet. We spoke and everything went well. But later he told me that he was actually polyamorous. And that he was actually seeing another girl. But he told me that if I agreed to be with him and giving him a second chance he was willing to be official with me.
I pardoned him. And everything went pretty well. But the things changed. We had a hard time and broke up last week. But we spoke about it and agreed we couldn’t stop our relationship. The big issue is that he is in Germany now for 2 years and I am in Spain. He is staying for work and also for his family btw. The thing is that we agreed to stay together but he needed to be able to see other people.. so we are in an open relationship. 
The thing is I am scared that he doesn’t see us together anymore. That he will forget our memories. And that he will meet someone that will make forget everything about me... I am so scared, because you see, I can’t loose him. I truly love him. And I can’t understand that he need to see other people while being with me, because personally I just can’t imagine seeing  anyone but him... so I am doubting about his feelings toward me... I told him that, and he agreed that he didn’t know if he wanted a serious relationship. He is 22 and I am 24. But he told me that he didn’t want this to stop like that so he agreed to try 1/2 months in a serious long distance relationship. 
But then yesterday he told me he wasn’t sure about anything. That he needed a pause, and that he couldn’t continue this like that. That he needed time to understand what he wanted. And that now he wanted to stay in contact with me but as friend because he has a big complicity with me, and he didn’t want to loose that.
But you can understand that I can’t agree with how he is feeling. Now I think I won’t contact him during 1/2 months to make him realize what he has lost and maybe give him try to change his mind",15Sep2020,1

920," 

If there were something to be done about it, I would be doing it. Instead, here I am writing this useless commentary on my rather bleak current state of mind. There seems to be nothing worth looking towards. Everyone always says to live in the moment, but what if the moment sucks? What if there’s nothing you can do to pull yourself out of an endless state of meaninglessness? It’s not that I don’t see the point, it’s that I know there isn’t one. I’m just a tiny, insignificant blip to be forever lost in history. Maybe someone will think about me briefly in a couple generations, but I don’t care. I won’t be there to know that they are thinking, and they’ll know that I’m long gone anyway, not to be considered as a part of who they are.

It’s not that I don’t think I’ll ever do anything meaningful with my life. It’s that even people like Elon Musk, who is doing more for the future of humanity than anyone else right now, will be but a memory in the minds of those to come. Where’s the beauty in that? Where’s the force to keep me going?

Perhaps I am only in a depressed state of mind at the present, and tomorrow I will be just fine. Happily going about my life, not caring whether it has an ultimate meaning. But, right now, I feel miserable. Like I’ll never amount to anything, and even if I do, it won’t matter. That’s the point of living in the moment though right? Not worrying about yesterday or tomorrow, only today - now.

But, now has already passed. The moment I look for it, it has already gone, just a memory.

Memories important thought, right? They make us who we are. Or do they?

Who am I? Do I have any control over the answer?

Recently, I’ve been spending a lot of time searching for the answers to these unanswerable questions. I’ve been meditating, pondering, looking for what is. But, I never actually get to the answer.

A lot of the time I find peace and forget about the questions - they’re only thoughts after all. But, what am I if I am not my thoughts. How can I disconnect myself from what drives me forward? Do I even want to?

I am probably missing the point - in fact, I know I am. The point is not to disconnect, but to connect more deeply with experience. The sad truth is, that sometimes experience simply isn’t pleasant.

I try to remember how short life is - to give myself perspective. I need to live every moment to its fullest, because eventually there won’t be any more moments. The entire world lives in me, or, more accurately, I am space for the world. Do I really believe that though? Is that what I experience? 

When I try to look for who I am, am I just deceiving myself; creating understanding where there is nothing to be understood? If our memories are just our brains making sense of what is experienced, how am I to know that now is real? I can feel, see, hear, taste, touch, smell,  and think, but I can’t know. 

Even now I am searching for the answers. Hoping somewhere deep down that I can just let go of it all and start living. Being with what is. Flowing. Paradoxically, as soon as I begin to try, I am failing. I am pushing myself ( what I experience) to be different than what already is. But, if I give up, doesn’t that mean I have failed? There is no end, no goal, only endless existence. That is, until existence inevitably ends.

So, maybe that’s it. That’s the answer. There is no purpose, there is no right way to go about life. There is no perfect state of Zen, the mystical enlightenment sought by monks and spiritualists everywhere. There is only what is. 

Hell, maybe that’s better having an answer. I am what is, so that’s that. There’s no greater meaning, only what I experience. I can never hope to understand the happenings of consciousness, so I just need to accept each moment as it comes. Even if some moments aren’t great, because a lot of moments are. 

That brings me to my next question. Can there be happiness without suffering? Must joy be relative? The more I think about it, the greater my conviction becomes that suffering is indeed necessary. 

If I am naught but space for the world, even my thoughts must be nothing more than an appearance of the world, the manifestation of things as they are. No, that can’t be true. If it were, I would not have questions. I would simply be. But hold up - that’s what all the spiritualists are constantly telling us to do. To be. I think I accidentally just found my answer.

I don’t like it, but I don’t dislike it either. It just is. How beautiful. Wait, no, how devoid of meaning.

Welp, this is pretty much the cycle of my life: struggling to find the answer, finding it, briefly accepting it, and then doubting it again. No matter how many times I come to the truth, I always seem to lose it. 

Should I just stop looking? Can I? I just want to break free from this seemingly endless loop, to be at peace. Others claim to have done so, but can I?",15Sep2020,1

**This is my academic history, after high school, so far:**

I was a pre-med hopeful studying Biology. Freshman year (2018-2019), I was academically dismissed from a private four-year college in CA, leaving with a GPA of 0.50. I joined my local cc the summer right after my dismissal, as a prospective **Computer Engineering** major, and I'm in my second academic year there, it's fall semester, and these are my stats: GPA: 3.744, Passed/Earned Hours: 43.000, only two Withdrawals in the first two semesters. My current fall schedule is : General Chemistry I Honors, Introduction to Computing for Engineers (C++), Kinesiology (Intercollegiate Tennis), Multivariable Calculus, and Engineering Physics-Mechanics. For extracurriculars, I'm the Captain of the Men's Tennis Team, Regionally ranked debater in HS, and continued nurturing that interest as President of our Public Speaking Club, Was a Secretary of the student government for one year, not anymore, although I do have an opportunity to rejoin. I'm in the Honors Program as well. In addition, I know I can get great letters of recommendation, from the positive relationships I've created.

**Question(s):**

Given my initial academic dismissal, what's a good plan of action to get some form of academic forgiveness/academic amnesty from the university when they have no information on such processes on their website?

If I begin the transfer applications *this* fall, what are my chances of getting into SJSU, UCB, and UCLA (TAP).

If I begin the transfer applications *next* fall, what are my chances of getting into the same schools, but also the top 20's across the nation. Is it worth giving them a shot this cycle, as opposed to waiting longer to ""prove"" more. In my mind, I just think as if I don't have much to show in my one year. 

**Final Thoughts:**

I don't wish to sound stubborn, but I have drive, and I know what I want. I try to avoid the dogma surrounding the value(s) of where one goes to college, but going to great schools inspire me, and was always a personal goal of mine- to each their own.  Any and all input would greatly benefit this discussion, and anyone else who could use the information derived from this. I greatly appreciate all of you!",15Sep2020,1

I only found out because I was scrolling through my feed and saw a picture of one of my kids, that I didn't take, posted from a family/friend.

I have a huge problem with that.

For one, they are my kids, and I have told/asked people before to not do that. I have a right to ask people not to post pictures of my kids on the social media accounts, and if they do, to please crop/cover up my children's faces, so their identity is better protected.
Second, I don't know all of my family/friend's friends or followers, so how do I know that they do not have some sick pedo / murderer who can see my kids now? And could potentially track them down? 

I value my children's privacy, and other people's children's privacy. I would never post a picture of someone else's kid on any of my social media accounts without at least informing the parent, 'Hey I'm going to post this..' beforehand. That way, if they have a problem with it, they can speak up.
However, asking first, I think would be much more respectful though. 'Hey, do you mind if I post this..' is much more thoughtful and shows you care and respect said person and their child(ren) and their privacy.

She wanted a different dog (pitbull mix) about two months ago, but I told her I ultimately didn’t want to keep it because I didn’t want it to make a mess in our house, being a nuisance, etc. One of my main objections was that I didn’t want a dog of that size. I have also expressed my opposition to getting a dog numerous times in passing in the time that we’ve lived together. My other roommate is indifferent to having a dog or not and is generally irrelevant to this story. 

A few weeks ago, the titular roommate cautiously asked if I would be open to getting a smaller dog (Dachsund) because it would be less destructive. After I told her I didn’t want the pitbull, she said she’d drop the dog thing for good, but clearly she didn’t. However, it’s also 12 yrs old and small, so I figured it probably wouldn’t be able to do as much damage or require as much cleanup as a pitbull, so I said I was open to the idea. I would have also felt like a hypocrite when I said no to the first dog mainly because of size and then shut down the idea of a small dog immediately. Anyway, she showed me a few more dogs from an adoption site, and that was that for the time being.

I believe she mentioned it to me maybe once or twice more before the dog moved in, but to the best of my memory, I do not remember fully signing onto getting a dog. I remember saying I would be “OPEN” to it but was careful never to commit 100%. I have a bit of a bad memory, but I’m fairly certain I never said I was absolutely on board with the dog because I know I’m not. I think I may have given her the impression by trying to be delicate and optimistic about her getting a dog, and I take responsibility if so, but I’m almost positive I never committed to anything.

Well, one day, she texts me that she’s on the way to get the dachsund. I’m confused, thinking she’s going to play with it for the day, maybe try living with it for a few weeks, or just visit it, but no. She’s picking up the dog to adopt, to keep in our house for good. 

I decide to keep an open mind still, trying to be open to the dog, but after a few days living with it I can safely say I don’t like it. It’s always underfoot, aggressive toward men, and sneaks into my room to chew any food or trash I may have accidentally left on the floor. For example, I had a box of protein bars on the ground when I was emptying my backpack in a hurry, and she got into it and tried to eat them. I‘m worried she’ll tear up anything I leave on the ground. I can always remember to pick up my room or to close my door every day before I leave. 

I know that relocating can be very hard on a dog. However, it’s only been here for about three days, and it just left it’s owner if presumably 12 years, separating it from its sibling, because the previous owner was old and couldn’t take care of it anymore. Therefore, I think getting rid of it soon would be justified and minimize trauma to the dog because it’s already done so once in just the past week. 

My concerns are that if I tell my roommate I no longer want the dog, she’ll try to tell me I did commit to it already, that I’ll damage my friendship with her, and that she’ll be depressed if she has to get rid of it. Getting a dog has been a pretty big improvement to her mood because she’s been really sad/depressed since her break up with a longtime boyfriend a few months ago. What should I do?

Tl;dr: Roommate got a dog, I’m almost certain I never agreed to it, I want it gone but I don’t want to damage our friendship or make her sad. What now?",15Sep2020,1

931,"My (25f) younger sister (18) has been back and forth about living with me for the past two years. we grew up in a very abusive home both physically and psychologically. I took the brunt of the physical abuse for my sister and younger brother (23) at 18 I got beat one last time they loved accusing me of stealing things because I did occasionally. Long story short they had tactics of keeping me up late into the night and telling me I did whatever I was accused of for hours while beating me till I said I did it. They had both siblings watch for whatever reason. Anyways after that I left knowing I couldn’t take it anymore because I was mentally pretty fucked up. After I left they tried arresting me or ruining my life I had to go into hiding for a year. My siblings told me some things- my parents both were insanely abusive with each other and really went through a intense divorce blaming me and the kids. Suicide attempts on dads side, mom beatings and both siblings had to call the police and look after parents. Before I left I had to take care of everyone, clean, and they made it seem like I was some type of glue. I know they beat my brother a lot after I left, my mom was insane and has my brother hating women. Some of the things he says is rough. My mom sexualized us girls with lingerie at early ages, appearances, verbal abuse, and just showing us through her relationships how we must please men. I’ve since been in rough relationships with heavy sexual stuff. Now my sister has only been in 2. First were her bf would constantly push sex on her even Without consent but she wasn’t bothered. Now her current bf is abusive in so many ways- no friends, no talking to me, separating her from family, constantly checking her location, threats, etc etc. I’m scared it will turn physical. Anyways for about the last 2 years she has been back and forth on moving in with me across the states but she gets a lot of backlash from family saying bad things about me and telling her she will fail constantly till she stops thinking about it. She knows I’m successful and got away, but that isn’t enough when she is so scared. She has tried dropping out of school and asked me to take guardianship atleast 5 times, but never followed through. Consecutive days will pass we’re she is all in, and then we won’t talk for a day or two and she’s out. She uses excuses like needed to be there for everyone like they can’t live without her. This trauma my siblings faced after I left was enough to make my brother not leave either. They can’t leave my mom behind like she’s a pathetic child. Thing is she is now living with a new man and his kids. They live in a beautiful home but she stuffed her children in the garage and has been telling them to fend for themselves for the past few years. Anyways now that my sister is out of school she’s met this abusive boyfriend and once again she wants to leave. Now she wants to bring him though or keeps putting the move off for him. Then they fight and she wants to come without him. I told her she needs to live without him and he needs to visit 5 times after that then we will see what happens. Although I said a few times now maybe they can find there own place if he wants to come out. I know he is guilting her behind the scenes and honestly I’m getting annoyed about her doing this. Like I get it’s hard for her to leave everything behind and start new, but it would be so good for her. When she has those moment of being concrete and moving out o get excited and plan everything for her and then when she changes her mind she freaks out and says I’m pushy. I don’t think I even want to bring it up anymore. She is coming to visit in two weeks and we were supposed to plan the move then, but now she is uncertain again because of everyone. I told her she needs to have an answer for me then. I want what’s best for her. She’s in a bad spot. I don’t know how to proceed anymore though. I don’t want to see my sister waste away like my brother.",15Sep2020,1

934,"Some context on my situation: 

I'm currently getting my MBA in management and will be graduating by the end of this year. The job I am currently in I have felt stuck in for some time. However, my employer is helping me pay for school, and I am under contract for 2 years after graduation (i.e. I will have to pay them back whatever they paid me if I leave before 2 years). I have been at the company for 5 years and saw career growth early on, but have not really seen much in the last few years. I am specifically looking to get into management. I have had several conversations with my superior about career growth and advancement, however it doesn't look promising. I would ideally like to leave the company, and the only circumstance in which I would stay is if they advance me to a management position after graduation (which likely will not happen as there are not any openings). I have been job hunting for over a year now, but with COVID have had no luck. 

I am also dealing with a toxic family situation and have been contemplating leaving the state if it does not get better. My lease will be up by the end of the year, so by 2021 I need to decide where to move. I want to leave my current place as I live in the city, but I am not sure whether I should move closer to my current work (until I can get a better job) or if I should hold off and just move if I get an offer out of state. My boyfriend and I would also like to get married in the next year or so, and he is open to relocating if a job opportunity comes up. I would prefer to get married before leaving though as I thought that would make wedding planning easier. 

Finally, I am interested in starting my own business, but I feel I have so many ideas that I don't know where to start. I am an artist and musician so I am currently looking for ways to monetize my work, but also looking to launch an ecommerce retail business selling alternative healing and self-care supplies (i.e. crystals, oils, candles, etc.) and services (guided meditations, reiki, etc.). 

The most pressing decision I need to make at this time is where to live. I plan to finish school first but after that, I am not sure if I should just move within my state to relocate closer to my job and boyfriend, or if I should be aggressively recruiting out of state so that I can move out by the end of the year. I am afraid if I get a new place in state and get a lease for a year, I'll be stuck there if a job comes along. I am also unsure of the job market, and I basically have a guranteed job for 2 years but not guaranteed advancement.

938,"So, my mother has been a chain smoker for years, and it’s finally catching up with her. Last year she went to the hospital 3 times and now our house is full of oxygen tanks, breathing machines, and medications. Despite this, she continues her chain smoking.

Here’s my question, is my take on the situation normal or should I feel differently? My take is that she either needs to go to the hospital and stay there until she isn’t about to die, or she needs to get her shit together. If she dies from lung cancer or failure, I won’t care. If she died in a fire or car crash, yes, I’d be distraught, but cigarettes are basically suicide and she knows this. I can’t feel bad for her if she knows she’s gonna die and does it anyway. My house feels like an industrial hospital and it pisses me off and makes me really uncomfortable. Die or don’t just stop making it the whole family’s problem.

My friend has been struggling with depression quite a bit. She has for quite a while but it's become especially bad as of the past few months.

This is mostly due to quite a bad breakup and the pandemic, as well as her friends treating her really really badly and seemingly not caring about her at all.

I've been trying to get her to go see someone for a while (I realise begging them is definitely a bad idea) but it hasn't been working. She doesn't feel she needs one, and has also said her family are struggling to cope financially anyways.

She has kept on telling me she can deal with it alone and she will get better but I know for a fact she isn't and she won't be anytime soon. She's one of those ""I can do it alone"" types and it's really hurting her nowadays as she doesn't want to trust anyone after what happened.

I don't think she is in immediate danger to harm herself but she has admitted to me of having suicidal thoughts and I know the headspace she is in is horrible. She cries everyday, quite a few times, is always exhausted and has frequent panic attacks.

I genuinely hate seeing her like this, and I've tried and tried but I really cannot help her - and it doesn't look like anyone else is rushing to do so. Doesn't help that I live on a separate continent either.

He has no idea I watch him do this every single day. I have never spoken to him, he lives in a neighboring building and I don't know anything about him, but obviously he's trying to hide his alcoholism from whoever he lives with. Clearly, he has a serious alcohol problem.

I've been considering putting a note on his bottle with some kind of heartfelt message to encourage him to stop, but I also kind of want to do something more elaborate and creative...I'm just not sure exactly what that is. I want to help the guy, but I also kind of want to have fun doing it (is that wrong of me?). 

Here's some ideas I've entertained:

* Leave him clues for a scavenger hunt that leads him somewhere inspiring or help him take small steps to overcome his alcoholism?
* Include an email address so that he can write to me?
* Include a riddle or puzzle or something to solve?
* Include something humorous?
* Create some kind of game he can engage with?
* Give him a USB with a bunch of great music?

I presume I'll probably only get 1 shot at this because once he knows he's been compromised then he'll likely hide his stash somewhere different...so whats best the move here?

Both times it ended because we were both too closed off and while we liked each other we both had mental issues to take care of

But this relationship I'm in with her I love to death because we both have cracked out of our edgy teen shell and are now more open


My personality is safety first and hanging out with friends mostly means sitting around drinking idk... Coffee or something and talking about life and what we're going to do in the future and that's about it. When someone needs to get groceries we will join them and that's it really. Maybe get food together

Her personality is wayyy different while she is calmer and wanting to stay inside she constantly is around people who I would classify as VERY trashy and redneck she knows it's wrong but she hangs with them because her BFF of many years hangs with them. She's only there for her BFF

I moved to a town about an hour away for a better work opportunity and everything and we started dating again after I moved

Well.. Were dating right? And like I've said I'm loving every minute of it. But I am like... Committed to her you know, I want the best for her, I want to be her everything. Call me a simp IDC I love her

But I overthink a lot of shit. Like with her ex, she lets him get her food all the time even tho her ex was apparently a super dickhead, abusive and cheated on her and this and that and lets him give her a ride from work when she has no one else to give her a ride. 

Like I trust her to not be dumb but my previous 2 ex's I've dated for about 6-12 months I've said the same thing and they ended up realllyyyyy fucking me over

I trust her and she trusts me. We are all good but every weekend she goes to her BFF's house and that's when my head gets lonely and I start overthinking shit. 

I overthink shit cause of my past and I've opened up to her about it last night, she knows how my previous ex's been after she left me the first time.

But she never knew how much I overthink everything. But I need to stop because it's gonna start driving me crazy if I don't.

I can't stay consistent with what I want to study or the job I dream of after graduation, and I am starting to feel burnt-out from the previous 4 years of stressing about what I'm going to do. I think I'd rather dip my feet in the water in some entry-level job that doesn't require a Bachelor's. 

I've been applying to any job that only requires an AS in the hopes that someone will accept me and I can drop-out before the grade deadline in October. I've even been looking at trade schools or apprenticeships. 

I guess I'm looking for advice or reassurance that it's completely normal to feel this way and maybe I should follow my gut. 2-cents are greatly appreciated.",15Sep2020,1
958,"My pet dog named Darwin has been getting multiple seizures once every 15 to 20 days. The gap used to be a month long before but has now reduced to 20 days. This has been happening for 9 to 10 months, a few months before the Covid pandemic. 

I live in a small city in India, so just to let you know that even though there are vets in this city and we have checked him up with most of them, they may not provide or be equipped with the best skills to give a completely accurate analysis. Due to the Covid pandemic, it is very difficult and potentially dangerous for me to go outside the city to metropolitan cities for checkup since contacting the virus may put me or my family members in danger (Mom and Dad). 

I have been taking him for a checkup multiple times and the vet here has said that Darwin has Ascites, a case of liver enlargement which includes seizures as a symptom. The thing is, the liver enlargement came a bit later, while in the beginning, the seizures were the only thing happening (Darwin may not be pure breed Beagle since we adopted him and he may have genetical problem, although not sure). Now, he has both liver enlargement and seizures every 20 days or so, and the biggest concern is that after every 20 days when he does get seizures, he gets the continuously for 7-8 times in a short span of less than 2 hours, which is very concerning and heartbreaking to see. During the rest of the 20 days he seems fine, with mild disorientation sometimes but he mostly responds well. 

He has been given Gardenal medicines ever since he had been having seizures. Gardenal has liver enlargement or liver problems as a side-effect, so it makes sense that his belly has swollen up ever since. We have been taking care of him as much as possible, and sometimes he has shown improvements, but I'm scared if it might get worse later. I have even been thinking of euthanasia if it ever gets worse (I don't want him to suffer the pain of multiple seizures with no change for the better), but my sister is determined in finding out the cure and treatment, and I'm afraid if in the process, Darwin might go through the worst. 

What do I do in this situation? Do I continue the medicines (he is been given Gardenal as well as some liver medicines. If you want more details I can reply to you if you ask) or do I take him somewhere (it is very dangerous at this point)? Euthanasia is the last thing I wanna do, but I don't want my best friend to suffer more and more everyday with no improvements. So if you have any advice related to treatment, any procedures, tips, medicines etc, please let me know in the comments. I am grateful for any help given. Thank you, and don't forget to hug your dog before you go to sleep tonight!",15Sep2020,1

961,"Hello everyone, 

I’m 22 years old, male, live in the United States. I just finished my undergraduate degree in Public Relations. While in undergrad, I also did a music performance degree in jazz studies, as I’m a professional musician and have been playing music all my life.

I’ve traveled all over the world performing with jazz bands. My ability to play the bass and saxophone rivals that of college professors. I was born with perfect pitch, and have always found music to be my most beloved gift, talent, and strength.

In January, I was offered a contract to be a cocktail-hour jazz musician aboard the Celebrity Reflection, the largest ship in the Celebrity cruise lines Solstice Class. It paid $2,500 a month, and I would have had zero expenses. I was supposed to set sail on July 17th. This was going to be my most lucrative job, and I would’ve had the opportunity of a lifetime traveling the world doing what I love. 

In early June, I was informed that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my assignment was cancelled, and I would no longer be working for Celebrity. I cried for days. I was so lost, hopeless, and couldn’t believe my reality. 

Out of college, I moved back home to wait for my assignment to start, but once that was cancelled, I realized I was stuck at home. I applied for 122 public relations jobs. No luck. No one is hiring. Period.

My family was exceedingly helpful in keeping me sane, comfortable, and helped me stay positive. Come August, however, my parents insisted I find a job and move out, or continue my education at the university in the town that I live in. 

They explained that while no one is hiring, I should go back to school and get my Master’s degree. They said I could live at home, which is incredibly generous and I can’t thank them enough for the support. 

A month into school, I realize that I absolutely cannot focus on the material, am not passionate about it, and struggle to find enjoyment in the curriculum. My family is incredibly excited for me, but I’m not living my best life and can feel the life being sucked out of me.

My job right now is I am part of a performing group that plays twice a week. This job is enough to help me pay for school, gas, food, and other things a 22-year-old needs. However, I can’t bring myself to explain to my parents that I don’t want to follow a career in public relations and would rather be a professional musician. If I quit school and performed full time, I would have enough money for a new car, apartment, and a wedding ring for my soon-to-be fiancé. 

I value my parents’ opinion of me more than anything else, but I’m just not happy in my current situation. I feel trapped. I don’t know what to do.",15Sep2020,1

964,"Back when I was still underage I was groomed a lot by older men and I unfortunately ended up hooking up with them and sending them pics when they asked. When I was 17 I was being groomed by this 28y/o man and we went through the whole thing with pics and it escalated to the point where he’d pic me up from school to take me back to his place to have sex with me. He made it where I had to follow certain rules for him. I couldn’t walk I had to crawl everywhere I couldn’t be on furniture unless it was the bed and he said it was ok and I couldn’t feed myself when I was with him. The grooming and hooking up with him went on only for a couple months and somewhere in between those months he added me on fb and told me how he hooked up with another 17y/o (he did know our ages) and started talking to another 17y/o girl who I also had known. 
I’m conflicted on if I should report it or just let it go. I still have his fb and I think I still have the google hangout messages between us. I’m not sure if he’s still grooming minors or not, but I still can’t stop thinking about it. What should I do?",15Sep2020,1

969,"So me, my dad, and my brothers are supposed to be PCSing to another state in 2 weeks. There isn’t a house available for us and there won’t be anytime soon. 3 options my dad has and he wants me and my brother to pick. 

1. Stay where we are for a few more months 
I hate it here. I’ve been wanting to leave where I’m at for so long. Now my dad divorced my mom and we live with his gf and her FOUR kids. There are a total of 9 people in the family now, opposed to the 5 of us when my dad was married to my mom. Living with them makes me feel worse the family is much bigger now. Every morning, I have to wake up to the sound of screaming and giggling children under 6. Besides that, memories from when my dad used to scream at me as a child are being brought back because he does that to them now. Chores are more difficult now since kids are messy and dad’s gf doesn’t do shit. I even have to share a room with my 14 year old brother now because we’re living in her house. Also my dad fucks her every morning and night and it kinda bothers me, since I know my dad did that behind our backs when he was still married to my mom

2. Move to the new state but live in a small apartment (total of 4 people) We’ll have to live there for 6+ months until we get a house house but we’ll get the house quicker if we stay where we are

3. Me and/or my 14 year old brother live with my grandpa or uncle for a little while until we finally get a house. I’ll be a lot closer to family since both from my mom’s side and dad’s side live in the same city. I’ll be able to focus more on school since it’s only my grandparents living in the house so it’ll be nice and quiet.",15Sep2020,1

I’m a freshman and my classes were moved online 2 weeks ago. I’ve been staying home since then, and the university is deciding in two weeks whether to send everyone home or stay online. I’m behind in all my classes and haven’t done any work since I got home. 

I picked electrical engineering because I am interested in audio / sound design, and I’d like to work in places such as a recording studio, movie set, or do fx for video games, movies, tv shows, or composition scoring for anything. I read online EE is the best degree to choose for this as it will give you a solid understanding of audio and how it moves, but really I’m not sure what to do. 

I’m a first gen college student, and my dad owns a trucking company. He did horrible in school and he really wants me to get a degree so I will have a better chance of getting a job. The thing is, I’m tired of the education system. I was always in all the AP classes in high school, I ranked 3rd in the class, I scored a 31 on my ACT, and I never really cared about it. So many people praised me for intelligence and still do, but I don’t care about it that way. I’ve never been as interested in academics and stuff as much as my peers, who are going in for biomedical engineering, and civil engineering, and they are the type of people who want to work in those industries. I don’t want to work on a community power grid, I would rather design software/hardware instruments and obsess over what happens to an audio signal when you do x,y, or z. 

I’m a very musical person, and I write songs and mix them all myself. I know I’m really talented, but I haven’t put as much effort into it as I should have. I kind of wish I took a gap year and got a job, and focused on my music full time for a year just to see what happens. Since quarantine started I did it more and more, but always viewed it as a hobby and not as a full time thing.

I know there is a niche for what I want to do somewhere, but I’m not sure where. I was thinking of minoring in music tech, or getting a dual degree in EE and music industry. 

I just don’t know if EE is right for me, and I’ve basically stopped with school because I have completely lost my focus right now. I’d appreciate any help.",15Sep2020,1

975,"Hi, not really sure where I can post this so I’ll post this on here. So I just got bad news today. I’m currently (19M) and I had a ATV accident 5 months ago that caused a “sprained wrist” after 5 months going back and forth to the hospital asking what’s going on with my wrist that’s not healing I finally got a MRI scan. It revealed I have a broken [scaphoid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphoid_bone#/media/File%3AScaphoid_bone_(left_hand)_01_palmar_view.png). 

I will need surgery (surgery in 3 weeks) for it to recover it’s the only way it could be healed. The doctor is going to cut a small piece of my bone from my elbow and put it on my scaphoid and put a screw. Theirs a possibility that it won’t heal after the surgery. I’m not going to lie I’m scared, I’m sad, and it’s causing me to have really bad anxiety. 

I enlisted in the Army National Guard before the accident and I was supposed to leave back in early August for Basic Training. Due to my injury and not knowing at the time why it hasn’t healed it was cancelled until I got more information. I informed my recruiter about it and he didn’t worry about it a lot he said “shit happens but make sure it doesn’t happen again you can still leave but it will take longer”. 

Now I’m scared that it won’t heal and I would have to be discharged out of the military. It has always been my life long dream to join as a kid. Also, it ruins all the other dreams I’ve ever had in life I wanted to be a sheriff when I came back from my training. Another reason I enlisted was because I wanted to go back to school as well because I cant afford college I don’t get FAFSA. My parents make too much money and they don’t wanna help me pay for a single dime. I’ve tried applying for scholarships but I only got the shitty ones that were only $100-$300. “Why are you complaining that’s something at least” well that pays literally for nothing college in my state is 5-7k a semester... I really can’t work 2 full time jobs and go to school I’ll be a mess. No I’m not pulling out a loan I’m not getting into debt if I end getting a job that will take me 10-20 years to pay off.

All the things I dreamed about doing looks like its starting to fade away. I wanted to do something in law enforcement doing things like SWAT, UC and more.
I can’t do any of those things with a broken wrist that has a possibility of never being healed. I won’t be able to do everyday activities will I even qualify for disability? 

I’m just worried because if it doesn’t heal I’m not really sure what I can do with my life anymore. That’s the only thing that interested me in life and now maybe it can be gone.",15Sep2020,1

I wasn't enjoying studying accounting at all, so I decided to switch just before this semester started.

I said straight up ""why did u call her then, why would say that?"" and Katy said ""I'm a bitch, I know, I know"" which was a huge red flag for me.

Now, Katy wants me to meet her at a train station when she comes back from a trip and go get a beer. I refused, but she told me she actually needed me there and that she was going with 2 guys and I agreed cause idk maybe she doesn't feel safe or smth. And later that day Sally was like ""Hi do u maybe want to go to a hookah place tomorrow with me?""
And now it's weird cause I already have plans with Katy but knowing Katy's relationship with Sally I don't wanna tell her that Katy didn't invite her, nor tell Katy to invite her, nor do I wanna go with either of them tbh.

With one it's a bit of a draining friendship because  I feel the age gap, the other one turns out to be a bitch, sooner or later I'll have to ""pick a side"" and no matter how hard I try I'm in the middle of it
I can't tell Sally it's okay and Katy doesn't dislike her when she complains about it to me since I KNOW she DOES dislike her

I just wanna distance myself from both of them, is that a right decision? 
Especially after tomorrow night  when I'm done with Katy's bs
If she lied to lore me into hanging with her I'd be mad 

Sorry for the long read and drama, thank u!",15Sep2020,1
993,"This may be a bit long, sorry. If you have any questions Im happy to clarify things. 

I am a woman in a same-sex relationship. We have been dating for over 4 years and were thinking about getting married in June 2021 but Covid has pushed our timeline to at least 2022 so I have some time to figure things out, however recently I have had a lot of anxiety when thinking about potentially one of the happiest days of my life because of the complex relationship I have with my dad. 

Some backstory/context of my relationship with my dad:  
When I was very young he had an alcohol problem, he got help and was sober for many years. Then his parents both died less than a year apart when I was about 11 and he could not cope and fell back into alcoholism. Since my mom very clearly did not like this, he only drank when she was not around. (Mainly during the summers which we spent in our home country with our dad while our mom usually stayed working in our residence country.)   
While I did not enjoy it when he drank (which was very often), I put up with it because I was just a kid who didn't really know any better. At the time I did not realize how much he was emotionally manipulating me.   
He would be all happy drunk during the day but by evening he was crying and pushing all his emotional burdens on to my 11 yo self. He would say repeatedly how he didn't know what he would do if my mom left him, that he could not live without his children, subtly and non subtly implying suicidal thoughts. He would beg me to not tell my mom that he was drinking which I did not do because I was scared he would do something, he was my dad afterall, and I felt like it was my duty to sort of keep our family together and especially shield my younger brother from this (I'm the eldest of 4).  
His relationship with my mom was rocky so he spent a lot of time in our home country and not with us in our Residence country. He called me drunk all the time talking about all kinds of things that I just did not have the emotional capacity to deal with.  
When I was 17 I had been dating my GF for a year (kind of in secret because I was not yet out to my parents). One day my dad called me up and straight-up asked me if I was dating this girl and if I was a lesbian. I admitted to it because I was sick of hiding it and explained I'm bi and what that means. I knew he would not fully support me and because I said I'm still technically attracted to men he has hopes I will ""grow out of my phase and find a boy"" etc. etc. (Not to mention the countless times he has said he is expecting grandchildren from me ). He always manages to absolutly contradict himself by saying things like ""Even though this is super unnatural and bad and disgusting I still support you 100%"". I kind of brushed over statements like that because I knew I was in no danger and he could hold nothing against me as our mom is basically the sole provider in our family so she can call all the shots.  
 As I grew up a bit more I began to see more through the bullshit and slowly distanced myself from him as my brother had done way before me. I talked to him way less and he would hold it against me of course, turning every one of our conversations into guilt trips, lectures, sobstories about my mom not returning his dunk calls ect. which made me want to answer his calls even less. But he is still my dad and not all of my memories are bad, so even if our relationship was not good, I did not want to cut him out completely.   
Last summer was one of the first times I really talked back to his crap (which obviously did not go over well with him) and this was the start of us losing touch even more. Around this time my dad was basically permanently living in our home country and my parents were unofficially separated.   
My mom divorced him at the end of 2019 and at this point I was talking to him maybe once a month because I would not pick up alot of his calls because I definitly did not want to get in the middle of all that drama. 

The catalist that made me cut basically all contact was an awful situation at the end of last year.   
My dad would still talk on the phone to my youngest siblings every once in a while. He was talking to my sister (12yo) while he was drunk. I wasnt aware that they were talking and my mom was not home then. She comes downstairs to my room clearly in distress while still on the phone to my dad and I hear her **Begging him to not do anything**.   
He said he would call back because he was receiving another call and hung up.   
My sister breaks down crying. I understand what the situation is because Ive been in a similar one with him before. My brother and I got her to give us her phone (so she would not see him call back) and took her to her room to calm her down. After she confirmed the awful things he had been saying to her about taking his own life, I gently explained to her that everything will be fine, he is not gonna do anything, Ive been there before and just in case we will also contact our grandparents (on my mother's side who also live in home country) to make sure that everything is ok. She calmed down and we watched cartoons after, but I know this was an absolutly traumatic thing for a 12 year old to go through and hear from her father.   
My dad tried to call her back several times and then me which all incoming calls were ignored. He even had the audacity to text ""What happended?"" as if he was completly oblivious to what he was doing to my younger sister. I texted him that I am busy calming my sobbing sister.

I have not really talked to him since then. We exchanged a couple words when my siblings went to home country to visit him and they skyped my mom but other than that we have not talked about what happened or at all really. 

I am at a complete loss as to what to do regarding my wedding. There are several aspects I have to consider.  
The most obvious answer would be to just not invite him- he is a toxic person and I should not have to deal with that. The thing is even though I do feel resentment for some of the things he has done to me and my siblings, I feel like not inviting him to my wedding would be a point of no return in regards to possibly salvaging the absolute shipwreck that is our relationship.  
 Another thing is that I dont know if he will even want to come to the wedding since he is not exactly happy about my relationship. If he did not want to come I think I would even be relieved.  
 Also If he came to my wedding I would not want him to walk me down the isle, which would probably be a sort of slap in the face for him and I absolutly want to avoid as much awkwardness as possible. In the ideal scenario neither me or my gf would be walked down the isle and we just go together/ by ourselves but I know this is not an option as gf's dad is great and I know she would love that and I could never ask her to not have that moment with her own dad.   
I know that I would have to talk out all our issues with my dad before I can invite him to our wedding, but honestly it truly gives me so much anxiety even thinking about having a conversation with him. 

Any and all advice is welcome, Im really struggling to wrap my head around it all and my anxiety is getting worse :(",15Sep2020,1
994,"Workplace Accident

Today, my sister in law had bit of an accident at work. Just a little background, she is a dental assistant and she often works in the back to clean tools as well. She was draining some hydrofluoric acid in the sink, when some splashed, at the exact time her boss and main/primary dentist came in the cleaning room. It splashed and some landed in his eye. He screamed in pain and had to be transported to the ER via ambulance. The dentist accepted that it was an accident and said that work place accidents occur. The doctors at the hospital said that they didn’t see an eye damage at the time. Can he legally fire her and get in trouble? How should she proceed?",15Sep2020,1

I've always had my sights set on being a vet, but I haven't been getting the extremely intelligent scores on highschool tests this entire year. 

I'd also love to be a mechanic, as one of our family friends is one and I love being in his workshop, with him teaching me stuff about motorcycles and cars. The tiny details and use of fuel and air really interests me as well. 

Open to any opinion/advice, thanks in advance!",15Sep2020,1
997,"This is my first post, so bear with me. I(F18) live with two other girls(Nicki and Jordan) who are also 18. Nicki is my childhood best friend and Jordan is one of our other close friends from high school. Anyway, when we moved in together in June of this year, Nicki and I both decided to get kittens. She was less attentive to them than I was so her kitten ended up bonding with me more than her. This made her decide to get another one. I advised against it but I couldn’t force her not to. 

This week, we realized that all three cats have fleas. The vet bill for each cat will be $80 because they need to get the rabies shot, the flea meds, and a wellness check. Nicki wants me to only take my cat in and then get three months supply of the meds and she would buy the other two pills from me. If I did this however, I would not be able to continue my cat on the pill because i would have already used the next two doses and the vet wouldn’t give me more until three months had passed. She then said she was just gonna get rid of her two cats because she didn’t want to pay for their treatments. 

I am not happy about her getting rid of her cats because we got the first two together while I was under the impression my cat would always have a friend to play with. All three kittens are best friends and it makes me so sad to think of my cat all alone. I know that it’s her decision and I am trying my best to not say anything about it but it seems so immature and irresponsible to get two kittens and then give them away because they have fleas, which are not uncommon at all. 

Now today, our landlord asked us if we would be willing to take in a Rottweiler that had been with one of his other tenants who got arrested. Our third roommate Jordan jumped at this opportunity because she wants her own pet and she volunteered to care for it. I would have absolutely no problem with this, but he specifically told us that the dog does not get along with cats. When he said that, Nicki chimes in, “Oh it’s okay! We were about to get rid of our cats anyway.” Now, I have no intention of getting rid of my cat. He’s my first pet and I have bonded with him so much in the few months I’ve had him and I would just be so sad if I had to give him up. 

So my dilemma is, should I get rid of my cat? I don’t want him to live in a home with a big dog who is aggressive towards him. Should I ask my roommates not to take the dog? I feel like I’m the only person in the house who likes the cats anymore but originally everyone was in and we all wanted cats. I know we all share the house and it’s not fair of me to ask them not to do these things, but I hate to think of my cat bored at home without any other cats while i’m at work, or him having to live in fear of the dog.",15Sep2020,1
998,"Last week was my friend’s Bachelorette trip and we did all of the regular stuff people do on bachelorette trips, like staying out all night and hitting bars and clubs. We ended up walking through a bad part wolf town at one point in the night and we ran into a girl who was crying and alone, waiting for her friends to come pick her up so we decided to wait with her so that she would be safe. As we all walked up to the outside of this convenience store where it was better lit, my friend pulled out her self-defense pocket knife which I told her to put away but she insisted on having it out because of where we were. After we sit there for a minute or two talking to this girl we met, this man walked up behind me and slapped my butt on the way into the convenience store, and with her knife still out my friend went after him, and ended up stabbing him and cutting herself and one of my other friends in the process. The cops were called on us, we were all questioned, and now that I’m already looking at going to court as a witness for her, her family is mad that I don’t want to file a report of sexual assault against the man because they believe it would help my friend’s case. However, my statement and the surveillance footage from outside of the store should already establish that the guy groped and that’s what set off my friend. I’ve also received conflicting legal advice, some people think that me filing a report wouldn’t help her case at all and some people say that it might help her look better in court. Am I a bad friend for not wanting to get wrapped up in a whole different trial?? I’m a busy college student that lives in a different town and I’ve been assaulted in that same way or worse many times at bars around my home, thus I don’t want to worry about not one but being involved in TWO trials on top of everything on my plate. I wish she would’ve just yelled curse words at the guy and not gotten herself into all of this. Any advice???",15Sep2020,1

1000,"My brother (M2) grew out of baby clothes ranging from six months to 12 months. We also had toys and other items that my brother wasn’t going to use. 

My mom originally was going to throw them out until I found out a friend (F17) of mine from middle school had a baby. We still talk, but we’re more like acquaintances now. Her baby is currently three months old and is a boy. I mentioned to my mom that we could give her the stuff instead of throwing it away and she said it sounded like a good idea, but my old friend needed to pick up the items as soon as possible if she agreed in wanting it. 

I contacted my old friend and she agreed in wanting the clothes. I originally offered to drive to her place, but she moved and didn’t want to tell me her new address, so she said that she’ll drive to my place and pick up the items. I told her that I’ll have the baby clothes/items ready on Saturday and asked if she could pick them up the following week. She agreed, but didn’t give me a specific day. I told her when she was ready that week, tell me what day and time she’ll pick the items up, so I can leave them on the front porch for her to pick up. 

A week passed and she never messaged me or came to pick up the stuff. I contacted her again after a week went by, reminding her about the stuff. A day after I sent the message, she tells me that her mom was in the hospital and the details about it. I apologized and told her not to worry about the stuff, just focus on her mom for now. I also told her that my family will pray for her (we’re both religious) and that I wish her and her family the best of luck. 

It’s been about a month and a half now. I messaged her asking how her mom is doing, but she hasn’t responded. I told my mom this and she was furious. My mom told me that my old friend took advantage of my kindness, but to not worry about it because she’ll give the stuff to a family member instead. We’re both extremely close to this family member and she’s a little over two months pregnant now. 

My mom will most likely give the baby clothes to the family relative now, but I don’t know how to break the news to a pregnant teen mom, who’s mother is in the hospital, that she isn’t getting the baby clothes/items anymore. 

My mom tells me to just ghost her because my old friend didn’t appreciate my efforts and that she’s probably lying about her mom, but I don’t want to take any chances and lead her on if she’s still expecting the stuff. 

Any advice on how to handle this situation? How do I break the news to a teen mother that she’s most likely not getting the baby items anymore?",15Sep2020,1

hello s-so can someone please give me counsel.

i have an ex girlfriend. we broke up almost 3 years ago. we broke up because i cheated on her. she found someone new a few months later, and i found mine a couple months longer. we're both in a relationship (i guess?) but lately i've been thinking about my ex. my current girlfriend is a jealous type one, but she taught me to be a better person, even though we fight a lot, she made me realize that i can be a better person. however, with that being said, i feel like i owe my ex girlfriend (and other ghosted flings) an apology for what i've done in the past. is that an ""okay"" move?

1. am i cheating on my current girlfriend because i'm thinking about saying sorry to my ex and other flings?
2. am i cheating on my current girlfriend because i'm stalking my ex?
3. is it a reasonable move to chat my ex, even though we have not spoken in years, just to say sorry out of nowhere?
4. will i be able to ""breathe"" knowing that i've amended with the people i've hurt in the past?
5. i think and i know that my current girlfriend will be 100% against and mad at this, but shall i go on?

1010," 

Hello,

First of all I want to thank anyone taking the time out of their day to have a look at my situation. The complexity of it is going to make a short post difficult, but I will do my best.

Born in the US, I went mostly to drama schools and ultimately got a GED in an effort to go to college early. I attended classes and got to about 56 credits until I underwent a dramatic change, overwhelming anxiety that kept me totally unproductive until 25.

At that point I started taking some heavy medication, but it actually allowed me to live a normal life. I developed an interest in a niche historical topic on Youtube (Trying to really reduce details here, so going to be very vague on this). I began doing Voice Over work for people in that niche, and even got a job which got me to go all the way to Southern Europe to do Public Relations work for the company. The corporate lifestyle drained me, after 2 years I left and moved to Portugal where my family owns a few homes. I have been living here since from 29-32 essentially making very pitiful money here and there doing Independent PR jobs and occasionally tutor work. But I am getting nowhere, and most of my time is spent at home, on reddit, or YT just wasting away.

I simply don't make even close to enough to be happy, and I have been considering going back to the US to finish school. But I have quite a few concerns, specifically, is that even a good choice? I did a number of personality and job aptitude tests that said I would make a good Psychologist, and I feel I am mature enough to buckle down and take school seriously.

Should I go back to America? Should I stay in Portugal? I do speak Portuguese, but I fear that trying to attain my education here would have the added difficulty of it not being a first language. I have enough trouble making any friends at all. And I worry that many of my existing skills aren't marketable outside a niche.

This is just a tiny part of what I consider a pretty awful life to this point. There were moments of happiness in the past, but now I am filled with uncertainty and anxiety on a daily basis. I just want to do something I can be proud of, but I am unsure and afraid to take any steps.",15Sep2020,1
1011,"This is a long one. Before I get started, I ask that you don’t make fun of me for being afraid of being honest with my parents. They’re extremely conservative and are afraid of life itself. I live with anxiety and have come a long way (for example, I got my driver’s license at 22 after overcoming a fear of driving). My parents have all sorts of phobias and poor mood regulation, so I tend not to tell them anything if I don’t absolutely need to.  I (25/f) started dating someone (24/m) I met through tinder last year. I want to introduce him to my parents but I know they will freak out if I tell them how we really met. He lives in the NYC and I drive from New Jersey to see him, which my parents find reckless; my parents get nervous if I tell them I’m driving on the highway somewhere. I am financially unable to leave their house because almost all my money goes toward paying grad school, loan debt, and living expenses. The car I drive is still under my mom’s name and she holds that over my head whenever she gets upset with me.

So what I need advice on is: is there anything I could do to help her better understand ? Should I continue being the boyfriend she admires or should I do more ? What do you think of the situation ? Thank you for any help.",15Sep2020,1
1016,"Obvious throwaway... my daughter is 29 and was married from 22 to 27 to her boyfriend who I wasn’t fond of. She was the breadwinner while he stayed home blaming his depression for why he couldn’t work. My daughter was frustrated because during the marriage she was in medical school and running the household. She had enough of him, his physical abuse, cheating, financial abuse and lying and filed for divorce in 2017.   

Very recently, I found out she vented on Twitter about being raped by her ex-husband. An anon phone number claiming to be her ex husband sent the screenshots to me - who turned out to be my daughter’s ex sister in law. 


I am so sad my daughter held this from me and she was hurting by herself about it. How do I help her? How can I help her?",15Sep2020,1
1017,"My [30F] boyfriend [32M] has made plans on Tinder to meet other women on the work trip he leaves for tomorrow.

The title pretty much covers it. I found out about an hour ago, after he fell asleep. We had been to dinner earlier and he had been acting shady and shifty all night. He’s been recently having issues at work and with his family, and I wanted to take him out to cheer him up. Everything _seemed_ normal but I had a feeling he was being weird. And I was right. 

I’ve been emotionally supporting him for months now. It’s been hell for me. Just hell. I’ve had nobody to speak to and all my time money and attention has been on him. Because he was _breaking the fuck down_ in front of me and I thought I loved him. And that’s what you do for the ones you love. You hold them when they need you. I held him after he threw a chair over my head, because he broke down crying. He’s been a wreck and it’s been so emotionally draining. And we’ve talked! He said it was all because of the stress and pressure of working with his family (it’s a family business). He got mad about something at work, got drunk and smashed up the holiday house we were staying in for the weekend. This was the first night. I spent the rest of the weekend helping him clean up the wreckage of broken chairs and doors. Smashed cups (from his family heirloom sets that aren’t even manufactured anymore). He would just cry and cry and I had to clean it all up. I’ve been so patient and things were getting better. And now this. I can’t get past it. The messages are so lewd and disgusting. I feel humiliated. I’m shaking so I cant really think straight. This is just the lowest point of my life. I’m absolutely done. I’m ready to leave now. I’ve given him chance after chance. I need out. 

He leaves in 5 hours. He’s asleep now. How do I handle this? My first instinct is to pack my things after he leaves and ghost him. But I don’t have anywhere to go. I lost my job a few months back and used my savings in helping us out. We live together in his house (his parents have purchased it for him so no rent). I can try and contact an acquaintance 3-4 hours away, but that area is in off-season and there aren’t no jobs as such. I live in Italy but I’m not Italian. I hope that’s enough information. Any suggestions are appreciated.",15Sep2020,1
1018,"I met his man. A man I click with so well. A married man. His wife hasn't been intimate with him in 3 years. Since she got diagnosed with MS. She says it hurts to have sex. I'm thinking, so use your hand, your mouth... something. I get it that it hurts. I'm not denying that. But there is other ways to take care of him. There's a difference between cant and wont. There is also no hugging kissing. Nothing like that. They sleep in different rooms bc she has a cpap. They dont really talk. So he has a roommate. A platonic relationship. Is it even that? 
It gets better
She gives him permission to see me. To fuck me. To get off. What the fuck....... I'm astonished at this point. So he came over, we didnt fuck. I loved being with him. Every second of it. And when he left he called and said she called him and text him 3 times. She wants to try.... so she talks to the doc about a cream for her dryness from the MS. Okay.... so... for the past 3 years she didnt want to touch her husband, and now that I wanna touch him, SHE WANTS TO TRY?????????? THIS BITCH.

1021,"
I feel like I have no reason to live. I have failed at every meaningful goal I have ever set for myself and i have nothing to look forward to. To top it all off I’m fucking disgustingly ugly so no girl is ever going to settle for me.

I don’t have any goals or aspirations anymore, I don’t have anything I want to work towards. I’m in debt for a fucking history degree that I may not even get because my financial aid was lowered this year so I may not even be able to pay for this semester. I told myself I was going to lose weight and I lost 80 pounds. I’m still 230 but there’s no point in losing anymore, I’m still embarrassingly ugly. My goal was to get to 200 but I’m stuck and can’t lose anymore, and I don’t have the motivation to keep trying.

There’s no reason for anyone to get involved with me. Nobody has ever really loved me and I’m never going to get to have that experience. The only things I ever wanted out of my life was to not be in poverty, and to have a girlfriend. That’s it. But I can’t even accomplish that.

I don’t have anyone to talk to about these things so I’m just posting it here. I give up. Theres nothing that inspires me and any light from my life is gone. The only thing I can do is just smoke pot and go to therapy until I die. I don’t know what kind of advice I’m looking for, but I appreciate you reading it.",15Sep2020,1

1027," Hello.

I'm  not a redditor, so I hope I'm posting in the right subreddit and I hope  I don't trigger/upset anyone, it is not my intention to do so.

My  situation is such: I have a younger sister who has severe OCD. Since  the start of Covid-related lockdown in our country, she's been living  with me. Or more accurately I'm now living with her. Our mom has bipolar  disorder, my sister and her were triggering each other, so my brother  and I decided to split them apart for now. I'm staying with our sister  and our mom temporarily moved in with my brother. I knew about my  sister's OCD prior to us living together again (I'm currently 25 and I  moved out from my birth home after graduating high school), but I had no  idea how intrusive with her life it has become. She's a high school  senior and I can tell that the stress of graduating, COVID and  everything else is taking a major toll on her. She barely sleeps at  night and I don't know how to help her. I tried speaking to her about  this, but she refused me. I didn't pressure her, because I didn't want  to cause her further anxiety, but I don't know how to strike a balance  between giving her the space she needs and making sure I don't  accomodote the creation of new rituals.

We  live in a very conservative country with deep mental health stigma. The  last psychiatrist she went to told her to ""just stop thinking about  it"". Compulsive is literally in the name, how can she just stop thinking  about it?? I'm sorry, this makes me very angry.

I'm  looking for advice on how to speak to her about this. Her OCD is  related to orderliness and our apartment is starting to become very  messy. Should I move the things back to their actual place while she's  at school? I'm home alone the first half of the day, but I'm worried  that this would make her feel anxious and embarrassed. So far I've let  her do as she pleased, but now she started moving my stuff as well and  it's starting to interfere with my work. I'm an artist and as of late  she's been rearranging my workspace, hiding materials etc. I'm trying my  best to hold it in and not snap at her, but it's starting to take a  toll on me.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",15Sep2020,1
1028,"I have not seen what it is, or why it wants to. But i feel it constantly. Sometimes it’s just there on the edge of my perception, but there’s days when it will really try to get in.

I know it is there to do me harm. Sometimes it tries to distract me from focusing on keeping my mind safe, sometimes i hear what sounds like a room full of people screaming, sometimes i hear static. 

The only thing that will make it go away for a while is when i do some type of harm to myself. I have no idea why this is, but it has been the only thing i have tried that has any affect on it at all, and i’ve tried everything.

There was one day it almost took over. I could feel it trying to push its way in, for the longest time i couldn’t move my arms or legs, my whole body had gone numb. Sometimes i can see things out of the corner of my eye, but i never have enough time to get a good look at them as they disappear in an instant.

This whole thing started happening about 8 months ago. Over this time it has gotten more persistent. It takes more harm and focus to get it to leave for a while, it has been testing me more, and the knowing that someone is watching me is almost always present now.

I need help with this. I have no idea why it is here, but the best answer i can come up with is that i am being punished for something i did in the past. 

If anyone has information on what this could be or how to stop it, please tell me.",15Sep2020,1
1029,"I’m 19f. I’ve been professionally diagnosed with ADD but these are new symptoms.

I always find myself being sad, bored and numb and feeling as though everything is my life is just a distraction from feeling sad. This symptom is more recent then others i’ve been experiencing but for about a year i feel like i have to make an effort to constantly tell myself to stop overthinking and being sad. I also find myself constantly worrying about being successful, failing university, making money and my friends. Like to the point i’ll have breakdowns because i’m so scared of failing and not having a house. I also find myself imaging scenarios like for example i’ll be thinking about stuff then will just zone out and think about what if i became a dental hygenist instead and will go on a huge search about how to be one then realize what the heck am i doing when i’m not even in school for that. (I’m in school for global studies and french). I also have troubles with setting boundaries. I also have lost my appetite and lost weight. I’ve also struggled with maintaining contact with people as i feel like a burden. I also feel like experience very high highs and get very sad and alone when not being distracted by something that makes me feel better. 

I feel like something is wrong with me and it’s making me worse. I know this is not professional but maybe someone could advise me on what they think may be the case and where to seek help.

there’s a lot of personal info contributing to these symptoms but i’m just looking for someone to help me figure out what’s going on. (Hence why i want to see a therapist)",15Sep2020,1

1033,"For reference I work at a pharmacy. My job has known about my pregnancy since I was about 6 weeks along due to needing to pick up my prenatals there. This pregnancy was not planned but I’m over the moon non the less! I am the only full time employee they have aside from the lead tech so I know it’s hard to cover my shifts when I do need time off work. I rarely ever call off and when I do it’s for medical reasons (having the flu, being hospitalized, etc). 

My boss (who is a women but not married and has no children) has mostly just worried about who will replace me while I’m gone. She only ever asks me about the name I’ve picked out, how much weight Ive gained, how much weight I gained with my first, and questions like that. She never asks if I’m feeling okay or if I need a break after being busy and working on a 9 hour shift. 

The first time she really started being rude to me was because I had used the bathroom for the second time while working a 6 hour shift. She yelled at me saying I was only going to the bathroom because I wanted to use my phone. I told her that wasn’t true because I was allowed to use my phone whenever we weren’t busy. It had been super slow since covid so most days we were very slow and we all would use our phones. I told her I really just had to use the bathroom and she said that was fine as long as I left my phone while going. She also basically said it wasn’t an excuse to be pregnant because soon I’d be 8-9 months pregnant saying the same thing and going to the bathroom more frequently. I informed her that was true I would be going more the further along I got and that it very much so was a reasonable excuse. I found out later she wanted the lead tech to go get her lunch and because I had went to the bathroom before she left she was upset about being hungry and having to wait. I also want to add that I only take about 5 minutes in total to use the bathroom while at work and I only go when we have no customers or prescriptions to fill. I often hold it for hours just to make sure we aren’t busy when I go because I feel like it is an inconvenience for the rest of the workers. 

The next time was more recent. I’m currently 36 weeks and during the weekend (Saturday) I noticed the baby hadn’t really moved for the entire day. She’s usually very active so I told my OB and she suggested I go to the hospital. While there they checked everything out and I ended up having to stay over night until they were sure my baby was okay. I finally went home mid afternoon (Sunday) and decided to bathe and rest. I started getting a migraine and my blood pressure was very high so my OB told me to go back to the hospital since they think I am at risk for preeclampsia (I had it with my first pregnancy). I had to stay another night and wasn’t released until the night after around 11pm (Monday). I then picked up my child, took a shower and finally settled down for the night. At this time it’s now 2am (Tuesday).

I had been in contact with my boss the entire time this was going on. She first told me that she hoped I felt better and to text our group chat to see if anyone could cover my shift Monday. No one responded so I let her know but she had gotten some people to stay a little later for me. Later that night I told her I wouldn’t be released until late and needed my shift covered today as well since I was supposed to be working at 8am. She finally asked me after 3 days what exactly was going on so I told her everything that had happened. I told her about the baby not moving, the headache, the high blood pressure, that the baby’s heart beat had been dangerously high, and I had started contracting. She read my text and hasn’t responded at all. 

I’m scheduled to be off work tomorrow so I won’t be going in. I had asked for an extra day off during the week so now I work 4 days instead of 5 and have the weekends off. I usually work 30+ hours and ever since I asked for an extra day off she’s still been scheduling me 30+ hours. I’ve actually been working more since I asked for the extra day off. She now gives me 8-9 1/2 hour shifts as a posed to the 6-7 1/2 hour shifts I used to work. It’s really starting to wear me down the further my pregnancy progresses. I told them I’d stay up until I go into labor because they have no other people to help despite knowing about my pregnancy the entire time. I always cover peoples shifts when they’re sick or need time off and like I said I’ve only ever called off while having a real medical reason. Most of the time people call off at my work it’s last minute and for vacations they never asked for time off for or they lie about things that they later tell coworkers aren’t true just because they don’t want to work. 

I go back to work Thursday-Friday this week and they’re both 9 hour shifts. We’ve been extremely busy lately and it’s been awful. I know my boss and her lead tech have spent this whole time complaining about me being off work (they do that any time people call off and act nice to their face). I guess I just need some advice on how to handle this whole situation. I really need to keep working but with my boss, the long hours, the crazy rush of work all day I’m getting more and more stressed out. I never get to sit down at work or even eat while there most days because we’re constantly busy. What should I do? Also sorry this has been so long I just wanted to make sure everything was covered.",15Sep2020,1

1036,"So I’ll start here, when I was about 16 I went out to get my first job. I worked to buy my own School clothes, buy food to eat and help my mother with bills. My mom is a single mother.. she had to raise 3 kids on her own. But now that’s over! We are all grown!! When I became a freshman in college I got financial aid and a scholarship to finance my tuition. My mother decided that year that it was time to get rid of her home she rented for 8+ years. She asked me to do a garage sale, make the signs, etc. 

I asked my mother where she was moving. She told me she wanted to move with me 4 hours away to where I went to School. I told her she can’t live in the dorm with me and would instead have to find an apartment around the area. She told me she found a place she liked through google.. and forced me to get her in that apartment. I took half of my direct refund from college to pay for the deposit on the apartment, not to mention I had to pay for gas, and other expenses to get her moved up there.

I had to guide her there using my gps, pay for hotel stays while her application was processing etc. when she finally got accepted into the apartment, I left her alone to go back to School. My mother gave me a horrible time, she continuously asked for money, food, etc. I helped her the best way I could. She told me she was lonely, I don’t visit her enough, she didn’t know her way around, her car had problems and would repeatedly tell me how much she hated the apartment.  

I got my mom a job around the area but she quit, I got her another job and she never returned. I looked for more and she said they embarrassed her because she didn’t know how to work the computer. I had to come out my pocket once again!!! To pay for her bills. 

My mom decided to move back (To our hometown 4 hours away from my College) without telling me... and blamed me everyday saying it’s my fault. I made her lose her home, money, etc. She stayed with my older sister until my sister decided to move out of her home and with our grandma. My mom now lives there too... and TODAY (3 years later) is now begging me again to move her back to where my College is saying she’s desperate for a place. She asks me for money, for advice.. she gets upset if I don’t answer her calls, she hangs up on me, fusses at me and I’m just SICK OF IT. 

I’m literally soo broken and stressed. I had such a great heart and didn’t mind doing for anyone no matter what.. which I’m still that way but I’m not afraid to say “No” no matter how much it break my heart. It’s just really hard to say NO to my mother... i’m trying soo hard to get away from her but she keeps telling me God will punish me for ignoring her and attempting to abandon her.",15Sep2020,1
