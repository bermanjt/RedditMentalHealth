1,"To give some background, I not only have a very long but sharp memory.  If I could focus, I can easily remember things down to detail and recall them within my head.  This has been both a blessing..... and a curse.....

The past few weeks, I‚Äôve come across certain articles and things on the internet that, for the lack of a better term, I want to end up forgetting.  But I can‚Äôt, no matter how much I try, I can‚Äôt get myself to forget or at the very least, move on.  

I can‚Äôt keep my mouth shut about this anymore, with this and the COVID Pandemic restricting where I can go and what I can do, I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy at this point.  Any advice would be of real help.

2,"I'm a clinical pharmacist with an idea that would allow me to supplement my clinical practice with my love of teaching. I have heard from many of my interdisciplinary colleagues that pharmacology was one of the more challenging parts of their schooling. My idea is to basically start a pharmacology tutoring service where students (medicine, pharmacy, nursing, PA, NP, etc) could reserve 1:1 or group tutoring sessions with a clinical pharmacist to discuss any pharmacology topic they would like (drug classes, disease state treatments, pharmacokinetics, literature, hypothetical patient cases, etc) via zoom for an hourly/session rate. My plan would also be to offer pre-recorded lectures or topic discussions that would be available for sale. So, my questions are:

1. is this a service that you would/would have use(d) during school?
2. do you think the tutoring sessions or the pre-recorded content would be more helpful?
3. what do you think is a fair hourly rate?

I'm open to all thoughts on this idea. Thanks in advance!",06Dec2020,1

4,"I [M22] feel like just a second opinion to my roommates (who are my girlfriend and her sister). I think what makes me most frustrated is that I continuously bottle up all my emotions and avoid any conflict. I have extreme trouble talking to my girlfriend about anything that upsets me or apologize without presenting my perspective on any argument. So it almost seems impossible to confront her sister who never does anything around the house, is unemployed, and belittles my girlfriend, her sister, whenever they talk. I honestly just don't know what to with addressing things that I can control and don't have anyone to talk to about my issues. 

My girlfriend and I have talked about moving out from her sister but we're her only option for a stable home environment that wouldn't cause more stress on her mental health issues. 

I feel like I need a therapist to rant to every so often because my girlfriend really is the only one I can talk to.",06Dec2020,1
5,"This is hopefully a COVID19 slump, as I've had terrible anxiety and possibly depression for the last 6 months. I went from being happy with an active social life in my college city to moving back with my parents (who are awesome, but aged 50) in the rural village I grew up in where I have no friends anymore. Been a super isolating time for me, like it has for everyone else. I'm hoping and praying I have college on campus next fall so my life can continue again. 

With that being said, I worry almost daily that my boyfriend isn't right for me. I also worry that I'm settling cos he acts like I'm his mom at times and refuses to get help for a mental illness that ruins both our lives for weeks at a time when it gets bad. I get overwhelmed and wanna break up when it happens. Each time he gets better, I assume it won't happen again, but it's happened three times now, last time was this summer. Made me cry a few times.  We've been together exactly 26 months, meeting the first day of college, losing our virginities together, being exclusive in 2 weeks, it was a freaking fairytale. I've always thought it was so sweet but for the last few months I've wondered what it would be like to date someone without his issues. Occasionally I now fantasise about falling in love with a random guy. Other times I think I'm horrible for this, because all relationships get hard and I'm only unhappy about 30% of the time.

 Our sex life kinda sucks, I've never orgasmed during oral or actual sex, just alone, and I'm boring loving/fun p in v in various positions, some blindfolds with oral sex, he wants anal, finishing on my face/boobs, tying up. I feel guilty because if we last forever, he will never get these things he spent years watching on porn. I was worried I didn't love him anymore as I barely missed him during a 6 week long lockdown without him, but I see him once a week now and I'm still having fun and feel a little more for him now. I just miss being 100% sure he's my future husband. I feel so fickle wondering if there's more out there, cos for all I know this might be the only guy who could tolerate me forever? Is our relationship good/bad? Am I picky?",06Dec2020,1

11,"There's so many things I want to happen, but I just don't know how it can or how to make myself do it. 

- Recently, I haven't been up too date with my school work. Maybe it's because of quarantine and it's easier to get distracted at home, but I just don't want to do it anymore. (Though, I was up to date with it in the beginning) 

- I want to make more friends, but don't know how. I used to have quite alot in when I was younger, but it started to diminish as I got older. The ones I do have (3), we barely talk to eachother, and I only talk to 1 of them one-on-one, but even that's not alot. 

- I want to be able to talk to anyone. Every time I'm put in a situation to socialize, I'm so quiet and end up hanging by myself. Sometimes, I feel like I can talk to anyone, but when it gets down to it, I shut down. I can kinda force myself to talk when needed (presentations and answering questions online), but it can be quite awkward and I get ""stuttery"". 

- I always think about losing weight and bettering my appearance. I am pretty overweight for my height, I can never get my hair to look nice and i have bad acne and can never stick to a regimen I though I always buy the products. 

- I feel I romanticize suicide and selfharm. I'm always searching about it, and thinking about it. I even think about cutting just to know what it feels like. I'm not sure if I'll ever do it. But I still don't want to have this kind of ideal for it. 

Anyway, I would really like some advice for these things. I know it may seem alot, and I may look like I'm just some weird lazy complainer. But I would definitely appreciate any help I can get.",06Dec2020,1

14,"I‚Äôm sorry if this sounds brief and factual but my emotions are so heightened that I don‚Äôt know how to convey what I want to say.

My (21F) and bf (23M) live together. There have been some big issues with his mum in the past few months which has led to separation from his family, he has isolated himself from everyone and our relationship is now struggling as a result of the actual result of all of these things. Everything is taken out on me as I‚Äôm the only person he isn‚Äôt afraid of. He‚Äôs terrified of speaking up for himself, he‚Äôs afraid of everyone. He‚Äôs become so depressed and I‚Äôve just been watching him deteriorate for months.

The job he works isn‚Äôt his career, it‚Äôs a job with no progression in the small town we live in so we can afford to live (I am 100% not saying this in a put-down way, you will see why I say this but I just want to emphasise that this is not detrimental to his future career). He works for the a family run business (and they are ****‚Äôs to put it lightly). He does night shifts alone in this place, and this has only made things worse as all he does is sleep all day now as he‚Äôs been getting more depressed. He doesn‚Äôt even wake up to eat in time, it‚Äôs so hard to watch.

To explain a little, there are students that cover the weekend night shifts at the moment as the other night shift employee quit in September. His employer has not hired anyone else since, leaving my boyfriend to do all of the other night shifts with the inability to ever call in sick for work (which he never even has anyway) but he can‚Äôt even take time off or swap with anyone. This employer has broken laws - paid below minimum wage (which he already had to confront about), etc. She‚Äôs sneaky and wants to cut costs at every corner. Doesn‚Äôt care about her employees. He indirectly asked his employer for holidays, finds out (because he never checks his payslips, I didn‚Äôt know this either...... but nothing I can do now...) she used over HALF of his holidays without consulting him. Keeps bluffing that he can‚Äôt use the rest of his holidays as she has no one to replace him!! This is ludicrous to me. I eventually convinced him to go to the doctor this week, the doctor encouraged him to talk to her and explain that if she doesn‚Äôt give him time off, he will be getting a sick cert. I forgot to add he is so afraid of this woman; I don‚Äôt blame him, she‚Äôs a nasty piece if work but at the end of the day, she doesn‚Äôt give an absolute damn about him so why should he bend to her will?? He speaks to her - she turns around and says ‚ÄúWHY would you be stressed??? I come in here 6 days a week‚Äù SHE‚ÄôS THE OWNER. Basically fobs him off and then she puts him down on the rota for next week despite him saying he will have to get a sick cert. Now he is too afraid to give her the sick cert and says he will just have to work.

He is having breakdowns, crying and can‚Äôt function. I keep trying to tell him life is bigger than this job, it won‚Äôt matter in a years time, keep reminding him of how this isn‚Äôt his responsibility and he comes first. Nothing I say gets through to him. He is getting headaches and nosebleeds and I can‚Äôt watch this get worse but I‚Äôm powerless. I know I can‚Äôt go into his job but I just want to help him, can someone please advise me or tell me what you would say to the person you love in this situation? I‚Äôve tried everything and I‚Äôm afraid of what‚Äôs going to happen next to him.

Sorry if this is all over the place.

I haven‚Äôt had a relationship last for this long since I was in high school, and obviously now as an adult the experience is a lot different. The more time that goes by, the less I know what to expect as far as what a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù progression of a relationship looks like. 

I know every experience is different, so I‚Äôm just looking for kind of anecdotal responses or suggestions in navigating the relationship as it slips out of the infatuation phase. Being I haven‚Äôt gotten past infatuation in probably any of my relationships, it‚Äôs easy to feel like it slipping away is a sign of a failing relationship but I hope that‚Äôs not true. 

Some questions I have:
What does a healthy relationship look/feel like after the initial infatuation period wears off?
Is it normal to often not have much to talk about after having been together for a while?
Is it typical for sex to become less frequent to even a little more dull?
Is it normal to have some ‚Äúcold feet‚Äù thoughts such as, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can imagine having this one sexual partner for possibly the rest of my life‚Äù?
How can I continue to nurture the relationship?

20,"I'm not against LGBTQ+, but I'm straight and it seems like this friend of mine talks about our friendship like it's a romantic relationship and I really don't want a misunderstanding but it's freaking me out. Basically we would often have h2h or deep talks and it pretty much makes up the entire friendship besides shared interests. They said they ""idealise"" people often including me and they think we have a deep connection etc. But their word choice is making it weird because they jokingly mentioned ""being my pet"" or using terms that are usually used for romantic partners.

22,"Ok I know that sounds really bad but I don't think I can do it any longer, at least not in a way that makes me feel like shit after. I am and will always be there for my friend (we're BFFs since highschool) because I know she struggles with mental health and really gets down in the dumps. But some of the things ,, like i don't know.... for example she weighs like 140-somethings and is super pretty and attractive (huge boobs, curly hair, yadda yadda) but is always telling me about how ""fat"" and ""ugly"" she is (she's none of those). And I get that everyone can get insecure no matter how desirable they appear to society, but man I just don't know why I feel the way I do when she says that. I weigh like 184-186, have got A cup boobs, and never (never!) had a BF/not really a hit with the guys like she is, so when she says that stuff I just.. i don't know.. don't wanna hear it... and I know that sounds so awful and I feel awful for even feeling that way but I just help but feel even worse about myself, and tbh i don't have to say anything I just want a good way to deal with it. The places my mind go to usually look like this: if you're calling yourself ""fat"" at 140, what does that make me? and if you're so ugly why do guys love you so much and ignore me completely? 

I know those sound really selfish, but I make sure to never NEVER express them out loud. My other thing is that she only really ever says/complains/vents(?) those to me, and not our 3rd roommate who is 1) closer to her weight (so 150something), 2) has the same cup size (we all measured lol), and 3) had a lot of boyfriends/pretty and blah blah blah...,, I'd understand more if she talked about her problems with someone who's on a similar playing field as she is, like our roommate. But I can't help but feel like her saying those things to me, someone who is lacking in nearly all those departments, kinda feels like ""punching down"" (even though, y'know, it's about her own insecurities). 

I'm always there to listen and be there for her because I love her and she's my best friend, but this happens literally all of the time if not pretty much every other day. It's just disheartening to hear so often...idk...lemme know watchyall think..",06Dec2020,1

Brother and sister are the same piece of trash, we dont really talk, and when i think about it 90% of our conversation is just inconsistency and no sense fights and how they make fun of me, because im the ""black sheep"" of the family.

I am not really smart, I dont know how to deal with it, its easier for me to forget about it but those negative thoughs always come back and really hit me hard although i am the kind of person who doesnt give a damn about things.

When I was in middle school I was had a really bad relationship with my dad. He's a good person but is not very nice with his words, and has a quick temper and will physically lash out.

I was a moody teenager and often had trouble asking for what I wanted. Maybe I was too proud to ask, or maybe my piss poor relationship with my dad made it hard for me to ask. 

Over the years my dad has learned to tone it down, and is now approaching the way he raises my middle school aged sister very differently from the way he raised me. I am happy for her, but also find myself extremely jealous at times. 

For example, it's common in our country for students to go to extra tutoring because our education system is very competitive. My parents never sent me to one, and I never asked. Only later did I realize how much of a difference it made in college entrance exams.

34,"Some background info:  I met this girl in august of this year and since we hit it off pretty quick. It wasn‚Äôt a relationship or anything but we talked all the time and hung out occasionally. We would flirt sometimes too but neither of us are looking for a relationship right now so it was just friendly.

Since then we don‚Äôt talk as much and haven‚Äôt hung out but it‚Äôs been trending towards normal the past few weeks.

However, our neighbors downstairs scream at one another every single day. It wasn‚Äôt so bad when we had the AC running because of the white noise, but now that that‚Äôs off for the season, we hear every single word of it. It can be intense, and one time it was so bad that we were worried for their safety. My fianc√© and I actually went down and pounded on their door until we were sure that everyone was unharmed. The girl, M, was so incredibly embarrassed.

It isn‚Äôt just fighting, either. The guy, A, screams at his video games for hours.

I got through most of the windows setup until it asked for my Microsoft account info. I went to look my password and username up and left my pc. I found the info within 5 minutes and when I came back to my pc to input it, the pc (I assume) had fallen asleep. I pressed the space bar a few times and nothing happened. Clicked the mouse a few times and nothing happened. I pressed the restart button on my pc reluctantly and when windows went to boot again it froze. I waited a few minutes and nothing happened. Restarted again and nothing happened again after freezing. I powered off the power supply and then turned everything back on again. It told me that the system turned off incorrectly and that it needed to repair itself. After about a minute of that it went back to rebooting windows, only to freeze AGAIN.

38,"This year has been an absolute rollercoaster for me. At the start of it, I left an 18-year career and got my dream job...something I'd dreamed of doing my whole life. In the middle of the year, I was made redundant as a direct result of the coronavirus. I'm now back in my old job which is totally unfulfilling with very little (no) chance of getting my dream job back.

I thought I'd readjusted to this new normal but my old job is worse than ever...it pays well but is working from home with so little work that most of my day involves moving my mouse to make sure my skype tick stays green. My boss doesn't care and doesn't even respond to my emails.

I realise I'm lucky...I have my health, a job, a home and a good relationship although for two years we have been struggling to start a family which is causing some distress. For the first time in my life, I just feel deeply down with nothing to look forward to. At 41, it feels like this whole situation has caused a mid-life crisis...up to now, I've always thought my path to happiness was pretty clear. Now I have no idea what I'm doing.

Games like MMOs that start boring and stay boring have been the most consistent fun I‚Äôve had with media ironically enough. But it goes beyond entertainment to school, relationships, jobs, friendships. Even the littlest of things, like how I recently found a new way to crack my knuckles that felt like the biggest hit of dopamine to my brain in years suddenly holds no appeal, just like cracking my neck, my toes, etc all of which started as incredibly satisfying things but now are just a part of my nervous ticks I do simply because I‚Äôm always bored. Everything I do I just become desensitized to within days, maybe weeks if I‚Äôm lucky and its so hard to find joy in anything anymore.

I'm 23 years old and I live at home (only because the house is going to be given to me when he passes) but I really would like to have a cat. When I lived with my roommates, they had a couple of cats. The cats really helped with my mental health. 
Since I moved back, my mental health has declined and I just know getting a cat would help. I have asked my dad about it and he said no. I asked why and he said he doesn't want one in the house. (Vague answer, I know.) 
I was talking with my therapist and I could get a cat that's for emotional support. But I'd have to get the cat first.

43,"I used to be super insecure, as an Asian kid growing up in a mainly white environment, I always felt inadequate. Puberty gave me a nice glowup, and my confidence shot through the roof. I got a lot of attention from guys and often got complimented too. Then I met my current boyfriend, and 2 months into this seemingly perfect relationship, my confidence got completely scattered. He told a mutual friend how I am ‚Äòtotally not his type‚Äô and ‚Äòhe finds Asians 0% attractive‚Äô as you can imagine that hurt me so much. He told me before his type was blonde and blue eyed... at the time, I thought ‚Äòoh can happen I guess‚Äô but learning how he told all his friends and family... made me feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. We had many conversations about this. I said some hurtful stuff, how I felt like he was embarrassed of me, saw me as a placeholder til he ‚Äòfound his type‚Äô. He tried to explain how he meant that he picks me over his type. But the stuff I knew he said to others is just so vastly different.

Now after a years time I love him in every way and he is good to me but I get anxiety when he compliments my looks. Like he‚Äôs lying, cause behind my back he‚Äôs complaining about my looks right? 

This situation made me realize how fragile my confidence was, how it was really built on other people‚Äôs positive opinions, rather than myself being content.

53,"Hey guys, I need advice regarding a personal family issue that needs to be looked at from different perspectives. So, I'm going to try to keep this short as I can without leaving out important details regarding the situation. The issue is regarding my mom, my grandma, and my aunts. My mom has been asking for more support from my two aunts for my grandma, she is in her 70s and is suffering from Parkinson's and is in the early stages of dementia. My grandmothers mental health has been deteriorating throughout the decade, and the past few years have been rough on my mom given that she is her caretaker. 

My mom, step dad, and two little brothers have had to learn on the job as her condition worsens, doctors and family members close to us have told all three daughters that it needs to be an equal effort in order for them to be able to tackle this situation in the best way. However, both my aunts(One lives 5 min away driving, the other a couple of states away), have been neglectful of how my mom is feeling going through this and its been affecting her life. My grandma is very difficult to manage, and is at risk of hurting herself on a weekly basis.

My grandmother want's to leave the house everyday, but my mom can't take her because 1(She works from home and my step dad takes the car for work) 2(They live in a highly populated area, where COVID cases have been spiking) 3(My mom is working and watching my brothers as they do online school). She is constantly at risk of escaping because she gets too anxious and leaves their apartment, they've had issues with other tenants because she is asking them for rides and has been caught sneaking into our neighbors home. She is at risk of her hurting herself(Rushes down the apartment stairs, crosses streets in traffic. And lastly, the kids have had to witness and deal with some of her episodes and its been traumatic for them.

My family and I understand my grandmas situation, and we've supported her all the way and continue to do so. We feel as though the ones who don't seem to understand how complicated this really is are my aunts, each time my mom has asked for their support they get defensive and disregard her and hows she's been handling all this. It's been difficult on her, and it's been taking a toll on her mental health and the kids as well, overall this is a mess. And I do want to say that YES they do help out, just not as much as they should. The oldest one lives states away, and calls my grandma on a weekly basis and helps out financially, but she she offers little emotional support to my mom and my gets the most defensive about this. The youngest lives in the same area, only shows up every now and then, and like my mom has two kids/job, but has excuses to why shes never around and says that my mom needs to complain less.

I'm tired of them pointing fingers and neglecting the reality of the situation, I just want them to do whats right for everyone. I don't know what to tell my mom anymore, because I've tried talking to my aunts in the past but it's always the same BS. Other things i'd like to put out there is that my mom moved in with my grandma over a decade ago, but its under my mom/step dads name and they've been paying the bills for years and never asked my grandma for financial help. Mom does everything for my grandma, cooks and buys her food, helps with her laundry, handles her medications and appointments and has been her emotional support throughout most of this. We have tried looking for an at home nurse for her, buts it way too expensive to pay out of pocket and her insurance wont send anyone since my mom is there).

I know this isn't easy for my grandma, its been a nightmare actually, seeing her like this. But, like her, my family and I are in disbelief of how fast the disease has progressed and are struggling to find a way to deal with this as it develops. No, we will not put her in a retirement home.

She was telling my dad and I at the dinner table today while we were eating, about a package she delivered that was vibrating. My dad told her that it was too inappropriate to say around me and especially at the dinner table. So she tried playing it off by saying she thinks it was an electric razor. Neither my father or I believed that. Sometimes she will say something that she thinks is normal or okay when really it sounds absolutely horrible and wrong. 

On Halloween, she yelled at our neighbor and said to not go cause any havoc. As our neighbor has been in and out of trouble, I told my mom that she shouldn‚Äôt have said that. But she didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with that. Later that night, our neighbor got arrested.

A few weeks ago, she had congratulated someone in my family for being pregnant when really they were just obese. When they said they weren‚Äôt pregnant, my mother had asked if she had gained weight. 

And of course there have been many other occurrences of this but these are just a few. She has no filter and I don‚Äôt like that.

I haven‚Äôt really been able to have a proper relationship with my mom because of this. I wish she had a filter and just not spoke her mind so much.

58,"Hi, 

**Background**

Classes at my university have recently come to and end and I received a D in my Organic Chemistry class, which is failing. I have the option to retake the class up to one time, however, I am struggling to pick a time to retake the class. One of the reasons I felt like that lead to my failing grade was the abrupt switch to online classes, it was difficult to adjust and find a new work and study style. I am currently a **2nd year in college** so I do have time to take classes a later date.

**My Options**

I was thinking to either retake the class possible next spring 2021 semester, as I would have taken the class already and the information would still be fresh in my head, however, I firmly believe that will be fully online as well. Which makes me hesitate to sign up for it the spring 2021. My other option is to retake the class fall 2021 semester, I do not know if that class will be online or in person, but I feel like COVID-19 will have passed by then, and a majority of individuals will have vaccines allowing for the university to re open classes to be in person. 

**What I Think**

I feel it would be better to wait for fall 2021 semester to retake the class in hopes that it is in person as I feel I will be able to pay attention to the material better and have a stronger study routine. However, I am second guessing myself and think that if I do not retake the class spring 2021 I wont have some of the information still fresh within my head. Although, I do not think that matters anyway because I would have to relearn the information anyways.

**Question**

What do you think? Which option sound like the better choice in this scenario?",06Dec2020,1

Let me start by saying that I am fortunate to work for myself so I worry about having to shut my business down due to workload not being up to standard but I am not worried about ""being at work"" when I burnout. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I am struggling to do my job every single day.**

I have gone from a 6-8 hour workday to having to stop after 1.5 hours in the last few months. I have to stop because of getting physically tired, having brain fog, making mistakes etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what aspect of my life has brought this on. My depression feels manageable right now, I don't know if it's the constant fatigue I've had since a bad illness in June, I don't know if it's subconscious feelings from a long term breakup a few months ago, if it's the fact I cannot work (well) on my main mental health problem due to COVID, the general melancholy this year... 

I feel incredibly lazy and worthless because of it. 

I am having to write a daily task list for such mundane things like ""clean teeth"" and I do 3-4 tasks on the list and that's me burnt out for the day.

&amp;#x200B;

I AM doing all the things you're recommended to do, such as:

* Working out 3 times a week
* Counting my calories and eating really clean every single day 
* Blood tests have been done and came back fine
* Keeping my work, sleep &amp; play areas separate

and so on...

It takes so much of my mental and physical energy to try and do all these things to stay healthy and they have not been (noticeably) helping despite doing them for at least 2 months.

66,"I started university this year, so naturally I have only kept in touch with those I really cared about throughout high school. There is this one girl I've been friends with for a long time (we took a break for a couple of years in the middle), and I've known her since Gr. 5. After high school finished, the only way I could contact her was through Discord, as she lives quite far away and it'd be inconvenient to meet up too often (not to mention, she's not the type to go out a lot). She's always been a friend that I valued a lot, and the time we spend together is really great. However, throughout our many years of friendship, I am usually the one who reaches out first. If I were to count all the times she reached out to me first, I'd be able to do it all in one hand. This year, I decided to stop messaging her first and to wait and see if she'd take initiative to talk to me. After about three months of not saying anything, she still never messaged me. She's the only friend I have that I can talk to about writing stories, as all my other friends are not interested in these things. Recently, I decided to message her first just because I missed her company so much; we've had several conversations since then. Nowadays, I've noticed that she often ignores my messages and she explained it was because I kept messaging her while she was playing games, so she'd forget to reply. As a result, I've been only messaging her when I see that she is available on Discord. The problem is, she plays games for a long time (and I don't normally have an issue with that). So today, I joked about how I was waiting for her to finish playing games and how I've been checking back for hours just to talk about something I was excited about. My tone was not serious at all, so there's no way she'd have thought I was genuinely upset. Her reply was what hurt me though. She asked why I couldn't have just messaged someone else and that she'd been available for most of the afternoon anyway. Normally, I would have just brushed that off, but combined with how she's been treating me lately, I couldn't help but feel unappreciated and upset. I've always had trouble making friends, so I only have a few close ones. Although we haven't talked very much in the past year, I still considered her as one of my closest confidants. This is part of the reason why I cherish the friendship between us so much. Over the past few years, I feel that I've been the only one making an active effort to maintain this friendship. I don't want to be lonely, but I also don't know if it's worth it to keep being friends with her.",06Dec2020,1

Honestly it‚Äôs not hard for me to keep up with school because I‚Äôm organized with it, but I feel guilty. It‚Äôs approaching the end of the semester, meaning for the month of December and January I‚Äôll have a lot of free time.

I also have trouble with remebering homework and the simple things like ""Just do it as soon as you get home"" dont really help.

I usually skip detentions to walk home with my freinds, it can be hard to do the right thing.

69,"My first semester of college I‚Äôll admit I was a huge dumbass and didn‚Äôt go to classes or even try. I got a warning about my gpa so I tried so hard, so fucking hard the second semester but with covid I was forced to move back home into such an abusive toxic household I was so depressed I just gave up on school. I received a letter that I was going to get kicked out unless I wrote an appeal explaining my situation and how I‚Äôll fix it. They accepted the appeal and I didn‚Äôt get kicked out. I was very lucky to be able to dorm and leave the environment this fall semester and I tried so hard again, I really did but I would‚Äôve had to get straight A‚Äôs to raise my gpa enough to not get kicked out and I wasn‚Äôt able to.

73,"Hey everyone, I hope you are all doing as well as you can given the current circumstances!

I live in the United States, and the covid epidemic seems worse than ever at the moment. Throughout this quarantine, I've been running and exercising outside as often as I can to keep myself physically and mentally healthy. But recently it's been snowing, and it's a bit too icy and cold outside for me to continue my exercise routine.

My mom gave me an early Christmas present: a membership to a nearby gym! The gym seems to have put a lot of work into their safety precautions, and they only have every other machine open as well as cutting their hours to allow for deep cleaning. I would love to keep working out, but I am worried that I may be acting irresponsibly if I go to the gym! For reference, the county I live in is at a Level 4 Purple risk level, which is really bad! 

So should I play it safe and avoid the gym and find a different way to get my exercise in? Also, any advice for how to fight the cabin fever that's been getting to me?",06Dec2020,1
74,"I \[21f\] recently caught up with an old childhood friend \[21m\] and had a great time. Conversation flowed readily and easily. We laughed lots, and I enjoyed hearing about his life since we'd been apart. It was as if no time had passed between now and our childhood friendship.

We caught up as just friends, but if we were to continue spending time together, I‚Äôd be open to more. That said, I‚Äôm trying hard to keep a clear mindset and be wary, because, even though it was a long time ago, I‚Äôve had a bit of a rough time with some not-so-gentlemen before now.

Anyway, whilst we were chatting, he mentioned his surprise at there being a nudist beach when he was on holiday once. I shared my own thoughts on the subject, we joked and laughed. This was totally fine...

But then he reflected on nudist culture a bit, I guess, and mentioned that he used to work with lots of French people and then said:

'These French people, gorgeous French chics right, and they'd just take like (he just gestured to his top, suggesting they take it off) and sit around. It‚Äôs just what they do there, in France apparently, just what they do. And I mean, I wasn‚Äôt complaining, but I wasn‚Äôt really looking either. There was this disgusting old bloke who came and was just taking photos of them. Without consent or anything.' He looked pretty shocked and horrified by this.

I didn‚Äôt get any creepy or bad guy feelings from this guy. He was, to all other accounts, perfectly gentlemanly but I don‚Äôt want to make mistakes and end up in an unideal situation.",06Dec2020,1

I have a full-ride scholarship+the college gives me money every month (half of the minimum wage here).  About 2 weeks ago my mom said she had no money and took my card to buy food, I don't have a problem with this but I found today that in 2 weeks, she spent my monthly scholarship just to buy food (she only spent the money in supermarkets). I was shocked to find this out because she mainly buys junk food and cigarettes. The problems are: She overspends on food. We (me and my siblings) only eat dinner and the other meals are just chocolates or chips with soda. I am currently trying to change this but I can't cook 3 meals for 4 people every day while attending college. My mom, on the other hand, doesn't eat any meals, only eats like a slice of bread, cheese and nuts in a day. I think she smokes about a pack every day. She tries to avoid cooking and leaves it to me half of the time. Her work is very flexible, she works from home and works about 2-3 hours every day. She spends most of her time on her phone. I think she may be experiencing mental exhaustion or maybe she has depression. Unfortunately, there are no psychologists in our area and I can't afford it right now.

To be cautious, they‚Äôre going to have the apt sprayed now and do a second spray in a few weeks. I told them I could delay the move to January instead so they have time to deal with the bedbug issue, but after reading up on Reddit about bedbugs...I‚Äôm not so sure this problem can be resolved in a few weeks. I‚Äôm starting to get a lot of anxiety about this, and am wondering if I should just break the lease and not move in at all. Should I continue with the move in or cancel it? If I do choose to move ahead, how will I know if the apt is safe?

79,"I'm 23, he's 26. We work together in a supermarket. 

We first got to know each other in December 2019, at the job Christmas party. I had seen him around the store before that but we never really talked. We ended up talking that night and we spent most of the night together I was going through a lot personally at the time and I found him easy to talk to about everything. 

Anyway, my mental health has never been the best. I put up on my close friends on Instagram (which I put him in) earlier in the year that I was considering calling the Samaritans for help and asking if anyone had any experience with them. He texted me and told me he would be there for me whenever I needed it. 

So, I have. Every so often when I get upset he's always been someone to turn to. Also I've been trying to lose weight and he's really fit and he has been given me lots of advice and has been a lifesaver, really. I really really like him and consider him a good friend. 


Recently, things have been... different. He doesn't really talk to me as much as he used to and when i try talk to him the conversation is very short and to the point. Also a new guy in the job (lets call him John) has gotten very close to him. Him and John now do everything together and he now has no time for anyone else but John. I feel really jealous of their relationship. 

To give an example, when I lost my firs stone on my weight loss plan I told him and he was really really happy for me and was encouraging me to keep going. I finally reached my end goal last week of three stone and told him two days ago and the response was ""Oh, cool. Keep at it"" and he walked off (to see John of course) 

I started to wonder if I had done something to annoy him or piss him off. I texted him and told him I noticed a difference in our conversations and asked if something was wrong. I also asked if I was starting to drain him with the stuff we were talking about. He just replied ""No just been tired lately is all. Nothing is up"". Not much to go on, and he seems in a great mood around other people, just not around me.

Like it may sound crazy but we just feel like we were meant to meet. But I‚Äôm so anxious to actually meet her. I feel like I won‚Äôt be able to live up to any expectations even though we both said we will go into this with an open mind and no expectations. She keeps asking me to come over and see her and I keep coming up with an excuse not to but I can‚Äôt keep doing it. I want her so bad. And she genuinely wants me. 

I just got out of a 5 year relationship on Halloween after my ‚Äúsoulmate‚Äù cheated on me. We had an apartment together, pets, material items, everything. We were halfway through building a kingdom together and she burnt it down.

This girl I‚Äôm talking to is going through the exact same thing. The amount of coincidences, and the amount we have in common, is absolutely unreal. It felt like life was leading us to each other after being in such undeserving relationships. The synchronicity is unreal. Our minds seem to be the same like we didn‚Äôt know we were missing each other but we were. And the best part is, she feels the same way!

We don‚Äôt understand how we can feel this way. It seems so crazy. We both want to meet so bad and she‚Äôs 100% ready but the wounds are fresh. She‚Äôs willing to go slow but I just feel so nervous and anxious to meet her. Why am I like this. I feel like I can come up with excuses to the point of her feeling like I don‚Äôt like her or want to see her and I don‚Äôt want her thinking that. I even explained to her about this nervousness and she feels the same but seems so much more confident than me. She‚Äôs beautiful, her mind and everything about her is so gorgeous. And she says the same to me. Like we literally both deleted tinder because of each other. 

How do I stop feeling so anxious and just do this. I feel so boring, i feel so ugly, I feel so not fun, I feel like no one wants to be around me.

There is this one ex of mine I dated in my early 20s for 3 years on and off. Basically I was head over heels for him he was my first long relationship and he was a fuck boy for lack of better words. Only would see me when we were drinking. Calling me at 2am wanting to hang out. Never took me out on dates. Said he wanted to be official but was texting other girls behind my back, had an active tindr (most likely sleeping with them too) and I was just invested in him during that three year 'relationship' I never slept or talked with anyone but him. I always just wanted his approval and never got it. We stopped seeing eachother because I decided enough was enough and wanted to start moving on that is when I met the guy I am seeing now. Conveniently at the same time my ex met this girl who he later became public with (something he never did with me) and dated her for a couple of years they broke up recently. 

We don't talk anymore I don't have feelings for him. I find myself getting frustrated when girls I was worried about when we were seeing each other are blowing up his social media especially now that he is single.

100,"Hi Everyone,Looking for some advice. I'm 25 and living in London after I moved here 4 years ago from Italy seeking career improvement and a higher salary.In these years I've managed to progress quite a lot in both and had a great time. Now with Covid and everything, my job has gone fully remote and it will be easy for me in the future to find other remote positions if necessary (I'm a senior software engineer). I and my girlfriend are starting to think of buying a house and settling down, yeah you know maybe kids and stuff.

As I can virtually work from everywhere, and my girlfriend is a hairdresser that can quickly adapt to new environments, the big question is where in the world should I buy my first house?

We are originally from small little towns in Italy, so we grew up in the middle of cow fields, woods, and good food and we like to think our kids should grow up the same before taking their route. For how much we loved London and UK in general in these years we have felt that it's near to impossible making new long-lasting relations with other people and end up missing family and old friends or just feeling lonely in general.

Though on the other side we left Italy years back because of boredom, disoccupation, and many other aspects. In all of this, we are still very flexible, we were thinking of relocating to California to try out how it feels, but stuck with this life-changing decision

So what are some tips to choose something so important? Is the fact that missing family and old friends something decision making or should we hope that in the future some new good friend will show up to make the distance less heavy?Has any of you relocated to a country different from their native one and now regrets the choice of living in a different culture different from where grow up in?Is life going to change so much that ""friends"" will have a different meaning and priority that I shouldn't worry too much?

Thank you!",06Dec2020,1
101,"I work as a sales rep in Fast Moving Consumer Goods and while I don't have any personal issues with our new sales manager I know there's a problem. I'm witness to it and I here the complaints. Obviously, these complaints are told to me in perceived confidence but it's gotten to a point where I'm wondering whether or not I should say something. 

The new manager started in the role about 2 months ago. It's a small family business and he's is the owner's oldest son. Up until he came to us he was building up new operations interstate and now that the owner's felt comfortable handing the reigns to my former sales manager, making him GM of our state they moved to the new operation and their son came back here to be sales manager. 

He's young, cocky and knows it all (or at least acts like he does). I just smile and nod most of the time and just get on with my day. 

Just before the change in management one of our sales reps resigned. They got a replacement pretty quick and I trained her up and all was well for about 2 weeks after she was released upon our customers. Then he started his new role and straight away the shit hit the fan. He was sending out passive-agressive emails left, right and centre to the point I rang him up and asked if we needed to have a chat about my own performance. He told me ""It's not you"" so being a small company with 2 field reps and one internal sales person (who is the cornerstone of our department) it was obvious who the emails were directed towards. I gave her a call that same day and she told me she had just handed in her resignation and would finish out the week. 

Again, we found a replacement very quickly and I was training another new rep the following Monday. She spent a week with me and was out on her own after that. At the first afternoon she was on her own she called me and asked ""is he always like that?"" Saying he had been calling her and asking why she spent so much time at a customer's store and wanted to know why she hadn't responded to any group emails. Almost every day that week I got similar phone calls from her complaint about the new manager. Meanwhile, the passive-agressive emails continued and at the end of that week a group email came out announcing the resignation of that new rep too. 

I spoke to the sales manager and the GM about this asking if it was a failing in my training that needs to be worked on and I was told it wasn't and that it was an attitude/ personality issue. 

This week we had another new rep start and the sales manager has been on the road with them doing the training. I was told this is because of then not wanting to throw someone in the deep end during the Xmas period and not because they weren't happy with my training delivery, which I guess is fair enough and I honestly think it's better for the rep to train in their own territory and meet their own customers instead of mine so I'm totally cool with it. 

But as something came up on Friday I was asked to take the new rep out with me. All she did all day was complain about the guy - he hasn't taught her a great deal of anything and has been lecturing her on his pet peeves all week on top of talking down to her about the role of a sales person as if she'd just finished high school. After hearing similar things from the other 2 reps and also knowing that these are things I just smile and nod about when he talks to me I have no doubt that most of what she says is true.  She honestly sounds like she's ready to quit already. 

So the quandary I find myself in is do I say something to my sales manager or GM about this now before it's too late in the hope he reflects on his management methods and adjusts while ultimately risking that it makes the situation worse and I'm known as the catalyst or do I just let it ride and see how it plays out?",06Dec2020,1
102,"Long story short, I just found out that my ex, mother of my child, is dating the man she nuked our family with. I really don't have any friends that I want to talk about it with. Im so disgusted, we haven't been together for over a year but it still stings insanely that she would keep seeing the man who had no problem ruining her family and that she can stomach what she did and be with him with out care. All I want to do is scream, to text her and say exactly how hurt I am but I obviously can't. I informed her I knew and she lied, like always, I have told her all communication going forward will be through text or fb messenger and if there is anything that requires a phone call she can do so through a third party or leave a voicemail.

106,"In January of 2019, after a year of saving every cent we had and working nearly 50 hours a week, my(24F) partner(33M) and I finally were able to move across the country to start our life together. We moved to our dream city, to a much nicer apartment, and I found a good paying part time job. Then the pandemic hit and my life has spiralled out since. 

I'm only work for a few hours on Friday and Saturday nights. During the days I'm home alone from 9 am to 8 pm while my boyfriend works. 

Back home, my family is falling apart. My grandparents on one side are getting divorced and my mom had to check my grandpa into rehab against his will. On the other side of my family, my grandfather is recovering from colon cancer. Then, I just found out two weeks ago that my dad died. I loved my dad so much. He died of a heroin overdose just months after completing rehab for the second time after a fifteen+ year struggle, getting a job, his license, his own house, and I am wrecked. 

Because of the circumstances I haven't been able to go home. My sister(21) and I made the arrangements and decided against a wake or a funeral because we were the only two in his life really.

My mental health is important to me and I've been trying to cope but I'm alone with my thoughts all day every day. On top of that I have two weeks left of my bachelor's degree and a mountain of 15-20 page analysis and criticism papers to write. I'm transitioning into my masters program in February and I feel so depressed and barely prepared, like if I go into it this anxious and listless I'm going to fail for sure. 

I have wonderful friends who I'm so grateful for, but they're all in a different time zone and busy with their lives. My partner is wonderful but he's tired and stressed out too. I try to fill my days with hobbies to keep my mind engaged (DnD, writing, rough sex, and binge watching Netflix) but I can't focus and I feel so discontent and distressed about the direction this year has gone. What was supposed to be the reward for years of saving and labor and excited planning has turned into one of the loneliest, scariest, darkest times of my life.

We are 1200 behind on rent and getting notices on our door every month because we missed one payment in March when we had to both stop working and haven't been able to get the funds together since. I'm about to drop a few hundred on dental work and with the way everything is going with our city (Las Vegas) I don't see how I can justify paying 100+ a session for a counselor. But I need a counselor. I can feel myself struggling, spending all day in bed or on the couch and feeling deeply unhappy and afraid. I just don't know where to go or what to do. I feel sick and exhausted. I just need help, or someone to talk to. 


TLDR; Moved to a new city one month before the pandemic. Stuck at home alone all day every day with nothing to do but write papers. Friends are busy and in a different time zone. Just found out my dad died, can't even go home for the funeral. Need help coping that I can't afford. I feel so alone.",06Dec2020,1

113,"TW mention of sexual abuse

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



So I was raised in a very sex-negative religion, and I did not receive an adequate sex education growing up. I was sexually abused by a family member as a child, and since I had no concept of sex, I had no idea that anything wrong was happening and didn't even realize I had been abused until years later. I left my religion right as I entered the throes of puberty, discovered the internet, and developed a porn addiction.

A couple years later I realized I had been sexually abused as a kid. I spent a few years processing all of that and finding out where to go from there. I had very few people to talk to and I was in constant internal turmoil. I didn't want to come forward about it. But I was worried that if I didn't, my abuser would hurt another kid and it would be my fault. Strangers on reddit offering me advice and support honestly saved my life.


I also have OCD, so at the same time all of this was happening, I was also having severe and constant intrusive thoughts of a sexual nature. Usually with OCD I can tell that my thoughts and worries are irrational. But this time I couldn't differentiate between my intrusive thoughts and reality. I genuinely believed that all of the fucked up intrusive thoughts I was having reflected my true desires. And I wanted to drop dead because of it. This was probably the most traumatic thing I've lived through, it fucked me up worse than being abused did. Strangers on the internet saved my life again. Between processing my abuse and dealing with my OCD, I completely lost my sex drive for a couple years. And that I made me feel like I had lost a part of myself. Once my intrusive thoughts started to fade, I started to get my libido back again. But I was completely dependent on porn. I was terrified that if I relied on my own imagination to get off, the intrusive thoughts would come back again. Eventually I tried to wean myself off of porn, and sure enough the intrusive thoughts came back in full force. They went away after about six months, but it took a full year for my libido to come back.


Eventually my libido returned, and I managed to kick my porn addiction. However, I became very hypersexual once I got my libido back. I think it's because due to all this trauma I went through, my brain associates a low libido with poor mental health and trauma, and a high libido with mental stability and normalcy. And so I desperately cling to my sexuality that I worked so hard to get back, and am frankly scared of losing again. I'm also trans (ftm), and I have a complicated relationship with my masculinity. I think I subconsciously associate a high libido with masculinity, and a low libido with femininity. So having a low libido in a way makes me feel dysphoric and like less of a man. Not a healthy thought pattern, I know, but my brain does have that association. I think another part of it is that I just want to spite the repressive religious environment I grew up in. I think another major part of it is a form of escapism. I don't think I've fully processed all my trauma, and frankly I would rather think of something more enjoyable than that. And finally, I think I'm just so emotionally repressed that the only time I really feel safe expressing emotion is when I'm getting off. So I take refuge in that. And all of these different factors that cause this hypersexuality just get tangled up with each other into one thing, and I can't seem to untangle it and deal with each individual problem causing this.


I've been realizing how unhealthy this is. My brain is just constantly fixated on sex and I can't focus on the shit I need to do. I'm not even turned on most of the time, my brain is just obsessively fixated on this, and it's been like this for a couple years now. I don't think nofap would really be a good solution to this, because the problem isn't an inability to resist the urge to masturbate. My brain is just obsessively fixated on sex whether I jerk off or not. My hypersexuality is just as severe whether I go a day, or a month without jerking off. I once went two months without masturbating because my mental health was terrible, my libido was dead, and I just didn't have the urge to do it at all. But my brain was still obsessively fixated on sex the whole time. I don't know what to do about this. My conscious filter is the only thing that keeps me from saying the obscene shit that comes to my mind. When I get my wisdom teeth out or get a surgery I'll be having in a few years, who knows what I'll say when I'm high as fuck and my filter's gone. I don't think I would ever live it down. I can't see any good outcome coming from that situation. I really need to deal with this, but I don't even know how to begin to bring this up with my therapist.",06Dec2020,1

116,"So to start, I‚Äôve been in a tight situation for a little over a year and a half now. It all started when I lost my second job that made me quite a bit more than my first. I don‚Äôt really have a way of doing this type of work again and I don‚Äôt really have any desire to. Before that job, I was being supported and could focus on my true goals and passions. I‚Äôd done that ever since I was a teen and as a result I have no real job experience to help me survive. (I‚Äôm a high school drop out too to make matters worse.) I‚Äôm in my mid twenties now and during this entire COVID thing things have only gotten worse. I‚Äôve lost my vehicle that I was living out of and now I‚Äôm burdening that last and only family member I really have around me and am on good terms with. They want me gone by the end of the year.......I‚Äôm finding it impossible to wrap my head around everything I need to do while stressing every day. I‚Äôve made literally no plans because I‚Äôm loaded up with a few problems and debts already. I know I must get it together soon, but I just feel like a child. I feel as if up till now I‚Äôve never truly done anything a normal adult would do and I don‚Äôt know where to start. I don‚Äôt even have a job right now. What do I do? How do I relocate?

118,"I‚Äôm 13, and my mother recently got married to an old friend from a deployment in 1999. We moved from California to South Carolina. I was looking forward to this new change.

120,"Right this is long and confusing and could very easily be made in to some random film. Me(35) &amp; my hubby D (32) have been married 11 years and been together 12. 

I worked with my husbands brother (P) and we were just colleagues - nothing else. One day we decided to go out for a meal and ended up inviting D along as well. Things started from this point for me and D. 

Soon after something happened at our job to which we were both forced to quit at the same time. So whilst I was still seeing D P had decided he was going to start seeing D ex gf (S). D &amp; P have an older sister E. Me &amp; E got along fine and there wasn‚Äôt really any issues. E is a nanny. S had a young son by another man who P raised also. Within 6 months P knocked up S. Me &amp; D got engaged just before hand. 

We - me, D, P &amp; S - all hung around each other and things were ok. P &amp; S used to lie about where he was and what he was doing as he was doing this behind D back. When P &amp; S had their baby we got married month after which was all planned etc but P refused to come to wedding as S had just had a baby - we got married abroad with a small selection of family and friends. E had a BF at the time and she then broke up with him just before our wedding. She point blank refused to come to our wedding if he was going, so we changed things around and this now ex wasn‚Äôt coming. However E still refused to come unless she could bring her friend with her for a holiday - bearing in mind this was our wedding and not a holiday - we said fine just so she would come. 

Just before wedding on our first ‚Äútry‚Äù we discovered we were expecting. But day after hen night I discovered we were pregnant so had drunk during hen night. E refused to come to my hen night and my brother ended up in a fist fight with my now FIL - yep. 

So we flew away to go get married and enjoy the time away. E didn‚Äôt spend any time with us and her and the friend spent time together always. 

So when we got back and kept the pregnancy secret until 12 weeks. In the mean time P had asked S to marry him... then they started to stop talking to us. This happened until at least a year after we knew we were expecting and we wasn‚Äôt invited to the wedding. 

Whilst being pregnant for the first time E had previously thrown a baby shower for S and was there with her 24/7. When I asked if E was going to throw me a baby shower, she stated ‚Äúno, I only throw baby showers for people who I like‚Äù.

Alrighty then. She‚Äôs clearly got an issue with me but wtf I don‚Äôt have a clue why. I end up having our son prematurely and he had time in baby unit. E, P &amp; S didn‚Äôt visit at all or send any congratulations. 

So time went on and a few months after our son was born they (P&amp;S) got married.

Church‚Äôs being public places we turned up anyway to see the wedding and the baby behaved etc. We didn‚Äôt take any of ‚Äútheir day‚Äù away from them we just kept to ourself. Obviously not invited to the reception either we went about our day (2010 first England WC game). We didn‚Äôt see them or speak to them after this but did get praise from my FIL for coming regardless. 

Then when our son turned 1 we invited P&amp;S over for a party with some other friends who also had kids. This was the first time they saw our son. E didnt come and hadn‚Äôt seen him since a few weeks old. 

Then things started looking up and we all (not E however much she was involved in P&amp;S life with the kids) started talking again and meeting up. 

A few days before xmas 2011 P&amp;S started getting a bit distancing and the months before we had all been TTC again so we were close but things just started being weird. I don‚Äôt know why to this day. Then from no where I received a scathing message from P who attacked me from all angles and we were done. Christmas Day I ended up miscarrying but hadn‚Äôt known I was pregnant. 

So March 2012 we discovered we were expecting again. When P&amp;S  and us were TTC together I had bought two car seats and a twin buggy - yes we were that dedicated - however we emailed P&amp;S and asked for the stuff back as we were expecting. I received an email back telling me to go F myself and that S wished I miscarried. 

Distraught obviously we told my MIL what was going on and what had been sent, obviously divulging we were expecting again. She said and did nothing. P&amp;S claimed they had thrown these baby items over my back garden fence but this was bs. We then had to replace the car seat with our own money and they were never reprimanded for their lies and behaviour. 

I later in the year gave birth to our daughter prematurely again. Then we received news that D grandparent was going to die - D refused to go as he knew the whole family would be there and he didn‚Äôt want to see E or P&amp;S for what they had done to us in the last year. So I went. No one had informed P&amp;S we had had our daughter. The grandparent then died and P&amp;S never showed up to the funeral. 

Fast forward 4 years with no contact with P&amp;S and again no interaction with E - she used to take the other two kids out as aunty E and spend time with them etc but never did for ours. 

I was taking a random look on a fake FB account and saw S profile as ‚Äúsingle‚Äù. First I knew about this so I emailed her straight away and asked wtf was going on. P&amp;S had separated as P had never lived his life and knew no different then S. ok this is nothing new to me I kinda knew it would happen S is P only ‚Äúlove‚Äù and still is to this day I believe. 

So me and S start emailing back and forth and over a few months we decided to meet up in public and see each other again with our kids. This was fine and nice. 

A few months later S tells me her and P are moving back in together and trying to work things out. About a month later S tells me she has this massive mass in her tummy and they don‚Äôt know what it is but they are going to remove it. 

They remove it and it‚Äôs not good. Turns out to be a rare soft tissue cancer. P&amp;S break up again as P couldn‚Äôt emotionally support S through this. 

S then starts seeing a new man when they get the news it‚Äôs terminal and they can‚Äôt do any more surgery‚Äôs. She then married him and they are still together now. She‚Äôs had chemo etc but she was just told that the chemo is not working anymore and her masses have grown. She is going to die. This cancer had a prospective shelf life of 5 years and I think we are up to year 4 now.

In the mean time E gets married and has a couple kids. We met up one Christmas etc and she still wouldn‚Äôt see the kids etc nothing had changed. 

So my question of all questions is the following. 

With the prospect of my now Ex SIL S likely to die in the next 12 months with things now slightly repaired in the aspect that we talk etc now why do I feel compelled to contact my other SIL E and try once again to sort things out with her. I have tried and tried and tried with this woman and it‚Äôs gotten me no where. 2015 I basically had to decide that I had to stop caring. It was doing me more damage than good and I simply just needed to stop. She‚Äôs not spent more than one hands worth of hours with my children and it‚Äôs been 2/3 years now that she once again went back to her old ways of ignoring us etc. 

My mind screams that this woman is just such a fudged up person it‚Äôs not worth my time or effort. But with the prospect that my own children are going to loose their only now decent aunty to cancer in the next 12 months is making me feel like I should do something.

121,"Hello guys, I come here to ask for help in this big confusing text, however sincere (I will cut details and be straight to the point to try to be brief).

A few weeks ago, I met a girl virtually, we talked normally, and in a few days, we were performing sexual acts over the internet together. However, in a few days of such, she started to mention things like love, marriage, etc., which bothered me a lot due to the speed of everything.

As I am an introvert, puffing out and talking has always been a problem, but I thought it was my duty to do that, so I went and opened myself up to her sincerely, said I didn't want to be the boring guy who pretends love to have sex or something , so I thought it best to stop because I really didn't want to hurt her or things like that.

Now the plotwist, her answer was based on 2 parts:

1- Praise me saying how good she felt with me saying that, being transparent and putting her first.

2- Admitting that she was emotional, and said those things from the chest out, and that I was not supposed to feel pressured by them, and that we could continue with the relationships casually if we both agree.

We have been keeping this way for about 2 months, however, I must admit that I was really attracted to her due to how she reacted to everything in a ""mature"" way, you know? I expected her angry or something.

In all this time, we have done much more than just these relationships, we watch movies, we are good friends and listen to each other. So I'm afraid to be creating a feeling alone, not knowing what she really feels for being ""emotional"" and always saying what she thinks.

Do you think I should tell her that I'm liking her sentimentally? Really?

Keep the relationship ""Casual"" keeping in mind that she can meet someone and everything will end overnight?

Or cut everything off now and avoid headaches?

&amp;#x200B;

PS: She lives 170km from here, far away, but closer than my ex that I used to visit.

PS 2: In the middle of conversations and acts, we always say things like ""Just do this to you"" and things about couples implying jealousy and exclusivity.

PS 3: We spent a good part of the day together, we talk since the morning until we go to sleep together.

124,"Im really concerned because my once responsible sister has gone off her rocker. She has fallen really deep into conspiracy theories and crazy shit like that. She had over 10,000 in bonds and she gave it to Scientologists a couple of years ago. She got out of that thank god but she keeps falling for the same ish. Pyramid schemes and things like that too. That was years ago but recently its been worse. 

She is always looking for male attention and it's embarrassing. She has no female friends. The friends we grew up with dont talk to her anymore because of her erratic behavior. Shes always picking fights with people on the internet. And she is an insanely jealous person to the point where she cries about the lives other people have and saying its not fair. Im talking she cries hysterically. In the same day she'll call other people ""haters"" for unfollowing her.

 To be honest her social media content is not that good and she tries too hard to impress other people. She begged all of my friends to follow her and then posts controversial things that honestly embarrass me. She recently posted about how toxic her family is... (we're not) and how she was spending thanksgiving traveling because of it. In the same week she was posting videos of us on her YT channel. If you dont like us and are open about it why post us and smile in our faces...

She also pretends shes a child on tiktok to get clout and makes false claims about famous people she does not know. Very defamatory things and alligations she got from conspiracy sites. Lastly, She says that COVID is not real  and is just so disrespectful about it. I am immunocompromised and we live together in a small apartment. She is continuously going out to her friends houses (Ive never heard her mention these people in my life)

I need help handling this. ANy advice is greatly appreciated. More triggering infor mation below.

I really like interacting with the residents but my problem comes with my coworkers. A. The two coworkers I clean with are extremely annoying, they won't stop arguing (Even well we're cleaning residents rooms and the residents are present) and one of the coworkers is highly critical of my work (Did you clean this, what about that) and even yelled at me one time well doing call lights! (She is significantly older than me) B. The workplace is extremely toxic, people gossip about each other all the time, and one time well with my coworker Tina and 2 other coworkers, one of my coworkers started  crying because she hated her job so much.

I really want to quit, I have anxiety every single day, and can't stop thinking of work. (Even though I only work four days a month) I wake up and go to bed with a feeling of dread. (I have never been diagnosed with anxiety or any other health condition) I feel like I'd be letting down Tina if I quit, and I feel like my family will look down on me if I quit a job after three months.

So Reddit, should I quit?

129,"Throwaway account to lessen my anxiety about even posting. To start it off I‚Äôm 21(f) originating from a Southeast Asia country to provide some context. I‚Äôve been raised in a very by the book traditional Christian household. When I was in my early teens, about 14 or so, we moved to the West where the values were clearly different to the ones I‚Äôve been raised with. 

My parents are insanely bigoted and they are very fixated on the idea that their religion is the ‚Äútrue‚Äù religion. Their religion has rules about not being able to celebrate Christmas, Easter, Halloween or any event with any religious context as it is considered to be blasphemous, being unable to have a relationship much less marry someone who isn‚Äôt of the same religion, no signs of the cross or anything of the sort, they are against homosexuality, or having a de facto partnership and other nitpicky details that they swear are based on the bible. If you are found to violate nay of those, they are fixated on the fact that you WILL be going to hell unless you repent by trying to correct your life and following all of the rules of the church according to their main figurehead whose instructions are something that get conveyed to the entirety of the religion. The religion is highly organised, and well managed which they do by having not only pastors but having normal members take on roles that have specific duties, such as finance or guarding. Reports are all circulated and redirected to the central office but each area has its own smallest districts that is managed by a certain amount of people before it gets forwarded to the main office. 

With all that in mind, I have continuously expressed that I did not want to be in the church. Ever since I was a teen, I found it hard to be ‚Äúobedient and subservient‚Äù (which they preach to do in order to attain enlightenment and salvation) to a god that they serve. I‚Äôve always kept it under the wraps and have pretended to be a believer throughout my relationship with my parents. I moved out of their house when I was 20, and have kept pretences up by attending services. 
However, I have found it tiring to even do that as of late as I do not believe in a single thing that is preached in their religion. I respect that they want to be part of it but I do not want to be. I have stopped attending for months now, and I was aware that somebody at some point will let them know that I have not attended recently as they have a detailed attendance of members. The church is very tightly knit and it‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say that everyone knows everyone in a certain area. Somebody called them today, and my parents are furious about the fact that I have been lying about it. Pretending that I was leaving their house after visiting in order to attend when I haven‚Äôt been a part of it at all.  I have a relationship with someone who isn‚Äôt part of their religion for nearly two years now, which they aren‚Äôt aware of. At some point they found out about my romantic relationship and they called one of the ministers to have a chat to me about it saying that I shouldn‚Äôt compromise my membership to heaven, I lied through my teeth to get through that. It was the cause of me leaving their house in the first place. My relationship with my parents are good if the whole ‚Äúreligion‚Äù aspect was excluded. I don‚Äôt know how to tell them that I don‚Äôt want to be a part of it, they are expressing their concern as they don‚Äôt want me to go to hell and think they‚Äôre all doing it for my sake but I don‚Äôt know how to tell them that even if I was going to hell which I don‚Äôt believe in and even if it was real, I don‚Äôt really mind at this point. Another factor that makes things a bit difficult is that, my parents who wholeheartedly believe all about this religion could possibly be expelled from their church if I were to leave that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been lying and trying to keep it down low. At this point I am not looking for a compromise that will make them happy, I just want them to know that I can‚Äôt be a part of it but I also don‚Äôt want them to drag into expulsion if they want to enjoy their religion. 

Sorry for the massive rant but any advice or similar past experiences would be of great help. Thank you",06Dec2020,1

133,"I've always been highly paranoid about being emotionally, verbally, psychologically abusive. I always feel like I've gone too far (even when I really haven't) and crossed some line if somebody doesn't react in an equally neutral / assertive way. 

Growing up was emotionally tough. But both my parents a doctors and gave my sibling and I an amazing house, education, vacations, experiences, they let us eat out, paid for everything (my gas, car, college, etc.) and continue to financially support me completely while away at college. I feel ridiculously complaining about anything about them because it registers to me and others as spoiled and ungrateful. I often keep lots of my thoughts to myself or feel guilty when I do share. I was tough kid too. I acted out, had trouble with emotional regulation and would often times get in trouble for being distracted in school. This would cause screaming matches between my parents and I, my mother giving me cold treatments from time to time, my father pulling me by the hair/ shirt collar up the stares, etc. I often times felt like I was abusing them. I took it out on my younger sister as well as she received much better treatment and was never really the point of contention in the house. 

While I feel like I was truly given everything materially / to set me up for success I often times feel like my parents never understood me emotionally / often times weren't very empathetic or were highly empathic. I struggled a lot in school due to ADHD and my dad always came in to save the day/ fix things. He was incredibly academically overbearing, would text/call me constantly. It often times felt like he was obsessed with making sure I got by / fixing my life. I don't blame him though, the older I've gotten the more I've realized how emotionally and verbally abusive his father can be. He's hysterical but also has zero regards for people boundaries physically, emotionally, etc. That has for sure rubbed off on my father and he's to some degree a people pleaser (my mom as well). Middle school is where I got extremely depressed (I was struggle with sexuality and gender at the time). My parents were extremely dismissive and very invalidating. The older I've gotten I realize they compartmentalize a lot, my sister too. Reflectively, my behavior middle through high school was pretty bad. I was self-centered, emotionally dumped a lot and expected a lot from my friends. I was undoubtedly toxic and codependent. Basically I don't feel like healthy love or relationship have ever really been modeled to me.

Things only vaguely shifted in college. However towards the end of my first year I was struggle to process aspects of my childhood, my senior year of HS (where I almost killed myself), the difficult of a college course load, abusing drugs, bad extremely cramped triple housing situation which I feel like I was partly emotionally abusive in (all of us were toxic though), and dating someone 6 years older than me. Within that relationship I also felt like reflectively I was abusive. I would constantly beg him to hangout, asked him when he was going to be home to hangout, if he was free, etc. Part of me Denys such because he was so much older/mature and he engaged in a lot of criminal behavior but part of me admits I should've walked away sooner

It wasn't until this year when I talked to a guy for about 8 months over quarantine and couldn't except the fact after we met up that he didn't have romantic/sexual feelings for me anymore (when prior it seemed like he did). We went NC for two months and when he came back around I asked if we could be more and he asked to be friends again for the third time. I'd always accepted friends but this time I told him how confused I had felt and that it made me upset it felt like we never got to address it. He told me that I needed to not emotionally dump on him, that he had set clear boundaries and that if I could subscribe to such I needed to unadd him again. I expressed how frustrated and denied emotionally I felt and that I didn't feel comfortable ""going back to normal"" if we didn't discuss aspects that made me feel upset/ uncomfortable from the past (which we never had talked about). He told me it wasn't the way things went down and that I needed to get over it. He then told me I was beginning to be ""a little emotionally abusive"" I was stunned and angry as I had felt used by him for awhile and was finally ready to admit such. He ended up blocking me before I could respond. And for the past couple days I've been sitting with such.

Maybe I am the abusive person, I'm the constant here, I've worried/thought about it before, I've obsessively read about emotionally abuse and feel like maybe I've entered certain territory but I also feel like maybe he had but that could easily be HEAVY denial and projection. My therapist is on my side but I remained unconvinced. I don't feel like I can talk to my friends about the situation and am scared to. The accusation has weighed heavily on my mind and I either want to address my truth and move forward or get to the bottom of things. I've read HUNDREDS of psychology texts, articles, forums, etc to try and be the best person I can and reparent myself. I ruminate and self reflect constantly and always try to prove my thoughts wrong (on either side). I feel doomed to be who I am regardless of what I try. I also know I severely lack boundaries to some degree but also can be assertive.",06Dec2020,1

136,"I (16F) got my phone the summer after 5th grade. Same with my younger sister (B - 14F). Our youngest sister (G - 11F) is currently in 5th grade and she got her phone during quarantine.

Needless to say, B and I are *pissed*.

Our parents say it's because they have an extra phone around now and they didn't when B and I were at that age, but that was at no point the case. B and I both only got phones because we were going into middle school. Even then, there were different circumstances for both of us. I got mine around the start of summer vacation, B had to wait until closer to the start of the school year because of her grades.

My specific circumstances were a bit more complicated. We're in an upper-middle class area, so kids in my class were getting phones when they were still in elementary school, I believe right around the time smartphones started getting popular. I was really upset that my parents wouldn't let me get a phone when it seemed like everyone else had them. I now understand it was partially my age (I was like 8 yrs. old - 11 yrs. old. during this) but it was the way they explained it to me that fucked with me so bad. I was a gifted kid - never had to try in school, pretty mature for my age, etc. You get the idea. My parents talked up my maturity a lot - ""You're so grown up!"" or ""You're so responsible/mature for your age!"" However, I guess I spoke about wanting electronics too much and at some point I guess I got annoying enough for them to give up on, ""You don't need a phone at this age,"" and start basically blaming me. ""You're not old enough."" ""You're too little (God how I hated this one)."" ""You're not mature enough."" ""It's too much responsibility/you're not responsible enough."" You can see how this would absolutely crush me as being seen as ""grown up"" was super important to me.

And besides that, I'm pretty sure they never planned on getting me a phone until I was in high school or something. I was a kid, so of course a big part of my argument was, ""But *everyone* *else* has one!"" Obviously they never believed me, but then my dad chaperoned one of my field trips and told my mom when we got back that every other kid did, in fact, have a cellphone. That was it. That was the driving reason they broke down and got me one after 5th grade.

But also, now that I'm older, my parents are starting to clue me in on a few things, mainly that we're not as well off as a lot of people in our town. Not poor, but certainly not wealthy. It makes sense too - staycations, thrift store clothes (wouldn't trade that for the world though - it's like treasure hunting), doing a few home projects ourselves that most would probably hire others to do. I understand that they probably didn't want to burden me with worrying about our finances when I was barely in double digits, but I think it would've been better for them to tell me, ""We can't afford that right now,"" than to use my sense of maturity and responsibility against me.

I'm worried that I'm just being a bitch for still being upset about this even though it still affects me (sometimes have trouble with feeling like I'm not good enough), and if I'm not, I really want to bring this up to my parents but I'm worried they might try to gaslight me and say that everything I mentioned here never happened. Even if they didn't, what would be the point? They take G's phone away until school ends? She'd never forgive us for that, there would be no winners here.

How do I deal with this?",06Dec2020,1

139,"Hello, again. 

I tend to ramble so I will make this as concise as I can. A woman lied about me sexually assaulting her and it resulted in my expulsion from a church-based university in Utah. To be a student at this school, one has to follow all of the same guidelines of any other university. The chief difference that sets this school apart from most other public schools is the mandate to follow a code of conduct that includes: a full ecclesiastical endorsement by a religious leader, no drinking, no smoking, no sex or anything sexual (all things included), and to attend church regularly. At any point this student conduct office can determine a student unfit to continue their education and pursue anything from temporary suspension to expulsion. In my case, I was expelled for sexual misconduct and lying that any such activities had been going on. I did this because I was in defense-mode with a girl reporting that I man-handled her and attempted rape when no such things occurred in our short time knowing each other. In all fairness, I did have a FWB relationship with another woman where we had regular sex so I guess I got what I deserved... until: 

That aside, I'll call the administrator of the Student Honor Office that reviewed things with me, 'Dick'. I do not feel that Dick let me represent myself well in the trial. There was absolutely no evidence that what this girl said occurred so the police she reported to were out, the Title IX Office of my school acknowledged that there was insufficient evidence so they were out, so the SHO was the last option for HER to fuck ME. Since it DID NOT happen, I thought I would be in the clear. However, it turned out that after 2 weeks of being worried sick that my last three months of very challenging coursework would be all for nothing, Dick had a phone-call recording of me talking to this girl saying a couple of ""concerning things"". According to him, I inadvertently admitted to having sexual relations with different girls and breached the Honor Code. He would not tell me anything more than he had to and I felt caught between a rock and a hard place and my amygdala was on fire. In the recording, this girl got me to STUPIDLY admit that I did indeed have plenty of experience with other women and that none of them ever treated me the way she is (especially one I never slept with) because I rejected her. Dick asked me if I use condoms and I STUPIDLY dodged the question and he caught me in the recorded lie and I said ""YES, OF COURSE, YOU ASS!"" hearing this, he smiled for the first time talking to me in the most malevolent, wide, shit-eating grin that lasted but a few moments. I didn't say anything because I wanted to keep my cool, but I knew I was fucked. It turned out that earlier that morning his council of colleagues had already unanimously decided I am to be expelled for ""unsolicited sexual misconduct and consistent dishonesty in the investigation"" (AGAINST ME!). This is on my permanent academic transcript/record and after 2.5 years of busting my ass, this end makes me want to send an inconsequential hate email to this asshole expressing my disdain and pure hatred of someone who only pretended to be genuine before revealing his true emotions about this whole thing. To add context, I've had 2 weeks to think about all of this in the aftermath. 

TLDR: Should anyone send a hate-email to someone if they know it will make them feel better; knowing that it will be inconsequential? (Dick can do no more to me now).

I feel so guilty and I can‚Äôt pay her back because I am a student and can‚Äôt afford anything. They were very expensive and my dad gifted them to her.

I had forgotten about it for a little while but then I saw my mom taking the broken earphones and I heard her asking my dad if they can be fixed, then I heard him say that I‚Äôm stupid for breaking them. It was like my heart shattered knowing that she still thinks about them and wants them fixed.

This might be such a foolish thing to ask advice about, but I feel so bad about it and I cry because of it every night. I feel so stupid and should‚Äôve probably forgotten about it, but I can‚Äôt. Maybe I just made this post to get it off my chest, I don‚Äôt know.",06Dec2020,1
157,"Okay, I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible but there is a lot of background details that go along with it. So firstly, about two weeks ago my mom had asked if I wanted to take the PSAT through my school because they just started to offer it again. I had already taken it through a different company, but then she ultimately convinced me to take it since this is the official one and would be good practice before my official one. She originally texted me this, but I had replied to her verbally the next day because I had forgotten and to which she responded, ""okay I'll go sign you up right now."" Then yesterday, I got a text in a group chat with my mom and sister asking if either of us made bacon. I said yes and she said use parchment paper because it's hard to clean. I do admit my response is just me being bratty for no reason but she always tells me things after the fact and is passive aggressive with her commands. So I responded ""ok you should've told me that earlier then??"" Because my mom often tells me to do things when it's too late and she has the ability to be mad, and especially since I make bacon at least once a week, so it would've made a lot of sense to tell me before I possibly made it next. And she replied ""I've told you before."" I said ""Nope bc if you did I would've used it,"" which is extremely true because I am very responsible, and my mom knows that. And she said I am forgetful, but she only says that because I can't remember things that happened when I was like 2-6 years old, which is completely normal? How am I supposed to remember that. So then I said how can she call me forgetful when she couldn't even remember that I verbally told her I want to take the PSAT at school. Then she again, denied that ever happened. And this all happened over text so I went downstairs and I was just slightly raising my tone at first asking why she can never admit she's wrong because I know for a fact the PSAT conversation happened, and I would've used parchment paper if she told me because I don't just forget important things like that. Basically that's what we argued about and I did begin to yell at her because my mom has a known problem for never admitting she's wrong and insisting she's right on everything even in situations when you disprove her with actual evidence. Anyway, since I was yelling, she got mad and said I need to respect her and my Dad more. To anyone who is thinking I'm crossing the line by yelling, which I did in a sense because it was over two really small things, my parents treat my sister and I as equals and we try to have actual discussions instead of my parents being authoritarian.  So back to my parents, of course I respect them, and they are crazy to think I don't. I'll admit, I have had a bad relationship for basically half of my life, because as I've grown up I've realized how temper-mental and hypocritical he is. And I've tried so hard to be nothing like that. And the cherry on top of that is that in this past election is that he voted for Trump!! And I have had so many conversations with him beforehand about social and political issues where it seemed that he actual listened, but clearly he didn't and he only voted for Trump because of the ""economy"" even though we're a lower middle class family. But that is a whole other story. So that's why I've been especially stand offish. And I also dislike my sister a lot because of past trauma she has caused me, but again, a whole other story. So that's why my family thinks I'm just mad at the world for no reason, when in reality they just don't take into account anything I feel. So ANYWAY. I just protested against my mom saying I do respect them and it just got really heated and the most she would admit was ""I'll admit that in your perspective I am wrong."" Which is just totally petty and was meant to make me even more mad. And when I'm angry I always cry just out of anger so I started crying and went to my room. Later, she came in my room and finally admitted she remembered that I had told her verbally I wanted to take the PSAT. But since I was still angry and resentful, I just got upset again and said ""how can you admit that after all of this even though I admitted I am probably wrong about the whole parchment paper situation?"" She said she had to think about it and asked why I'm always so angry. Which isn't true, sometimes I say things in completely normal tones, and my mom just takes it as an annoyed tone for no reason? I swear moms are so dramatic sometimes. And I just responded ""well you never admit you're wrong and Dad's a racist."" And she got so mad at that statement that she just left my room. She will never admit that her and my dad have extreme internalized racism. So ever since, my mom hasn't talked to me. It's only been a day but at dinner tonight, she waited until I finished and went upstairs for her to go down and eat. Like shouldn't I, the annoying teenager, be the one to be pulling petty things like that? For a moment I felt bad, because I didn't really accept her admitting she's wrong last night and thought about waking up early tomorrow to get her flowers, chocolate, and an apology card. But then there's also a part of me that has pride and knows she is being partly dramatic, (I know I am too), and should work on feeling the need to be right all the time instead of being a grumpy old woman. So basically what I am asking is, what should I do? Should I wake up early tomorrow like I planned? Let it blow over and keep my pride, and it like it most likely will, but that might take a little while... feel free to analyze the argument, and you can be critical of me but not too harsh I'm already in an emotional state.",06Dec2020,1

I just got home from college where my parents have had little to no oversight about my activities and feel like this short trip should not be an issue as I'm a pretty responsible kid. I'm 18 and don't really need their permission to go, but out of respect to them and because I am currently staying with them, was planning to ask for their blessing to go.

161,"Over the summer, I met this girl online. (Yes, she was real) There was a pretty big red flag right off the bat in that she and her boyfriend had just broken up the week prior, but I didn‚Äôt acknowledge it. We met and almost immediately clicked and flirted pretty heavily. We talked for like half the day everyday and eventually confessed feelings for one another and planned on meeting in-person as soon as covid permitted (it was a pretty reasonable distance between us) Then about 4 weeks in, she dropped everything out of nowhere because her ex messaged her apologizing. 

I know it‚Äôs pretty pathetic to fall for a girl online, even moreso that I'm still kinda obsessed without even meeting her in person officially. Maybe it's because she was the first person who ever appeared to be into me and wanted to do things. It‚Äôs been like 5 months and I still keep thinking about her. Still 5 months after, it keeps me up at night pretty regularly and kills my mood. I‚Äôm not sure why I care so much about someone who basically lied about liking me to forget about her ex, but I do.

Its been almost a year and still not over my guy friend we use to date but it didn't work out he told me he didn't want anything serious.I stopped talking to him for 6 months.We reconnected again because he happen to be at the same job orientation as me.Later I come to find out he told me he actually did like me and that he felt lost with the whole situation.It was my fault for not being clear on what I wanted.

Fast forward 2 months after we reconnected we've been good friends I felt like I could get over him now but I was so wrong lately I find myself thinking about him,some days it feels like I'm definitely over him and then I revert back to the former state of liking him,It makes me feel sad because I really do value the friendship he's kind and willing to help me with dropping me off at work he always seems to willing to help me ,but I think its just in his nature to do that.I know he has attraction towards me he's called me beautiful and cute. I also see he's always willing to make time for me when ever something comes up that he can't make it  he let's me know.But I think he just sees me as a friend at the end of it all.I don't want to get the wrong idea.

My partner is a college student while I'm a dropout, I've spent most of my time since then learning video-editing programs and photo editing software. My partner is studying in a field that teaches those skills, but most of what I've seen her learn is stuff you could easily do in movie maker - transitions between media, overlaying text, etc. The most complicated thing I've seen her do is 2D-Animate something in Visual Effects - which is a great skill, but it was never pushed past that and they went right back to the basic things. She doesn't spend any time cultivating these skills outside of her assignments and it breaks my heart to see her get ready to apply for jobs and knowing what's going to happen.  


How do I convince my girlfriend that in order to get job in editing marketing material for big companies like she dreams, she'll need more than basic knowledge to get there, and the drive to cultivate her skills outside of school? Maybe there's a fun website that teaches these skills idk...  
Or better yet &amp; hoping I'm wrong, convince me that companies actually don't care about that sort of thing and will hire whoever they can hire for cheap... I guess? Or maybe companies are willing to let someone learn on the job, idk

175,"So growing up, even though I am the baby of my family of 4 (parents divorced when I was 14), I was labeled as the ‚Äúlevel-headed peacemaker‚Äù of the family. This included many things, such as pushing my emotions/mental health to the side to focus on family member who ‚Äúneeded the attention more‚Äù, pigeon aka message deliverer (tell your mom this, tell your dad that, tell your sister this, tell mom and dad that, etc.) , middle man of every fight (90% not even part of it), and just any way to drag a neutral person into the middle of anything. I have struggled with depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts since I was as young as 10 years old; but even growing up, my sisters mental health was taken seriously and my parents thought i was ‚Äújust copying her and mines not real‚Äù.

She left and got married at 18, was married for 4-5 years (i can‚Äôt remember) and had two kids with my ex BIL; then she ran off with a guy we knew from when we were younger (met him through my bf at the time) and that‚Äôs when her life went to shit. He‚Äôs a manipulative narcissist who basically killed his old gf cause she ODed; he was proven innocent since he didn‚Äôt give her the drugs (technically) but he still served jail time and was registered as a felon. He was already from a heavy drug family and my sister already struggled with addiction (my mom and dad struggled with alcoholism and so did she also weed and pills etc etc) so they both toxically dated and did drugs together. 

(This is my moms old house that she let me live in by myself after she left to move in with her now husband when i was 21, so it‚Äôs technically my house but i consider it both me and my sisters) When this first started happening, I kept telling my parents something was wrong; he practically moved in even though he wasn‚Äôt supposed to, he let his whole family move in and they brought roaches (took a couple years to get rid of them but i finally cleared them 100%) and it was horrible. Unfortunately, my mom only bitched and told me that I HAD TO get rid of them; my dad said ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs not my house (it‚Äôs not but i wanted legal help ) but just let them stay no harm‚Äù and it got WORSE. AND WORSE. AND WORSE. so bad that I‚Äôd wake up and random strangers were in my house and i feared going to work because i thought maybe they would steal my stuff (they did some stuff) or my dogs (i have an English bulldog and husky) and i would lock my bedroom door so they couldn‚Äôt come up and hide my pills (prescription), keys, clothes, etc. i felt unsafe in my own home. Finally one week my mom brings me and my stepsister, along with my stepdad (they still weren‚Äôt married yet but they were engaged) to Hawaii for a week; this is around the time my sister and her ex would sleep for 16 hours a day and they locked the door so i couldn‚Äôt get in and she had no clue i even left until 4 days later. Well when i get back from Hawaii, i get home and my sister looked like she aged 20 years and looked 100% different; scabs, jittery demeanor, etc. she was FUCKED. UP. so i grabbed my dog luffy (i picked him up from boarding same day) and went to my dad.  He was watching Lucy since she‚Äôs older and does better at his house; as soon as i got there i broke down and cried. It scared me seeing how drugs can change a person dramatically, and that‚Äôs when my parents finally decided to care; of course it came with a price, cause they blamed me at first because ‚Äúyou weren‚Äôt looking for the signs‚Äù (yeah shitty right?) so once she was caught they forced her to take drug test and she had a shit ton of drugs in her system. Retaliation? Her and her ex packed up as much shit as they could into my sisters car and drove to PA where his drug head sister lived so they could ‚Äústart a new life‚Äù 


That was in 2016, and they lived there; she had two kids with him recently, and they were so bad off drugs the kids got taken away by CYS and ex‚Äôs mom took them with her to Texas. They were doing meth almost every day, although if you ask my sister she only did it for ‚Äú2 months‚Äù (her teeth say otherwise). Suddenly in July of this year, she calls me and claims she is dying and knows she is about to die; calls my mom and dad and says the same so they pay for her way down here. Soon as she got here? Suddenly not dying anymore, asking for money, a car, etc. so we ignore her until almost august when she begs my ex BIL (he came to let my oldest niece and nephew see her) to take her away from the ex and bring her to rehab. So me and my ex BIL bring her to rehab and she was in for 4 1/2 months. 

Fast forward to this past Monday (11/30) my mom and stepdad bring her home; she looks and sounds so healthy, happy to be out, she cleans and keeps herself busy tells me i don‚Äôt have to worry  about hiding the liquor, etc etc. then this is when the emotions start to fly: any time something bad happened or it didn‚Äôt go her way, mostly from being impatient, Sabotage happened: 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs moms/dads/your fault! You are the reason why i turned to drugs‚Äù etc etc etc. ‚Äúi should‚Äôve never went to rehab it was a waste i want my life back‚Äù etc etc. 

And then, just with a snap of fingers:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all my fault. You and mom and dad helped me i love you all so much thank you so much! (The ex) he was so toxic and i don‚Äôt love him!‚Äù Etc etc etc 

I tell my mom and dad she tried to fight me on Wednesday (I‚Äôm much much MUCH stronger than her and she got into my wine and was hammered) what do they say? 

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you let her drink?‚Äù (I was at work...) 

Every day this week she has talked shit about how my family hates her we don‚Äôt do shit for her no one supports her (all the money we spent, all the rides I‚Äôve given her, my food my clothes etc etc) talking about how her friends are the best for her how the ex was the best compared to her etc etc 


I tell my family: 

‚ÄúThis is too much to handle you take care of it‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh we can‚Äôt bring you to celebrate your graduation (2020 bachelors) cause your sister needs help‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh we can‚Äôt _____ cause your sister‚Äù 

As i said before this is nothing new but I‚Äôm about sick of it. Now she left with her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to the casino and she has pending warrants from PA (ironically that were set in July 2020) and if she gets caught by police she‚Äôs FUCKED. i didn‚Äôt even tell my parents cause i know they‚Äôll blame me for letting her go (i told her i didn‚Äôt want her to she basically told me to fuck off she can do what she wants) 


What should i do? I‚Äôm so lost and it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs taking an even bigger emotional toll than ever.

Regardless, i like her anyway. 

Im not social at all i can be but i had a reallly shit 2019/2020 i basically lost everyone and dont really trust people at all. So its painful to open up and be vunerable but at the same time thats exactly what shes doing and im making it harder on her than it has to be.

There was a lot of screaming, fighting, tears, and punishments growing up, but I'd like to make clear no closed fist beatings (just slaps and the norm) or sexual abuse in ANY way. 

Coming to college and sharing ""wacky stories about growing up that I thought a lot of people could relate to"" ended up leaving a lot of friends uncomfortable.

It‚Äôs been especially hard since he works basically a 10 hour shift (only has one more week left of this), it‚Äôs remote but he‚Äôs on the phone all the time and barely has time for me. Which is understandable since it‚Äôs work - but point being there‚Äôs no time for us. After he gets off, he‚Äôs exhausted and goes to bed. My sleep schedule is messed up, and I don‚Äôt go to bed til late late (4-5am). 

Idk, I‚Äôve also been really sensitive lately and it‚Äôs in a negative way. I just want to be a better partner to him. He‚Äôs told me he doesn‚Äôt feel heard in our relationship anymore, and even though I portrayed I was angry about it - deep down I was truly heartbroken about it. When he wants to speak up about a topic that he‚Äôs insecure about I tell him to basically save it for later (there is no later). 

I‚Äôm doing better in letting him feel heard, but what are some other things to do to show how much I love him? How much he means to me? I know he tries really hard.. I just want to show him I can do the same. I just feel so weak right now. 

tl;dr I am making my relationship with my boyfriend harder than it should be but I can‚Äôt find myself to stop and need advice to be a better partner and a better listener",06Dec2020,1

191,"Hi I‚Äôm a 17f and well I live in a house with my mom,dad, and two younger sisters.

The middle is 16 youngest is 7.

Anyway all my life my mom and dad have done this thing where they live with each other for a year or two then move out away from each other only to move back in with each other again.

They do this over and over again I had lost so much because of this, this is the reason I‚Äôm scared of change because it always happens.

We always end up having to go with our mother and wel because she doesn‚Äôt make money we had to get rid of the cats we originally had the time they moved in together when my youngest sister was born.

Okay so my mom and dad both lived with there parents until two years ago they decided to move into this side by side (most of my moms side of the family lives or has lived there we ended up moving a few streets down from my Baba and Grampi)

We got two new cats now as well which is awesome. 

Okay so my mom will not work idk why she just always finds excuses to not work so my dad buys everything.


My dad he has adhd and he gets angry so quickly etc he did hit a couple times but has since fixed it by going on weed he smokes so much.

Recently he‚Äôs started drinking every weekend my mom hates it she doesn‚Äôt want him to become an alcoholic as well because we are already tight on money.

And now they are fighting again my moms already talking about moving but I really don‚Äôt want to I thought we finally could settle down I don‚Äôt wanna lose my cats ether I‚Äôve worked so hard for them.

A thrift store find. It probably looked better her anyway. 

Fast forward, 10 years later... Haven't talked since... I pop into her Instagram live... 6 people watching... Big broadcast. I'm number 7. She says my name.. She knows I'm in there. I start typing some comments.. I mean, maybe there's another chance to be had... The sex was good. He friend goes... Who's he.. She responds ‚Äùsome guy I fucked when I was 18.

195,"I  have a group of close friends, there's 8 of us in total. Over the past  few years people have been getting into relationships and such, which is  totally cool. All of my close friends have been branching off and I see  and talk to them less and less. I've known most of these people since I  was 5 years old. It's at the point where nobody asks if I want to hang  out. I only ever see them / play games with them if I initiate the  conversation.

I always known that  groups of friends grow apart, but now I feel so alone. Everyone has gone  onto different things. I get too anxious to text someone if they want  to do anything because I always feel like I might be annoying them.

The  worst part (imo) is that I'm often seen as the ""dad"" of the group. I'm  always there for any of them, and I have a good personal relationship  with each of the guys. It just feels like I don't get that in return.  I've don't believe that I have depression, but it feels like it's around  the corner.

I spend most of my free time either playing guitar, or getting lost somewhere on a drive. I'm not much of a lone wolf.

I  want to be able to make new friends to help fill my time and make new  connections, but I suck at it. I don't go to college, or anywhere that I  could meet anyone. Where should I go from here? How can I help myself  get out of this rut?",06Dec2020,1
196,"Hey guys! I'm hoping to get some advice on a little situation I am finding myself having to address.  

I'll try to make it short and sweet: 

-childhood friend (20 years) and I decide we should date. 
-she is notorious for cheating and this carries on into our relationship. (who would have thunk it?)#
-she cheats,  I get mad, take her back, she cheats again, a whole bunch of crazy stuff happens etc etc. You get the picture; we're both a little unhinged. 
-almost inevitably,  she winds up pregnant (definitely not mine).

Now, she wants me to attend the labor/delivery which is obviously pretty far down on the list of things I want to be doing with my time but, since I've known her forever I feel bad saying no and this was sprung on me last minute so I'd just feel terrible if she couldn't find someone else. She is also mentioning bringing the baby to stay at my place for a few days after so I can help out. (I don't know if I mentioned this but we are not together and haven't been for some time now, nor do I want to be together.) 

My questions are: 

How can I be a positive support in the delivery room? She is being induced Monday so I'm trying to just gather as much information as possible before then. 

How can I maintain boundaries within our ""friendship "" while still being supportive to her in this journey she is on? 

Is it an awful idea to have her stay here? I don't know if she just genuinely wants to be here and have my help or if she's just kind of trying to pass the buck or lure me in...l know, I sound paranoid. 

Ultimately, I want the best for this baby and know that I can be a good support to them but I don't know how to navigate the situation with my ex in a way that is appropriate and fair for everyone involved.

Hello, I am a 15m and I have 2 parents which have been divorced for years, my dad moving to a small town(s) near my home town(h) with step-mom. My mom living in (h) with her new wife, my sister and my brother. I currently live with my mom that has rheumatoid arthritis (joints hurt constantly), a sister who stays home and plays video games all day, a brother who tries to boss me around trying to be my father figure (asked him multiple times to stop trying to replace my dad but to no avial), a racist, sexist neckbeard. I am the baby of the family and most importantly I am my mom's baby. My dad lives in a small town with his wife and 4 kids, 2 are out of the house and the other 2 are in High school.  


-Enough background information now to the point-
I am writing this post because I am asking for advice if I should leave my home town to live with my dad. Let me place the pros and cons. In my dad's house I feels so much more free, It will be in a small town which I have always dreamed of, I feel like I connect with my dad more, and overall I KNOW I will be more happy than with my mom in my home town( I go with him on the weekends, and I never want to come home).The downsides of it would be I would leave my mom (her baby would be leaving her to go live an hour away), I would be leaving my school and every thing behind. The only reason in still their is for 2 reasons. I'm still getting my permit which I will be down with the qualifications to get my license early February, and I'm just not sure if it's the right moce for my life. 2nd I'm scared it's just the heat of the moment, I have my mom and dad's anger( the anger is more prominent in my mothers household than my dad's) , I love taking risks, and I've been known to do things without thinking about the end result. But I've thought long and hard about this and I think it's the right move. I just need some advice. Should I go live with my dad, or stay in my home town with my mom?",06Dec2020,1

208,"I (F16) live in GA, and today Trump held a rally in our state. My conservative Chinese parents LOVE him, so my dad and a group of his friends drove down to Valdosta to attend. I was already worried because it would be crowded and rural Southerners tend not to care about COVID precautions. While my parents thought it would be perfectly fine, I asked a bunch of my friends (who have parents in the medical field) on how he could stay safe at the rally. The best I could do is get him to wear three masks layered on top of each other, have him wear outerwear that would later be disinfected, and glasses.

That brings me to right now. I recently had an argument with my mom about the severity of COVID, and she told me I was being annoying for wanting to disinfect the things my dad touches, and getting him to sleep (and live) in a separate room from everybody else for a bit. Granted, we don't have a spare bedroom, so I don't know where he would sleep or work if my mom occupies the same space. Also, I wouldn't be writing this post if I knew he would get tested, but my parents have implied that he doesn't need to get tested. 

When I say they're not worried about this, they *are not worried.* They believe that the severity of COVID was blown out of proportion by Fauci for political reasons, and a whole bunch of other conspiracy theories about the illness that have been touted by Mr. Trump himself lmao.

What should I do, on top of the precautions I'm already planning to take? My current plan is to stay in my room for two weeks (just in case) with the window cracked open a bit to let air out. I've also brought some food (all packaged, so no ants) and am generally planning to chill in here until I think it's safe. I'm just worried because my mom doesn't see a problem with hanging around my dad, so mealtimes could get complicated unless I'm planning to subsist on fruit snacks and Chinese fish tofu lol. 

Finally, is there anything I could say to make them actually take this situation seriously so that my brother and I don't get infected? My parents like to pretend to take my advice or listen to my opinions, but I can always hear them whispering in Chinese about how I'm misguided haha. Thank you in advance :)",06Dec2020,1

210,"So my mom is really, really, sick. She has extreme anxiety, depression, and a few other physical diseases that cause her chronic pain. 

It used to not be as bad, until a few years ago at her job she met this guy, let‚Äôs just call him D. My mom said that she had migraines that hurt her head and so he left her a red solo cup of opioids on her desk the next day. She took them, and thought not much of it. They helped, but the effect wore off. She wanted more, he gave her more. She didn‚Äôt pay him, and there‚Äôs a reason for that.

My mother is very beautiful. My friends at school actually thought she was my older sister, that she was a model, etc. (she actually used to be a model, but then quit) D is one of the ugliest people I have ever seen. He is a 50 y/o that lived in a gross house with roommates. D thought that if he got her addicted to his pills, that she would be reliant on him to give her more, and he would be in a relationship through that addiction. 

His plan worked.... kinda.

Fast forward to 2018. She is really addicted, but doesn‚Äôt like him sexually at all. But no man wants a woman that has a weird creepy 50 year old guy hanging around her, so in a way, he got her all to himself. She realizes that this is harmful so she gets off of this medicine and gets something new from her doctor. 

Now let‚Äôs talk about my relationship with my mom. I‚Äôm an only child, my dad was abusive to both of us and then left, and so I am VERY close to my mom. We are like best friends. But she gets in this mode that we call ‚Äúhulk mom‚Äù. She won‚Äôt remember anything, she will kick, punch, shove, and beat me if I dare breathe the wrong way. I do everything in my power to help her, and I love her to the moon and back times a million. 
She is funny, kind, sweet, and caring when she‚Äôs in her normal mode. 

Now it‚Äôs 2020. Mom lost her job due to Mrs. Rona, but at least she‚Äôs not addicted to anything. The new medicine calms her pain but also makes her gain weight. Her self esteem plummets. 

(I would also like to note that in 2019 she remodeled D‚Äôs father‚Äôs house with her own money expecting to get paid back, and never got paid back and the cops did nothing. We lost a LOTTTTTT of money renovating that house and getting nothing back)

So now my mom has a crappy retail job working at a furniture store even though she went to college and has multiple degrees and used to work for the government, she can‚Äôt get a better job. 

I could probpably call the cops and put her in jail for everything that Hulk mom has done, and D still comes around expecting free food, shelter, clean clothes, and support. 


So in short:
There are SO many details I am leaving out, but D is a douche, im trying to get good grades and be a good kid, and my mom sometimes beats and screams at me, and sometimes is a sweetheart the next. (Hulk mom has been more common recently)

We have talked about this and we don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm getting gaslighted all of the time, and I feel like I can‚Äôt take it anymore. My mom keeps saying she‚Äôs gonna kill herself, I have had 3 suicide attempts, and nobody else really knows what‚Äôs happening.

215,"It's not that I want to dress super out of the ordinary. This period of working from home and quarantine has really made me realize how before, I dressed in certain things because I wanted others to think of me a certain way, not be too noticeable, just fit in, go with the general trends, etc.

It's made me see how I used to just dress for others, and how when I wore those outfits, how *aware* I was of what I was wearing: constantly adjusting my clothes, looking in reflections to make sure things were all good, things feeling sort of uncomfortable, etc. But now, being mostly by myself every day, I've been thinking: How do I want to dress for myself? What makes me feel good?

I've noticed that I love layers, and I love dresses. I have been trying to live a more sustainable lifestyle the last few years and I've gravitated towards more natural materials like wool in the winter and linen in summer. I've realized that all I really want and need is a few cotton denim jeans, wool sweaters/jackets, and linen dresses, along with some cotton underlayers.

The dresses I like aren't ""matronly"" or ugly or out of fashion, more just classic and maybe a little plain. But a few people have remarked that I look like a Mennonite (which isn't necessarily bad, I'm just...not a Mennonite) and it sort of evoked that subconscious desire I used to have to dress a certain way just so people wouldn't comment or so I could fit in. But I really like these classic, pretty, versatile linen dresses that won't ever really go out of style, are good quality and will last for years, and go with everything else I own.

I guess I'm just sort of tugging back and forth between dressing in a way that makes me feel beautiful and confident but also worrying about what people think of me if I do, because knowing people think I look like a Mennonite or Anne of Green Gables, like I'm wearing a costume, sort of knocks down that confidence I initially had in those clothes.

 The area I live in is pretty urban too and dominated by people who wear a lot of trends and brand names, and I feel like in these clothes, I stick out like a sore thumb. Any advice on how to care a little less? Or how to have the confidence to dress this way anyway?",06Dec2020,1

225,"Was i trolled on Omegle by somebody using ‚ÄúManyCam.com‚Äù 

First post on Reddit but Okay so hear me out. I know none of you can give me a definite answer, but i want to hear your thoughts on it. I was on Omegle with my friend, and this ‚Äúgirl‚Äù popped up but at the bottom of the cam it said ‚ÄúManyCam.Com.‚Äù The ‚Äúgirl‚Äù in the cam already knew what she was doing cause she had her cleavage all in the camera. She said she‚Äôd do more things if we showed something. Obviously the idiot i am, i did. The weird thing is she started undressing as soon as i did what she asked us to do and was texting in the chat like a real person. After i was ‚Äúdone‚Äù i disconnected  immediately so I‚Äôm not sure if it was a troll or not. Or even somebody trying to blackmail me. So was it really a fake cam or was it a real person? I haven‚Äôt been banned from Omegle or anything but I‚Äôm just really scared I‚Äôm going to be tracked or something for doing something so stupid. I never said my age or anything or told them any information. But I‚Äôm also scared they got my IP address. The anxiety has literally been killing me these past couple days. Are all the ‚ÄúManyCam.Com‚Äù cams fake cams with somebody just trolling? Or could it be a real person in the cam? Just need some clarification cause i can‚Äôt even think straight.

In October I got to meet her at a small gathering; me, my cousin, and his gf sat and talked. Right off the bat I noticed that she had scissor marks on her wrist. Then she started joking how she‚Äôs so unhappy with her looks and she‚Äôs always been depressed about it. During other parts of the conversation she would swear a ton.

I was like that‚Äôs cool why do you want to be that, and she said she liked math, and she then said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really good at it tho‚Äù. I just let it go. Later the gathering was over and she said that she wanted to tell my cousins parents that they were dating, and I watched. It didn‚Äôt go well.

228,"Hi Reddit. I want to find a way to help my friend M(20F). 

M has been mistreated for much of her life. Her parents kicked her out, her mentally ill ex of several years cheated on her multiple times and has physically abused her as well. Her current boyfriend, who‚Äôs parents‚Äô house she‚Äôs staying at, is also emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. 

One difficult thing (other than M being of age of course) is that she defends her abusers. Having grown up apologizing for the behaviors of my own parents, I can understand where this comes from. But she‚Äôs expressed to me a few times that she does need a better place to stay because she has bills to pay and a valuable engineering degree to pursue. 

The next problem is COVID. My state‚Äôs restrictions are a huge barrier, mental and otherwise, to M‚Äôs ability to find another place. Her apologies on behalf of her abusers (sometimes I wonder if it‚Äôs Stockholm syndrome) mean she‚Äôs not really trying that hard to get out. 

The only thing I can think of is asking my own parents ‚Äî a real bag of fun on their own ‚Äî to take her in while she gains her footing. She‚Äôs told me not to worry. 

Is there something I can do? I‚Äôm really worried for her safety, but my hands seem tied. I have no money to speak of, I have few friends and none can help, and I‚Äôm staying with my parents during COVID. 

Any help or ideas are immensely appreciated.

i am in middle school and have this irrational fear of growing up. this isn't a new thing though, i have been acting like this since i was 6-7ish.

Whenever i talk to my parents about it they are always like ""oh you have plenty of time"" but that's no help. I like shows on cartoon network and nickelodeon, playing on the swings at the local park etc. I thought those were normal 12 yr old activities, but whenever i try to bring it up in conversation with peers, everyone always says the same thing: ""yOu stIlL wAtcH sPonGeBOb?"" yes, [Adalynne](https://nameberry.com/userlist/view/61001) i do

that isn't the only thing though. Whenever someone brings up something nosalgic, i have to hold back tears. Don't know why though.

I finished mandatory school at 16 and haven't stopped studying since. The problem is that I never finish a course, I try to pick things I'm passionate about but always lose interest a few months in. It's always the same, I look forward to starting school all summer and by December I've had enough.

This year is different. I got myself into a private school and paid a pretty penny for the course I'm in. I started my first full-time job in August in a related field and I'm as depressed as I was in the previous years.

I don't know how I keep changing my mind so drastically from 'this is something I want to do for the rest of my life' to having a breakdown every other day because I'm so unhappy with the path I've chosen.

To my utmost dismay at this point I'm convinced that school is not for me. Which pretty much leads me to death's door having to work minimum wage jobs with people who are just as unhappy as I am. Minimum wage is a joke at ‚Ç¨4.5/hour with no way to get by and no way to move forward in life.

Worst of all, I kept calling and texting my boyfriend. He was super supportive and helpful, but I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like a burden especially after having such a great time with him yesterday. I practically called him every hour today, about 10 phone calls and many text messages about how sad I am and how I don‚Äôt know why I feel this way. I feel so bad for doing that to him. I know he loves me, but he probably feels I was slightly annoying today and I should give him space now for a while. I should‚Äôve given him space way earlier on today, but I kept going on and on just like the thoughts in my mind keep going on overthinking every little thing until I tear myself apart. New high score of breakdowns in a day: too many to count. I also feel guilty because there are people going through worse than I am. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me.

But most of the time, I don‚Äôt even know why I feel these things. And boy today was it bad in my head and I feel like I made today a bit worse for my family around me and my boyfriend just trying to enjoy his Saturday. 
I tried going for walks and things, they did good for a while but the feelings came flooding back on and on today.
I usually do feel a bit sadness after having such a fun time. It‚Äôs like post-fun depression because I was having so much fun with him, but then I had to come back home to being lonely again. And then I started being clingy which led me to feel guilty and sad. 
Any advice? Much appreciated. Thank you for reading this far.

248,"

So I‚Äôm about to transfer into the university I worked so hard to get into but I‚Äôm facing a little bit of a ‚Äúpotential‚Äù dilemma per say.  I‚Äôve struggled mentally with depression in college my first two semesters and failed math twice (which is a D in my college).  Partially because I was in my head for sure as my other classes I get As and Bs in and have been on anti anxiety meds when I was younger for my anxiety issues.  I‚Äôve since gotten better and have even gotten an A in one of my math classes since then and haven‚Äôt gotten a D since.  I am pretty happy about that but lately I‚Äôve had a 76 in my stats class and while I think I will pull it off, I have a another dilemma, I‚Äôve been using chegg to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù in another class where I have multiple projects to complete.  The syllabus never covers cheating and maybe this will save me since it‚Äôs a ‚Äúproject‚Äù where I still have to use my brain rather than a timed exam so what do they expect? Though the prof hasn‚Äôt  got me in the past for doing it, I have a suspicion that they are on to me as they locked an assignment I completed.  I still doubt it however, but I‚Äôm very vulnerable if they choose to bust me even though I use a VPN and gift card to pay.  

Here‚Äôs the thing, I honestly can‚Äôt see myself passing this class without cheating and even if I didn‚Äôt, I would probably fail my stats class.  I‚Äôve had a  rough life outside of school so this was the least of my concerns so this advocated my cheating.   I had low motivation to complete this class fairly as this is a class I will not need for my future degree coursework.  Whenever I have a class like this paired with my ADHD, I get stressed and depressed and feel like I‚Äôm wasting my life just completing it.  I‚Äôve came to the conclusion that if I am caught, I will drop out.  I already just barely got into the university I got into, and having to already take one class twice, I don‚Äôt know if I should use more of my life time dealing with college if it‚Äôs not meant for me, even if it‚Äôs a hard pill for me to swallow.  

I‚Äôm a fitness junkie and want to be a personal trainer as I have potential in it and it‚Äôs my passion, but dropping out to pursue this is embarrassing for me.  Also when it comes to fitness, injuries are thing that could affect your career.  It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm getting an NBA contract with free insurance to cover my ailments if I get them.   I also flip things on eBay and have made thousands and already have a property at 21 yrs old.  To sum up without sounding pretentious, everything I am good at is not at school.  Everything I‚Äôve achieved from school has been pure grit with no purpose behind it.  For now I need to put my guilt aside and get to studying for this stats test as if I don‚Äôt I am definitely fucked.  People always say I would be good in the military but my entrepreneurship goals might detract from my potential to feel good in that structured environment.  I‚Äôm also a pussy bc I‚Äôm afraid of getting killed potentially in combat.

If they do catch me I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to tell my parents.  At least I go to community college rn and we don‚Äôt pay a lot of money for college.  I know what I‚Äôm doing is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù but I feel without doing this ‚Äúwrong‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt be able to pass.  Im undergrad though so once I transfer I will be happy with all the classes I have as they are of interest to me.  I‚Äôm just looking for guidance in my life......I‚Äôm having terrible anxiety rn.   You can say ‚Äúyou cheated and you deserve what you got‚Äù..... okay mr perfect but I already know this.  I‚Äôm just hoping this isn‚Äôt the case and I won‚Äôt get caught for the time being.

‚Ä¢ we have a porn addiction epidemic which is giving us  a unrealisitc view of sex

‚Ä¢ Family values and wanting kids seems to be demonized now


‚Ä¢ apparently its now bad to hit kids who get out of line or to tell your son to ""man up"". Growing up i was always told to man up and i feel like that actually turned me into a more stronger, independant man as i got older.


‚Ä¢ Men dont seem that masculine anymore and have been feminized by the media


‚Ä¢ We have too many overweight people and we have movements calling it healthy/beautiful


‚Ä¢ We still have millions of people suffering and since this pandemic the rich have got richer while the poor have got even more poorer


‚Ä¢ We also have this vaccine coming out which is most likely going to be forced. Now im not an anti-vaxxer but at the end of the day we still have not studied the long term side effects. It also shouldnt be forced onto healthy people and people shouldnt be told that they cant work, cant travel, cant socialize ect unless they get the vaccine.

259,"Hey so I‚Äôm 17 and my mom has recently run into a slight Heath issue: high blood pressure (and she smokes). She‚Äôs been prescribed to take medicine to curb smoking and help her blood pressure and I was proud of her for actually taking the initiative to do better for her health. She‚Äôs a long time smoker and obviously that‚Äôs not helping her blood pressure which was alarmingly high btw. Mind you, this all started Wednesday so I totally understand it taking a while to adjust. What I don‚Äôt respect is her telling me that she ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt smoked for 2 days I‚Äôm doing good,‚Äù only for her to tell me today that she has had ‚Äútwo puffs but then tried again and it didn‚Äôt taste good‚Äù. This is another lie which I soon find out from catching her taking ‚Äúa little puff‚Äù again tonight. The thing is, I know it‚Äôs not going to change overnight, but the lying really makes me angry. There‚Äôs no need to waste my hope if she‚Äôs just going to keep telling me what she thinks I want to hear. To be quite honest, I‚Äôm worried she won‚Äôt even make it to see me graduate college, these are things that have weighed on me heavy since as long as I can remember and if she‚Äôs paying for it now with her blood pressure, what happens when it‚Äôs something worse? Will these lies eventually turn into her saying she took her medication when she didn‚Äôt? This sort of communication is not good to build on and makes me wonder if she just says it so I can shut up. I try to communicate my concerns but it‚Äôs like talking to a wall. I honestly feel like a big idiot for thinking she would even take it seriously for a few days let alone see the severity of it. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore and I‚Äôm quite drained tbh, I need to know that I can leave the house and she‚Äôll be taking care of herself without enablers around.

260,"For context I live with my SO, my brother and his wife. He‚Äôs had a dog for over 10 years now and I‚Äôve lived with it for nearly 4 years. We knew the animal had been having health problems and that his time was unfortunately coming. However today my SO noticed that his wife posted a picture of the dog‚Äôs collar on Instagram with a ‚ÄúRIP‚Äù caption. I went to ask my brother what had happened once I noticed their demeanor was super down, and he simply said nothing. I eventually had to text my mom and ask because my brother had apparently told my parents but not me, despite us actually living with them. It was also understood that they planned on putting him down, and that it wasn‚Äôt an emergency. It‚Äôs not a big deal, but I‚Äôm pretty bummed that I didn‚Äôt get a chance to say goodbye to the dog given that I would usually let them out to the bathroom and occasionally feed him his special food cups. I know my brother and his wife are grieving, but I‚Äôm sad that I didn‚Äôt get a chance to say goodbye. And it just seems odd that he wouldn‚Äôt even tell me what had happened despite me asking. I want to bring it up but I want to give them space first, would it be worth bringing up a couple weeks down the line or should I just let it go? I hate starting problems and I can just see emotions getting out of hand with this. 

TLDR: Brother put down household dog that had been around for 10 years, and I‚Äôve been living with for 4 years. I didn‚Äôt get a chance to say goodbye even though the vet trip was premeditated. I asked my brother why he seemed down and he ignored me, only to find out from my mom that the dog had been put down.

261,"I've felt extremely insecure about myself lately because of friends of friends. I have a friend group that I enjoy spending time with, I hang out with, all that stuff. But 1 (We'll call R) and to some extent 2 people (The other is L) in our friend group are friends with another group that absolutely despises the rest of us for basically no reason. 

R is really good friends with the other group, but L...it's tough to tell. L is an extremely close friend of mine, yet he has hung out with the other group despite them apparently openly trash talking me (according to R, which I believe because the group acts as if I don't exist). It got to the point where I'd be in an Xbox party with my friends, including L, and suddenly, the other group would join and the vibe would become all shitty. But L never seemed to mind despite the other group discarding me and the others. I asked L lately if we could make Xbox parties invite-only, and he agreed, and we've done it since. But still, I can't shake this feeling that he is annoyed with me and wants to be in a party with them. 

Part of my fear is honestly that, due to that group casually hating me...R and L will eventually think of me as useless and boring and drift away to the other group. Honestly, it bugs me how R (and kind of L) seem to see the other group as equal to ours despite them treating us badly. I unadded R on snap lately to prepare for what I see as the inevitable, which is R finally realizing how boring I am and abandoning me. But R is usually nice to me, and we are good friends...so idk. I readded him but I cant shake this feeling. He seems like he would agree with the others if they trash talk me, and tell them about my flaws.

I feel a lot of things. Scared that R, and even L, will abandon me out of agreeing that I'm pathetic. Worried that they'll prioritize them because they're more fun (R has told stories of the fun, crazy shit they do). Idk, just...I feel just terrible about it.

265,"So I have been working as a door to door lead generator for almost 2 years for a solar company and I‚Äôve honestly reached my breaking point. I take no joy in what I do anymore and for quite a while now I‚Äôve felt quite depressed and have had to really push myself to even go to work and get through the week. It just feels like I‚Äôm going no where and will go nowhere if I continue where I am and it‚Äôs honestly really starting to take a tole on my mental health. Not to mention the pay isn‚Äôt the greatest either considering my responsibilities and what I need to pay for (rent,car,etc.) 

I‚Äôve only recently however started causal work fri-sat at a paint store/warehouse as a sales representative and so far I‚Äôve been enjoying it a lot more. There‚Äôs just so much more to do and I feel a lot more important and appreciated and in control. And also the pay is better and I don‚Äôt have to worry about long commutes to other towns as it‚Äôs a lot closer to home and there‚Äôs also opportunities to learn new skills which can help me in the future. 

So here is my dilemma:

For the last 3 weeks I‚Äôve worked my solar job Monday-Thursday and the other Friday-Saturday but I‚Äôve been asked to do Monday - Sat all of next week by my new job. I texted my boss and let him know what‚Äôs going on and he was not very happy, to the point where he was almost guilt tripping me saying ‚Äúthey‚Äôre only going to use you until Christmas and then get rid of you‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been with us longer and we give you 5 days whereas they only give you 2‚Äù and all of that typical stuff. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. I originally applied for my new position to do full time but I did not get it as the other candidates who were hired had more experience. But because the interviewers liked me so much they offered me casual so I could get that experience I was lacking. 

So the boss of my solar job says he‚Äôs going to have a chat with my supervisor who is a very goof friend of mine and is happy for me and supports me doing something I enjoy and see if they‚Äôre even going to keep me on anymore. 

What should I do? I don‚Äôt want to lose this opportunity but at the same time I need to work more days. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",06Dec2020,1

Due to living situation with my roommates being extremely cluttery and anti-kids, I rarely get to have him at my my place (moving not an option yet). 

Time and calls with my son are not regularly scheduled and his father never responds to my messages or calls when I reach out to speak with my son.

271,"I‚Äôve been dealing with this for a long time but recently, I think because of spending a lot of time alone, it‚Äôs been consuming a lot of my thoughts. 

Ever since I was I think 12 years old, people have been making jokes about me being gay. This is nothing new and guys do it all the time but every single time anyone in my life has ever wanted to insult or hurt me, it‚Äôs always the first thing they went to. I‚Äôm not particularly feminine but I‚Äôm not very masculine either. 

When I got to high school, it became less people making fun of me and more everyone just assuming that I‚Äôm gay. I went to a very diverse school and there were lots of openly gay guys so nobody had a problem with it. But it was a pattern where when I would meet someone, they would automatically assume I‚Äôm gay and then I would have to convince them I‚Äôm not. I ended up dating girls that weren‚Äôt really my type just so that I would have a girlfriend and people would get off my back about this. Not many girls liked me though because, again, they all thought I was gay. 

Nothing has really changed now that I‚Äôm in (online) university. My friend‚Äôs brother doesn‚Äôt like me because I‚Äôm a ‚Äúf*g‚Äù and recently I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about how often people have called me that word for my entire life.

I know 100% that I‚Äôm not gay, but I question my sexuality probably way more often than most people because I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm gay for my entire life.

280," 

Some back story: we have been together nine years, both in our mid to late 30's, not engaged or married.

I am completely irritated with the way things are. We rent an apartment in a luxury apartment community. We split the rent and basic utilities. We moved from a full size house. I pay for the storage units which hold the extra household furniture and holiday decor etc. I also pay for the rv and the storage fees for it and the maintenance as well as pay for the truck to tow it (my second vehicle). I also pay all the expenses for the dog (vets bills, food, meds etc). He pays for the NFL package, his softball leagues and video games. He also has not cleaned a single thing since we moved in, I do all the cleaning and the laundry. We also spend holidays separate, have for years. Backstory on that: I planned a large fundraiser event and he was supposed to go and said he would. At the last minute his friend said that was the weekend of his bachelor party so he wanted to cancel going with me out of state for the event so he could go to the bachelor party. He was not party of the wedding party. Needless to say a fight ensued and he apparently mentioned it to his mother. I overheard him tell his friend that she said that she agrees with me even though she doesn't like me. I was never anything but nice to his family. So I have not attended a family event since, not going to go somewhere where I am not liked and both be uncomfortable. I was also not invited to his brothers destination wedding and found out about it at another friends wedding six months later when they asked me if I was excited to go and I didn't know anything about it. A few years ago his friend actually messaged him and said the friends-group opinion of me is even worse than before. Yet I was always nice to them and helped them when they would call and ask me for stuff. Now the same friend messaged him and wants him to go on a guys trip in January and he still owes me $2000 and never pays his bills on time to me because he takes it for granted that I will have everything paid on time. He even goes as far as saying ""our"" rv even though I pay for it and maintain it. We are not engaged or married and I am not a stay at home mom where I clean etc because he works to support me...I work full time and support myself. Am I wrong for being completely pi$$ed?",06Dec2020,1

If I would have just said ‚Äùno‚Äù and stopped talking to him sooner, then I would still have my parent‚Äôs trust, I would still be able to talk to my friends (I would still *have* friends) and I would have never had to live with the guilt and fear that my nudes and lewds could come out some day. 

In August I made *such* a bad decision to talk to these older men. Both I met on discord. One, was big on me sending pictures, he would almost always ask for them. Finally I blocked him after a few weeks however, he dmed me through another account not too long after threatening to leak them but I just blocked him again and that was that.

The other man, did not pressure me to send things but I enjoyed..sending them? Willingly. He didn't make me uncomfortable like the other guy for some reason.

Either way, my parents found out around late August, early September and It went down from there. I know I deserve this punishment, I'm already used to having no phone. I've already asked for advice before..but everyone says to report the men to the police. I already have (and mentioned that in those posts). I just want advice on how to..stop feeling this guilt I guess.

A couple of my online friends emailed me, saying they know what happened. I was so upset that the guy told them. (they were friends with him, but these 2 we're my age). they said they don't speak to him now, but they're upset with me. It's alright though because I knew I couldn't stay in touch with them anyways after this.


Really, this is me just ranting I guess. I've been feeling really bad. I'm going back into these feelings of loneliness sometimes that I had in middle school  (I didn't talk to anyone then, I was a mainly a loner). Anything is fine, I don't know what I'm looking for in an answer. Even just a little ‚Äùit‚Äôll get better‚Äù I guess would be fine.

283,"Please Only nice advice as I am super stressed out and just need some help. So I messed up. I was diagnosed COVID positive on Monday, November 30th. I felt like I had a fever while waiting for my sister outside of the airport. Well her flight was delayed 2 1/2 hours and had time to kill as her flight was running super late. I was in a rental car she payed for and went through a drive through covid testing center to 'be safe' as I heard if you have a fever you could have it. I was worried (as I work around people) that I might give it to my sister. So I had the 'quickest test done' and filled some stuff out my information on my phone. I searched a place and found one within 10min or so. It was called StarMed. I got a call a little while later and it was positive. I hadn't picked my sister up yet and was in a panic at first but decided to not pick my sister up and Venmo her uber money. I called my work, which I was already off that day and they told me to stay home for the next 2 weeks. I am not getting paid or anything but I really would hate to give it to anyone and be responsible for the sickness of anyone else. My sister ended up staying with a friend and she ended up getting the rental car the next day and worked it all out. She was fine.

So I spent the next 4 days in bed and avoiding everyone including the fedex guy with a note on my door. So Friday around 4:30 my boss calls and wants to know what's going on, as he heard I got my covid diagnosis from my other manager on shift. Why he waited till Friday to notify me idk. So he wants proof of my covid diagnosis. Um ok. I tell him where I got it done and I still had my StarMed reference number text on my phone from where I signed up in the drive through. No he wants my positive paperwork faxed to him by Monday. He was being weird so I call StarMed and talk to a receptionist and she was really nice. 100% loved her but she dosent have access to the rapid tests. She takes my information and tells me she will call me back.

So Saturday. I get a call from another sweet receptionist and she admits she can't find my test. She isn't sure but tells me I am not the only one. She can see me in the system and has my information, Birthday ect but the test isn't on my information. I ask her how I was called and notified positive and she reassures me that I was given accurate information and to just quarantine. That they 'called me after my test result came in and it just wasnt transferred onto my online profile after I was called as they are so busy trying to do as many as quick as possible.' I tell her I need paperwork and to sent in to my work. She says I can come in for a regular test. But if my boss wants to call she 'will make a note and she will tell him what happened.' That when they 'go through all of the paperwork it will more than likely get transferred to my online information but it will take a while as they have hundreds of boxes of tests.' That if it is urgent, she will fit me in whenever I want for another test if I have to have paperwork now and they will print it out while I am there. Which would mean calling a uber and exposing more people to covid and paying more money I can't afford.

I don't want to expose anyone else and just don't feel well and want to rest. I don't know why my boss is being such a jerk, and I basically fell like I was called a liar. I called him Saturday and told him he could call the place I went to and talk to receptionist but he wants paperwork faxed to him with ""attention:James"" or he will assume this was my 2 weeks notice. I just need some advice or a google image of someone else's paperwork I can slap my name on for now to satisfy my jerk boss. Otherwise I will Just go in a uber on Monday and hope I don't get anyone else sick or IDK.I don't know why anyone would want fake COVID as you literally can get in trouble if you do anything if you are not in quarantine. I just don't know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated. Sorry for the long rant. 

And my boss (the jerk) owns the business I work at so going above him is impossible.",06Dec2020,1
284,"How to tell mom I can't be the only help

21f only child living at my mom's house. For background, my dad died when I was 12 and I was left as the only help for my mom. We have no family in this country. She is an immigrant turned citizen who doesn't speak much English, so I've been the interpreter ever since. This requires me to help with a lot around the house. My mom expects me to make all the phone calls for her regarding the house, pay the bills online for her, find plumbers, carpenters, and whatever else the house might need. She also thinks that once I get a ""real job"" I'll be consistently helping with renovations for the house. The truth is I help financially as best as I can but she requires my constant attention. Even if I'm in another room focused on homework she has no problem with coming in to interrupt with whatever she needs. I don't mean to sound spoiled I understand and appreciate all she does and am thankful. It's just gotten to the point where I can't be in 10 places at once. The house is pretty old and I've brought up why doesn't she sell and purchase a condo, she gets upset and says I should be more helpful as it's my home too. When I am away for too long aka a night or two she has a list of stuff she wants from me or the worst the extreme guilt she puts me through for leaving her. It's like she doesn't accept or believe I have a life beyond her and the house. I just wanted advice on how to approach saying I can no longer be the only form of help around here.

285,"Hi, im 13 And I have a few things i need a second, third, and maybe fourth opinion on

1, I want to become a anesthesiologist: I am worried about the job security of anesthesiology with how quick the medical field is advancing technologically. When I first heard of anesthesiology I thought ‚Äúoh hey a way to help people and get paid a nice amount of money for doing so, this is the definition of a dream job‚Äù but as time has went on i have realized that this may all just be a dream because in 10-15 years doctors could be completely replaced with technology. I know anesthesiology is a hard medical field to take and I feel as if all the years I invest into med school could be completely invalidated because someone made a robot that can do my job better for a fortune less.

2, what job should I take?: I have multiple career paths id like to explore and ive always said to myself ‚Äúlearn the stock market and start investing that way you have money for med school and a secondary source of income and maybe even a second career path‚Äù but obviously things change and im not entirely sure if that‚Äôs viable anymore. I think about how difficult any the jobs I want to take are and I get really sad thinking about how ive told every major adult in my life what I want to be and how much I have to live up to. I feel like my life is crumbling under the stress even though I know its just fine, I feel like a disappointment when I spend 6 hours playing games because they take my mind off all the anxiety that come with getting older. 

3, What Do I Do: I have so many problems I need to work out but I feel like securing a future that wont leave me without a job and in debt is the most important right now. These questions have been like a black hole forming in the pit of my stomach and its starting to consume me. 

TL;DR: 
1: Im concerned about job security for anesthesiology due to technological advances
2: I dont know what career path I should take, one I really like or one I moderately like that pays really well and lets me help people

I really just need some answers, am I justifiably anxious about my future? Or should I stop getting myself so worked up over late night thoughts?

Its currently 1 AM so im gonna sleep on this and please if you have any answers or advice to give please do",06Dec2020,1

289,"I‚Äôve been working for a grocery store for about two years now. After about a year, i decided i wanted to start exploring the possibilities of going into management. I loved my job, the people were great, it was fun, and i was good at it. one of my managers had a scheduled LOA coming up so i took that as an opportunity to learn more of the assistant manager job tasks. i started putting away the delivery pallets when they came in later, training new hires, cycle baking, etc. now, there is a bit of backstory to my job. i close down my department at night alone. i am really only responsible for customer service and cleaning. but when you‚Äôre there long enough, you learn everything. it is not expected to learn the other parts of the department. i wanted to learn them because i thought it would prove that i could be a great manager. a few months later, one of my managers goes on their LOA. i pretty much step up as my other manager‚Äôs assistant. things start getting stressful because we are down a person. funny how you can give a job almost a year in advance to hire temporary help and they just don‚Äôt. anyways, we all just start basically doing the jobs of 2 people as one. holidays are approaching and we are already getting burnt out.

so, my job‚Äôs thought of help is training a new assistant manager that has undisclosed health restrictions and never worked for the company or in a bake shop. in the middle of the holidays. my manager tells me that she‚Äôll be gone in a month and it‚Äôs just help until they can hire someone to cover more of my nights so i can train fully in the other parts of being a manager. except, the new assistant does absolutely zero part of her job and we have to do everything for her. and by we, i mainly mean me. so this person is getting the manager salary while i‚Äôm doing all the work. 

my manager got fed up and told her boss that they need to send her somewhere else. i got fed up and told her boss that i feel taken advantage of because i‚Äôm doing everything a manager is required to do but yet this person gets the title and salary. they say they‚Äôre working on it. two months go by. nothing. that brings us to today. it‚Äôs just gotten worse and worse. upper management does not seem to care at all. i am starting to lose sleep because i am so anxious and on edge from not knowing the crap i‚Äôm gonna have to fix that day. my back hurts from putting away 200 piece deliveries by myself. i am running myself into the ground.

i don‚Äôt want to threaten upper management, but i‚Äôm getting close to the edge here. they need to know that if management is not something they can offer, i need to explore other options. how do i say that without threatening them? i just can‚Äôt be taken advantage of like this anymore. i need to be paid and treated what i am worth.

tldr: my job promised me management and full time but gave it to a new hire from outside the company. they don‚Äôt do any work at all so i have to do their work and mine. management is doing nothing. how do i tell them if they can‚Äôt offer me management i need to leave without sounding like i‚Äôm threatening them?",06Dec2020,1
290,"I was dating this girl for about a month or so. We ended up breaking up after she couldnt talk to me  like she used to anymore. She stopped responding fast and when she did respond she didn't really add anything new to the conversation. We broke up 2 weeks ago and I still find myself still thinking about her. I still think about her future even though im not going to be in it. She smoked weed and she said that her dream was to be a big plug (drug dealer) ok anyway. I feel like finding someone new would really help me. But Im not really looking for it because I know that this feeling will most likely go away in a month or so. 

One day I did a yolo on snap, and this girl slide up and asked if I was single, (yes I am)
She texted me, I responded and then she started being really dry. It's just all so confusing.  I know the saying ""theirs a lid for every pot"" I know every lid won't fit but I feel like im going to be alone forever at this point

When I was younger I used to get bullied for being wierd and ugly. I had a massive glow up tho. But I still feel like things will always go bad for me. Even though the relationships only lasted for a month, and it was a pretty bad relationship. I had to do everything. Start conversation,  give compliments first, say I love you (some may say one month is too soon to say I love you but I don't know)  I miss it and I don't know why. Mabye it's because Iv never had it. No one besides my family had ever called me cute. no one besides my family has said they love me (Besides close friends).  

girls are just so hard and I guess I got to attached to the one I had. I want a girl that calls me names and makes fun of me for dumb shit, but I also want her to be there for me when I need her. I want to be able to laugh at offensive memes with her without her getting offended. But I also want her to be there for me when im feeling sad, and make me feel loved. I feel like that's hard to find in a girl. The girl I was dating had the first part(laughing at offensive memes) and she also comforted me when I was sad, but she didn't make me feel very loved. One day she told me that if we broke up, she would probably just forget about me. And even though she said that she was just joking after, she didn't make me believe it.

 The girl is actually one of my friends little sisters, and Everytime I hear him say something about her like ""im going to hangout with my little sister""  I just feel sad. She broke up with me and she told me I was an amazing bf, and I was an amazing person but she didn't want all of it. She said that she didn't want to keep bringing my mood down. Even though it was for my own good I still didn't want it to happen

291,"It‚Äôs been two weeks since my girlfriends sex drive dove down. We used to have sex every other day (sometimes every day), and it was always passionate, and we‚Äôd go for multiple rounds (usually 3, but minimum 2 rounds). But ever since 2 weeks ago, it‚Äôs just different. She is never in the mood for it, if we do it, then it‚Äôs more of like ‚Äúokay fine I‚Äôm kinda in the mood‚Äù, and it‚Äôs one round max. It‚Äôs also not really passionate, it‚Äôs just ‚Äúokay‚Äù kind of thing. 

I confronted her about it today, and she said that she swears she has no idea why. She said ‚Äúmaybe we‚Äôre just doing it too much‚Äù, but I know she likes sex, and as she said I‚Äôm the best partner she‚Äôs ever had, so it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. I asked her ‚Äúdo you even find me hot?‚Äù, at first she said ‚Äúyes I do, I mean it. I promise‚Äù; but it didn‚Äôt sound really convincing to me, so I didn‚Äôt quite believe that. I told her that she can be totally honest, and that it‚Äôs okay to say what she thinks, because I want to know. She took some time to think, and with tears in her eyes confessed that she doesn‚Äôt find me hot. Ouch, not that it‚Äôs a surprise to me, I‚Äôm pretty objective person, so I knew I‚Äôm not the hottest guy on earth. I said that she shouldn‚Äôt have lied, and she tried to do this ‚Äúoh well no I swear I was thinking that you were asking before like face-wise, and then you said body-wise and then I thought about it and yeah‚Äù. I don‚Äôt exactly believe that, but regardless it‚Äôs still upsetting. 

I asked her if that‚Äôs somehow related to her low sex drive, but she said no. I told her to be honest because I really want to know. She swears on everything it‚Äôs not, but also cant say what is the reason. (The reason why I suspect those are related, is because prior to meeting her I barely ate out, but ever since I met her I started eating McDonald‚Äôs and such, so I gained weight over 2-3 months).

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I told her that I might not want to have sex for some time, and I‚Äôm not exactly comfortable getting naked. She cries and is really devastated to hear all of that, she is blaming herself for being a horrible girlfriend, and said she failed to make me feel comfortable around her. I try to reassure her that none of it is her fault, but she doesn‚Äôt seem to listen. Both of us are devastated, and very sad. What is more sad for me, if that over the course of this conversation I managed to get a confession from her that her previous sexual partners were hotter than me. I don‚Äôt know what to do, even if I lose weight and she will find me hot in future, this will be haunting. She seems to be truly sad and worried about all of that too.",06Dec2020,1

She has a kid from a previous relationship but I was getting comfortable enough to meet her kid. She had some academic/professional priorities the later 2 months si I gave her space to focus on that. Right before a licensure exam she spent a weekend with a ""friend"" whom she told me not to worry about. She told me that weekend that she developed feelings for him. She broke up with me and I was devastated. She also said she wanted a clean break and never wanted to talk to me again.. A month later she talks to me out of the blue. She's had trouble with past relationships with guys being abusive in one way or another. Rhe guy she left me for gave her an excuse for not dating her and just ghosted her.. We started talking and we finally met up for one of our favorite activities.  She told me about her frustrations and we just had a good time laughing like we used to.

I spend some 2 years working on how to clean cars in 30 minutes or less. monday week of the lockdown (keep in mind I had no idea that they would be shuting the country) I took out a personal grivance against my boss, where I called him out on his double standard between me and the other groomer.  In the 2nd week of lockdown they devided to make me redundant. I allways had my issues about how they decided on how to make me redundant (and I can see how my personal grivance played into it), as they use an assesment matrix with no resonable way to asses my skills, as they never do preformance reviews and the entire country was shut.   


I just found out today from the person who took over my old position that the reason they let  me go was (ilegidly) due to poor hygine, and that they liked the other groomer more.

I only messaged 157 people I suspected to be interested, and I have 8000 followers and growing, meaning there are thousands more I have yet to message. I haven‚Äôt even begun advertising on Twitter or Reddit, which could increase my numbers significantly. By New Years I hope to be close to 50 subscribers, though it could end up being less or even more than that. I am supposed to go to a 2 month boot camp for the military and a 6 month training afterwards, but it‚Äôs been halted due to Covid, and I‚Äôm unsure when I‚Äôll ship off. I have a part time job making minimum wage and working terrible hours. There might be outrage if my parents were to find out, since it would seriously endanger my future military career. Because of this I‚Äôm unsure if I should:

Get another job as a cover, which I don‚Äôt want to do at all. And I‚Äôd rather not lie and ‚Äúact‚Äù like I have another job, since I have a history of betraying their trust.

Move out of the house, which they will have a lot of questions as to how I‚Äôm able to afford it.

Or I can continue my life as if I‚Äôm broke, and continue to amass a following until I‚Äôm making &gt;$3000 a month from my OnlyFans, in which case I‚Äôll feel comfortable moving out, admit to them what I‚Äôm doing, and potentially leave the Air National Guard and use my Onlyfans income to pay for school.

What do I do? Because NOT doing an OnlyFans is simply not an option.",06Dec2020,1

She‚Äôs a college graduate and works in tech, she‚Äôs smart already, way smarter than me, but she keeps saying that she needs to get better at reading and writing. I want to help her achieve this.

313,"Hello, throwaway rr since I have siblings that use reddit. I got into a pretty heated convo with my mom about using my social security to help get a mortgage to be able to build a house. I let her know right off the batt that I was NOT ok with her using it to get a mortgage, mainly because I am at the age (25) that I would want to start looking for my own place to live. She got really mad and upset and started saying how ungrateful and how egotistical I am for not letting her use my SS. Was I in the wrong?? I let her know applying for a mortgage will hurt me in the future, but she keeps saying it won‚Äôt and it will instead help me.

Additionally, I make 10-12k a year doing unemployment, selling drugs, and flipping Nintendo games on eBay. My only real hobbies are lifting weights and partying, I go thru periods where I don‚Äôt go to the bar which I usually spend sitting inside playing snes and doing ketamine. Within the next 1-2 years I‚Äôd like to develop a business.


I find myself in these weird relationships about once a year since I was like 20 and it‚Äôs always the same blueprint: short petite blonde about 5 ft-5 4, 90-120 lbs, lives in my bed and goes on a 2-3 month drug binge, than I try to get serious about it and end up never hearing from her again. It‚Äôs always short, quick, and passionate. People call me a simp or beta or whatever but I truly love these women and are hurt every time they leave me for drugs.

I can‚Äôt help feeling SO attracted to him. I have felt this way for a while, when we were working together in person. Now, we are working remotely and it has not subsided. If anything I am more attracted to him. This could very well be because of quarantine loneliness, but I have been attracted to him from day one. 

Obviously nothing will happen; he is not single, he is my colleague, and we are working remotely. This is nothing but a fantasy.

316,"So I'm a almost 15 year old male, and I don't think i feel emotions anymore. 

Today my dad was screaming at my mom about how he didn't like me anymore, and my mom was kinda taking my side and saying things like ""parents should love their kids no matter what"" and stuff like that. I didn't really listen to what they were saying after that tho, because I was listening to music and let me tell ya, I got some killer noise canceling headphones.

But getting back on topic, I fear that either they(my parents) might be getting a divorce soon or my dad's gonna do something real stupid. 

But I don't feel sad or mad at all. All I can think about is how pathetic my dad is and how if he doesn't support me financially, that would result in the quality of my education and just quality of my life in general to go down.

Even 2 years ago I would have bawled my eyes out and been traumatized by something like this, but now it doesn't even graze me. It's been about a hour since this happened so I guess I do care a little bit or at least enough to post about it here.

Now here are some questions I have:
1. Do i talk to my mother? (Hilariously enough, I'm more concerned about my mon's mental health than my own.)
2. How would a normal person react to something like this?
3. Am i better off being like this rather than maybe getting therapy and being able to feel again?",06Dec2020,1
317,"My mom always makes comments about my weight and the food I eat, she's been doing it since I was around 12. I guess I always just assumed that other people's parents called them fat and told them to stop eating junk food, but I guess not?

Example being earlier today I was making my second sandwich of the day, I didn't really want to eat another sandwich, I was just to lazy to make anything else, so I started putting it together when she said something along the lines of 

""Are you seriously making another sandwich? Can't you eat anything else? Look at yourself, look at your cheeks, look at your legs, all those carbs are going to go straight to your ass. Why don't you get on a scale, I bet the numbers would shock you.""

Now I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the healthiest person out there, but it's not like I'm morbidly obese either. At most I might be a few pounds overweight, but I don't know if that really warrants her saying those things. (It's also probably worth mentioning that I have uneven body fat placement, so ALL of it goes to my legs, and a little bit to my stomach, that why they look so much bigger than the rest of me) It always makes me feel bad about myself, so my self confidence is really down the pit. It's so bad that I get nervous whenever I go into the kitchen now, and I usually just stay in my room when she's home, and I feel really guilty whenever I eat food.

She also always says things about how ""ugly"" fat people are, like they don't deserve love, and she keeps saying ""do you want to be fat and ugly?"" All the time. I honestly don't know what to believe anymore, my grandparents keep telling me to just ignore her, but ignoring her won't make her stop, and I feel like shit more and more every day.

I honestly thought this was a normal thing that parents do, but none of my friends have ever said anything about they're parents doing anything similar.",06Dec2020,1
318,"Hello, I'm a senior in high school (maybe that'll give you context or help you give me advice?) and I want to learn to drive. I already spoke to my parents about it and we all agreed that I should. However, I can't help but feel intimidated by the thought of driving.

It's not a phobia but more of an anxiety. The thought of driving a giant steel cuboid that can potentially harm people and me is kind of terrifying to me. Another thing that scares me is what if I'm not good at it? (I know it's silly, but I don't exactly have a nice history with any kind of driving videogame ... which is also worrying me.)

I am an organized and detail-oriented person, and I take good care and attention whenever I do something. Most of my family - including the rational side of my brain - know I can do it with a bit of practice and I'll be fine. How do I get over this initial fear? Or more specifically, how can I train myself to get rid of (or control) the anxious thoughts that I force on myself?

319,"Exactly one month ago today I got into an accident while driving to work. It was at 4 am and I had just gotten my license about 2 weeks before. I was changing lanes and didn't see someone in the lane I was changing into and, because I was new, I didn't follow the correct protocol of getting out and assessing the situation with the person I hit (don't worry, I got all the legal issues sorted out). Before that day I felt so happy and confident about driving, felt completely safe, and often drove my friends around (even in hectic city driving areas) because I'm the only one of them that actually has a license. Ever since the incident almost all the driving I've done has made me extremely anxious like I wasn't before, and almost every time has had a situation that freaked me out. How can I overcome this fear and trauma when it comes to driving? I can't get better at driving if I don't consistently do it, but to do it provides an inherent risk of danger, especially if I'm anxious.",06Dec2020,1

321,"Around April / May, my best friend ‚ÄúJanelle‚Äù [30F] moved in due to job loss from Covid. This has been my best friend since I was 8. She‚Äôs like a sister to me. She helps out a lot. She‚Äôs even helped my daughter with her virtual learning classes while I‚Äôve been at work. She gets money from her father who lives a few states away from us, so she pays me some for rent. 

Since she‚Äôs moved in, she has been juggling 2 guys. When one doesn‚Äôt do right, she‚Äôs with the other and vice versa. My problem is... they are both trash. She is constantly beefing with them at different points in time and it‚Äôs starting to piss me off. Especially since I don‚Äôt like nor feel safe with one of them around - that seems to be the one she likes the most. I feel like he‚Äôs extremely disrespectful. He carries a gun on him everywhere he goes. He‚Äôs been known to be on drugs and claims to have quit. I‚Äôm guessing she‚Äôs attracted to ‚Äúsober‚Äù him, but I don‚Äôt trust it all. 

In my mind, I want to say that I am genuinely concerned about her well being and the behavior she shows with these men; I know when she is having problems with them because she is moody, depressed, randomly angry, etc. I‚Äôve tried to talk to her about it, but she says she has it under control. The guys both disrespect her in their own way and she just continues to entertain them so she won‚Äôt be lonely. 

I haven‚Äôt dated anyone at all this year and the last time I had sex was 2 weeks before she moved in. I feel like if I continue to talk to her she‚Äôs going to say that I‚Äôm jealous. Am I? I don‚Äôt really know. I am lonely too. I don‚Äôt entertain anyone because I don‚Äôt really want to commit to anything and I don‚Äôt want to have flings or men in and out of my house. It wouldn‚Äôt set a good example for my daughter. But again... I am lonely and I do feel a bit of rage and resentment towards my best friend for being able to entertain men in the way that she does. 

Am I jealous? What can I do to fix the way that I feel?",06Dec2020,1

We took it really slowly like it was some kind of a tutorial in a video game, and it was going quite smoothly for my first time. However, I was only able to get fully erected when she was blowing, but other than that I felt like it was a bit erected but still soft. So, when I inserted it at first it was completely normal but it stopped erecting as time pasts away. After that I‚Äôve tried watching porn to wake it back up but it didn‚Äôt work, so we ended up stopping it there.

My daily life for the past year and a half
I wake up
Text my gf good morning 
Get ready
Go to school 
Talk to the girl next to my desk in period 1
Fall asleep from period 2 to 3
Occasionally talk to the same girl
Go to 4 period and sit next to my gf
Completely ignore the class and talk to my gf
Leave class and tell her goodbye 
Say goodbye to her again while I go to lunch
Everyone ignores me and I eat lunch alone
Think about my gf
Think about my life 
Think about the unknown that I want to experience 
Go to 5th
Go to 6th
Get humiliated by lower classmen in front of gf
Walk her out of class
Go to 7th 
Contemplating leaving home
Contemplating on leaving everything 

School ends 
She goes home 
I say I love you as she leaves
She texts me I love you
I go home
Parents yell at me for the most mundane things such as dropping a pencil and wanting to not be a FUCKING GODDAMN ENGINEER
play games
Laugh 
Text gf goodnight 
Watch yt 
Sleep 






There‚Äôs nothing new in my life 
Nobody cares about me
Everytime I text her it‚Äôs nothing new
Nothing exciting except the occasional I did that

Nothing

But I still love her 
And want to be there till the end and I just love her and she‚Äôs my life and she‚Äôs everything 

But all I want is her to say I love you irl instead of me saying it
I want her to hug me  instead of me hugging her 
I want her problems to be my problems and I want everything bad towards her to be gone and put on my shoulders 

She‚Äôll text me sweet nothings but at the end of day I just want a I love you but in real life and me not saying it first

I just want her to say it 

I just want her to say it

The first time I decided to tell her some of my problems she didn‚Äôt really say much 

Idk what I expected but not just bruh and I‚Äôm sorry and Oh NoOoO.

I told my friend the same thing and he didn‚Äôt know what to say but he tried and that‚Äôs all that mattered

But I guess this is pretty petty but I guess I wanted her to at least try instead of a hollow ‚ÄúOh No, anyways‚Äù (yes I quoted a meme)

I love her and she loves me but I just want something different or something to tell me that she cares

I‚Äôm buying her some jewelry for Christmas cause I guess that‚Äôs what girls like idk, it‚Äôs a chain necklace that‚Äôs like 20 bucks (which is half of my money)


All I want is a picture of me and her for my phone wallpaper 



I‚Äôve lost friends for her 

I just want a I love you

That‚Äôs all I want for Christmas 


I love her I really do 

God I‚Äôm fucking pathetic 
No wonder all my friends left me

I‚Äôm a failure 

I‚Äôm a fucking monster

326,"Recently I‚Äôve come into a bit of internet popularity. Things have been going really great so far, but ever since my online presence has started to pick up, I‚Äôve gotten more and more paranoid about cancel culture. I‚Äôm a teenager so I know how brutal people on places like tiktok and Twitter can be when someone screws up. When I was younger, I said some things in a discord call that definitely were not acceptable and I‚Äôm absolutely terrified it‚Äôll get out. I have an ex who was in the call with me at the time and I‚Äôm constantly worrying that if he finds out who I am, he‚Äôll speak out about it. I was in a really bad place when I said what I said, and I regretted it immediately after I said it. I would never, ever say it again and I feel so guilty for it. 

This paranoia has led me to start thinking about ways to apologize and ways to make things better if it were to get leaked. I‚Äôve started talking to myself. Like having full blown conversations while staring in the mirror. I‚Äôve been practicing my tone, my facial expressions, everything so that I don‚Äôt screw up. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it had gotten until my friends noticed. I literally can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like my brain just forgets that there isn‚Äôt a person there. I‚Äôm normally not even saying the words out loud, just mouthing them. 

I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm going crazy or something. I‚Äôve started treating mirror me like a different person that can respond to me. I‚Äôll say something and then she‚Äôll give a retort and then I‚Äôll say something and it just goes back and forth. My family doesn‚Äôt have a history of mental illness or anything, so I doubt it‚Äôs schizophrenia or anything like that. I just don‚Äôt know how to make it stop. 

Does anyone have any coping mechanisms? I can‚Äôt keep acting like this since it‚Äôs starting to freak out people around me.",06Dec2020,1
327,"Hi, this is a long story i apologize :/

I met my (who I thought or still do think) soulmate a year &amp; 1 month ago. We started dating in my home town until a series of events happened with his roommates (nothing that i caused, but it‚Äôs a long story so i‚Äôll skip details) i guess he got super stressed out being in my hometown so he moved back to where his mom stays at, in Texas. 

Now, i asked him (and so did his mom) before he officially moved, if I was coming or if I could come, he kept making up Bs excuses about how he wants to focus on himself. Im not the type to hold ANYONE back, so I just let him be. 

he moved sept 22nd, and we broke contact until oct 1st when he texted me asking if I wanted to move down to texas. of course i did. 

he said his mom was cool with it, but the catch is, they‚Äôve been living in a hotel. i was completely ok with that, as they were promising me theyd have an apartment by the time i‚Äôd be down there, (Nov 11th), they also promised me i‚Äôd be set with a position at the same job they worked at. I applied that same day we got back in contact.

fast forward: The 10th hits, he comes back to my hometown, picks me up, meets my family etc, and were off the next day to texas. 

The first week went smoothly! amazing actually, I talked to his mom like she was my bestfriend, made sure she felt comfortable around me. Hell, i even said she was family to her face. 
Still no apartment though. i brushed it off because honestly, it wasnt my business. 

then the next week hits, stuff is still going great, im waiting to hear if I got the position in the department where my boyfriend is, he says no, (this is friday, his moms off on Sat-Sun) 

so i dont hesitate to ask his mom, could you possibly get me into your department, she assures me, in her words ‚ÄúYes! dont worry about it, this works out perfectly‚Äù yadda yadda etc etc. I don‚Äôt worry about it, continue on with my day playing on my boyfriends xbox. 

until saturday hits &amp; it‚Äôs just me and her alone. me and my boyfriend stay on facetime while hes at work &amp; were alone because not gonna lie, i have separation anxiety and it‚Äôs comforting to know he‚Äôs there. (he was fine with it) 

his mom was on the phone, i was playing his xbox (nothing else to do), were minding our own business. until she walks out of the hotel room on the phone. Okay, maybe she just wants her privacy! not my business and i carry on. 

Until I get a text from my now ex‚Äôs little sister. 

‚ÄúMhmmm this _____ what are u doing about this job situation? cause if ____ isnt hiring you need to be looking at other jobs‚Äù 

once again!!! I wasnt looking because, 

A) i was promised a position when I came down here. 
B) his mom‚Äôs car overheats, and can‚Äôt go too far.
C) i was told we‚Äôd be moving anytime so I dont know which area to be looking for jobs around?? I dont know texas at all?? 

so, i start crying &amp; freaking out, my now ex starts crying at WORK, confused just as much as i am. 
I never replied to his sister because, what the fuck?
i‚Äôm wrecking my brain trying to figure out what I did wrong, maybe it‚Äôs because I dont offer any of my snacks? (i noticed the past week she barely eats) 

Fast forward to a few hours later: his mom comes back in. She acts like nothing happened, it‚Äôs an awkward silence ngl. 

So i broke it and said, hey, just to let you know any of my snacks youre definitely more than welcome to have. 

worst mistake ever lol, she says ‚Äúwhat? thats weird, whered that come from?‚Äù and goes in on all this spiritual weird shit about her body and that she was offended that I even offered her snacks. like okay, never doing that again. 

anyways, FAST FORWARD AGAIN! this is like, 3 days after that whole situation. (during those 3 days he asked why his sister texted me and his mom claimed to not know why).... ANYWAYS, 

I cant sleep because I have terrible anxiety thinking she hates me for some reason, so i‚Äôm laying on my ex‚Äôs stomach on my phone scrolling tik tok, whenever he‚Äôd twitch or move i‚Äôd put my phone down and situation myself to make sure he was ok, (he doesnt like my laying on his belly but I did it anyways) and i‚Äôd get back on tik tok to make myself tired &amp; stop thinking. 

i finally passed out. morning comes and my ex &amp; his mom are off to work, i get a call when my ex gets to his job, somethings off so i ask whats wrong, 

apparently, his mom calls me sneaky because i put my phone down &amp; she basically says she cant trust me, and she admits she‚Äôs been texting his little sis about me this entire time &amp; gave her my number to text me. lmao... so i freak out, and my ex drops the bomb on me saying his mom said we‚Äôre just gonna live in a hotel forever, 

(there‚Äôs alot about his mom and the apartment situation i‚Äôm not gonna get into, lets just say she‚Äôs super fucking weird and wont do her adult business &amp; shes been living in hotels for over 4 months) 

my family told me specifically they‚Äôd hate for me to live in a hotel and i‚Äôm not gonna stress them out like that. also, i‚Äôm 20 yrs old and i‚Äôm not gonna live my life in a hotel with my ex and his insane mom. 

my ex is telling me I should go home, because he cant handle this etc. so thats what i did. plane ticket and all baby, i leave on that monday. it hurts like hell, but I was hoping he‚Äôd be there to support me. 

the upsetting part is: that means I have one more weekend with her alone. LOVE THAT! 
anyways, Saturday pops up, his moms on the phone for HOURS in the morning, every single light on in the hotel, 5am til 12pm,

 (this isnt the first time shes done this either, she started doing this the second week i was there), ANYWAYS! apparently; while i was turnt the entire opposite away from her, different bed and all, I was, ‚Äúbreathing hard‚Äù, and when i went to the bathroom she was talking shit about me to my now ex. (didnt know this until she went out to the car to take him to work) 

so i‚Äôm pissed off at this point. although she‚Äôs mentally put me through hell the past 2 weeks I would never be disrespectful to anyone, especially in a whole different state with nobody to back me up.. thats just not smart, or who i am. i‚Äôd let someone spit in my face before i get disrespectful because thats how i was raised. its like she wanted every and any reason to not like me to the point where she was literally making up things in her head to piss me off, or not like me. 

i dont say a word to her at all, til the day i left. 

now, my ex (woah surprising) wants nothing to do with me and now, im stuck thinking: holy shit, did i actually do something? what did i do? like i‚Äôm sobbing my brains out everyday because i had real genuine love for him and even for his mom, and i‚Äôm just so utterly shocked all of this even happened. :/

basically, what im posting this for is, was i really an asshole or something?? what could i have done differently? I wanna be with him with EVERYTHING in my soul, but he just... doesnt care anymore. i feel like this entire thing was just a whole set up :/",06Dec2020,1

331,"Long story short, over a year ago I had to move away from my really great friend who I almost dated but we decided not to officially date because we knew I was moving states (we are both currently 19 right now also). Fast forward to a few months ago where we stayed talking a lot, we have a 80 day snapstreak on snapchat and pretty much all those days were actual conversations and not simply saying Hi or something.

Anyway about 2-3 months ago I video called her and told her that I still had feelings for her even after a year of being apart. She said she was trying to get rid of those feelings but she admitted she also still felt similarly. We ended up ending the video call and conversation by saying we should talk about it another time during another video call. However its been months and no real mention of it has been brought up 

When we talk sometimes us saying how we wish the other was there comes up or we reminisce about the things we did together in the past. She was going through some really hard parts in her life and I told her that i would always be there for her. 

She is perfect in every way and even with just messaging over snapchat we are still getting closer and closer. I honestly want to be with her and want to bring up to her maybe doing a long distance relationship with her, or at least bring up the video call we were saying we should have.

I‚Äôve noticed lately my heart rate gets to be 107-108bpm at odd times of the day. Today was cause for concern cause it lasted more than half the day. I use a Fitbit to track my heartrate, and it says my overall heart health is fair-average and my avg bpm is 87. It was only the past week or so I‚Äôd see it specifically at 107-108 at times. No other symptoms than just shakiness and general anxiety. I drank some coffee today, so that may be why, and I drink it from time to time but have been trying to lay off it the past few weeks. So the last few times I‚Äôve seen this spike, I hadn‚Äôt been drinking it. I would just be doing homework or sitting in my bed and check my watch to see 108 bpm.

For reference I‚Äôm 21F and was pretty healthy before circumstances at my uni led me to being very inactive and stressed a lot the past month. My mom has a history of tachycardia and I think had to get surgery for it after her pregnancy with me in her 30s.",06Dec2020,1

He is 23 now, about a year ago he moved out of my place because he tried to let his 60 year old boyfriend/girlfriend move in with us fulltime and my fiance and i didn't want the extra company. I try calling him every now and then and recently sent him a message asking if he wanted to talk to me and he said, I'll talk just not much. I replied with a decently long message asking about our friendship and stuff and no reply.

 I guess I'm just venting, I'd do anything for him and feel like he doesn't see that.. my conclusion which is harsh but possibly true, is that he is on something. Im not saying I don't ever do drugs, I've just seen in the past how they can cause this type of not wanting to socialize. So, either he hates me now or is using a hard drug again. Honestly, it's not like he's ever busy.. what am I missing here?

336,"Throwaway for reasons. I work in a small medical clinic, and the doctor I work for recently vacationed in Cancun, Mexico. Travel to Mexico at this time is highly discouraged, but he claimed it would be very safe because they want tourists there. He had a big Thanksgiving gathering even though it was highly discouraged in our state, and he thinks covid is being overblown. He was very vocal about this. He also told quite few patients about his vacation plans, but decided to keep things on the ""down low"" when they started asking him if we was going to quarantine when he got back. 
In our state the CDC lists specific instructions on what to do if you return from Mexico. You're supposed to get tested for covid 3-5 days after return and quarantine for a week.

342,"As my parents are getting older the subject of their final will has come up and I need some advice.

Little background, we are 3 brothers, I am the youngest.

The only thing my parents are going to leave to us is their house which worth about 1.5 million.

Now comes the tricky part. My parents have helped my two older brothers a lot financially during their life. paying for some of their mortgage, buying them cars,  paying their loans, etc. While I never got anything and I also never asked for anything as I was always able to sustain myself and never spent too much.

As a result of that my parents decided that I alone will get their house and my two brothers will get nothing as they already ""Got their share"" during my parents life. 

The thing is that I don't feel comfortable getting it all for myself, while me and my two brothers have great bond between us, I am sure when the day will come and I will sell my parents house for a large sum and take it all for myself - this will create  tension between us and can set us apart, which will be horrible.

But I also want that everything will be fair and that we will all get an even share.

What I thought suggesting is this:

Each one of my brothers got around 500,000 from my parents. so When it's time to sell the house - I will first take the 500,000 I never got and then we will split whatever left evenly between us.

It comes up to me getting 50% of the house and they will both split the remaining 50% between them.

Me and my parents talked about it - and they told me it's my decision to make.

Am I being a sucker for not just taking the house all for myself? I just want everybody to feel good about it , that there will be tension in the family and we will get our fair share.

Would love to get your opinions , thanks in advance!",06Dec2020,1
343,"I've never posted before, so if I'm in the wrong place to ask for advice just let me know.
So I am almost an adult, and long story short, because of issues going on at home I feel the need to move out as soon as possible. The problem is that I'm disabled. I won't get into it because that will take hours to explain, but basically on my best days (which are few and far between) I can be on my feet for 3 to 4 hours until I have to rest for the rest of the day, otherwise I will literally collapse and even pass out from the pain. Even on my good days, the pain can change in minutes, and I can't lift anything heavy, bend over too much, stand or sit still for to long, etc. On my worst days, which are very common, I can't walk or even see straight because I'm in so much pain. This has been going on for six years and it hasn't gotten better at all. I've tried everything that my family can afford, but it hasn't helped much. I have no way of knowing how I'm going to feel the next day, so I can't be consistent in a job. So most places wouldn't hire me on that alone. To make it worse, I'm not well educated. Every school I've been to, including several online schools, have kicked me out due to me not being able to keep up with the other students. Because of the pain that I'm in, I don't sleep much, and I have trouble focusing on anything. So when I did school, it was typically 3-4 days a week and about 1-4 hours a day. I was going to a school for about 8 months that said I was okay as long as I made some progress in my classes. It was great because I only had to focus on one or two classes at a time. I tried very hard, even after 4 hospital visits due to overworking myself, but at the very end of the year, this school told me that they were changing their policies. Now, because of this ""policy change"", I couldn't pass due to the fact that I had only completed 2 out of 8 classes. They told me that if I wanted to pass 9th grade I had to do the last 6 classes in the next 2 months, or they would start me over with classes, no credits. So I was held back my freshman year multiple times until they kicked me out. So technically, I only have an 8th grade education. Which makes getting a job even harder.... I'm not on disability because my parents haven't done anything about that yet and I don't know if they will. One of my parents has threatened to kick me out at 18 before. I've tried talking about getting on disability with them but I can't really make them do anything. As of right now I have no disability help. So basically, I can't live alone due to the help I need most days, I can't get a job, I have no money, and I have nowhere to go. What exactly can I do to get out my own? I have medications that I absolutely need for other reasons not related to my disability, and I don't have any money to pay rent, utilities, and of course groceries and medications even temporarily. I can't drive due to my disability. I just can't keep living in this house, everybody is always angry at each other. It's non stop screaming, crying, nagging, guilting, breaking things, etc. The only good thing I have is my brother, and he lives in another state 10 months of the year... Someone is always mad or frustrated with me, and no one communicates. My parents have been like this to me since as long as I can remember... I can't even repeat some of the things they've said to me and it's only getting worse. But at the same time, it's my only option to stay here. What do I do? I'm completely lost and I'm almost at my breaking point. I'm so close to giving up, I just want a normal life.

346,"(17F, High school senior, Science background)

There's a lot of background to this, but to put it simply I have been upset for the past 2-3 months for many reasons which I cannot help now. These things made me realize how I wasted like 5 years of my life in a place where I was not needed or valued. I also gave up on a friendship because of this and I find myself in a depressive state where I don't really want to talk to people or do anything at all really, I'm just pulling through each day and surviving by doing very little, being unproductive.

I believed that once I get some uni acceptances, I may get my focus back and be determined to finish my courses successfully, but that did not work either and it seems like I am just stuck in the past and in my own thoughts and those things which I have dreamt about for years also fail to make me feel happy. I cannot get over this sadness no matter how much I try. I shared this with my friends, family, and I tried distracting myself and engaging in activities that I enjoy, but none of it actually worked for more than a few minutes or hours.

Final exams are coming up soon and I absolutely need to get good grades, that has been the dream of my life. I have always been one of the good students and it wouldn't have been difficult for me otherwise but this entire struggle with my own mental well being is taking a toll on my concentration and all I do is overthink, cry about the past that I can't change, and a lot of things which ultimately do not help me in any manner whatsoever and further divert me from my academic goals. The fact that school is online is another hindrance, I just do not feel motivated to work because of the huge backlog and I procrastinate a whole lot.

I am willing to do about anything which will allow me to do some course correction. Please advice! Thanks a ton.",06Dec2020,1

Should I change it up? Make it shorter? Maybe erase the whole thing and send something generic? Is the whole idea too creepy to pull of without it being creepy?

350,"Hi,

So in Switzerland we got a pretty bad second wave, worse than a lot of EU countries. My city ranked at the top of Covid cases/1m pop between major EU cities in November for some time. We have a limitation of 5 people for gatherings, and the general saying to stay at home. Restaurants and bars are closed.

I live with my parents who are in their 60s and 50s, so definitely a bit more at risk for covid.

My significant other comes often at my house, usually on the weekends. We‚Äôre both pretty happy together. She lives on her own, in a collocation.

For this second wave lockdown I have done exactly like the first one. I haven‚Äôt seen any other friend than my girlfriend, especially during the past three very crucial weeks. Since I have my parents it‚Äôs easier to cope socially. Since she lives sort of alone, she obviously needs to see some friends, which is absolutely fine. I figure out since I see my parents it makes up for my social ‚Äúquantity‚Äù, and she makes up hers with the few 2-3 friends she occasionally sees.

I‚Äôm also being extra careful because of a job I have in December, for which I have no security. So if I have to isolate or even have it (we have to isolate for 10days here if you were with a person who had it, even if you test negative), I won‚Äôt be paid. And it might be one of the only jobs I‚Äôll get in the next few months probably...

We‚Äôre both pretty stressed out. Her roommate brought 8 person once at the apparemment to party (without masks or distancing, and a lot of alcohol) without asking her and she (and I) also was pretty upset. She even went up to them at some point and confronted them about not caring about restrictions and safety.

Her father has cancer so she‚Äôs trying to be very careful as well, because she sees him sometimes when she goes back to her parents (maybe once a month).

But Friday she tells me that one of her best friend organizes a party Saturday for her birthday, and that there will be at least 8 people (4 of which she never meet regularly). I thought that she shouldn‚Äôt go, it was absurd, that even if it seems hard to not do that, we have to stay strong and find alternatives. She agreed on just going before the others come to wish her friend happy birthday and all, which is pretty much ok. Her friend even told her that she had planned on asking people who were uneasy about breaking the restriction to come before others, so that there would be 2 groups (yes I know it‚Äôs kind of stupid, because then everyone would have seen everyone, but at least my gf would have been there first and not last). She was supposed to gather with her friend and another one who‚Äôs part of her 2-3 friends she usually meet with.

But she stayed for the whole party. 

Double standards much ?

Also we won‚Äôt be able to see each other for at least two weeks now if I want to be safe, and we didn‚Äôt see each other since last week. We were supposed to meet after she visited her friend. 

She knows all of this makes me anxious but she still went to the party. She took the risk that we wouldn‚Äôt see each other for 3 weeks total just to party.

She is so important to me during this lockdown, when we‚Äôre together it‚Äôs really great and relaxing. I need her these days. But she puts me in a difficult situation...

To me all of this is a question of principle. There‚Äôs a tiny chance for her to have got it from this party of course. But this is a matter of being civic, of being careful, together, even if those gathering limits seem arbitrary. Hell there will be less people at both of our Christmas dinners than this party.

361,"I discovered writing when I was 11. It's been my passion ever since. My whole family knows this and is very supportive. Normally, I write fantasy. However, my latest book is contemporary fiction and inspired heavily by my own experiences. 

So, the problem. I had my cousin read it. She loved it. Said she thinks I should try publishing it. But she doesn't think I should let my mom read it. The book is about two siblings deciding whether or not they want to reconnect with their estranged father. It pulls heavily from my own childhood because my dad was and presumably still is a total piece of shit. He emotionally abused my mom, came in and out of our lives as he pleased, and then cut all contact with me when I was 18 because I didn't send him a father's day text. The last time I tried to talk to him he casually mentioned that the only thing he felt bad about was that he would shake my brothers when they were babies to passively get back at my mom. Everything else was on us kids. The guy is a psycho, but sadly, it took me 20 years and a suicide attempt to realize it. And even then, if he called me up right now, I'd go running to him in a heartbeat.

The book dad is just a deadbeat, nothing more. And the story is more about how his absence affected the relationship of the siblings. It's about them growing up, growing apart, and then coming back together. I didn't take much directly from my own life, but there's obvious parallels. My relationship with my brothers is what made my childhood bearable. 

My cousin admitted that there were a few scenes that she even struggled to read, and that she had to keep reminding herself it was fiction. She's worried those scenes will destroy my mom. She's also worried about me. In my family, we don't talk about shit. Ever. Literally, my mom wouldn't even let us mention our dad growing up. None of us went to therapy, either. Not even after I almost died. They act like it didn't happen, which to be honest, was kind of nice at the time, but like, damn.

My cousin basically told me that I need to really think about it before I let anyone else read this book. She even said part of her wants me to tuck it away and move onto the next story, but she also thinks that's not fair to me because it's the best thing I've ever written.

And to be honest, this book means more to me than anything else I've ever written. I'm not saying it's a masterpiece, but it matters. I want to share it.

So I don't know what to do. My mom knows I've been working on something the last year and drops hints all the time that she'd like to read it. I've tried warning her that it's unlike anything else I've written and that she may not like it, but she brushed me off. 

My current plan is to let my brothers read it, and if they tell me it's not worth pursuing, I'll hide it away and tell her that I scrapped it.

Knowing my family, I'm 90% certain that's what's going to happen.",06Dec2020,1

364,"Hi, I was on a discord server when I said some things revealing details of  the server owner's private life, on a corner of the internet where the people involved would rather stay anonymous to the broader world. I made allusions to their life and career after googling their username. I wish I had privately warned them of the potentially unwanted connection, but I made the brazen, cavalier, and asinine mistake of mentioning it in public, on their server, and they were creeped out and irate. I was immediately banned from their server and had most connections severed. Although I absolutely refuse to test this, I do not believe that I have been completely blocked from all communication on all social media platforms. I feel deeply horrible for what I did and the consequences it could have had, if the server owner hadn't caught it and banned me. This has been keeping me up, even after multiple doses of CBD and Melatonin in a futile effort to go to sleep.I was a big fat creep and I feel absolutely horrible for it. I wish to further apologize to them, but I'm wondering as to the best timing and wording for when I do that.

I have wanted to be a doctor for as long as I can remember, and my family was always supportive of that idea.

However, these past couple of months I've been thinking that I don't want to do this anymore. I'm now thinking about becoming a mortician.

They told me that it's basically a dead-end job and I won't go anywhere with that, but I truly believe this is what I want to do.

I also have a picture of what he looks like, if I‚Äôd ever need it. I‚Äôve searched obituaries and news articles in my country (Canada), and various provinces.

388,"So start in July of this year, my brother's girlfriend calls my girlfriend a whore and insults her repeatedly telling her to leave and never come back.  She is worried that my girlfriend wants to be with my brother.  My girlfriend was over at my place at the time taking care of me I had a broken collarbone.  When this happened, I could not stand to be there.  I took some of my things and spent the night at her house and the next day, had my parents pick me up (I couldn't drive) and I stayed with them 2 hours away.  She visited every week on her days off.

After about a month of this going on, we found out she was pregnant.  I am so excited because my partner was perfect for me and we were going to be starting a family together.  My parents and my older brother were supportive, but my girlfriend did not want my other brother and his girlfriend to have anything to do with the baby.  I understood why she felt that way at the moment but felt like things can be fixed.  A few months later we found out we were having a miscarriage.  This was really overwhelming and heartbreaking.  She was so overwhelmed by this on top of how fast our relationship moved due to an unexpected pregnancy and having been slut-shamed by my brother and his girlfriend, it was too much for her to continue the relationship.  We broke up.  The stress from the slut-shaming never went away for me, I am still grinding my teeth about it.  I am respecting that she wants space but things got weird.  My parents don't understand why I still care about this because ""she left me in our time of need"".  It's much more complex than that and every time I explain the full situation, I get told that I need to see things from a different perspective and in cases tell me how I should see it exactly.  My brother's girlfriend's actions were immature and they triggered her.  I can't stop thinking that she and my brother need a reality check and then to own up to their actions.  My older brother who was supportive of the pregnancy is now telling me I need to stop trying to back her up.  I can't stop feeling as though I can do something to fix this situation but I also know I can't change people.  Taking into account that I can't change people, are these really the people I want to be around?  I can't afford to live on my own yet because I'm still in school.  It just feels so unfair I have tried to confront them so many times but it's like talking to a brick wall.  

I haven't talked to my ex in 3 months but I still have faith in our relationship, even with my whole family telling me not to.  I know that's my person.  I don't know how I can be happy if my family does not learn and grow from this.  I don't want to be closely affiliated with such negativity and I will even go as far as to say oppression.

I think I just need to gather myself more to find a solution.  I feel like getting a perspective of someone who is not anxious/depressed/infuriated/helpless could be helpful which is why I decided to write this post.  I miss my person but I won't stop at anything to make things right because she is amazing and she does not deserve to be treated the way that she was treated.  Even if we're not talking right now I am determined to fix the problem because it does not exist between me and her it exists within my family.  It's a form of ignorance.  My girlfriend was not a whore she was my partner and we had a powerful connection beyond sex. We didn't even have sex until we were seeing each other for around a month.

390,"I am a university student who is having trouble staying focused and am concerned about my mental health. 

I have started to realise that I have been becoming much less focused throughout the day nowdays to the point where it is nearly affecting every small action that I do. 

This issue really started to become apparent to me when I got fired for making too many careless mistakes during my previous job. I was told about two months ago that I had been making such mistakes by my seniors and thought that these were just bad habits that I had to fix. I tried fixed them by checking all my work consistently before submitting anything but I kept making small mistakes which I could not catch on to when checking rigorously. 

This has also been affecting me at home, as I sometimes loose focus on the tasks that I do and again make small mistakes, like buying the wrong groceries when going out or missing out on parts of instructions that have been told in detail to me. Sometimes, I also forget to do tasks when it is right infront of me.  

When I was in university however, I felt that I was quite competent as I got consistent As on all my courses and took care of things quickly that came by me. 

This is now starting to worry me as I feel that I am loosing my grip and slowly becoming redundant. I worry about the smallest thing whenever I go out or have anything to do. I am in constant panic in somedays and am worried about my future. I keep trying to fix all these mistakes by cleaning my room, going to the gym, reading more books and putting some time into hobbies. However, even when doing these tasks there is this lingering feeling that something is catching on to me.  I am also starting to loose interests in my friends, family and just life in general.

And another book presentation in May that I definitely won't do.

I have no idea where this comes from, I was always loud in kindergarten and to about 4th grade so maybe it was the bullying or idk.

Last night we didn‚Äôt leave until 10. Not a huge deal, but we‚Äôve left late every single time I‚Äôve closed. I live 30 minutes away from home too, so it does make a difference. Instead of getting home at 10:00 - 10:20 I‚Äôm getting home at 10:30 - almost 11.

398,"It started in school when four of us in photography class, it was Phillip, Bruce, Reid and I. We were planning to go to the city to take photos for our photography class. We also decided to invite our friend Nolan since Phillip doesn't have a phone to take photos with so we invited Nolan as he had a phone and complimented our group. But, we were talking about this after school and our other friend called Pat overheard our conversation regarding the city. 

Later in the night, we all got on discord to discuss our city plan. Then, Pat joined our call. He then started to slowly force himself in our plan and none of us could tell him to stop as it would have been extremely rude as Pat is our friend as well. All of us including Nolan don't want him to come but Phillip and Reid are open about it and have already told Pat that they don't want him to come. That leaves Nolan, Bruce and I. Deep inside none of us want him to come but we have been telling him that we don't mind as we don't want to be rude. The main reason nobody wants Pat to come is that even though he is our friend and is close to us, he won't fit our group well and will upset the vibe. Nolan, Bruce and I don't have the heart to tell him we don't want him to come.

This is the advice part, should we invite Pat or not? All of us are leaning towards a no but we cannot tell him directly. We need a way where we can tell Pat we don't want him to come in a polite manner and where Pat understands too.",06Dec2020,1
399," So I really loved this girl, I asked her out as soon as I got to know she liked me back. So everything was going smooth in the beginning, we used to text and call eachother a lot. We even met eachother twice in this duration, the second one was kind of a date. But after that date, everything went downhill, she told her mom that she had a boyfriend, her mom was angry for sometime but then she accepted me. A few days later her dad got to know about me too, and her dad is really strict, so she cleared all the chats with me and blocked me on instagram. Then she told me that she convinced her dad that I'm just a friend. Then we started talking once again, after a while her mom got to know that she went on a date with me too, this time her mom was not happy about it. So now I can't message her on instagram neither on whatsapp, I can't even call her. And it's not like her mom is really angry with her, or her mom watches her 24/7, she is always active on both the social medias but she has told me to not message her there. After that we started talking on snap, she used to talk to me there as well but it lasted for only 4-5 days. She has told her mom that I don't use snap plus she has muted me on snap. I can only message her when she wants, she is always active on instagram and whatsapp yet she doesn't open my messages on snapchat for at least 4 hours. I told her why are you doing all this, then she started to talking even lesser. And one day told me that I was being too clingy and she can't talk to me for the whole day. But I'm not even saying to talk for the whole day, we don't even talk 10% of what we used to. I really need more people's opinion on this",06Dec2020,1

However recently, for 1-2 months now the daughter will only sleep in 10-20 minutes intervals at night. So for example, she might go to bed around 8pm and then every 10-20 minutes she wakes up crying. Then she gets put back to sleep and the same thing happens. Then again and again and again. My sister doesn't get more than 10-15 minutes of sleep at a time and this has been going on for a couple months now and she's just really struggling with sleep. She's always tired and you can tell she's exhausted. Shes recently moved back in with my mum and she's trying to get some much needed rest but I thought I'd see if there is anything that could be the cause for her daughter waking up so often. Prior to this she's slept for a few hour chunks at a time. 

Im my sisters brother, am 19 years old and tbh I have no idea about baby-keeping but I'm sure something must be up? Atm my sister and mom can't seem to figure anything out. One thing I was thinking is that it could be constipation or something along those lines? Her daughter is transitioning into eating soft foods/baby foods and my family has a history of having troubles with our digestive systems. My sister herself has crohns for example.

The good news is that they're trying to avoid putting more people in jail right now (for obvious reasons), so in a sense I was lucky...

...But sadly my crime wasn't ""minor"" enough that community service or straight probation was enough.

I accepted a plea deal to avoid jail time (normally not possible for this crime), but part of my probation conditions will be smelling this really-horrible-smelling-stuff for 5 minutes straight, on 4 separate occasions.

No idea what it is, other than that it's not considered harmful. My lawyer told me that ""malodorants"" have started to be used in jails here as a more humane alternative to solitary confinement, to deter prison fights / rule violations...so I guess with 2020 being how it is, it's now being used for criminal offenses too.

I have been without any symptoms, and have not been tested for the virus, so I might be an asymptomatic carrier, which is very dangerous for others.

okay. i don‚Äôt want dirk back at this time but still love him. so eventually i get with somebody else and time moves on. we break up, in the beginning of this year, i go about my life single and happy, then one of my friends me and cunt hung out with got in a car crash. cunt reaches out to me multiple times before this, begging for forgiveness. i also see that she‚Äôs dating fucking bum at this point, so i reached out to the guy *cunt was dating when i was with dirk*, we‚Äôll call him al. Al told me she was a worthless hole for fucking basically. he always gave me the dirt even when i didn‚Äôt ask for it. we were good friends, along with my friend who had gotten in the car accident. i have been with his mom, it is a sad fucking time for them and me. but i refuse to talk to cunt. so in september i started dating an amazing guy who is friends with bum. they haven‚Äôt hung out since we started dating that i know of, but my boyfriend is aware of *everything*. so one day some harmless facebook scrolling led him to find her post about being 2 months pregnant. i howled of laughter. 
karma is golden. i‚Äôm sure dirk is fucked up but he also kind of deserves it imo. now cunt and bum are not together. i kind of wanna know why but don‚Äôt care. Al thought the baby was his but the time didn‚Äôt match up. this girl cheated on every guy she‚Äôs been with, with AL. so my advice would be...after all these years should i even forgive her? will she try to fuck my current boyfriend? why is she trying to be my friend?",06Dec2020,1

445,"Until last year I was in an all girls school and I was comfortable, had enough friends and people to talk to. A few months ago I decided to move to an all boys school - in Y12 and Y13 it‚Äôs mixed but the majority of students are boys. I found it difficult to adapt because I didn‚Äôt really know how to make friends with boys after not talking to any for so long. 

I‚Äôm quite a shy person in general so I find it hard to make friends. Me throwing myself out of my comfort zone and into a completely new environment didn‚Äôt make my life any easier. I made friends with a few other girls and one boy but that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt have any classes with most of them anyways so I only get to see them at break/lunch. 

So in class I don‚Äôt have friends and I just end up sitting there while everyone chats to each other. I honestly feel like I don‚Äôt exist sometimes because no one talks to me, even the teachers don‚Äôt pick on me. I might as well be invisible.

I know that I can‚Äôt expect to make friends with people by just sitting there and waiting for people to talk to me, but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to talk to people because I never know what to say or how to start a conversation. I have quite poor social skills tbh. It‚Äôs one of the things I hate about myself. 

People have made an effort to talk to me in the past but I never have anything interesting or funny to say because I don‚Äôt know them well so I end up saying something weird. I take ages to understand what people are saying to me and think of something to say back to them. I find it really exhausting and I feel like that‚Äôs not normal but idrk.

I had to self isolate for two weeks and I recently got to return to school. When I was stuck at home I felt really lonely because I missed my friends and I wanted to talk to them. I went back to school a few days ago and I thought I would be happy to see them. But I wasn‚Äôt. After not speaking to anyone for two weeks I somehow kinda lost the few social skills that I had. I felt like I was back to square one and I was so angry at myself. Anyway I‚Äôm back in self isolation now so it‚Äôs only gonna get worse yay

I keep a lot of these feelings bottled up inside until I end up crying my eyes out or something and I don‚Äôt tell my friends because I don‚Äôt trust them. I know they just want to help me but I just can‚Äôt because of my trust issues - another problem caused by none other than myself. Basically I find it difficult to trust people with my secrets because when I was younger whenever my friends told me something I had to go and blurt it out to someone else. I saw how upset it made them but I couldn‚Äôt help myself. I feel like if I told someone a secret now they‚Äôd betray me or something because I‚Äôve done it to other people. I know this is stupid but I can‚Äôt help it. 

I know this sounds like a whiny post by an edgy introverted teenager, and that‚Äôs kind what it is, but I just had to get this out",06Dec2020,1
446,"Hey everyone, 

I've had a problem with spending way too much time on technology (wake up, on the phone until I get on my PC, stay on my PC the whole day, take my phone with me even to like piss breaks, etc, go to bed, repeat). I have a full time job and I'm a full time college student, so obviously when I'm doing either of those, what I said isn't applicable. But I'm still always checking my phone. Anyway, I need to stop but I don't know how. Every free moment at work im on Reddit or Twitter. My life is consumed by this right now. I wanted to sell my PC and get a laptop which doesn't have the processing power necessary for games, but as its a gift from my parents who really want me to keep it (for some reason, even though they know my issue).

I'm 21 years old so its not like I can't just decide to sell it anyways, but I'd feel bad since they don't want me to. Does anyone have any tips? My overall goal is to check social media a few times a day, cut back on my YouTube watching to maybe an hour or two, and completely cut video games out of my life entirely (this is because every time that I try to self moderate I end up back in this cycle. I've tried to fully quit twice but I started again this last time because I was extremely bored bc of covid). Its gotten to the point where my school is lacking because I leave everything to the last minute. Thanks for any responses.

TL;DR: I have an extreme tech addiction and want to almost fully cut it out of my life.",06Dec2020,1
447,"I‚Äôve never made a post on Reddit so please excuse me not using the typical form that people usually use, sorry yall. So for some background, pretty much my whole life I‚Äôve been abused by my parents. Physically, verbally, mentally, you name it. Very stereotypical strict Asian household where everything they say goes and any efforts to reason or converse on topics to amend issues become seen as back talk and disrespectful and since I‚Äôm disrespecting them I‚Äôm a terrible child so it‚Äôs okay to them to abuse me. I‚Äôve tried to hold up and not let it get to me until I can figure out a way out but my plans were completely screwed by covid. Before this I had a job and saved up all of my checks to move out and had some people to move with but now none of us are able to continue with those plans bc of financial issues. Lately it‚Äôs gotten worse and I‚Äôm really struggling to just let them continue to hurt me time after time. Last time this happened I got kicked out and crashed at a friends house for a month but I feel bad doing something like that again, I don‚Äôt want to burden my friends and couch surf for who knows how long without a plan or a source of money. I‚Äôm very high risk to the virus and can‚Äôt work so I‚Äôve been stuck quarantining with them. Today was especially bad with the constant bickering and screaming fits and led to me uncovering that they‚Äôve been working unmasked at times(they work as nurses mind you) and hang out with a ‚Äúrelative‚Äù (friend of theirs) who goes out often and doesn‚Äôt wear a mask, even going as far as going to a party. Typical uneducated boomer shit but god is it frustrating and this also happened two days before my 20th birthday so it‚Äôs been really draining and overwhelming. They constantly use their ‚Äúimmense care‚Äù for me to guilt me to feel bad for pointing out their mistreatment and neglect towards me and my health and it‚Äôs absolutely aggravating having to constantly justify why I should be treated decently. I don‚Äôt have any family here so I can‚Äôt really stay with other people and I wouldn‚Äôt want to anyways because all of my family is the same as my parents. Thankfully I have a really supportive friend group that‚Äôs done a lot to get me away from them as much as possible. I live in Cali so it‚Äôs really hard to just move out randomly without a stable job/ roommates/ a good plan. If you guys know any online jobs that aren‚Äôt insanely impossible to get into I‚Äôd appreciate the help, as well as websites that help find low income apartments since everything here is priceyyyy as hell. I‚Äôve built up a good credit, done taxes before, and saved up a good amount of money so I‚Äôm not really going in blind but it‚Äôd be super helpful to get some assistance in this realm since I‚Äôm new to adulting. I wanted to study abroad or try moving to another country since it‚Äôs cheaper than America and has a better government but I also have zero experience with moving and I have no idea how to do any of the paperwork for any of that. So if you also know how to apply to abroad programs/move to another country that‚Äôd also help a lot.",06Dec2020,1
448,"Ok so last night I was really drunk and was drunk texting a lot of people. I told one of my close friends of 2 years, who I always kinda liked. That I USED to like her. But I still do.

Now she said she‚Äôs feeling a bit competitive with her and would like to get with me too. The problem is I don‚Äôt know how to tell her that I lied and that it everything that happened between us would be built off a lie.

I defo won't fuck with someone like that again.

I don't miss her and i've moved on and have been doing better if you exclude the trust/love issues and the pain waves but goddamn the pain waves have been hitting me for some time since she's messed me up yet she got what she wanted from the jump and i haven't even done one thing that could be wrong or messed up.

For the last few weeks, it happened almost every night. In my dreams, I'm getting hurt. Usually bitten by animals or insects, but also just beaten or occasionally electrocuted. It hurts *a lot*. I didn't even know that dreams can hurt that much. I understand that this is a dream, but I can't affect it like it was a lucid dream, and I can barely move at all -- it's as if I'm partially paralyzed or moving through molasses.

Follow along because this will be a mess, but hopefully, I explain it well enough and can get some help.

So  I take Venlafaxine for my Anxiety and Depression. 2 pills a day, 12  hours apart. One at 7:30 am and one around 7 pm usually. My medicine  makes me legitimately hibernate, I need a minimum of 8 hours of sleep  with a proper schedule for sleep and my medicine to not get out of whack  (keep this in mind)

I quit my job  and had another one lined up with 2 weeks off before I started my new.  Well, tomorrow is my first day at orientation for my new job and I have  to be there at 6:45 am.

Imagine  this, I'm 20 and I started staying up until around 3 and waking up at 11  am. This was a week ago, from there my medicine was taken as soon as I  woke up at 11. Making another schedule out of whack.

It has only gotten worse, it somehow became me going to bed at 7 am-10 am and waking up when it's dark out at 5.

I've  pulled the god ol' ""all-nighter"" to force myself to try and fix it. I  am currently making this post as that ""all-nighter"".  Plan on staying  awake until 8 pm and waking up at 5 am. (Couple of days ago when I did  this my eyes slammed shut at 7 pm and I naturally woke up at 4 am.)

So  my current schedule is my body wanting to go to sleep at 7-10 am and  waking up 5-6 pm. I have tried melatonin, NyQuil, even marijuana. They  all clash with the medicine. They don't work well with me.

I use the filter for the blue light on my phone and pc. I haven't been going to the gym these last 2 weeks either.

Hopefully, this post wasn't repetitive and someone can help me out with this as I need it fixed ASAP.",06Dec2020,1

460,"I work for a Union in construction. Specifically in a nuclear power plant right now, where there are thousands on construction workers of different fields. (Pipefitters, electricians, iron workers, etc...) Anywhere from 5 to 10 workers in the same field are are together in groups called a crew. In each crew a person is selected by a general foreman (higher up than a foreman) to be the foreman (leader, manager, boss, whatever you want to call it) of the crew. The selection is based on two categories; how qualified you are for the position, and more importantly, how well you can kiss up to the general foreman.

I've had dozens of foreman in my short 6 or 7 years in construction. It's a position that has a relatively high turnover rate I believe.

If a boss on any other job is no longer deemed fit for the position, that person is usually let go from the company. But my job is a little different. If a foreman is unfit for the position they are usually demoted and switched to a different crew, and someone from the old crew gets selected for the job. It's happened plenty of times.

If you are a disrespectful foreman, then the moment you get demoted from the position, all the people on your level are going to remember how you treated them when you DID have power. And we all know how good people are at holding grudges.

But it begs the question, how can you discipline someone below you, when in a week, a month, or a year you could be demoted back to the same level as the people you disciplined?

It seems like a constant battle between keeping the respect of the people who currently work under you, (but in the future will work beside you) yet getting the job done in a timely cost effective manner that keeps higher ups off of your back?",06Dec2020,1

Me and my gf (both 22) are moving to a new city for both of us, i am still studying and she just found a lovely job in this new city. But for her to be able to go to work every day/night she needs to live there because we both live quite far away from her work. 

Now we have been talking about living together before and we really want to but the only thing i most look up to is i don't have anyone there, she will deffenitly meet new people trough her work and other things. But because of corona i've been having school at home for the past 9 months and you can't go do something here because almost everything is closed due to corona. 

Now my question is how would you meet new people in a city your moving to without you knowing absolutly anyone ? i will go to the gym there because that's the one of the only things we are allowed to do, but that's not really a place you meet new friends.

463,"Hi, I am a 21 year old final year university student. Generally, I have lead a regular life for the most of my life until last year. Late last year, I had appendicitis and I had to do an operation to get it removed. After the operation everything seemed normal till a few months ago I had general health issues of varying types of pain as well as constant nausea. After going to the ER everything seemed normal I was told to ignore it. The issues kept getting worse for a few months and I spent the last few months throwing up and in intense pain, going from different MDs of different professions trying to figure out wtf was wrong with me and doing at least 30 tests that varied from blood tests and scans etc.

I heard varying things from that it could be stress or its all mental, after the 21th doctor inspection turns out during the appendicitis operation something went wrong and the issue hasn't been fully resolved, and a remains of the operation were present. I was instructed to wait a bit and assess whether the pain would be getting worse before I performed another operation as it would be quite a risky one.

I currently live in a state right now where I am constantly charging my phone all day and all night expecting at any moment something happens where I need to scream for someone to take me to the ER. Every minor pain I start to think whether this is something different or because of the operation I am supposed to do, and start going down a rabbit hole of googling and just getting worried. Its gotten to a point where I would sometimes have my phone next to me at all times and get dressed expecting a rush to the hospital.

I know this is more of a medical issue but I want to just live my life and stop constantly waiting for that terrible thing that might happen or might never happen, especially since I haven't left my house due to online university and COVID being bad in my region. I know I should be grateful that I don't have serious health issues like other people but I just don't feel like I am living my life.

Thanks for listening to this rant! Any help on how to stop worrying about it would be great!

468,"Hi there, something has been happening these past few weeks and it‚Äôs been bugging me. I am 22F, and last year I purchased a ground floor unit. The unit complex has 24 units, a ground floor and second floor. It has a gate for the car park, but also an open access area which means any of the general public can get into the complex area, which usually consists of visitors, Uber eats drivers and the like. I live here alone, and I am a smoker. I have a little seat and ashtray outside my my front door, under my kitchen window. For the last couple of months I‚Äôve been noticing my ashtray (a old planter pot) has been mysteriously losing about a handful of the cigarette butts every few days. 
The other day I ‚Äòcaught‚Äô the person stealing them, a seemingly homeless person, who had a bottle of wine in his hand. When I asked him what he was doing he just grumbled and asked if he could have a cigarette. I told him that I‚Äôm not the one who smokes and that it was there for my friends who do smoke and he leaves. The cigarette butts keep disappearing so I know he‚Äôs been coming back.

Today I go out there and the whole ashtray is gone, and I had been out there not 15 minutes before. It was freaking me out. I didn‚Äôt see or hear anything.

It‚Äôs not the cigarette butts that I‚Äôm concerned about, they are literally my trash and the dude is probably using the last remnants of tobacco to roll into new ones. It‚Äôs the fact that there is at least one, if not more, homeless people coming right up to my front door to take stuff. What if they notice I live alone, or if they start to figure out what times I‚Äôm leaving for work. I have a fairly regular work schedule and let‚Äôs face it the level of security on my property is nothing. 

I have no idea how to curb this anxiety that something will happen while I‚Äôm gone or even worse, while I‚Äôm still there. But also, I don‚Äôt want to be part of the statistic of criminalising homelessness and being THAT person.",06Dec2020,1

476,"The title says it all. When I (22F) was 18 I moved away with my boyfriend and my best friend (23) stayed living with her parents. We used to get along so well! But after I went through a few rock bottoms and not being able to go back home.. I‚Äôve changed as a person in general. My ex and I didn‚Äôt last very long.. he left me to pay for the rest of the lease, I then found a roommate, and then got my own apartment. After so much moving around the state and struggling to find a meaning to life.. i became spiritual within myself &amp; finally got my AA which led me to the decision to move back to my hometown to finished off my bachelors and masters. My best friend from high school was stoked about this, as well as myself. As soon as we reunited, I‚Äôve realized she‚Äôs been extremely stagnant in life. This does not bother me.. If I could live with my parents I would. She is a year older then me yet still has this high school mentality. Judged me for having a one night stand last year, and has a very heavy opinion on other peoples business. This doesn‚Äôt mean she is toxic, she is actually a really thoughtful person and I want to emphasize that. Although she had her pros, there certainly are a few more cons. She is quick to judge, and seems to have started copying everything I do (including my spirituality). I‚Äôm happy to be an influence on her however, it almost seems unauthentic and a joke. It would be different if she actually took it seriously however, it is more of a hobbie to her and she portrays it in the wrong ways. Id rather just not hear about it if I were to be honest. We have established a friend group that I feel so happy to be a part of but none of them pay their own bills and have the same experiences I have so it makes it really difficult when we have deep conversations to relate. They unconsciously judge me for working too much, tell me I don‚Äôt love myself when I talk about taking caution in my love life, and tell me everyone goes through what I do through to deal with it. They also call me over analytical which seriously hurts my feelings. I am the way I am because of what I‚Äôve been through and I should be allowed to talk about it. Now I‚Äôm just quiet and observant which sucks because I want people who want to know my story as much as I want to hear about theirs. It‚Äôs almost like they are non empathetic yet when something they go through occurs I‚Äôll get calls of them crying for advice. I realize maturity is on different frequencies here.. however I need advice on how I can relate better with her and subtlety tell her next time she says something to bother me. 

I did think about distancing myself already however, I do enjoy times with her and don‚Äôt want to dismiss our friendship over something I may be able to easily fix over some communication. I have had crappy friends and she is the only one who puts in effort to be by my side. I just need to figure out ways I can re-wire this friendship in general before it slowly effects my mental health.

So I‚Äôve really been wanting a dog, and recently was able to acquire a letter from my therapist stating that i need an emotional support animal. Here‚Äôs the catch.

I have tried my best to stay away from everybody except my brother, his girlfriend (of over 10 years) and my Mum. I've done it to respect what the government wants us to do, and what my brother wants cause then I can see him more. My Mum flip flops between social distancing and ""covid isn't that bad"" and at the moment she's visiting family, and even though internally I don't like it, externally I've said I support her choices. Last night she was mad at me for not wanting to see family, and was gaslighting me to hell and I've been learning techniques to combat gaslighting, keeping my voice positive and calm, and keeping my answers as short and non-informational as possible, and it worked. She was still mad and she was slamming things but she wasn't yelling at me or threatening me. She had no ammo to use. She already pulled the mental health card saying that me, her daughter, is killing herself and making herself very ill by staying inside and I'm actually dealing with my trauma (which she has acted and said she can't acknowledge cause it makes her feel guilty) better than ever, and I'm doing really well considering.

But she let it go.

Today, she brought up my birthday. She asked what I wanted, and I said to just stay in and play games with her, my brother and his girlfriend who all already said were coming. But now my family want to see me cause it's my 21st, which I understand, but they all know I'm social distancing. It's been my cousins 16th, my other cousin's 20th and my auntie's 50th. I didn't go to any of them, but I'm supposed to want them to come to mine? We've also already agreed to do one big birthday for everybody next year, but Mum says they still want to see me. My Nan who said was staying in her tier 1 home is now coming over and Mum says I should let her see me like I'm being selfish- but I'm not I'm keeping her safe and I know it's them that have told her to come over, and they should be telling her to stay safe at home.

If I let my family come over, my brother won't. I know him, I respect that, and it's valid. His girlfriend and her family are really at risk. I've already said no but my Mum won't take it. She's so mad and I'm so fucking anxious- I had a flashback and panic attack last night to when I had to choose between who I thought was my Dad and my Mum, cause it's the same feeling of my Mum''s wishes and my brother.

Uni is nearly over. During that time, after the vaccine is out, I'm going to learn how to drive and get a car, I've been saving money for it. Then a job, a high paying job with my college grades, and then I finish uni. With the money saved, unless I really like the job, I quit, get a job with my degree. Move out. Get the fuck out. Get into a different city, and get the hell out. I'm so close, just. Less than a year with that plan, I mean, march and I'm out, maybe september at the latest but this time next christmas I'm out of here and I'm safe but what the hell do I do with the next few weeks? I don't know how to be safe and I'm really scared man.

We talked non stop for a month before we saw each other. It went great. I saw him again last night and it went even better! He's the one. I don't say this lightly, we've been talking non stop for 6 weeks now, and we've talked going off with other people and how we'd be annoyed.

Anyways I live in a different country and I leave for 6 weeks for Christmas. We discussed how we'd meet up when I'm back and facetime over Christmas etc. He lives two hours away from me and is a medic student. He's very busy next week as I fly out in 6 days. I mentioned it to him about meeting up and he said he can't he's too busy and it wouldn't work maybe. 

I want to mention it on Tuesday saying is he free for like two hours on Wednesday. I would travel down and meet him and then say goodbye. We've been talking non stop and still are.

My life is great, it‚Äôs any kids dream, I have 2 loving parents, nice clothes, 3 caring siblings, i‚Äôm pretty good looking, and all the pretty girls like me. Even though there‚Äôs nothing really wrong with my life, I could really use a fresh start and maybe some excitement. Growing up I was always surrounded by music. My grandpa was a fairly popular Tejano artist down here in Texas and my brother is always playing instruments and writing music. I‚Äôve looked up to celebrities, mainly singers my whole life. Some of my main inspirations are Johnny Cash, Frank Sinatra, Selena Quintanilla, Travis Scott, A$AP Rocky, and so, so many more. I‚Äôve always watched movies and documentaries about singers such as Walk the Line, Selena, Purple Rain, you get the idea. I‚Äôve always been fascinated with the concept of the celebrity, having so many fans (and haters), having people listen to your voice 24/7, having the nice house and clothes, and it‚Äôs just something I want. I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm a great singer so I want to put that to use. I‚Äôve loved singing since I was a little boy. I can sing everything from country music to swing and I‚Äôm even pretty good at rapping. There‚Äôs just something in my heart that‚Äôs telling me I need to sing. I can‚Äôt even go a day without singing at least 20 songs. Singing just makes me feel happy and it makes me feel so good about myself. Whenever I listen to music I just feel something in my heart and I get filled up with energy and it just puts a smile on my face. I know being a famous singer is a very far fetched goal but I believe in myself 100% I just need some help. I know this can be a long process so that is why I want to try starting off so early in life. Other than that my main questions are:
‚Ä¢How can I get better at singing?
‚Ä¢What can I do to get over my shyness of singing i front of people?
‚Ä¢How can I get my voice out there?
‚Ä¢How can I learn to write make my own music without getting unmotivated?
‚Ä¢Just general advice

At the time I knew she (F 19) had troubles with anxiety and depression, but I didn't fully understand what she was actually dealing with. Throughout the last few months its become apparent that she has some serious issues that she needs to work on (thing like waking up in the middle of the night crying because she has no friends, or had a dream I didnt like her anymore), and frankly I have issues of my own I need to work on. The fact is that I have too much going on in my life right now to deal with the constant problems she brings to me, and even typing this right now I feel like an asshole, but i need out of the relationship.

 Its not just that she has depression so i dont ike her or anything, im simply no longer attracted to her. I dont know how to tell her all this and im afraid of hurting her more than she already has been (her previous relationship ended with her getting cheated on), however i know that if i continue to see her without having feelings for her it will only make our inevitable breakup worse. 

Another issue is that she is constantly telling me that im the only good thing in her life, and that she has no other friends and if she didnt have me she would have no one. Every time she says this i feel worse about ending things, I mean I would have to be a monster to end things with someone who has no one else... right??? On top of this she feels the need to constantly give me gifts, which is great, but im afraid this will come up if i try to end things with her.

509,"Hi guys, 

I really could use your advice. This will be long so apologies in advance! 

So I was friends with this person (lets call her L) for about 7 years. When I tell you it was the most toxic friendship, I‚Äôm not even exaggerating. I‚Äôm an empath and I‚Äôm able to put myself in other people‚Äôs shoes and see things from their point of view whenever a problem arises. I am also very forgiving and have forgiven L on more occasions than I can count. L claims she‚Äôs an empath too but fails to ever see where I‚Äôm coming from whenever there is a misunderstanding between us. 

Any time I feel bad about the way she treats me and I try to bring it up with her, she victimises herself and gaslights me (we‚Äôre 25 by the way, lol). Whenever I try to tell her ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs best if we go out separate ways because this friendship is way too toxic‚Äù, she starts blaming me again and telling me I never told her I had any problems so how was she supposed to know‚Äù - which is a fair point but a lot of things she does that‚Äôs not ok is COMMON SENSE!!! But also, when I try to bring it up with her, I‚Äôm the evil one and she‚Äôs the victim so that‚Äôs why I refrained from bringing up any issues. 

About a year ago, I actually told her I wanted to distance myself because our friendship was so mentally draining. I was already struggling with my mental health and this wasn‚Äôt helping either. Once again, she made me feel like I‚Äôm the bad person but this time, I didn‚Äôt apologise - I just let it go and stopped talking to her. Then around March this year, she messaged me and asked me how I was doing (cause of the pandemic) and we started talking again. She asked to meet up and I kept delaying it as much as I could and eventually ended up meeting her around July ish (I‚Äôm from Australia and the pandemic had settled a lot by then). Sadly, lol, we started hanging out again. I‚Äôm such an idiot. 

Wait, here are two briefs examples: 
-one time, L asked me for MY HONEST opinion on whether I thought she was mature or not (someone had called her immature so she wanted to know). I told her, in MY opinion I thought she was more towards the immature side of things and then also mentioned that we all have different definitions and opinions on what maturity is blah blah blah... because she didn‚Äôt like my answer, she stopped talking to me for about 2 weeks and only started talking to me because we had booked a trip interstate prior to this event... I had apologised multiple times and told her it was ONLY MY opinion but she just decided to ignore me for 2 weeks because my answer didn‚Äôt match hers.... 

-another time, we planned something together and then she remembered she had made other commitments later that day so the plan was cancelled. L said she still wants to do something in the morning so we decided to wave up really early (like 5am) and go see the sunrise. I woke up around 4am and I called her up to see if she was awake and whether she still wanted to go (we were both so tired because we had only gotten about 3 hours sleep). We BOTH agreed to just go back to bed so I put my phone away and went to bed. I wake up around 10am and I see that she had texted me about 10 mins after our early morning call saying she wants to go after all... I never have my notifications on for messages and my phone was on DND so I didn‚Äôt even get her call. Then she proceeded to give me really blunt, awkward replies and started ignoring me again. Then we met up and she told me she was annoyed at me because I had cancelled the plan when she wanted to go... we literally decided together over the phone not to go... 

This is only two minor events. I can write a whole book on how badly she treated me. Anyways, recently we had another misunderstanding about ‚Äúme not confirming plans with her‚Äù lol and then I just stopped responding to her because I am genuinely done with her toxic self. However, today I was on Instagram and I noticed her out and about with her other friends doing what I had planned for us to do about a month ago... it felt really shady to me and I got super agitated. I just unfollowed her (a bit immature, I know). I think all my anger from the past events had built up and then seeing that IG story was the last straw for me. I feel so mad at L and I just want to go off at her... 

Please give me advice on what I should do. I know I‚Äôm not going to go off at her, lol but I need this anger and frustration to go away! :(((( idk if I‚Äôm just so mad at myself for allowing her to disrespect me and treat me the way she did... idk why she still has this much control over my emotions... please help üò≠",06Dec2020,1
510,"Hello Reddit, I'm at a loss

From around 10 months ago, my mom, without asking our opinion, said to a friend that he could live here with us.

He sleeps on the closed balcony in a bed that occupies the small space, the house is really small, an old T2 on the suburbs

He is the most manipulative, abusive and annoying person I have ever encountered. And I have an cheating ex, that's the level of my feelings right now. He is bipolar and blames everything on this, takes lots of meds and is a dick to everyone.

Some examples:

- He has the loudest voice ever all the time, so he always wakes me up earlier then I need just from existing (already told him to stop)

- He comes into my room all the time and start working here sendind really loud audios to his clients(while I'm on working hours)

- He open my drawers and is always touching my things, no privacy or respect that I once had in this house (even when I said ""don't touch this"")

- I can't go to the kitchen without being traped in a 1h conversation where is basically him talking all the time about random shit

-he is rude to me and say things about my body

- He NEVER do any of those things when my boyfriend is home, he knows what he is doing and he already
 admitted he was really manipulative in the past

- He has an opinion about everything, if I say im gonna do something he's like: ""NO BUT I KNOW ABOUT A CHEAP PLACE, you won't do there but here where I want"" (ofc I just do what I want and ignore him but is really about everything)

Things I tried to do:

- Talk to him and explain how I hate when he does this things and ask him to stop

- Talk to my family about how this is ridiculous

- Close the door and ignore the calls / no talking etc

So I was so overwhelmed that I decided to leave and was searching T0 around my place, and talked to my mom about this, she said: ""I can't just go and kick him out""

She feel pity for him and she basically adopted him and is using him to fill the gap my younger brother left (he is also problematic and bipolar and depressive but he's living in another country now. She always gave him more attention/love)

She basically chose him rather than me staying.

I really think he is making my life a living hell on purpose to what? Make me go away? For fun?

What I didn't tried yet: saying he has to move out. Because my mom doesn't want and she's always crying (she is easily manipulated by him) and how can I say that? This house is not mine.

Ah and HE DOESN'T PAY RENT lol because poor boy doesn't have enough money but bought the newest iPhone

The problem:

I only make 700‚Ç¨ per month. It can go up if i have more clients, but this is the ""base"" that I can count on

Rents here I super high and I can only find T0 around 450‚Ç¨/500‚Ç¨ honestly I don't mind eating rice everyday if that means I'm free, but I love my family and I'm really sad about leaving them and my dog. I do plan to visit a lot etc but is not the same

And it breaks my heart that my mom won't take my side on this, the thing is: I don't want to leave. I just want HIM out of my life.

I can't live with my boyfriend in a new house because he has no job and he is not looking for one at all (he is taking an curse tho about IT and is probably going to have an internship and work but that gonna take a while, like a lot) but he really support me and I love him and if it wasn't for him I don't know how I would be right now.

Tomorrow i will visit 2 houses with her and my boyfriend, and if I find a nice one for this price I guess I will take it, I mean, what else can I do?

I would really appreciate help and advice, people that where in this kind of situation etc. Should I go to him and say he has to leave? What right I have to do that? And would he even take me seriously?
Should I move out and just get my shit together and get the peace I want? Even if that means going away from the nest? We would live closely tho like 20min by car at maximum

I'm currently on Portugal so if anyone knows about some government help? Or things like that it would be great too

Thanks for anyone who read or helped it means a lot to me

TL,DR: I don't wanna leave home but this dude living with us is destroying my peace and I don't have lots of money to begging with. So Im here asking for help",06Dec2020,1
512,"Background: Each apartment in my building has a balcony or patio. As I am on the ground floor, my patio is level with the ground. While all the other apartments have a rail dividing neighboring patios, my patio and the neighbor's patio is one continuous, shared concrete slab with the fire exit door in the middle (technically taking up part of my patio).

Problem: Some of my building's tenants like to smoke out on the patio. Someone put a crappy plastic chair there so random people are always sitting out there smoking. The chair sits 3 feet from my patio doors on what is technically my patio. I have a number of issues with this. First, it's my damn patio, wtf. Second, the smoke seeps through our vents into our apartment and it reeks. And most importantly, they *throw their cigarette butts in the bushes in front of my patio and on my patio itself*.

I don't know if it's one resident or multiple because its usually dark when they're out there. I tried directly speaking to someone about it once but 75% of my building is Spanish-only speaking and I know almost no Spanish. (Also **literally** no one wears masks in my complex so I generally try to avoid conversations). It's important to note that there are multiple other places they can smoke - the front of the building, the gazebo 20 feet from my patio, or on their own damn balcony (everyone has one).

I've emailed the property owner but from my understanding they don't do much about tenant complaints unless it poses legal problems for the property company. I phrased it as a ""fire hazard"" so we'll see. I wanted to check with reddit to see if you all had any ideas for how I could manage it personally.

Currently I wear a pair of Adidas (not sure what model) that I found at Ross maybe 3 months ago and they're starting to have loose threads and a bit of peeling apart at the part of the sole that your toes go. I'm terrible at the names of these parts. The longest I ever had in good shape was a pair of Nike (again, I forget the name) that a friend gave me as a gift and they lasted maybe 9-10 months. I just need good, every day shoes. 

Routine for context:

Weekdays - 6am get up walk dog, go to work around 7:15. I work in a warehouse picking and packing for 8-9 hours. Get home, don't take off shoes and walk my dog again. 

Weekends - I work my second job at a deli, same shoes, for 4-8 hours. I walk my dog twice in the morning and if I'm not closing I walk her again when I get home. 

Basically I'm on my feet a metric fuckton and need something that will hold up. I hear good things about NoBull even though they're more for working out and crossfit, but are there any others that would be worth it? If I'm spending $100+ I'd honestly want them to last at least a year with heavy usage, and even that doesn't seem like a long time. My Adidas ones were only in the $30 ballpark so 3 months to start seeing wear and tear isn't that bad. But otherwise I'm sorta clueless.

One of these two friends is a pro soviet guy and is pro communism, that's the reason i'm talking so much about politics with him. I'm the type of guy that respects other opinions/political views as long as it donesn't cause damage to other individuals. 

He then came up with jewish prejudices as he claimed that he can recognize most jews by their big nose, their lips, their ears and chin.

I said to him that this is bullshit and he shouldn't say that stuff like it's a well known option to categorize jewish citizens. 

He replied with ""Dude i grew up with jews i know how to recognize them"". 

He also said that jews are often envious and non-patrons with a passion for business. 

It started to confront him with his claims and said that this is some NS bullshit and this is exactly what the Nazis said back then. 

A friend showed up with his girlfriend, so he wanted me to be quiet because he don't want other people to know what he said. But i didn't accept that and kept talking to him about that stuff when he suddenly walked away and screamed ""Go suck some dick"", ""Fagot"" and ""Your asshole is big you fagot.""

I claimed that i can't stand his antisocial/homophobic and anti-Semitic opinions, a real friend would point you out if you talk shit and this is exactly what i'm doing now.

He then said that i should go alone and yelled at me, I replied with ""Just shut the fuck up dude"" and walked back home.


Was it so wrong to confrontate him with this? I mean, yeah, a friend and his girl heard what he said because i talked to them but why should i respect such an inhuman opinion? 


What do you guys think about that? I really don't know if i should stay in touch with him because i don't like it when he talks about stuff like ""Fagots should get beaten up/shot"" but he was also kind to me most of the time, even though he said to me that he wouldn't be my friend anymore if i'm gay or smth. I'm straight so we both are cool with each other most of the time but it's not cool to hear stuff like that..

522,"I‚Äôm 15 and every time my dad and I go shopping, out of nowhere he decided to get frustrated and talk about how he‚Äôs spending all the money and how I‚Äôm spending nothing, it‚Äôs really fucking annoying because there‚Äôs literally nothing I can do about it if I wanted to. I honestly would have rather had my parents not have had me as a child than to hear my parents talk about how I don‚Äôt make any money or ‚Äúcontribute anything‚Äù to the household. 

This makes it extremely hard to ask for essentials for myself like school books or jackets because they always find a way to bring up money one way or another.

It‚Äôs the same for small luxuries that my parents are expected to get, they always ask me ‚Äúare you going to spend your money‚Äù? Despite me not even having any money or receiving any income, I asked for a jacket the other day because my other one I‚Äôve had for 4 years was super torn and I got made fun of it by my classmates at school and my mum asked me, ‚Äúare you going to use your own money‚Äù, and then proceeded to tell me to leave saying she has no money whilst eating takeaway food that she bought for herself.

Hi I am 22, Over the last 2 Years I have made several changes in my life, I used to be fat and had no direction in life, now, after being tired of people mocking me I lost almost 25 Kilos, I got new hair, stopped drinking excessively, I started studying what I wanted and I became very social, it was very hard but eventually I started having more confidence in myself, I am studying concept art and it‚Äôs a very labour intensive career but despite all my efforts to be a better person my friends still don‚Äôt respect me, they treat me as a lazy person, they treat me like I am an idiot, now they tell me I am too skinny, they think all I do is make useless drawings, I am sick of trying to be better and people still treating me the same, I‚Äôve literally turned my life around In everything I thought I was wrong, I found my passion and self confidence, and yet, my friends still treat me as if I was inferior, they look down upon me and judge me for everything, in this pandemic is very hard to just cut ties and go meet new people, most people don‚Äôt wanna go out and meet others nowadays, and I am here sitting thinking all the effort I did was for nothing, all those hours of working hard for my passion, of exercising, of learning how to socialize I thought were doing good, but it seems that it‚Äôs never enough, I am still seen as a lazy, unworthy bastard, what am I supposed to do? I did everything people told me, I changed my life and I am glad I did I really am, but why the people that I thought would support me or at the very least respect me, still treat me the same, or even worse, some have even started to ignore me, I am fucking tired of this, idk what I need to do for people to take me at least a bit seriously, I feel like a clown these days, just disrespected constantly, being mocked and judged by the people I thought I could trust, I am desperate for new friends, not to clap at everything I do or say but at least, at the very least, some friends that treat me like a human being.",06Dec2020,2

531,"I‚Äôm 18 (f) and almost in my second semester of nursing school. I live with my boyfriend of over two years who is 20, and I used to DoorDash as my whole income, in order to pay rent. I never had enough money for basic needs, I was always ‚Äújust getting by‚Äù, I hated always having him spend money on groceries and our two other bills (I pay my half of rent, he pays his, and he also pays for the electric/gas and internet bill; he makes more than I do), and I was sick of the anxiety. 

I applied for a job as a caregiver for the elderly, that way I would have a constant income and also because it would look nice on my applications when I graduate nursing school. I‚Äôll be making $21 an hour as a caregiver for a couple, the wife has dementia and the husband is mentally sound but he is very frail and has some heart issues. The wife is basically the one I have to take care of and shower, I have to feed them both, but otherwise the husband does his own thing. I‚Äôve met them both and they‚Äôre both very kind and sweet. 

I‚Äôm worried because although it is only for 2 days a week, they are 12-hour shifts, from 9 am to 9 pm. They have a daughter who lives with them (the reason I‚Äôll be taking care of them is because she is at work all day), and I was told that she may come home early and let me go home. I‚Äôm so worried that I‚Äôll mess up, or do something wrong, or one of them will get hurt. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll be so tired of it and not be able to do it. I‚Äôm worried it will be awkward. I‚Äôve never had a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù before. I‚Äôve DoorDashed, which is awesome because I‚Äôm on my own schedule and I‚Äôm by myself. Before that (before the pandemic), I was a babysitter for 4 children. They were easy to entertain because I could bring crafts, I could play games, I could joke around with them (I was their babysitter for over 2.5 years). I don‚Äôt know what to do to entertain the elderly, I don‚Äôt know what to talk about. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll say something wrong and cause the wife with dementia to get emotional. 

What do I do? What do I talk about with them? What meals do I bring? Should I buy scrubs since I‚Äôll be showering the wife/helping her use the bathroom? I haven‚Äôt started yet because I broke my right foot and can‚Äôt drive or work/put weight on it. My bosses are super superrrr chill and relaxed, basically said if I need to call out for whatever reason that I can do so as long as I let them know ahead of time, and they have also been very understanding about my foot.

Don't worry he isn't a Nigerian price and from what I have seen and heard I believe that he actually doesn't have a computer to practice cybersecurity on.

I have always seen him do CTFs on his raspberry Pi (which is a small computer basically) but isn't as efficient as you might think it is. It's small and I know for a fact that it's hard for him to learn all the things he wants to on it. He never asked for it but I want to from the core of my heart truly raise money for him just because I see passion which with the right support make him a resource. He is an ambitious person stuck in a country which is limiting his potential.

542,"I had a friend (I recently blocked him due to passive aggressive FB posts) where we had a falling out back in 2013. 

I since apologized for what I did months later (his anger was valid and I told someone something out of anger which resulted in him telling the friend and the friend and a group of other people stopped talking to me)

Out of anger and I don't even know why or what triggered me to do it but I told the person (a straight guy) that my friend (who is gay) had a crush on him and told him he wanted to do things with him. The straight guy wasn't too happy with it and told my friend what I said. Rightfully so which resulted in the falling out.

I already know the answer but this year since I tried to reconnect with him again after I redid my FB page and he pretty much ignored or excluded me from posts. Every once in a while he would tag me in a post where we used to hang out and go out to eat, etc.

Then the next week he would post about memories and I happened to be the only one that responded and he makes another post saying he has dope memories with people he wouldn't talk to again. (And another post where I ranted about wanting to be left alone and he complained about that I didn't read the entire post and I just deleted him off my friends list.)

He has a right to still be angry. he claims (like my cousin that's another story) he's an empath. Yes I've apologised but shade was still thrown my way (about my weight, bringing up anything negative, etc.)

What I want to know is, is he right to still be angry about it after 7 years even after we talked about what I did?

I finished my undergrad in the Spring of 2020 already having a job that would 1. Pay off my undergrad loans over the course of 3 years 2. Pay for my grad school and 3. Put me on a fast track to massive yearly pay increases (for the first 4 years) until I'm leveled out (with more room to go up) at a great mid-career salary. I have done well in the job thus far, receiving high praise by supervisors, high performance reviews, and my boss nominated me for an award.

I am so thankful for this job and feel extrodinarily lucky, however, I am beyond miserable. The work is dull, I have had to learn everything on my own, every time I reach out to anyone for help/resources/work I need them to do, I get radio silence (ignored emails / IMs / calls). I feel like an idiot day in and day out. I cannot gain accesd to resources I need for my projects as nobody ever responds to me, gives me insight, nor acknowledges my existence until they want me to do their BS work. I even start early and work late and am kept awake at night stressing about the job. It has taken over my life.

It has only been 6 months and I keep trying to be resilient and push through in hopes of it getting better, but the more time I spend here, the more I realize that everybody else is miserable too. I worry about turning into them and giving up happiness in order to receive a good paycheck. I found a lot of happiness in my life in the past few years and I feel like I have thrown much of it down the drain just in the fast few months and I want to quit. 

The only thing keeping me from quitting is my monthly payments and the current economic woes of the world. I know I should try to find another job, but I am scared that I will fall into a similar scenario and will be labled (to employers) as a quitter for only spending 6 months at a job before leaving.

He does have a few friends that he can talk to but they never invite him to do anything and when he suggests something they don't want to. Keep in mind we're not under lockdown and can do things as long as ee follow the social distancing rules. So, for example excersizing outdoors is fine.

The drive home and first night were completely uneventful. Over the course of the first two weeks the dog very quickly warmed up to me (was already good with my wife and surprisingly calm with out 3 year old child). Our kid was never with the dog unattended and has socialized with animals lots as the dayhome has two mastiffs.

A couple of times the dog would bark/nip when feeling threatened, but never acted aggressively, until last night. I went to pick up the dog from the couch, as I have previously, and it attacked me, bit my ear pretty severely, and sent me to the ER for stitches, immunization boosters, etc.

I am grateful the dog attacked me and not my child, but now I am asking for advice. There appear to be behavioural challenges with the dog, and I fear that my kid might be at risk. My wife wants to see if we can have the dog in for behavioural therapy and I want to remove the risk by rehoming the dog, or putting it up for adoption.

Reddit, what advice can you give me? It's greatly appreciated.",06Dec2020,1

If this doesn't belong here, please feel free to delete, or direct me to a more suitable sub. Thank you

I've been feeling really lost lately and could use some guidance. I'm done feeling sorry for myself and I want to get back in school to better myself... but I have no idea where to start. 

I have an AA from my local community college from many, many moons ago and I've been looking into healthcare programs, most of them are 2-year programs, but I see some say Advanced Technical Certificate. Does anyone know what those are? I've been out of school for so long and there are so many new terms, it's getting a little overwhelming and intimidating. 

For the 2 year programs, would I have to retake the maths/English/electives? Or can I apply the classes I already took to the new AS.

572,"Currently living with my dad, caring for him full time for at least the next year ( he has to relearn how to walk due to a lumbar tumor removal‚Äî his other injuries are a broken left wrist and sprained right hand). We live with my two sisters, one is 15 and helps with the cooking and cleaning while the other is 25 helping with the bills both medical and general. 


I have no idea what to do with my life and the fact I‚Äôm taking care of my dad is just an excuse I‚Äôm using for the delay in my process. I was a good student academically throughout high school and got into all the colleges I applied to except I couldn‚Äôt afford them. When covid hit I decided to stay with my dad and apply to the local technical college‚Äôs licensed practical nursing program ( spending half the summer studying for the entrance exam and actually getting accepted), I shortly withdrew after nine weeks somewhat because I was the only person available to care for my dad but mostly because I felt incompetent after a series of depersonalization and depressive episodes ‚Äî especially because the instructors would tell us we wouldn‚Äôt be good nurses when we were in lab without any demonstration for the skill we were supposed to perform and several delayed lectures, nursing is not something that should be self taught. 

The responsibility without experience scared me, and also made a lot of my insecurities manifest dangerously. I don‚Äôt actually think I want to be a nurse. I have no idea what else to study, although I won‚Äôt completely dismiss community college as an option ( however, I‚Äôm doing physical therapy and transferring with my dad all day). I can‚Äôt really commit to a job right now as I can‚Äôt drive or leave my dad alone for long periods of time. I‚Äôm selling stuff online with little luck because we are about to go into serious medical debt wherein my sister is the only person financially supporting us. 


If my dad wasn‚Äôt sick, I still would have dropped out. There are few apprenticeships in town and most are given to those that already have a relationship with the organization. 

I don‚Äôt think I should join the military‚Äî and I don‚Äôt really understand why it keeps being suggested. Also Im kind of mentally ill.

Right now further education doesn‚Äôt feel like an option but i might just be putting mental barriers up. I‚Äôm really concerned about our financial situation and we cannot apply to government assistance programs like disability/ social security/ or unemployment.

It has multiple times in the time I've been home (about a week and a half) escalated to them yelling at me about something.

I moved out of my parents house 3 months back because they were toxic and abusive to me. At the time, when I confided in him, he called me a lot of hurtful things and works like attention seeking and faking it and I started crying as I typed that bcos how can someone even think that? I have no idea what went on in his head but when I asked him about it months later, he said he has no idea what depression was or how to deal with it so he said that.

But I still feel we're like that, still feel he doesn't get me and he can't give me the support I need and even that's ok but he makes me feel worse at times. I'm in a different country all alone, I have not much friends and he gets jealous at the idea of me meeting new people (although I really need this especially now I feel) so I didnt and he says stuff like ""am I not enough""? Which makes me feel guilty. He doesn't reply half of the time and he blames me for stuff like when he forgets to eat. I have my own life to worry about and I'm not his maid ;_; and thats another area, he doesn't do chores or cool and has the mentality that females do those which is cool idm but would be nice if I had someone to help me out bcos I work too. And he doesn't work, he games all day and idk what he does the rest of the time when he's not replying me or not online playing but he says stuff like he was talking to his family which makes me sadder and jealous too. Because I dont have one. And he said its my fault for leaving them and it is but its also his fault for driving me to the edge and not supporting me - which he says he won't bcos he's not a computer to agree with everything but I really need support now not agree :'(

We recently had this huge fight and almost broke up because of this, I said I can't go on like this, we dont have a future planned (I feel like he just wants to kill time but he says he loves me and I'm the first he loved in 10 years which makes me feel even more sad that this isn't working out) and I said I need support because Im alone (he really doesn't get this and he keeps blaming me I just feel more and more depressed and shitty I dont even know what to do but that's a story for another post). So he said he would be more supportive and he has with his words, he's been agreeing. But I dont mean agree I mean encourage when I mean support or get my point and then discuss if he has a better idea. So based on what I've said, is there a way to communicate better (on my end) and make him understand and fix this or should we just break up? - in which case I don't know how to break up because he always says he loves me when I try to and then  when I give the reason, he tries to fix it but his way of fixing it seems so ungenuine...I'm confused ;_;",06Dec2020,1

So basically my brother (m12) is ruining my (f14) life. One example that just happened right now and happens every other time is when i call my friends. He feels entitled to scream, embarrass me, hit me and therefore physically hurt me. He destroys my stuff and makes disgusting noises and movements. I just cant take it anymore. Every day he hits me and finds a way to destroy the things i own, things i myself have to pay for (my parents barely pay anything for me anymore so i have to pay for the things i want with my own savings and im about to go broke yikes). But a month ago my parents bought my brother a Wellensteyn jacket for 180‚Ç¨, before that they also bought him nike shark TNs for 150‚Ç¨ or so AND he got an iPhone 11 as his first phone ever. He also owns a PS4. He talks to me in the most disrespectful way, makes fun of me, insults me etc. He wont stop. I cant do anything about it, i tried many ways. Back to the phone calling: whenever he‚Äôs in a call with his friends hours long me and my little sister say nothing. we keep quiet and mind our own business. i feel like i live a very unfair life. he always gets whatever he wants if he annoys and pressures my parents long enough. i really cant take this anymore. 
everyday i cry and my head hurts from his screaming and yelling. his voice makes me sick. He doesnt know how to do chores. He just got mad at me and threw a shot ton of pillows at me because i wouldnt help him with cleaning the dinner table. I always do it. why cant he do it alone once? i always take care of the house and work my hands off. i go to one of the most known and best highschools of my city and my parents of course wanted him to go there too. he got accepted but only because im his sister (chance of getting accepted here is higher if you have siblings there) now i also have to help him with his homework and I have to search for my years old exams so he can see what might be waiting for him. He is straight up dumb. Im not trying to make him look worse or anything, he actually is.
i just told my mom how i cant take this anymore. i told her how i would just like to take my own life and end it there. but im muslim and suicide is a major sin so i was never planning on actually committing it,, i just wanted to give my mom a wake up call so she can finally at least put an end to how im being treated like him. she made fun of me, she told me how this was not allowed in our religion. she told me to study and grow up so i dont have to live with him any longer. 
what?? im 14?? additionally,, im apparently not allowed to move out until i marry but im not gonna live by that rule. im planning on becoming a reconstructive plastic surgeon and work in nothern california, south korea or japan regardless of being married or not. 
she brang up people being murdered, she brang up people living in the middle east under not good conditions or in war. she compared their lifes to mine.

I told her I was very sorry and that I was completely stupid at the time and that I misunderstood her signs. She was still mad and refused to fully take my apology and blocked me on snapchat that night.

Now here's where it gets bad. A female flatmate then started explaining to me how people have said this has happened before and was immediately confused. She mentioned a couple of times where I apparently was 'too forceful' / 'they didn't want it'. I know these allegations were false as I have distinct memories of consent from girls involved. For example, both of them got with me continuously for 10 mins without once showing signs of wanting to stop. One of them repeatedly told me how attractive she found and asked me to choke her. The other kept pulling me closer to make me kiss her and even said at the end that I was a 'nice guy' and she didnt want to make things awkward and 'we can still be friends'. I talked to the girl in question and she even told me that the rumour wasnt true.

Now obviously the instance that happened last night was serious and I was completely out of line. The other rumours on the other hand and completely false and will quickly build me a bad reputation at university, which is what I really dont want. So far noone has been unfriendly to me and I think people are just silently judging but I dont want it to go any further.

598,"I‚Äôm (M25) in college and this semester has been super super overwhelming for me, from crying every night to somewhat having panic attacks while in class. The classes aren‚Äôt bad, the workload is way too much to do in a whole week. I dropped a course after not being able to get a textbook until right before midterms and I had no way of passing. Another class uses an online workbook instead of the actual workbook, and I‚Äôve spent more time fiddling with the online workbook itself and how it works rather than the assignments. I was way too stressed and I just didn‚Äôt do them. Being at home, where I‚Äôm easily distracted and having to do this and that doesn‚Äôt help either. Last semester, I did really well in all of my classes. Storm threats didn‚Äôt help either (for context, I live in Louisiana, and it was bad). I emailed my instructor about everything and she said I can do them from the actual workbook. I know I could‚Äôve said something earlier but I wanted to see what I could do first.

600,"Okay so I‚Äôm 21 M and I‚Äôve had a crush on a girl for a while now. We met through a mutual friend in college and it turned out that we were in the same class together. 

We started sitting by each other in class and starting talking and texting and then we decided we would study together. I would go over to her place 3-5 times a week to study. We have become good friends and we text very often. 

This all sounds great, but she has a boyfriend and they have been dating for a year. They are dating long distance, BUT I respect that they are dating and I have not flirted, I have just been a friend. 

The problem I am having now is that I feel like she has feelings for me, but I cannot act on them, since she is dating. She texts me and says that she is excited to see me in class, she texts me a lot, without me initiating it. If I don‚Äôt text her for half the day, she will randomly text me and ask, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs studying‚Äù or just any random question. 
And on top of that, I was at her house and she was showing me the sports bra she had on, telling me that she wished she could wear it, but didn‚Äôt have an outfit that would match....

All this has lead me to believe she likes me. Is this what all girls do with their guy friends? Or am I reading into this way too much? Should I go for it? Or just remain friends and wait it out? THANKS!!!",06Dec2020,1

604,"I got myself an opportunity to buy myself an apartment with pretty flexible 'financial plan'. It's basically kind of a rent-to-own kinda situation. 

A little backstory, I kinda always wanted to own an apartment somewhere, because the rent prices are going up, and I guess it would be nice to live somewhere rent-free someday or have some little side money from renting it. 

So, everything sounds perfect actually, it's empty, the price is good, but there is only one problem. It is in the same apartment building as my parent's apartment. We do get along okay if we don't see each other a lot, but I'll admit that I am afraid that I won't have my own peace. When I was living at home it was kinda okay, but my parents can be a lot and it can be quite energy draining. When my mom was bored, she would come to my room, bothering me, always thinking I have nothing to do, even tho I had my job and uni to do (I work from home now, since it is coronavirus), always having to do her stuff cuz she was kinda too lazy to do them herself and because of that we would get in a lot of fights. 

I am really leaning towards taking the opportunity. Considering the financial part, I can manage it and take in roommates if anything happens, the only real con is the whole family thing. To be honest, I see the solution in potentially renting it and moving away if things get rough, but I guess I just need some advice from strangers on the internet?",06Dec2020,1

Mom: Oh so you‚Äôre just gonna walk out on me now? 
Me: ‚Äúwell if you want me to stay I can, but when I do stay all you tell me is how awful I am or to leave.‚Äù

Whenever I say I love you to her she constantly just says ‚Äúno you don‚Äôt‚Äù 

Also we had a check for rent that I vividly remember handing her last night, and then she lost it and I got a beating because she lost it. When I asked why I was being hit for something I didn‚Äôt do she
Just said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not fair!‚Äù

622,"Note: I'm sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile.

Back in March my state went into lockdown and everyone took Covid seriously. My aunt is a nurse who works in a local hospital and advocated for social distancing. We also have family farther north, who are bigger doctors and this influences my family. My mom and siblings still wanted to see my grandparents and help them, so we would bring them groceries and stay outside (behind glass), wave and then leave. Once May came around, my aunt got family sick and wanted to see my grandparents. She knew how bad it was affecting out state but shifted her view to it not being important or bad anymore. Because she's a nurse, my gullible grandparents believed her. They started spending more time together. Then mom and 3/5 of my siblings starting getting that idea to. My grandpas birthday was in mid May, and they all decided to throw a party. It was outdoors to help, yet they didn't wear masks or social distance. Then and now, I have been firm on not going out, along with my other brother. I didn't want to get it without knowing and have a have my grandma or grandpa die because of me. No one else has that concern in my family and it bothers me. My mom believes covid is a real thing, however not as big as the media is showing it to be. She also has a friend at the city medical examiners office, and says how it isn't that bad either. The family up north, live in a county with more cases, and still go out and travel (until countries banned that). My mom takes that to heart, and tried to explain in her own way the facts and how if they weren't trying to hide something, that data would be easier to understand. My sisters are a bit worse, they completely deny it and think it won't kill anyone. They were actually exposed to another family member and they refuse to get tested or quarintine. They still go into work, where they're in contact with people who are more susceptible. I've told them they need to get tested, but they just laugh in my face and say if they start developing symptoms, then they'll tell their managers. Which is extremely messed up. One of my brothers said he was going to lie to people. The person who got possibly gave it to them had called (since they're family) and my sisters laughed in in face for not going to work and staying home for testing positive. They also got mad at him for feeling sad that no one checked up on him because they think that he's not on his deathbed. My last conversation with my grandparents ended with my grandpa saying he won't get the vaccine. I asked why and he responded saying that he doesn't want to be one of the first. I explained that the vaccine has to go through thorough tests trials, so if its released, it has already been tested thousands of times. Im only 17, but I'm the academically excelling child (since I'm taking 20 college credits at my community and state college) of the entire family and they say I'll be the started since the family. However when it comes to this, they all think im crazy. My grandma also thinks 5G will kill you (she found an article on Facebook), but I argued with her that it can't unless you're at the top of the tower and the facts she was using were actually wrong (since they were). 
With all of this being said, is there a way for me to convince my family that they should get the covid vaccine? 
My state plans to start giving them out this month, however I think they'll go quick, and since my immediate family doesn't have any health issues, I plan on waiting to allow more ask risk people to get them first.

Long story short, I've consistenly been told I'm boring since middle school, now I'm 21. There's maybe 2-3 people I've been able to have a decent regular not boring time with. I usually don't talk a lot. What set me off to ask this today is because of a drive with my family, and they all kept muttering how ""dry"" it was, since I wasn't even saying anything (it was just me, two older adults, they chatted up a lot and the third adult I didn't know that well). 

I've struggled to say much especially because of being called boring, and because usually the other people I'm with tend to talk over me, or move on from what I talk about, or think what I'm saying isn't worthy of conversation or whatever.

2 nights ago we were on Discord and I just asked her casually how many dudes she had sex with before me.. and she had the courage to tell me.. and then I asked how many times.. and she responded and we just moved with the conversation talking about our past ect..

Since then, I don't understand why I've been **stressed, troubled, weirded out**.. I know it's the past, and I should not care about it, but again I'm only human and can't get rid of the feeling..

What I'm asking is a way to think differently about this, because I'm aware that my way is totally wrong, because I kinda feel jealous, and whenever I remember the details because I was fool enough to ask for them, I get this feeling of pressure in my chest like I wish she never had sex before me.

I know thios s hard to read because I was just rambling, but I just hope to get some outsider thoughts about this, is it normal? how to not think like this? should I tell her how I feel about it knowing that I reassured her that no matter what it is I wouldn't care as it's just a casual conversation..? ect ect

Using shampoo and the like: I'm a bit afraid of losing my hair if I use too many chemicals. But at the same time I'm not an expert so the fear might be unreasonable and I'd like some guidance. Naturally I wouldn't go bald - nobody did so in my family and I have quite a lot of hair.

Equipment. My hair is probably low-mid length now. It already covers my nemesis - the Cow Lick. But I'd be curious about other things I could use. I mean, techniques to tie a knot (or whatever its name is, sorry guys, I haven't looked into the english words), some channels I could watch that helps with the basics and the like.

639,"A little background story: there is this guy I know from middle school. Since like the first month of middle school I had a crush on him. I started to develop a friendschip with him, but as our interests were not the same and as he did not respond to my signals (and sometimes was very rude to me), I decided to let him go.
Now is the last year of high school: my last chance of getting a relationship with him. I had let him go, but as he gives some signals, I am not sure what I am supposed to do. 
In the classes we share, he stares sometimes at me. Now, I don‚Äôt know if I am just imagining it, but he just stares at me... On top of that, I started to re-follow him on Instagram, after unfollowing him a few years ago because I wanted to let go of him. In all the years that I have followed him, I never saw his instagram stories. But after a history class when he was ‚Äúlooking‚Äù at me, I suddently could see his Instagram story! Again, I don‚Äôt know if I am just imagining this... 
On top of that, I can remember him calling me a few years ago, asking if I ‚Äúwould like to hang out with him once‚Äù. I was so in shock! But unfortunately, I did nothing about it, as I was too affraid. 
I don‚Äôt know if I should anticipate on these signals and I don‚Äôt even know IF these are legit signals from him. What should I do?? I would really like to have a relationship with him, but I don‚Äôt want to be laughed at at school because I tried to ask him to hang out with me...
And even if I find the currage to ask him, what am I supposed to do with him, as due to covid everything is closed??? Help me, guys!",06Dec2020,1

So, very recently I got into touch with one of my friends from school. We weren't close but we knew each other and we talked briefly on occasions. Nowadays, I occasionally message him on Instagram after seeing his stories and stuff and we have a bit of a rapport going on.

However, recently he expressed to me that he had a lot going on in his mind and stuff and I asked him if he wanted to talk about it. He did say not now but I am assuming we will talk about it eventually because I gave him my contact for just catching up.

So, my question is: what advice do you have for me and how should I approach it should he wish to talk about what seemed to be on his mind? I just want to make sure that I don't do anything wrong should he tell me something serious or significant.

Thank you in advance and I hope that you have a wonderful day!",06Dec2020,1
643,"Tldr at bottom
Shes not diagnosed but like I think she needs therapy. Idk if its ocd or not. Past two years she's been insane about handwashing and being super clean. Like she will be sitting on her break where we work and get up and wash her hands for no reason other than she feels like she needs to. 

Covid made this so much worse. Her hands are dry and cracked ALL OVER and almost constantly bleeding. She called me crying the other night because she said she can't deal with this anymore. She had just washed her hands and they were bleeding and her mum came into her room and put some cash she owed her on her desk. She started crying because now she has to touch the cash (disgusting to her), wash the money, wash and sanitize the desk and what the cash touched, and then wash her hands again. She was crying about the way she feels and the fact that she had to wash her hands again even though it hurt so bad. 

Tldr: Long story short, she's had a really bad week. She called in sick to work today for the first time in her 2.5 years of working here. She called in sick once before, but then felt bad and showed up anyways. 

We're in a group of 4 friends. She's 21F. We want to make her a care package to try to cheer her up a little and show her we care. 

The things we've already decided to get: 
- Some really good hand lotion (she has lots but perhaps we can find something better? Okeefes working hands, lush working hands, something?) 
- soap for sensitive hands
- candles, room sprays (she LOVES smelling good/  smelly things)
- chocolates she likes
- munchies she likes (chips etc)
- handwritten cards from each of us


Anything else anyone can think of to add to the list? Not sure if we should add flowers as we don't know if she will see them as being too dirty...",06Dec2020,1
644,"I'm 28, engaged, I work two jobs(60hrs a week) sometimes with no days off. Even with my two jobs, 90% of my income goes to bills and repaying debt I racked up when I was younger. I hate my job and I hate the people I work with.

 I feel as though I have lost my motivation in life, I'm not suicidal or anything, I know my life isn't the worst but I don't really feel motivated to do, well anything. I still drag my ass to the gym 5-6 days a week, I'm not in terrible shape, I'm pretty strong but even in the gym, no motivation.

I want to apply to Law Enforcement, but I never finished college, I have applied in th past and after an 18 month process I got deferred for 2 years. I have 8 years experience in the security field but feel like I am stuck in my current job.

645,"I'm not really active on reddit, I just come on for the usual check ups every now and again for a laugh or something interesting, you know how it is. 

But I'm really struggling. Recently I lost the girl who is the love of my life and the one I thought I was going to marry, build a future with. We were only together for 3 years but by god were they the best 3 years of my life so far. I'm only 18 and I know a lot of people will probably shake their heads or roll their eyes thinking ""oh young love you'll move on"", but we have a child together as well. A beautiful girl who will be 10 months coming up to christmas. Like a lot of young parents I wasn't ready for this new when we first found out and I didn't want it to happen, of course when I first saw her on the ultrasound I fell in love and I've been the happiest and most content I could ever be. I was doing really well in college, I recently got a part time job to save up for a car for the 3 of us to have family outings, life was just going great. 

Like I said though, no more. I don't know exactly what the reason is but I guess it just wasn't for her, still even right now it feels like one big joke and she'll message me saying ""I got you!"". I'm trying my best for our daughter, I have amazing family support around me. But I just can't shake this feeling that it's wrong. 

I've had those teen crushes and relationships before and felt a watered down version of this back in those days like the whole world has ended and my life is hopeless but now, it really feels like it is. 

She is an amazing girl, perfection even and I mean it when I say that, I can't amass into words how out of this world this girl is. 

What's eating me up is the fact that I feel I could have done things differently, given more when I sensed things were wrong, done more when I knew I was wasn't doing enough, told her I loved her more when I didn't say it enough. It feels like everything up until now could have been prevented if I'd just tried harder. These past few days have been a real test of my will and I don't know how much longer I can go on.

I know I have to be strong for my daughter, I know that, and I want to be the best father I can be. But I'm just so tired of crying and feeling empty already, I'm not the best when it comes to mental health, I'm actually quite weak so much it's laughable. I just don't know what to do. 

Every second of the day she's there on my mind, I can't look at something or think of something without thinking of the good times we had or things that we did together, little things that only us knew, little things that were special to us. 

I know this is awful of me to say but the only reason I accepted our daughter would come into this world was because of how much I loved this girl, and I do love our daughter I really do, I would do everything and anything for her but every time I have her and look at her face, I see her mother's eyes, I can't even look at my daughter without hurting and aching. 

I cry myself to sleep every night and when I wake up it isn't any easier, it feels heavier as if everything has reset and as soon as my eyes open I have to go through it all again.

I know you can't change people once they've truly decided something and I tried my best towards the end I really did, I did everything I could think of to try and convince her to stay but I knew it was all pointless and that's what hurts. Even now the only thing keeping me going aside from our daughter is the thought that some time in the future, she might pop up to me asking if we could retry things. A hopeless dream I know. 

I guess I'm just writing this out as a coping mechanism, but it doesn't last and the pain always comes flooding back. 

I'm hopelessly in love with this girl, I don't know what to do, I want to get better and be able to face that this is the end of us but at the same time there's a part of me inside fighting it's hardest not wanting to accept that this is it, that I won't be able to hold her again or kiss her, or tell her how much I love her and how much she means to me. I'm pathetic I know, hopeless and needy and dependent, but I just love her so much.",06Dec2020,1

649,"**TL;DR** I live with a selfish man having a mid-life crisis who just broke his hip. I'm sure he's going to ask for my help more than is reasonable, and I need your advice on setting boundaries.

Hi all. I'm in my 30s and my housemate is 51. He just got divorced. He's lived in my house since May and it has not gone well (we're strangers who connected through a Facebook group). Suffice it to say that his stuff is everywhere, and he doesn't contribute significantly to the house (either by cleaning or by contributing to household goods--he's not paid a cent for anything but rent/utilities). I've addressed my concerns with him many times and virtually nothing has changed.

The dude is clearly depressed and has a shopping/hoarding problem. Friday he calls me and says he had an accident--he apparently bought an electronic skateboard, was trying it out, and **fell and broke his hip**. It makes me really sad that I was his first phone call.

I have empathy for the guy--he's going through big life changes, and the pandemic has been hard on everyone, and now he's laid up and can't work indefinitely (he does body work). We live in a place with very tight pandemic restrictions, and who's to say if he'll be able to travel home for Christmas for two weeks like he planned. However, he's also one of the most selfish people I've spent time with. I've told him straight up that talking to him about a particular issue 3+ times and seeing no change makes me feel like my feelings don't matter to him, and still nothing has changed. I can't tell you the number of times he's tried to boss me around (like gesturing at an empty box of his and saying, ""That just needs to go in the recycling,"" as if it's my job to break it down and put it in the bin).

I don't know what to do with him back in the house--he comes back Monday. **I don't want to be heartless**, but I already know he's going to try to get me to do everything for him and be really sorry for himself, so I need to set boundaries. I mean, just for one--the guy is a hoarder. The hallway to his room has been so filled with boxes since he moved in that he has to slide past them. I fetched his toothbrush for him and brought it to the hospital, and his room is so much worse than I thought. I got anxiety just being there. I can't imagine how he's going to get around without someone's help. I have little sympathy for this guy in any regard--this is the same man who said that people would encounter less racism if they just had a more positive outlook.

So what do I do? I was thinking of setting a daily 10-minute time-limit of how much I'll help him... But I just don't know how to say no, as I'm sure he'll ask over and over. Luckily, I have a boyfriend and can physically remove myself from the situation here and there, but it's my house and I don't want to run away.

Last year I got him a scripture coffee mug which I've never seen him use, a daily devotional that he's barely touched, and a sweater that I've never seen him wear. I've heard him talk about how much he hates reading the marriage books their counselor assigns. He has all the tech gadgets he wants, he has a dang good pair of slippers I just got for his birthday, he has a nice coat, a nice work bag. I have no idea what to get him.

Then, we've got my Father-in-law... whose only interests I know are mcguyver type gadgets and tools, which he already owns all of... literally to the point that every spare surface in his house has been overtaken by flashlights, gadgets, and tools.

652,"For the sake of privacy, I'll use fake names.

Joe hooks up with Bob, a ""straight"" guy who is in a relationship. Somehow the word gets out to one of Bob's friends, who tells the girlfriend. There's a high possibility Joe already knew Bob was in a relationship but that has yet to be proven. But I'm willing to bet he knew.

Joe goes on Facebook to rant about it, not knowing who leaked the secret and calling that anonymous leaker jealous, judgmental, a self righteous asshole and meddler. 

All of Joe's friends left comments comforting him and also joined in to call that anonymous friend jealous, evil and self righteous for outing Joe and Bob's special night. Not a single person criticized Joe or Bob for hooking up behind the girlfriend's back. The anonymous leaker becomes the sole villain of Joe's story. 

I couldn't believe what I was reading. I contemplated on whether or not I should keep to myself what I was about to comment but decided to go ahead anyway, for the sake of balance.

""If Bob didn't want to be in this situation, he should've never cheated on his girlfriend in the first place. Problem solved.""

I left that comment thinking it was actually pretty tame and not actually critical of Joe himself. 

BUT THEN Joe replied to me and also called me a self righteous bitch and that if I didn't agree, I should've just ignore post and then proceeded to ignore me until the end of days.

That‚Äôs 6 hours there, 6 hours back and then the next week having to do it all over again. I did this because due to the pandemic she hadn‚Äôt been home in a year. Her roommate and her roommates boyfriend would also be in my car as well. Granted, I probably should have expected the second wave to hit. Maybe it was my own hopeful stupidity but now that it‚Äôs here I have told my friend that I do not feel comfortable going to get her until they all test negative for corona and properly quarantine. That is my only requirement and I will still drive a total of 24 hours, take PTO and take 2 strangers in my car home. I guess I‚Äôm not sure why she is so angry at me for that. She should want to test negative anyway, seeing as she is seeing her very elderly family members. Now seeing her attitude towards the pandemic, saying that getting tested is pointless I‚Äôm just not comfortable going to get her at all!

At first everything was chill, but when I was politely asking him to do tasks that are required of all of us for our job he throws an actual tantrum. Going off on how he is ""following my example"", ""wasn't trained on this"", ""he knows what he is doing"", and lied to my face that I didn't do tasks that he wouldn't even know about because he isn't trained for that area anyway. I dropped it, have been documenting every fuck up and miss step to ensure that I am documenting everything happening in case he tried to retaliate again. 

He went to the supervisor and basically told her the opposite of what he told me, that he was trained and always did these tasks, that ""throwaway"" never does them etc. If that was the case I wouldn't have been here for 5 fucking years and I would have been reprimanded but no, here I am.

In today's sermon, they called blm marxist and racist, claimed voter fraud, called masks fake, and spoke against vaccines. I think it's very unethical for a religious organization to be spreading political things because it makes it seem like god wants you to believe so and so side.

I‚Äôm just curious how the rest of the world views trans people. I do not hate nor dislike trans people, I just wonder about the more scientific/intricate side of transgenderism. 
By definition, transgenderism is a mental illness. 
Believing that you identify with something which you are not. To me, this sounds the same as someone who is white but chooses to identify as black. 
There is nothing wrong with mental illness, I mean, ADHD is a mental illness too, by definition. 
But is it wrong that I feel like transgenderism is overly accepted?? Are we supposed to accept people who believe that they are something they are not? As numbers of transitioning people rise, so are the numbers of people transitioning BACK to their original gender. I feel like ‚Äúidentifying‚Äù as the opposite gender is really just about social norms, and people feel like they are either male or female, but never a feminine male or a masculine female. 
This is also going to sound ignorant af, but in my experience, every transgender person that I have had any type of longer interaction with uses transgenderism as the entire basis of their personality.  Like, being transgender is WHO they are overall. 
I think this subject is over sensitized and people tend to want to accept everyone for ‚Äúwho they are‚Äù to avoid backlash and cancel culture. This subject needs real attention and not just acceptance in all realms. 
I feel like this is an identity crisis, in the same way that we are normalizing fat-culture.

693,"(Please do not post elsewhere)

I (24F) was made redundant during the first wave of COVID from an office of 70 people in the UK, but luckily found another job pretty quickly! The new job is office based with 1 other (40ishF). We do have other employees, but they are solely field based. I haven‚Äôt had to deal much with this woman as she has been working from home, but we are now back in the office. And I can‚Äôt stand her!

I have been there 6 months and all she does is talk about herself. Whenever I try to share something personal about my life, she changes the subject. She doesn‚Äôt even know my partners name. I find this behaviour really rude considering it‚Äôs just me and her in the office. 

- If I am silent for longer than 5 minutes, she accuses me of being in a mood. I find this exhausting as I‚Äôm not in a mood, I am just concentrating on my work and feel I don‚Äôt have to talk for the whole 8 hours! I have tried explaining this but she took it to mean that I was definitely in a mood! I honestly have never had to talk so much before and I reckon she is more work than the actual work! 

- Sometimes our field workers visit and they make an effort to ask about my life. On one occasion I was telling them about the house I was buying and she overheard and lectured me about it. She couldn‚Äôt understand why I would want to buy instead of rent (she doesn‚Äôt rent herself). Normally I am okay listening to people‚Äôs opinions, but she wouldn‚Äôt let me get a word in edge ways or listen to my reasons for wanting to buy. I felt really picked on and actually asked her to stop, to which I got another lecture about ‚Äústop taking things so seriously‚Äù? 

- She never believes a word I say, even though I have never given her reason to think I was a liar. For example, the director brought in a mini fridge for us to use which was left over from one of the sites we had brought. It was just me at the time and when I told the girl I worked with about it, she didn‚Äôt believe me! She told me it was the directors personal fridge he brought for us. The director came in for a visit a week later and told her the story about the fridge he found and she acted all shocked that it wasn‚Äôt his, even though I had told her what happened. I don‚Äôt understand this behaviour and she does it a lot...

- She constantly lectures me! A simple sentence always turns into a 30 minute rant. I‚Äôm always emotionally exhausted by the end of the day and it‚Äôs affecting my home life. 

- We are in Tier 2, but she still makes us come in. Despite the government guidelines saying if you can work from home, you should. So I am a little bit bitter that I am being made to come into the office, which isn‚Äôt helping my patience with her. 

- She criticises everything. For example one day I had a fruit lunch and somehow turned me being healthy into a bad thing? Another day I had instant noddles and she made snide comments about that too? She‚Äôs also a very negative person in general about EVERYTHING, and expects me to agree all the time. When most of the time I don‚Äôt. 

- She has a habit of ‚Äúteaching‚Äù me things that don‚Äôt need teaching. I tried explaining that I know this but she carries on and makes me watch (one time it was as easy as downloading an email, which surely everyone knows?). 

- Very recently, she wanted to know about a cost she found which was done in February 2020. I explained I couldn‚Äôt answer any questions about this cost because I started in the summer. She got very angry at me and said I can‚Äôt keep using that excuse. She then lectured me about it for an hour and I was in tears by the end of her tirade (luckily we were working from home at this point, so she couldn‚Äôt see my tears). She wouldn‚Äôt even let me defend or explain my self, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it as I feel a little bullied. 

- There was another occasion where she asked me to do a task for her, and send it to an email I had never heard of, dealt with, or had to email before. So I asked her to repeat the email and she lost it. Told me ‚ÄúI should know this by now as I have been here 6 months‚Äù, which I found out of order considering I had never heard of this email before? I tried explaining this but she refused to accept it? I am not necessarily a fighter, but all I want to do is fight her when she does these things. 

- When she is stressed, she tends to pick on me. I have brought this up to her before, to which she replied that she does not accept that accusation. Which floored me. I have nobody else to talk to this about professionally as we don‚Äôt have a HR department and my director and her are best friends. She also said I need to grow up about these things, which again floored me as I never had these problems when I was working in a 70 person office before? (Which could be really bitchy, but it was easier to hide and blend in). 

I don‚Äôt know if our problems are because of the age difference or if it‚Äôs a cultural thing? (She‚Äôs not from a European country or the UK). I was wondering if any of you have any tips for working in a small office with someone unpleasant? (And won‚Äôt stop talking!) 

Something to add: 
- She said I don‚Äôt need earphones as I am free to play my music/podcast on our shared Alexa. So I can‚Äôt ignore her with earphones. 

- I can‚Äôt leave the job as me and my partner are in the process of buying our first home and moving out of my mums house. We don‚Äôt want anything to affect our mortgage offer, but agreed once we have the keys, I can find another job. (This might not be until February!).

- Because of COVID there are limited jobs out there anyway and I don‚Äôt want to leave whilst everything is so unknown. The job security is the only bonus about the job! 

- I have had some advice already that suggested forgetting about the house and leaving the job now, but I can‚Äôt do that either! Me and my mum have a very strained relationship due to a difficult childhood, and get along better when we don‚Äôt live together. I know if I don‚Äôt move out now, our relationship will become even more broken! We are also in the box room and struggling for space. AND my mum is struggling financially and has been told she will get more benefits if we aren‚Äôt living with her, so it is better if we do move out. 

- I don‚Äôt want to move into other rented accommodation as my mum kindly charges us cheap rent which has allowed us to save. 

- My partner has told me if I want to just quit, he would support me. But this affects him too and I couldn‚Äôt do that to us when we are so close to getting our keys and exchanging!",06Dec2020,1

That's when gummy comes in.


**The story**

So now, I seem like the douche for talking like that when gummy was afraid of the dark. At the time, I didn't know that gummy was afraid of the dark and that she was ok with it cause I had never had a problem with her before. When I said that, the part where people who were afraid of the dark were sissies, that's when things went downhill. Gummy said, and I quote, ""Wow, thanks for letting me know. I'm afraid of the dark so good to know you feel that way about me."" We all apologized profusely and I think we were all kicked.

I now spend so much time with them and go to their home quite often, and every time I go they are always eating crisps and chocolate and candies and every sugary thing you could think of. 

They live with their mom and grandma - they both work many hours, so I do get why it is so difficult to have an established healthy food schedule. Sometimes their mom arrives so tired from working that she has no energy to have any argument with her daughter, so she allows her to eat whatever she wants, even if they are about to have dinner half an hour later. The daughter feeds her little brother too.

I see they are both addicted to this kind of food, sugary and unhealthy. I know we all have eaten unhealthy food in our childhood, and even now, but these kids are literally eating candies and chocolate every single day at any hour with no control at all. I personally don't think that buying more fruit and healthy food is difficult nor expensive (in Spain fruits and vegetables are cheap), but I just don't know how to tell their mom and grandma that the children's health can be compromised now and in the long run, and also their relationship with food.

716,"Went to look at a perfect house today but it‚Äôs HUGE and much bigger than my family needs. Otherwise it‚Äôs perfect. Rent is on the high end but we can swing it. We put $500 down to hold the house until we could go see it. Perfect neighborhood, right near a playground for my daughter, big backyard, lake behind the property, 4 bedroom, yard for the dog, parlor room, formal dining room, dining room, living room, gaming room, and two huge bathrooms.

The problem is that it‚Äôs so much house. My family is a family of 3 including only a toddler. We want to save to move out of country in a few years and any extra money goes towards that but currently we‚Äôre in a position where we can easily put away $5k a month. Our quality of life would be higher in a smaller place and the rest can go towards our move. However the smaller place we‚Äôre considering is too small with only 2 bedrooms and no room for an office for my husband‚Äôs work and no room for my MIL who is coming to visit for 6 months while I go to college this semester.

I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. It feels so first world problems but I‚Äôve never had money to have a nice place and have always lived in slums up until meeting my husband (who is used to the high life). Anything above $1k for rent makes me super nervous. So no matter what we get is better.

720,"I‚Äôm starting to not like him. Which feels wrong because he‚Äôs nice to me. Yet the way he treats others can get downright evil.

Gee, I wonder.

She's honestly done alot of bad stuff and i haven't even told her about half of it. I blocked her straight up and let it go for the sake of her mental health which is not in a really good condition and i was scared all the guilt would lead her on to suicide. Yet she went on victimizing herself and ignoring everything she's done to me and i honestly feel so burdened since she does all of this, gets away with it and is ignorant of some of the worst things she's done to me. 

I've moved on but the pain hits me in waves time to time and i just go through sessions of my mind reminding me of all the shit she put me through over the years and it's not really fun if i have to be honest.

745,"(Fake names) I broke up with my ex, Rosie and then a month later got together with her friend, Lexi, who she's obviously not friends with anymore. Me and Lexi had been hanging out as friends (completely platonically,  I had no feelings for her at this time) for a couple months prior to my breakup without my girlfriend at the time's knowledge. When me and Rosie were dating she would become angry at me and jealouse whenever I hung out with friends. Rosie got very mad at me if I had free time and spent it with anyone other than her even if she was busy no matter who it was, but especially if it was Lexi because she had admitted to having a crush on me a couple years back before me and Rosie dated. However Rosie had made me pretty isolated from all my other friends and Lexi was the only one that really stuck around. In addition, Lexi had been with 3 other people since them and wasn't pursuing me at all.

About 2 months after me and Lexi started hanging out secretly me and my girlfriend had an incident when she asked to pee on me. I told her no, she insisted, she told me she didn't have anything and I should just let her have this one thing. I didn't want to let her but she was starting to get angry again (she had just had a manic episode and yelled at me). I was too scared to say no again so I let it happen. Things weren't the same after that. She had done many other cruel things before this but this crossed a line for me. I told her I needed a break because I was struggling with my mental health and I was struggling to talk to her about it so I needed to deal with it on my own. The lie was when she asked me why I couldn't talk to her over and over and  I couldn't tell her it was because I was scared of her, obviously because I was scared of her. I couldn't tell her that she never gave me the chance to open up because we were always talking about her either because she told me she had felt like a burden before and that it made her suicidal. I'm addition she had asked me before (after a manic episode) if I was scared of her and said shed have to kill herself if I was scared of her. 

A couple weeks later Rosie is texting Lexi about me and starts saying scary things like how she want to ""hurt me like I hurt her"" when I came back from the break. Rosie also sent Lexi (TW SH) videos of her playing with razors she had taken from me to keep me from SHing when she knew Lexi  struggled with SH. Rosie had never harmed herself but she threatened to a lot so this was disturbing
Lexi told me because she was concerned for my safety because Lexi and other friends of mine had see her hit me and yell at me. I ended things permanently with Rosie after hearing that because I realized I was too scared to ever go back.

Me and Lexi started dating a little while after this and that's when Lexis ex Anne approached Rosie and told her we had been hanging out without her knowing and that we must've been hooking up.

746,"I am in need to some serious marriage advice as this issue continues to put a burden on me and my Wife‚Äôs new marriage. For starters, we have been together for 4 years and got married this year. This issue has been persistent since we started dating. 

My wife and my mother have never had a solid standing relationship, mainly due to the fact that my mom has shown some pretty negative behavior towards my wife a few times over the last 4 years. Granted it is not all the time, but she has made mistakes. My mother has never been the type of person to apologize to another person, regardless of the situation. She is the type, however, to extend invitations to people as a kind of truce. 

My wife has been waiting for an apology from her for the wrong things she has done, and I have tried to explain to her that my mother isn‚Äôt the type of person that just says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù. Even though I support my wife and think she does deserve an apology, it‚Äôs hard for me to explain that to her without her getting angry at me and telling me that I‚Äôm choosing my mother over her. That‚Äôs not the case at all, I‚Äôm simply trying to help my wife understand the way my mother works, as I‚Äôve known her my whole life. 

My mother has always been kind of the overreacting type, but due to recent events at the start of 2020, my family discovered she suffers from Bipolar Disorder. Knowing that, it doesn‚Äôt excuse the rude behavior or snappy remarks, but it does give us all insight to the issues from the past. She has used it as an excuse for treating people a certain way, saying she can‚Äôt control her behavioral fluctuations, but doesn‚Äôt that warrant an apology to my wife for the remarks and behavior towards her? 

Over the 4 years my wife, girlfriend at the time of most of these issues, would visit my family with me but would always seem uncomfortable. Knowing my wife is an introverted person, I didn‚Äôt push her to talk to people because that isn‚Äôt my place. I would however go around and talk to my family and hangout, attempting to get her to go around with me, but always being told, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay, go talk to your family‚Äù, but then later being to by her that I ‚Äúleft her alone‚Äù. So every time we went down it always was the same thing. Keep in mind, we never went down on free weekends, there were always get togethers where my parents were busy hosting and making sure everything was going smooth, but my wife, gf at the time would make it sound like my family wanted nothing to do with her. I‚Äôve asked her to visit with me on weekends when nothing was going on and it was just my family, but I always had to go down by myself even though I loved having her there to get to know my family. I have brought up to my parents that issue, but then have been told, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, we weren‚Äôt trying to ignore anyone, we were hosting a house party‚Äù. Because that wasn‚Äôt said directly to my wife/gf at the time, she never accepted that as an apology to her. It got to the point that my wife didn‚Äôt even want to go down and visit anymore and that broke me. 

Fast forward to recent events, As the wedding came around, this is after we found out my mother is Bi-Polar, (this next part is hear-say so I have no idea what truly happened) The morning of the wedding, my mother was full of attitude and when my mother-in-law walked up to speak to her, my mom made a snooty remark and walked off. The whole day, according to my mother, she had not been in the right headspace and acted poorly the some people which she said she would apologize for in a letter to my wife ‚Äòs parents. That never happened. 

Just the other day I confronted my mother about all of this, as she lives almost 2 hours away from us, I did it over Messanger as that is how we stay in contact. I was not harsh, but I was very straightforward when addressing the issue. My mother, in response, had an emotional breakdown and went off on me like a 4th of July Mortar that never lifted off. She has always done this and ended up getting what she wanted in the end, but I finally decided that enough is enough and demanded she apologize to my wife and in-laws for her poor behavior and attitude, as this would resolve a lot of issues both for them and for our new marriage. 

I know that this is a lot of information to go through in a short time, but I am in need of serious advice. 

TLDR: My mom has made some poor decisions in the past and hasn‚Äôt apologized to my wife which has cause stress on our marriage as I would like for my wife to go to family events on my side of the family and she won‚Äôt because of my mom. Now I can‚Äôt even bring up my mom or my wife gets angry with me as this issue has gone on our whole relationship. HELP ME PLEASE

I met this girl about 7 yrs ago in middle school. I am now graduated and haven't had any contact with her since I went to high school. Throughout that time I would very often think of her, but now it seems that those thoughts have been occurring far more often than anticipated. For some reason it has been very difficult to get over her. I don't really understand why I am so enormoured or obssessed with her or the idea of her. Just to be clear, I don't stalk her or partake in anything of the sort. I don't have any of the standard social media and generally make it a point to not partake in any of these things. I don't know why, after all these years, I still think of her almost daily. It saddens me greatly and has reached a point where I fear that I must turn to others for some advice, lest I continue to deal with these unresolved feelings. Sorry for the long post.

752,"So, I'm taking online classes right now, and it's my first year of high school. I've been on track with my yearly classes, but I had no idea of the concept of semester classes.

It's about halfway through the year, and I'm way over 50% done with my yearly classes. (4 classes).  For my semester classes, (2 classes), I'm about 25% done. I thought I could do my yearly classes at a faster rate, then once I finish them, I can spend more time doing the semester classes, but I didn't know that semester classes had an actual due date, unlike my other classes. When I made the choice to do online they said everything was modular and everything was a ""go at your own pace"". So I made my own schedule where I try to do year long classes faster than I do semester classes (So there ends up being a point where I only do 2 classes a day and can do like 5% for each class..) and I guess now its ruined and I'm only halfway done with what I should be by now for my semester classes.

I really don't know what to do.. please any advice?",06Dec2020,1
753,"The other day I heard this, ""Love isn't enough in order to have a healthy relationship"" and I realized how true that is for my relationship. We have been together for a year and a half and BARELY have much of the other things, like respect, similar interests, communication, effort, etc. 

We have been together for over a year, and have been friends off and on for 4 years. Its hard to just let him go. Ive masked being unhappy because i WANT to be happy, but i realized we just cant because we're not meant for eachother.

We get along good and I can be happy when im with him sometimes, but i feel like love can mask all the red flags and i realized I've let him manipulate me because i think assume its love. 

I also get very confused because he says things like ""im so lucky to have you, how did i ever end up with you"" Which obviously makes me feel loved and it makes me want to stay with him. 

ANY ADVICE for breaking up with someone who's a big part of your life and nothing extremely bad has happened? Who you still care about?? Its also almost Christmas so i feel guilty, but i realized thatd be unfair to him for me to fake being happy with him and plan to breakup after.

This week she has called me a 'hateful cunt' cause I wouldn't tell her what something was and also called me a 'miserable cunt'. For example if a parcel comes and she asks what it is and I don't tell her, she will get on like a child and start spewing awful things at me. I live at home rent free, which she keeps bringing up, even though many times I've offered to pay rent she refuses. She also knows I haven't  worked since April as I was changing a job, now that I've got it she's freaking out as its in the hospital and she's scared of me getting covid and bringing it home, even though I told her I would work in lower risk areas. I just stay in my room and try to avoid her as much as possible. 

My sister 18 who has no life experience (youngest and is treated completely different than me) feels the need to involve herself in the arguments too even though it has nothing to do with her.  My dad says nothing. My older siblings have told me they basically moved out because my mum treated them the same way. Overall my mum is just so negative about everything. For example me trying to be eco-friendly by using shampoo bars, she makes fun of me. She also hasn't went to university so she doesn't know the extreme pressure and stress that comes from it along with constant placements that's in different places due to my course.

I just don't know what to do anymore. We have had conversations before explaining about how we both felt but nothing has came from it. I have savings but I can't afford to live out on my own.

I came back to my parents' house since the pandemic and during these 9 months, I have decided that I don't want to live the way they do. It was always in my mind but I was waiting for the time that I make my own money. Now I started to give signs on that because I can't stand it anymore and one parent gets mad at me and doesn't talk to me for weeks and the other one is so sad that he looses his sleeps because of me. I wouldn't care if his reactions were some narcissit's way of forcing his rules on me but it hurts to see that he's actually worried. Also his heart is not the strongest one. I wouldn't forgive myself if something happened to him because of me. This made me realize that even if I have a job and get married, they are still going to be heartbroken, so ""wait till you get a job"" doesn't seem to solve my problem. I truly am lost.

At first our friendship was fine because we both had trouble making friends but throughout the years I was able to find new friends, interests, and hobbies. It feels like our friendship isn't as good anymore, it just feels so awkward to talk with her. I want to end our friendship but I have 3 major problems:

1)  Han struggles with making friendship and is really shy. She's only had 2 friends (including me) this entire time. This also makes her more clingy to both of us. I feel like i'll be extremly guilty if I end our friendship because she will end up lonlier.

2) I've dealt with the same situation with another girl (call her Ma)  who had the same struggles. Told Ma I couldn't be friends and ended up in a massacre involving both of our parents too, permanetly ending any relationship we could have again. I'm worried this will happen again.

3) That other friend i talked about in #1? She's also my friend (let's call her Vi). We are a trio. Vi and I been best friends for like 6 years or something, and 

a) Don't want to lose Vi too

b) Have Han lose both of us and essentially any friendship she had

c) Force Vi to choose between us

A little backstory: I‚Äôm currently 17 years old and working as a warehouse assistant. I‚Äôm under a temporary contract for 3 months as of November so I have been here for quite a while already. When I got the job, the company had just moved from another warehouse so they were just moving in and my primary job was to help move stuff around etc, and it slowly degraded as every official employee began their jobs again. I‚Äôm now stuck with nothing to do and have to pester people around the warehouse for something to do. And when I‚Äôm not doing anything I‚Äôm either sitting around or being forced to clean - which is stupid as they have a professional cleaner working there. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm fed up. I really am. It‚Äôs just not for me and I have other things to look up to. I just want to walk out and find something better. I know that will be hard because I‚Äôm only 17 but I know there will be something I prefer over this.

The boss doesn‚Äôt care about anything. He doesn‚Äôt care about his employees or health and safety. He bullies people and funnily enough he doesn‚Äôt even get my name right half the time. 

I don‚Äôt want to give notice. Because if I give notice I‚Äôll have to go through all the stupid questions like ‚Äúwhy are you leaving‚Äù and then have him complain.

Another thing if I walk out is I‚Äôll have to go home to my parents and have to explain it all which I don‚Äôt think wold be that bad. No one would care if I left in fact they probably wouldn‚Äôt even notice. I haven‚Äôt got anything to lose. Except money, but is it really that bad if I manage to find another job anyway? And even better if I actually enjoy it 

It‚Äôs either I leave or I stay for the rest of the contract - keep in mind I‚Äôm really unhappy and fed up.

782,"Hello, so I'm gonna try to make this long story as short as I can. I've gone through a lot in my life, but I've never suffered as much as now.   


This is the story: 2 years ago I moved to a new house with my family, I liked the place it's a relatively peaceful and safe area which is good for the price and considering I live in a third world shithole.  
Everything was good, until the neighbord next door started to bother, they were hiting our wall and annoying us but our landlord talked to them and they stopped, I tought everything was gonna be good from then on but I was wrong...  


After that I started to hear a dog crying coming from their house every single day, I figured maybe it would be that kind of dog that cries for basically anything? My family said so as well. But one day I was doing something near the roof and I peaked to their house and saw a little dog (adult dog but little in size like a chihuahua), it was tied to a pole and crying its heart out. I got mortified immediatly and asked the neighbor if there was any reason it was tied, but he refused to tell me and left saying he was busy.   


The dog continued crying every single day and that's where I realized it wasn't a temportal thing, that poor dog was gonna be there forever if I didn't do anything to save it. So that's when I made my first mistake, I went to the top of the house (there's a ladder there) at night and peaked to their house, there was one guy there and I told him (screaming and being rude) why in the fucking hell they would tie that poor dog in their backyard, I told them it was cold and dark and the dog was afraid, but then he was rude back to me and we ended up insulting each other, and he complained to our landlord.  


After that I made my second mistake, knocking on their door for several days trying to convince them to give me the dog, the owner of the dog talked to me and he wasn't even rude, but refused to give me the dog. He said he didn't like the dog but he didn't like me either so he wasn't gonna give it to me. I threatened to report them to the police, and he said ""ok do it I don't care"".   


But the problem is that I live in Venezuela, a country where there is no justice for animals, so I didn't know where to report it. Later I found a group online where people dedicated to help stray dogs, I asked there if they knew what I could do and most people gave me the number of a lawyer that dedicates her life to saving dogs with the help of some police friends of her. However this is just her side gig, so it was hard to get her to answer my calls back. When she finally did she said she could come rescue the dog, but I needed to pay her a taxi (as you know Venezuela is going through a crisis and gas for cars can be escarce sometimes so she didn't have gas and asked me to pay her a taxi), I told her that I was gonna pay her a taxi on a certain day, but I didn't have any money AT ALL, I barely had enough to eat a couple times a day and pay rent. So I didn't call her back and fell into depression.   


So on december, my landlord told me that she saw the dog running around on the street and back to its house freely, I confirmed that when I went out and saw. I was very happy because these neighbors finally had changed their mind... Third mistake, I should have taken the dog with me when I saw it on the street. 

The dog was only untied during december, then on january it went back to be tied in the backyard, I got REALLY upset, and I decided I was gonna report them again...  But guess what? After a few weeks the dog disappeared, I just gave up and thought they gave it to someone else.   


One year has passed by, and I don't hear that dog crying there anymore, however a few weeks ago I heard a dog crying there with the exact same tone, I got histerical, anxious, extremely stressed, had problems with my family and stressed them too. However, when I peaked at their house againg I saw NOTHING, there was no dog there but I only peaked breafly so they didn't see me. My mother and brother say that I'm crazy and never support me (they never supported me before either but I'll ignore this part not to make it so long)  


I'm still paranoid even tough I don't hear the dog cry, they have a bunch of trees in their backyard and I think to myself ""what if it's behind those trees?"" or ""what if it's another dog which doesn't cry?"" I'm extremely mortified and it has become like an obsession. I've got on top of the roof and peaked to their backyard, but I can only stay there like 5 seconds because the other assholes neighbors are their friends and if they see me peaked to their house they're gonna call the police on me.  I went to a therapist and it was wasted money, she couldn't help me and I can't afford to keep going it's like $15 every appointment and I spend every single penny I make on food.   


Now I have developed extreme neuritis, I can barely breath and it's hard to sleep. The treatment is so expensive I can't even afford it now.  I keep felling guilty every single day because I couldn't save that poor dog. I love animals and can't stand anybody hurting one. I HATE them, and I've never hated someone as much as I hate those people, animal abuser and horrible people all around, ironically everyone loves them in the neighborhood, and everyone gives me bad looks when I go out, I'm a shy and quiet person so that doesn't help.   


I don't know what to do, I've thought about killing myself to stop the suffering, I just want to erase this bad experience from my life, but I keep being paranoid and feeling guilty, it doesn't go away. I have eyebags, I lose appetite, I stress my family with my attitude, and I'm trying to breath but it's hard to do it because my muscles are tightened and they hurt. My christmas is completely ruined, and I worry that my health is gonna keep deteriorating and mutate into something worse.   


I post this to vent but also to see if anybody can give me some good advice on how to overcome this. I'm going to die or develope a serious illness if I continue being constantly in pain. Thank you if you read thus far, I'd appreciate your advice.  


PD: Before someone mentions it, as I said I cannot afford paying a therapist right now so that's not an option I can choose. I need a solution that's at my disposal. Thanks.",06Dec2020,1

784,"Hey those reading this.
So, my main social media app i use for messaging my gf, friends and so on is Instagram. I'd get a ton of notifications regarding these messages while browsing another app for example YouTube. Throughout the entire day, under these notifications was this seperate little box that said ""Quick Reply"", with of course responses to these messages. I never really gave any thought to it other than sub-conciously. Later on during my day however I realised that these ""Quick Replies"" weren't just default replies. They'd actually change to suit the message i'd been sent. As soon as i noticed it i brought it up to my gf, once done they had immediately stopped appearing. That little box with the heading ""Quick Replies"" just vanished and had stopped appearing. I wasn't able to find it in my phones nor Instagrams settings

Is this a feature? on Instagrams...or Samsungs part or could it be something more sinister than that like a 3rd party, stalking my messages?",06Dec2020,1

791,"I live in a 3 bedroom house with one other person. Rent is 1750, and I pay $100 more for the master bedroom. I pay $925/month, she pays $825 a month. When we moved in we wanted to have a third extra bedroom for shared office/music/art room.

She has mentioned that she is very low on money right now, and has said that if my best friend (who is in between housing &amp; employment) wanted to rent the third bedroom for a month or something that that would be fine with her and it would help us with rent a bit.

My friend unfortunately doesn't have the money to pay for a whole month right now, but just got a short term job for 2-4 weeks and is wondering if it'd be possible to stay here intermittently for that time. He has been staying with his dad &amp; dad's friend's family, but he can't be there full time for several weeks. The job is about 45 minutes away, near where he is staying. He's proposed possibly coming to stay with me during the week while he isn't working, probably Monday-Thurs for 2-4 weeks. 

So basically, I am hoping for some input on what would be fair in terms of rent. He would not be full on moving in, and would stay with me in my room, not renting the 3rd bedroom. I want it to be fair to my friend and my roommate (and me). He doesn't have a ton of money but wants to pay fairly for staying/utilities. They get along fine, and my friend and I would mostly be hanging out in my room (the house is pretty spacious). It wouldn't affect much for my roommate, but I know having an extra human in the house isn't nothing. 

How would you go about it, and what would be simplest/fair for everyone?",06Dec2020,1
792,"\*I will be keeping my information low key and this is a burner account.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a 23 year old guy who just lately bought himself an absolute dream apartment, I'm dubbed as the next big thing in the profession I do and I have a lot of really fine girls after me and because of these facts you'd assume a person would be happy and feel great however its the complete opposite of that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a relationship for the first time in my life for almost 4 years and at that time went through a phase of a lot of injuries which lead me to go have a lot of surgeries which ended up ending my career in the sport I love and apparently its a miracle that I am still fit and in great shape because there was a huge risk that I will not get back to sports.

Speaking of the relationships it was a relationship where the highs were by far the highest they could be and the lows were the lowest lows they could be, it was the first time I felt in love and at home with someone and before I used to be a person that would love being alone, thus the reason that was my first relationship too. But now after the relationship and after I bought myself the sick apartment I have been feeling the loneliest I could ever be, I have started to stress eat like crazy and gain a lot of weight in a small time. 

The thing that did not help was the fact that me, a guy that isnt a one night stand kind of a guy had a girl coming over and it ended up with us having sex. It completely broke me and after that I feel sick and even more lonely. I feel like im in a hole and although I said there are a lot of girls texting me and trying to get to a position where they could be dating me however the next chapter will answer the confusing part of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I over my ex? -

We broke up few months ago and I will be completely honest and say that I probably have not gotten over my ex, but also at the same time I really would not want to be with her as she was extremely toxic and in our relationship I had a lot of people wondering how do I cope with everything we had, as she was extremely abusive and manipulative. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Everything apart from my previous relationship, which I feel are driving me insane:

&amp;#x200B;

I have been switching my friendgroups in my life a lot and that has led me to a situation where I feel the reason I'm lonely is that I dont have friends that would be down to do stuff with me as actively as I'd want. Mainly it is because a lot of them have girlfriends nowadays and that has led me to a completely isolated situation where I just keep on feeling an INCREDIBLE amount of loneliness pain. I cant stand being alone anymore and that is literally mentally killing me. 

Also gym and running has always been something that has helped keep me sane, but due to the fact that right now its really cold in my country means that I cant go running because after the surgeries I had I have a situation where cold weather affects me and meaning that I cant run or do sports with cold because I am in a lot of pain.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How do I cure the immense loneliness? I feel like I'm heading to an extremely deep hole where I honestly am not sure I can come out of. 

After my surgeries I was in a really dark state with depression but I managed to overcome it but I really do feel this time it isnt depression yet and it feels its heading to a WAY darker state and I am really scared of it because I have literally no one completely close to me.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn‚Äôt mind me drinking occasionally and I‚Äôm totally against smoking. I‚Äôm a wannabe med student and the last party I went to was almost 3 years ago so all round I‚Äôd say he has nothing to worry about. The only thing is I LOVE tattoos. Like I fucking love them. I want so many but I‚Äôve only gotten one behind my ankle on my 18th which ofc I didn‚Äôt tell him about. That was about a year ago now and I am itching to get another couple ones but he is so against tats and I have no idea why cause his sister and nephews have many. He found out about my only tat a few months ago when my lil brother (7) saw it when I was wearing shorts and said ‚ÄúWOW I LOVE YOUR TATTOO!‚Äù And unfortunately for me, my dad entered the room right as he said it. 
Now I thought that he was gonna be so mad and blah blah right? BUT NO! He just fucking walked into the room and said ‚Äúreally?‚Äù proceeded to check and was like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get another one or we‚Äôll get it lasered off‚Äù and walked out the fucking room!

795,"Hey, so I never really do this but I‚Äôm a very low point and I just want some advice/support. Here‚Äôs a little back story...so I‚Äôm in the military and my fianc√© lives about 6 hours away (12hr round trip). I would always come down every weekend no matter if it was 2 days or 4 days. Any opportunity I had I would go down to see her and I loved every bit of it and would do it over and over again. That is until yesterday. Before I joined the military I smoked pot with good friends and where I‚Äôm from marijuana is illegal. So you have to go to some sketchy places from time to time to get marijuana. So I thought I would be a great idea for my fianc√© to just get it from my best friends instead of going to random peoples houses ya know. Well she started hangin out with my friends and I had no problem until it started getting later and later until ab 2am sometimes even 3am. I informed her I was becoming uncomfortable with the situation and I would like it if she stop hanging out with them that late. She failed to do so many times (she would say she loses track of time). So I told her either you can doing that or I‚Äôm going to go because I‚Äôm having a hard time trusting you. So that‚Äôs what she did, she dropped them (as so I thought). They had 0 contact for the past 3 months (or Atleast I thought). Well my fianc√© father pulled up to my ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù house yesterday and something just wasn‚Äôt adding up to me. So I started question them and playing the card like oh he just told me everything and vise versa. Until finally I was tired of doing that and I just merged the call together to which they argued and in the process everything came out. So basically my Ex-Fianc√© and ex-bestfriend had been scheming on me and waiting until 3 am to get together and do their thing. For the past 5 months. I never had a clue that it was happening and there was never any signs of infidelity. But every weekend I would come down and see her and be with her. As soon as I would leave she would have another man in that house and in my bed. I loved that woman with everything I had. I never once gave her a reason to want to cheat. I never showed anything but loyalty to her. I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt allowed here but the people that I would talk to about this situation are the people that caused the situation...",06Dec2020,1

So I‚Äôm the youngest of 4 siblings and they all dislike me. They always make these rude comments and manipulate my mother against 
 me and it gets me really upset. They always go out without me and have fun. They‚Äôre constantly putting me down, and they always make these mean comments then when I get defensive they always accuse me of ‚Äústarting arguments‚Äù. Or when they make a rude comment and I say how that‚Äôs rude and I don‚Äôt like it I‚Äôm always getting called ‚Äúa victim‚Äù then they‚Äôll make a joke about how I‚Äôm a victim then I‚Äôll argue and say I‚Äôm not then like I said earlier ‚Äúalways starting arguments‚Äù. My mom is tbh really stupid everyone in my house knows it and she‚Äôs easily manipulated. When my sister is mean to her she‚Äôll say ‚Äúyour always mean to everyone‚Äù which she is then when all my siblings are calling me victim for example she‚Äôll always jumps on the fun.

Another thing is like 2 weeks ago my mom says ‚Äúwhy are you so mean to your siblings‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy are you always starting arguments‚Äù.

I just can‚Äôt handle them anymore honestly when I tell them how they‚Äôre being mean it gets no where, if I try to ignore them they continue making these rude comments to me, I can‚Äôt talk back, I‚Äôm not a physical guy I try to avoid that at all costs.

797,"* my daughter provided me with an accessible phone, I can answer calls using my face, handsfree. i can also decline calls using my face. 
* I have never attended even so much as an appointment without my daughters to help me communicate. It's not just a language thing, people just don't understand me, even when I speak English. I ended up on ECMO, because I was complaining of heart pain from 11am to 11pm, and no one believed me until my daughter jumped on a call after visiting hours during a hospital stay, and spoke for me. 
* The phone is on a gooseneck stand, attached to the hospital bed. 
* I need the phone to face me, so I facial recognition can recognize me 
* I don't require ANY help to use this phone, my family has been clear that folks can end calls and move it out of the way IF and WHEN it is in the way. IT HAS NOT BEEN IN THE WAY 

What's happening now: 

* The staff kept sedating me and restraining me because they couldn't understand me and thought I was agitated, so my daughters (who are also my healthcare proxies) started jumping on a video call with me, and helped out with communication. The nurses asked my daughters to stay on calls and even called them up, because the staff couldn't understand me. They don't stay on the calls because I end calls and indicate when I need to rest and when I don't need them 
* Now I am scared, because they have taken my accessible phone away from me, even though I require no help to use it. All I need is for my phone to be at face/eye level, so I can accept and reject calls and communicate by nodding, shaking head and blinking. THE NURSES KEEP TAKING MY DEVICE OFF THE STAND AND HIDING IT IN TOWELS. 
* I walked into the hospital talking, walking, laughing, joking with my caregivers/daughters. I am now left without damage to me Liver, Kidneys, Lungs, Heart. They punctured my lung accidentally a few days ago and don't know how. I have been developing a chest infection afterwards, its been worsening. I don't understand when I tell them my legs or at least one leg and arms need stretching because they hurt, unless my daughters tell them. They tried giving me Fentanyl for leg aches. 
* I don't want to be sedated all the time, I am scared without my family. I have not been allowed to speak to them, I tried to tell the nurses I want my phone and they won't let me have it 

What are my rights? Under the law I am classed as disabled because of my heart condition. I want my daughters to help me communicate, the hospital has banned in person visits, but now they are trying to ban my phone communication with my daughters who are my caregivers and healthcare proxies.

My ex was and I dated for two years, about two years ago. Throughout the whole relationship, things would happen that alarmed or scared me, but I let those red flags fly despite my lack of ease. Things ended after I drove to my parent's house in a catatonic state and could not recall why I was there. My parents later told me that I was unable to answer basic questions like where I was or what I had done that day. Someone would ask me a question and I would space out for 5-10 minutes and then just say ""I don't know."" I was brought to the emergency room where I remember believing the hospital staff as trying to murder me and harvest my organs. After a few days, I was released. During the time my ex made no effort to visit me and only spoke to my parents once. He called my father to ask where I was and what happened, my father explained the situation. My ex simply asked, ""are you going to call the cops?"" My dad was bewildered and had no clue why my ex was asking that, and to this day we still don't know. What I do know is that he manipulated me for two years. He would randomly dose me with acid and joke about having killed his ex. Then I began to fear he might kill me. One while doing yard work he asked me to mulch an area of the yard, I did so then asked what I should do next, so he directed me to another patch. He had me go back and forth between the two patches many times, and when I would mention I already did them he would act like I was crazy and tell me I definitely didn't. Soon after that he asked me to get something from the shed and painted on the back wall in dripping he had painted ""watch your head"" in red letters. I am so thankful I got out of that relationship, but here I am two years later still afraid to fully trust anyone. I fear I will never genuinely trust or love another person again and I don't know where to begin with sorting this all out.

When I‚Äôm with him I‚Äôm usually pretty happy, or I was before I started to overthink things. I‚Äôve been having these random passing thoughts that make me doubt my feelings or my decisions. He seems pretty sure about me which hurts all that much more because I don‚Äôt want to be confused about him, I don‚Äôt want to hurt him. 

I keep having these thoughts with really nothing provoking them. I do like to be around him and I think the more I get to know him the more fun I‚Äôll have with him.

Furthermore I have some serious health problems lol and i don't feel sad over being sick. I feel lost and sad when I thinking about it not working out with her. I've given it a lot of time and there's not a day that goes by without me thinking about what she'd be doing. 

I've tried to date other people. I installed tinder too. It just doesn't workout for me. It's not like I don't get any matches but I never connect with anyone. Maybe I am a degenerate. Maybe this idea of being together with someone is a facade. 

At this point I'm not scared of death but sad about this girl. What are my options? What can I do? I have tried many things in the past 4 years but to no avail.",06Dec2020,1
810,"Ok so I bought a townhouse in February, it's a middle unit with adjacent units on either side. Both neighbours were pretty quiet, but one sold shortly after. The new neighbour moved in a few months ago, he's not so bad himself, but he has a son that just irritates me. It's not truly the son's fault though, more info below.

The kid is 10 years old and basically shrieks everything he says, it pierces the walls and gets under my skin. He also never walks and appears to run up the stairs for fun. One time I did an average and he ran up the stairs every minute for an hour straight.

It's not like it's all day, I do have times of peace (usually at night) but basically any time he's awake and at home it seems like it's constant noise. I'm aware there  are designated quiet hours and most Stratas won't do anything if it's not during those hours, but it's just ridiculous how noisy he can be; this is the most important purchase of my life and I feel like I can't fully enjoy it because of that pest.

In the title I say he's troubled because I do know some things about the household. A week into them moving I came back from an evening at my parents and saw there were police cars parked near my unit. It didn't take long to realize it was for my neighbour. Once the police left I heard screaming and put my ear to the wall, I also got info from a person I know in law enforcement.

 The Dad had apparently struck the kid and neighbors called CPS on him. The Dad got really drunk and by the time a social services worker showed up he was plastered and the kid had to be removed from the home. They took the kid to his Mom but she was also drunk so he went to a friend instead. From like 10PM to 2AM the Dad was drunk screaming his head off to somebody on the phone. Heard a lot of sad shit like how he wants to send the kid to a foster home and how he deserved to get hut and that he will do it again if he has to.

I've had very few interactions with my neighbour, just quick hellos if we are leaving at the sane time. I did have some stern words for the kid a few weeks ago when I caught him running around throwing litter around adjacent units. Other than that, nothing.

I'm kind of banking on this resolving itself over time. I doubt the kid will want to hang around much once he's older and has more independence. I was kind of hoping it was joint custody, but it seems like the Dad has majority custody as the kid is here just about every day.",06Dec2020,1

Like, there isn't a single person on this planet that I would trust more than her, just being with her keeps me happy and all.

For whatever odd reason, whenever she spends time with her other friends, I feel.. left out. Recently she was in a private call with one of her best friends, and for whatever reason, that made me feel bad. I kind of felt.. left out or unwanted, because ig I really wanted to spend time with her but couldn't. It's unreasonable of course, and I'm very aware of it, but knowing this doesn't change my feelings.

813,"Spring 2021 I graduate with a business degree. I have been employed with a seasonal company these past 4 years while in school. It's part time so it works. I have grown tired of the company and want to find a full time job when I graduate.

I don't want to burn any bridges, and I'd get an excellent reference form my employer... However, I would have to quit before the season starts so they can train my replacement. This leaves me jobless until I can find employment in my field.

My alternative is to stay on with my employer for one more season and commit to work until I wrap things up in October. This would avoid putting them in a position where they need to train someone to take on my rather broad range of administrative tasks when they are already busy. Then I would look for employment over the summer with the condition that I can start in November or late October. 

With the pandemic still raging on, I see it being beneficial to stay with my employer. It also looks better that I'm employed while looking for work. My biggest issue is that it's part time and I don't make much money. I'm also just tired of working there, but it's not a horrible environment. 

I meet with my boss next week to discuss the coming year and I know he's going to ask what I have planned. Unfortunately, they don't have enough work for me to be full time. However, I think he is going to give me another employees tasks as he's been unreliable this past year. So it would help. 

I don't see myself with them long term because I don't have an interest in their industry and I don't have any opportunity to advance my career there. I want to get in with a company where I can learn and move up. I want to work on my personal and professional development. 

The pro's seem to outweigh the cons for staying on until late 2021. I'm just so eager to move on and get my career going. I want to make some real money! However, I can use 2021 as time to take certification courses and to network... I'm hoping I will have a better chance at a job in fall instead of competing with all the summer graduates.

I've brought it up to the several people in my life who do this and how it makes me uncomfortable. In the past I've only experienced negative things with people who do this. Now that I meet someone new he also does this. I confronted him about it and he said it was to avoid certain people joining him. Yeah fair I said.. But that I also do not think its fair to others.

816,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 
I (25F) have been sleeping with this guy (29M) we‚Äôll call him Jake for about 6 months now. Jake has been great and as it stands now everything is mostly just physical, he‚Äôs a great guy but neither one of us has expressed any interest in being in a relationship, I‚Äôm finishing up school and from what I understood he still wasn‚Äôt over an ex. Which was fine and dandy, the sex is good and pretty consistent and we‚Äôre content. 

Or so I thought. 

I recently found out I fucked up. Jake still has photos up on Instagram and Twitter of his ex girlfriend, I didn‚Äôt really think anything of it because most men I know update their social media once every three to five business years and he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt post regularly anyways, this should have been my first clue. I also began to notice that when he referred to his ex he would refer to her as if everything was recent, don‚Äôt get me wrong he doesn‚Äôt talk about her often and that‚Äôs probably why it‚Äôs taken me a while to realize it but he doesn‚Äôt talk about her like an ex. It‚Äôs never past tense it always sounds like he just saw the girl yesterday. At this point I thought maybe I fucked up and caught feelings and jealousy got the best of me. Until I overheard him casually mention to an old coworker that he was going to be moving in with his girlfriend Jenny (not her name obv) and that they‚Äôve been together a little over two years and that he felt like it was finally time. You know in movies when the screen freezes and the record scratches, yeah it was like that, I felt like someone just punched me in the stomach. I left and went home and I haven‚Äôt talked to him since, I don‚Äôt know if he knows that I heard him, we‚Äôre currently not in contact and I honestly could not care less. What does bug me though is the fact that whoever this girl is has been cheated on for over 6 months and is about to sign a lease with this man. 

I don‚Äôt know where she lives I don‚Äôt have her phone number and I only have a first name, I can‚Äôt find her on social media, Jake doesn‚Äôt follow her or tag her in anything and as far as I know she doesn‚Äôt have a job at the moment because rona. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs even my place to tell her in the first place. I feel like a horrible person. Any and all advice is appreciated.

823,"So I (26F) started renting a room last month. I was really excited to finally have a stable place to live, I‚Äôve moved 4 times this year and was homeless for 2 months, plus it was hard finding a place willing to accept my dogs.

Well anyways my landlord was supposed to move out 2 weeks after I moved in, and then there would be 2 more rooms to rent out. First a girl who graduated from the same college as me and is my age was supposed to move in to one of the rooms, but she got a job out of state. So my landlord started getting desperate and gave that room to a couple still in high school (let‚Äôs call them Jake and Lacy). I didn‚Äôt want to live with any men at all, much less an 18 year old, and I always hated living with couples because I feel like I‚Äôm intruding all the time, but I can‚Äôt afford to rent the whole house and so I didn‚Äôt see much choice. The 3rd room remained vacant.

The week before I moved in I was told that my landlord was actually leaving later than she‚Äôd planned so all their stuff was still in the house so I couldn‚Äôt move my stuff from storage yet. She also had two dogs and one of them didn‚Äôt like my dogs and would bark loudly whenever she saw them so my dogs had to stay in my room unless they were on their way outside. Any loud noises also triggered this dog so I had to be very quiet at all times even if I didn‚Äôt have the dogs with me. It really sucked but it was temporary.

When she finally moved out, it was the same time that Jake was moving in. At the same time I emptied my storage unit. Since I was gone all day at the storage unit, Jake and Lacy saw a mostly empty house and assumed I just wasn‚Äôt using any of the space since I had been living here for almost a month at that point. I came home to a completely redecorated living room and dining room and no room for me to put any furniture anywhere. They even went out and got a (fake) tree without consulting me, which sucked because I had been looking forward to getting a real one and purposely put off getting one until they moved in so they could help pick one out.

I told them my concerns about the lack of space for me to add furniture (I was planning on having  some friends over later this month and there isn‚Äôt enough seating) and they just pointed out all the ways it wouldn‚Äôt fit with their couch, tree, entertainment center, and Jake‚Äôs desk (won‚Äôt fit in their room). I also mentioned I wanted to put dog beds downstairs and Jake freaked out and said he‚Äôd been told by the landlord that my dogs only go in my room and outside, no living room. He went on to rant about how he doesn‚Äôt want dogs on his couch or touching his desk or going down the hallway to his room and scaring his cat. Lacy calmed him down and she pointed out some places where I could put the beds, but the message that they are unwelcome was already well received and I told them I‚Äôd put a bookshelf there instead. I also talked to them about how they were taking most of the kitchen space and so we split the cabinets, drawers and fridge space evenly.

So reason one that I feel trapped is I don‚Äôt feel welcome in the living room because I have to use their stuff and can‚Äôt add anything my of my own (other than this bookshelf) and my dogs are limited to where they can go again.

Reason 2 starts with Lacy. She is a actually very nice (so is the Jake outside of that outburst about the dogs), but she doesn‚Äôt actually officially move in until next month (after she graduates‚Äî her parents wanted her to wait until then). When we signed our leases my landlord warned Jake that Lacy shouldn‚Äôt spend the night too often before she moves in as it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for me to pay 1/2 of the utilities when she‚Äôs using 1/3 of them. They both agreed but here we are, 1 week since Jake moved in and not only has she spent most nights here so far, they‚Äôve had other overnight guests. 

First it was Jake‚Äôs brother who I think slept over twice. Then on Friday Lacy told me a friend (Tiffany) was coming over. I thought it‚Äôd be for a few hours. Nope. Tiffany had just broken up with her boyfriend Scott. Scott had apparently cheated on Tiffany and this was going to be a girls night with Lacy consoling Tiffany. But when Tiffany came I overheard bits of their conversation and supposedly Scott didn‚Äôt actually cheat and there had been a misunderstanding. Scott would be arriving soon to talk about it. In the meantime Tiffany and Lacy started talking about the empty bedroom. Jake came home and they convinced Tiffany to contact our landlord and apply. The plan (if she‚Äôs accepted) is that she‚Äôll move in on the 15th. (All of this was overheard, no one has talked to me about any of this).

Scott came over and to my astonishment, in the morning I woke up to discover that of course Lacy spent the night again, but also that Scott and Tiffany had spent the night in the empty bedroom!! They have a bed in there and everything. Then last night the same thing happened!

So my dogs can‚Äôt go anywhere inside the house, none of my stuff is in the common areas, we have constant guests, constant overnight guests, they are blatantly ignoring the landlords rules and using the empty bedroom, and I‚Äôm always hearing their teenage drama and arguments. (I‚Äôm not trying to eavesdrop they are just super loud).

Even without all the rules they are breaking, I don‚Äôt want to live with 4 teenagers, assuming Tiffany and Scott move in officially.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have a one year lease. I don‚Äôt want to report what they‚Äôre doing to the landlord without confronting them, but I can‚Äôt stand confrontation either. If Jake and Lacy get mad at me that‚Äôll just make things worse. I was thinking of renting the empty room for myself, but I have no use for it other than to keep it empty and that doesn‚Äôt solve the common space issue.

I know I need to just suck it up and say something to them, I guess I‚Äôd just like advice about how to go about it with as little drama as possible.",06Dec2020,1

John used to be a massage therapist, so sometimes at work he‚Äôll rub my shoulders/hands. He was just trying to be nice, I thought.

One day John, my friend, and I were smoking weed at my friend‚Äôs house. John didn‚Äôt smoke, but I did. I was sitting under a throw blanket and he was massaging my back, and moved to my hip, and under my shorts. My heart was pounding but I was frozen. He got really close to touching the top of my vagina when I made up an excuse to leave. I told my friend what happened but I thought I was overreacting.

This past Friday was my birthday, and I had a small party with close friends and my roommates. My roommate, let‚Äôs call her Kayla, has a girlfriend. She is a lesbian. Her girlfriend was at my birthday party as well. John, Kayla, and Kayla‚Äôs girlfriend seem to be having fun together and hang out all night.

So for the past few months she‚Äôs been so depressed and spends most of her time in her room with the door locked and just drinks or smokes weed. And when she does come out all she does is get mad at me for the stupidest things and just yells at me and picks a fight because she‚Äôs drunk. We haven‚Äôt had the best relationship in the past but at least before I‚Äôd be able to go to school for seven hours and not have to deal with her, now I‚Äôm stuck at home

So now my job is the only source of income we have right now, I‚Äôve been working nights at a warehouse and doing online school during the day, so I‚Äôm always so tired. Also I‚Äôm falling behind in school and my grades because I can barely concentrate during my lectures and keep doing really badly on tests because I hardly have time to study. I keep missing deadlines for things to be submitted and I‚Äôm having a really hard time keeping track of all my assignments. If I try to mention anything to my mom about how im feeling about everything she‚Äôll say things about how when my dad was my age he was working two jobs and supporting his family and didn‚Äôt complain once, and that I need to ‚Äúman up‚Äù because I‚Äôm almost an adult

Also I have two sisters who are in middle school that I pretty much have to take care of and do everything for because my mom just doesn‚Äôt do anything anymore. So I have to be the one to help them with their homework, cook meals for them, drive them to their practices, make appointments for them, clean the apartment up after them, etc. I love them a lot and I don‚Äôt want to make it sound like I‚Äôm complaining but it‚Äôs just getting to a point where I‚Äôm so overwhelmed and stressed out by what‚Äôs going on and exhausted that I feel like I‚Äôm going to pass out most of the time. 

I put together a budget based off of my paychecks after canceling our cable and we‚Äôll be fine for a while until the spring probably we won‚Äôt be able to make April‚Äôs rent payment or will have to give up something else 

I had to break up with my girlfriend because I couldn‚Äôt spend enough time with her and she was getting mad and couldn‚Äôt understand why. and now my friends don‚Äôt even ask me to hang out anymore because I keep saying no because I‚Äôm so busy, so I‚Äôve felt so lonely and haven‚Äôt been able to talk to anyone about this because I don‚Äôt want my sisters to be worried about what kind of financial situation we‚Äôre in. every time I try and tell my mom she needs to get another job and stop drinking she screams at me/ tells me how much she hates me

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore and I feel like I‚Äôve reached my limit of what I can handle and I‚Äôm starting to question why I‚Äôm even trying anymore and what the point of anything is, I‚Äôm getting to be in a really dark place and things don‚Äôt seem to be getting any better in the near future and I really need advice",06Dec2020,1

843,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about 6 months after knowing each other for a bit over a year beforehand. At first it was great, her sibling didn‚Äôt really like me but we got past it without much trouble. Her sibling seemed to warm up to me and all was good for 4 ish months. But then it started to seem like she stopped putting effort into it, we used to be able to sit and talk for hours on end and it was amazing. Now I‚Äôll try to start a conversation and I‚Äôll get a one or two word response. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs cheating on me and I truly believe she cares about me. I know I really care about her but I‚Äôm not really enjoying it anymore and I‚Äôm starting to think it might have been better to stay as friends. A possible reason is that she‚Äôs super shy, I am as well but I‚Äôm trying to stay close and keep things working. Not only this but she will always choose her sister over anyone else including me, now I completely understand that family comes first but it‚Äôs to the point where she isn‚Äôt really making her own decisions anymore and that she‚Äôll even back her sibling when they‚Äôre just being an asshole. For instance earlier today a mutual friend mentioned someone (let‚Äôs call them joe) none of us like but my gf most of all and it made her uncomfortable. Instead of saying that it was making her uncomfortable and asking him to stop her sibling just started being real bitchy and pointing out every tiny mistake they‚Äôve done recently. Now I would understand this if our friend knew that talking about joe made my gf uncomfortable. But joe has been mentioned a lot recently and it didn‚Äôt seem like anything was wrong. I really do care about my girlfriend and don‚Äôt want to break up but I don‚Äôt know what to do because it‚Äôs becoming really draining as I‚Äôm putting a bunch of effort into it on top of classes and other things I have to do and it doesn‚Äôt really seem like she cares anymore.",06Dec2020,1

845,"I think I have a toxic relationship with my mother. I'm 32 but don't have a job because I'm disabled and live off welfare. My mother spends a lot of time lecturing me about everything she can think of, but she feels it is necessary to share this and for me to learn. She over-explains things, repeats herself, and can take an hour to discuss something.

One example is the dishwasher at her house. She told me she didn't want a dishwasher, but had one installed for me when I inherit her house. She's given constant lectures on exactly how to use it, and goes into detailed stories of how she figured out settings. And repeats those lectures a lot, she says to make sure I remember.

It's tiring to deal with. She will tell me to come listen and there will be a stack of papers next to her on the subjects to lecture about, and I have to nod along for an hour or so.

She gets angry whenever I ask her to just give out the main points. Or when I say I can figure it out myself (she says I can't). Or when I express I'm tired of listening by sighing or something (she says, ""you don't want to learn? It's important!"").

Sometimes it escalates. She called me over to show me something, and I said ""oh?"" But she heard it as a sigh and demanded what I meant by that, and then got very angry. She's now refusing to talk to me and told e to shut up when I try telling her I didn't mean anything by it.

846,"Title.  

Background:

\- I work full time and have a master's degree. I'm not ""rolling in the dough"" but I make an okay living (around $52k). I have great health insurance from the company that I work for and am working towards a pension. I was going to look into 401ks once my debt is paid off more; I plan on using like 80% of my paychecks towards my debts (i.e., car and student loans). I have around 6 months of emergency funds in my savings that I could access if I ever got laid off. Credit score is 800+.

\- I currently live at home with my parents . Originally, I was suppose to move out with a now ex in early 2021, which is obviously now not happening for obvious reasons.  I do give my parents ""rent"" (around $300ish per month towards food and living there) and pay for all of my other bills. I have offered to give them more, however, they stated that they would rather see me using the extra money to invest in my future which I appreciate. I try to do my fair share of work around the house but I feel like at times my mother still ""babies"" me and overall doesn't treat me like an adult (e.g., texts me where I am if I'm gone from the house for al long time, does my laundry for me when I would like to do it myself, etc.). Personally, I would like to move out once the pandemic calms down and my car is completely paid off (I have around 8k left).

Is it really that bad that I'm 27 and still living at home? I have never lived on my own before, however, I was trying to move out on my own prior to the pandemic.

847,"I dropped out of high school freshman year because I couldn‚Äôt handle my social anxiety + depression anymore, and I‚Äôve basically been a neet ever since. I‚Äôll be 21 in one month, and I‚Äôm having a hard time accepting it because I still feel like a kid. 

It feels like I‚Äôm wearing a big heavy backpack, and inside is this: 

Guilt for never having worked a day in my life, for not knowing how to drive, for never being able to find the motivation to study for a GED. Stress/anxiety for my future, I worry I‚Äôll never amount to anything, that I‚Äôll never stop allowing my social anxiety to control me. The guilt is extreme enough that I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve earned the right to be happy about anything anymore. The enjoyment I got out of hobbies like video games has been sucked away because there‚Äôs a voice in the back of my mind telling me I could/should be doing something more productive. 

It‚Äôs like social anxiety is one villain, depression is another, and they play off of each other, resulting in me feeling so worthless and trapped that I struggle to even shower some days. Sometimes just existing takes great energy. 

The contradictory feelings of wanting a job so I can start my life and not wanting a job because it‚Äôs terrifying stresses me out so much that I experience physical symptoms. 

The quarantine life everyone complains about, the one where the days blur together... I‚Äôve been living that for about 6 years now and it feels like I‚Äôm drowning.

854,"So prior to quarantine being confirmed here in the US, I would say that I was normally at home a month or two, before Quarantine was confirmed here in the US. To be more specific, I would be staying home on Fridays or on the Weekends, mainly because I was very occupied with school during the week. That 3 days of relaxation is what I really needed. 

Once quarantine was confirmed I was really okay with the flow of things. We transitioned into Zoom Meetings pretty well, from where we left off on my Class that we were actively going On-Ground for. I finished that Term (Semester) really well. But once I transitioned into my next Term and Chemistry being my next class, all online no less. Was really a no go for me and my class simulations were complete trash. So I decided to take a leave of absence for the Summer and continue and hopefully get an on ground class at the end of August. Which of course was not the case. COVID really grew. 

At this point I ended up being inactive the entire Term for Chemistry while being active for my English Class. I ended up doing good in English. The lab Simulations weren't so user friendly, and consistently seeing my grade drop week after week is what discouraged me early on. 

Fast forward to this Term I'm taking Chemistry again. I'm 3 weeks in and I still haven't done anything. I'm finding it hard to find the motivation to do anything. My dopamine and level of interest in literally anything has been really low. My level of interest has influenced a very short temper when it comes to having to do extra around the house, along with school work. My parents have noticed my short temper and get mad at me when they don't understand that while they're out and about working, being at home 24/7 is very devoid of energy. I feel that being able to go out, and drive around, even if it's not working. Being able to do literally anything outside of the house really bring me energy or motivation.

856," Hiya!

Me and my boyfriend decided to send each other gifts for christmas, he is from the UK and I'm from Canada.

\*He already sent his and I already received it btw but it didn't had those 2 things (perfume and lithium battery)

So here goes,

I'm sending lots of stuff but one of the thing is a small bottle of perfume I love to wear with a cute stuffed animal so he could spray a bit and cuddle it while he's in bed :p I know it's cheesy but believe me I know he will love it.

Also I'm sending a ""special kind of toy"" and it got a lithium battery in it.

For the rest everything would be okay but here come my problem : I just finished paying for a pickup and shipping from TransGlobalExpress. Price were way better then other places and my boyfriend told me he used their services many time in the past without problem, I saw during the time I was filling out the forms and everything they ask you to make sure no hazardous items are part of the package and in these list of items was : No Aerosol, No Battery (lithium or Ion) and No Perfume.

.... I still went through it .... I know that's sound completely stupid but with christmas being closer and closer and me being last minute as always my only other choice would be to cancel this delivery somehow and go to like UPS or Fedex and see how much they would charge if there's those 2 things inside to be in time, but just a normal parcel was 2 and half the price that it cost me with TransGlobalExpress.

Now I'm thinking of letting it go through and hoping it doesn't get seen..... still unsure what I'm doing.

Anyone have ever sent things like that and weren't suppose to and it still went through without worry??

Thanks for taking the time of reading this post, I appreciate it !

I worked with them for almost 7 months , but then I realised that I was doing something wrong and I hated myself so much , so I decided to expose the app and tell the victims  about it so I started looking  for their social media accounts. many victims was shocked when I told them and they stopped using the app since then , but there's one victim who's still using it till now , I told him everything , and even showed him some screenshots of how our work is done , I tried to explain that the girl he loves is fake and she's just moderator working for the site, but he didn't want to believe me and he's still talking and waisting his money , I really feel pity for him, what can I do ?",06Dec2020,1

876,"Hey. I don't have anyone else to talk about this and need another opinion because I feel so stuck and depressed and don't know what to do. Backstory: I'm a 19 year old girl, I have an older brother, and a younger brother. Deadbeat dead who convinced my mom leave all her family and immigrate to Canada. When they got here, she took care of us 3 kids while he looked for a job. He did not allow her to learn how to drive, how to speak english, in fear of her taking us and leaving him. He would abuse her in front of us. Then as soon as he found a job, he ended up leaving, no child care nothing just disappeared. He left my mother in a foreign country with no money, no car and in a cheap 1 bedroom apartment with 3 kids.

Right as he left, my mom started to work nonstop at a restaurant in order to provide for us, so it was just 3 kids at home alone. My older brother started molesting me when I was around 7. He was 14. Then when he was around 15, the molesting stopped, but I guess he decided he didn't want to do anything anymore and started playing computer games 24/7 and did not talk to anyone in the family, was completely mute and still is to this day. So, that left me taking care of my little brother and feeding him and making sure he was okay. At this point, I am 8 year old, my dad left and I didn't know why, my brother had molested me, and my mom was never home and I never knew when she would come back or where she was because I was so young.

Obviously at this point, my mother was emotionally drained and decided to start abusing me, physically and emotionally (when she was home). I developed eating disorder and started cutting and tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 11. Tried many more times throughout my teen years and almost succeeded a couple times.

Fast forward to today: This is where I need an opinion. My older brother is now 26. He is still mute, has not talked to anyone in the family. He has not talked, not left the house, has been playing the computer for 11 years now, and sleeps on a couch in our tiny living room. My mom will not kick him out. He has not had a job, no school nothing! She brings him food to his desk where he has been sitting for 11 years and has no intention of kicking him out, making him go to school or anything. She also knows he molested me, and does not believe me. It is a terrible influence on my little brother, because every day he sees this 26 year old grown man sleeping on the couch with no job, no friends and no school and my mom not doing anything about it. Every time I start an argument about it, I try to tell my mom he has to leave, he has to go to school, he has to do something, she agrees, then does not do anything. Then she'll make me feel like shit for starting another fight in the family. But what am i suppose to do! She isn't doing anything and this is not okay for a 26 year old grown man!!!!! I still love him he is my brother I am so concerned about his future everyday and so stressed and worried for him. But if i bring it up, im the bad guy. BUT IF I DONT NOTHING CHANGES!!!!! He sleeps on the couch right in front of my bedroom. So everyday, I get to wake up, walk out of my room, face the person who molested my many times, and watch him do NOTHING.

We are so poor my mom is 52 and working 2 restaurant jobs, while he does NOTHING. Then she comes home, cooks him food, brings it to his computer, and that's another day for him. Does anyone else see how that is not okay???? Not to mention, I have vivid nightmares every night where an image of him molesting me repeats in my head over and over again and I feel like I can't breathe and I feel like I need to run away in the nightmare and I can't, then I wake up, walk out my room and he's right there on the couch. My mom also knows about these nightmares I have, and doesn't care.

I don't even know if anyone can give me an opinion on this but I feel if I didn't let this out some time soon, I would go insane. I don't talk to my friends about it because I don't like bad mouthing my family to anyone. I don't even know where I'm going with this I just feel so stuck and had to let it out. Could someone please tell me if im really just being a bitch like my mom thinks I am and what he is doing is actually okay or if im right and this can't keep going on!!!!! SO WHAT DO I DO??? I feel so stuck and like I can't freaking breathe everyday.",06Dec2020,1

879,"Hello
first of all, English isn‚Äôt my first language, so sorry for the mistakes.

I am not from the USA. In my country, we choose a university based on a single exam. Basically, extracurricular activities or Classes I got have no value. I prepared for the university entrance exam for nearly 1.5 years during my 11th and 12th years of high school. It was a long marathon but I told myself I will go to my dream school which is one of the best medical schools in my country. 

In my exam year -which was the first half of this year-  We experienced Corona so some course topics were removed due to the global pandemic from the university entrance exam. This made the exam relatively easy. There was an accumulation of rankings  (There was one point difference between 10.000th and 7000th). 


I couldn't enter my dream school. All my classmates who have a lower GPA ended up better than me. I‚Äôve felt broken. I am accepted in a school which is nice but It just doesn't meet my expectations. It is a state university, my dream school is private.
My new school is in a small city comparing to my dream one. I always feel like I don‚Äôt belong there. I think I am a little bit judgy because I couldn't experience the campus environment because of coronavirus. But I am so jealous of my friends that accepted to my dream school.


My lessons are okay. I got 80 on the first midterm but I know that I can do so much better. I feel unmotivated. Should I drop my med school, study harder, and try my chance again? My counselor and doctor relatives say your school won‚Äôt affect your medical specialty training. Because at the end of your school you will get a test for this and it is all about your personal effort. Also, I skipped the preparatory class in my current school so I will graduate -hopefully- earlier than my high school classmates. If I try my chance again I will lose at least 2 years. But I don't know, I feel like I am doing wrong with keep going in this school and all.

My mom was never a helicopter parent growing up, but she did want things done her way with little room for compromise. Honestly, I had no problems as a kid with any of this as I spent most of my childhood in the hospital due to a chronic illness. I was also very shy and scared of authority figures. 

Now that I‚Äôm an adult, my mom seems to try and still ‚Äúparent‚Äù me. I know that being a parent is something you can‚Äôt turn off, even after your kids are adults, but it‚Äôs getting too much.

I‚Äôve asked her plenty of times that I am an adult, I make my own choices about my diet &amp; lifestyle, and if something does happen that resulted from anything I do, the consequences are on me, and me only.

Every year he hosts a Christmas party, and for the last nine years I've gotten him a bottle of expensive wine, as a thank you. Over the last year or two, though, his boisterous drinking habits have developed into a problematic addiction. 

I don't want to aid and abet in his struggle this year, but I don't know what the hell to get him now. I want to find a gift that matches the tone of the previous years' gifts, minus the alcohol. Food's not really a good option either, as he has a host of stomach problems.

884,"About three years ago I bought a 07 Honda Civic for $600. It was a little dinged up and not the prettiest thing but its not really that bad. Only thing it needs still is a new fender to match the rest of the car. The car is at about 168K miles and every mechanic Ive spoken to says the thing will run well past 300K with good maintenance.

It has no mechanical issues, its just not the prettiest thing.

Here's the dilemma: Last month I bought a 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe that looks slick as hell and is turbocharged and just overall looks badass. I love driving it and the look of the car inside and out.

The only thing is, its mileage is a little up there at 161K and Ive gotten it inspected and it does need somethings that could cost me a few thousand.

I want to keep this badass car so bad, its the nicest car I've ever owned but I cant sacrifice the reliability I already have with my trusty Honda Civic.

I've thought about keeping both but storage becomes an issue and two car insurances and all that.

I won't lie, a big reason I like the car is because I wouldn't feel embarrassed to be seen getting in it or picking up a girl in it... I would be proud to do so. But again I dont want it to kill my wallet in the long term.

What do you guys think? I currently have the Coupe listed on Craiglist and have gotten one inquiry, I am also listing it for almost 2k more than I bought it because I got a good deal and believe I can get what I'm asking for... so theres also the possibility I make a nice little profit out of this fiasco.

She asked how i work ( as freelancer ), rates, making points on her sheet. How i would see the job delivered in name of the company. . . Nice chat, friendly woman, said she was born in the same area where i live. I thought it was going well. 

At some point ( 1 hour later ) she said, i will get my brother to come &amp; meet u. Fine, i‚Äôll wait here.
Waiting 5 min on my own. 

Doors go open like a flash, i stand up, gives the man a good &amp; strong handshake, he looks like John Taffar ( tv show bar resque ) - I‚Äôm like ok, u got this. Just say hi &amp; be kind &amp; interested in the job - company ( i did my research ) 

While were shaking hands. He‚Äôs first glimps on my clothes, my hair, glasses &amp; then eyes. He‚Äôs fake smiling. 

Maybe my looks doesnt match with his profile. I will try my best to keep speaking about how interested i am in the job, how i worked for in the past, what materials &amp; programs i use. 

He stops me like he is my boss allready. 
He start to ask me personally questions: like do you have a girlfriend? - seems surprising 
Or you have a driver licence - seems surprising 
Do you have money enough earnt in my life to buy a car that can drives? - seems surprising that all that stuff i do have.

‚Äú where u from?... Ah never heard of it, will not go there in..my..entire..life‚Äù

Our 'group' is sort of feuding sort of not with another 'group', but there is an overlap in 2 friends: A and B. One of the other group's members, C, was originally our friend in freshman year but left and then started talking shit about us. Whatever, that's fine. We moved on and now our group is relatively drama free and we're all chill. But their group isn't. And apparently they've been making fun of C, so A and B added her back into our groupchat. It makes me kind of uncomfortable but whatever, if she needs friends we can take her in. HOWEVER, I was recently added to the other group's discord server and their humor is absolutely vile. I love a dark joke, but this is ridiculous. Posting about how Breyona Taylor deserved it and how [N-words] are ruining the country. Anti- Chinese virus stuff and saying how they should round up all the illegals and put them in cages. Posting straight up I S I S executions. Insane shit. To them it's just a joke, and I probably would be overreacting. But as a POC it makes me so viscerally uncomfortable.

So anyway, here is the text message I drafted up to sent to my friend A:

""Hey, I saw that K joined the groupchat on insta. I don't really understand the circumstances behind it but I have no problem with it. The more the merrier!

I understand it's dark humor or whatever, but I don't think you understand how being a person of color I could feel really ostracized by it. A lot of things that may seem acceptable or borderline to you might make me feel very strongly.""

I want to be friends with A and B still, and could care less about C but whatever they want. I don't want them to think it's that I just hate C. How can I do this but stop them from making jokes that make me uncomfortable?",06Dec2020,1
899,"Hey guys! So I'm 19, currently in ''Cegep'', a weird phase of education here in Montreal that acts as sort of a bridge between high school and university (although we just call it 'college'). I'm studying social sciences (aka nothing), so the only real benefit of finishing my program would be allowing me to continue on to university if I so desire. I don't really have any concrete goals or aspirations at the moment, so school is really more about keeping my options open than anything else.

Here's the kicker: I was recently contacted by a fairly large company on Indeed, and they invited me to interview for the role of account executive. I decided to attend the interview(s), and now I've been offered the job and told I can start in mid January. They're offering 55,000 base salary for the first year with an additional 5000 added in year two, plus uncapped commission. I have a quite a bit of sales experience, so I'm pretty confident in my ability to perform on the job (making the prospects even more enticing).

Problem is, I'm not really passionate about sales. Sure, I could do it for a few years, but no fucking way would I want to spend the rest of my life making cold calls. But I'm not passionate about anything in school either; I'm just clinging on to the hope that I might one day be.

55k+ sounds like a lot of fucking money at 19, and the fact that I've managed to go from working for minimum wage at McDonald's to an offer like that in just a couple of years gives me the suspicion that I just might be able to make a fucking killing in a few years if I play my cards right. I like school as it allows me to artificially cling on to my adolescence, but can I honestly expect to make much more than that with a useless, bullshit degree in nothing?

I'm starting to ramble here...

My main questions:

1. Does the salary offered to me warrant dropping out of school?
2. Will my ability to rapidly move up in earning capacity hit a point of diminishing returns soon? Can I keep getting drastically better-paid jobs one after another to the point where I penetrate the upper middle class, or will I get stuck at a certain salary range?
3. Would this type of experience open up possibilities in other branches of the business world with more room for growth that I might be more interested in? Or would I be relegated to sales/mid-level management?
4. Is it stupid to stay in school just for the fun of it? Serious question; I love acting like a teenager and going to class and fucking around and learning all sorts of shit, but high school is over, and I honestly doubt that my educational endeavours will surmount to anything meaningful. Basically, school is just a way for me to not have to grow up just yet. Is that awful?

900,"Some backstory: since around age nine I've had chronic pain issues that made it hard for me to do most forms of exercise without being in pain. I've been out of PE class since then. My parents didn't really try and keep me fit because they thought that the pain issues would go away and I would be fine. That didn't happen.

Now I'm in high school, and can't run 10 feet without being completely out of breath. I look ""healthy""  so my parents aren't very concerned about my fitness. I've tried to bring up this issue before but they say in just over exaggerating it. However, literally being winded by running up the stairs as a teenager is an issue. I'm still bothered by the pain occasionally, but it's not as bad now so I think I could start doing more cardio. The thing is I have no idea where to start.

My doctor thinks that I'm a lot more physically fit than I am. I'm technically in an exercise class, but it is highly modified so I'm not in pain and most of the actual exercise is cut out. My parents brush over the highly modified part when talking to my doctor. My doctor thinking I'm fit is partially my fault for not speaking up, and I don't blame her for not noticing.

What do I do? Should I consult my doctor? Or just start following basic cardio workouts to build up my stamina? I know you aren't allowed to give health advice

I avoided her for a few days but then realised I was maybe being sensitive (happens a lot apparently) so just started talking again. Explained work was getting me down and had exam in 2 days so sorry for being sensitive etc. The next day she brings a friend round, I was upset as she didn‚Äôt tell me she was bringing someone round and if they were staying here all night.

Anyway to tonight, I again forgot about the other things as I‚Äôm probably being too sensitive like I do. We‚Äôre having a few drinks and both episodes come up. She says she did nothing wrong as I had a friend round after this (I deliberately told he was coming round and invited her to come sit with us). I said that she knew I had an exam as I told her the night before and she still brought her friend round. 

She‚Äôs claiming it‚Äôs the same as me bringing my pal round after the exam. Am I crazy? Am I too sensitive? I honestly don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs me at this point (highly likely).",06Dec2020,1

905,"My girlfriend called me toxic earlier today during a rant and now its stuck with me. She acted in a way she never has before, acting super coldly to me, looking down on me and when I asked what I could do to stop upsetting her she said ""you're toxic. fix that."" I then went on a rant about how I'm not willing to sit there and be looked down upon, and she apologised for how she acted. I said how am I toxic and she kept saying she didn't mean it. But she told me to specifically look through texts to see how I was, so I'm guessing it's something she believes. I'm looking to find how I'm toxic, and wanna try and have discussion about ways I'm toxic to try and change that. Anybody willing to would be a big help.",06Dec2020,1
907,"I met and moved in with her (student housing) back in August and the whole time I've known her she has been saying that she was going to kill herself by the end of the year. Last week she came into the kitchen crying, she'd been binge eating (a sign she told me previously meant she was spiraling), she told me she was one insult away from killing herself and that she was surprised she hadn't done it that week. I didn't know what to say in the moment and she left saying she was going to her parent's house.

She stopped responding to messages and blocked everyone else in the house from messaging her so I went to her parents house make sure she didnt disappear and off herself, she wasnt there so I told her parents what was going on and if they could get ahold of her. She answered her phone and was pissed that I told them what was going on.

She hasn't spoken more than maybe a dozen words since then. I'm not sure if I should apologize but in all honesty I thought I was in the right. She gets upset when I'm anywhere outside of my room now and becomes immediately hostile if I try to talk to her.

I just want her to know that somebody cares whether she is alive or not but idk how to get that through to her without her immediately lashing out at me.",06Dec2020,1
908,"So I will preface this by saying I am currently 17 and will turn 18 in a few months. For my past birthday my dad built me a computer. It was made clear that this would be MY computer even though my little brothers use it for games (and I think my dad is going to fix up a computer for them for one of the birthdays). 
Anyway, when I suggested to my mom that I would like to move my computer to my room once I turned 18 she was rather against it. I argued that being an adult should grant a bit more freedom and many of my classmates have already had computers in their rooms for years. She dismissed those arguments. 
How can I sway her to my side? Or am I in the wrong? I appreciate any thoughts and suggestions, thank you.

Oh, I should probably mentioned that I am what you would call ‚Äòstraight-laced‚Äô I am not a probation child in the slightest, and my mom agrees with this. Almost straights As in honors and AP classes, no drugs, no alcohol, heck no relationships.",06Dec2020,1
909,"Ok, yes that sounds dumb, but how do you ask people to go out. Like as in go out for pizza, or to a park? Or how do you invite people over to your house?

910,"My 62 year old cancer survivor mom who lives in Florida wants to visit me in Ohio. She wants to drive up next week and I am scared out of my mind she will. I last saw her when she screamed at me to allow her to visit in September and has told me multiple times she cannot wait until she gets the vaccine likely in Feb. She lives with my dad and brother so it's not like she is alone.
We started yelling at each other because she is insisting she will be alright and I'm scared she will get it up here. Does anyone know of any things to say that might get through to her? She watches the news 24/7 and is super paranoid that she will get it to the point she made me promise her I will wear safety glasses outside because she thinks we can get it through our eyes. I am on a hybrid going into work and working from home and that wasn't a good enough excuse for her not to come up. She is not taking no for an answer and I am so scared she will drive up. It is stressing me out so much I'm literally thinking of faking being sick. It will probably come to that. Even screaming at her over the phone isnt working.
 Thank you for any advice.",06Dec2020,1
911,"I‚Äôm 19, turning 20 soon and developmentally I feel on par with a 15 year old. I didn‚Äôt graduate, I‚Äôve failed my driving test twice, and my social anxiety is so crippling I haven‚Äôt even tried to look into school beyond looking at the website. It‚Äôs so bad I can barely order my own food. I recently met my boyfriends friends and we had to leave early because I was practically paralyzed from being so uncomfortable around a type of group I‚Äôm not usually around. Today my boyfriend told me he‚Äôs worried and that I haven‚Äôt evolved as a person at all and implied that he‚Äôll leave me if I don‚Äôt start changing. I don‚Äôt want to lose him, when I‚Äôm with him is the only time I don‚Äôt just feel blah. But I‚Äôm scared and unmotivated and I‚Äôm not even sure how to begin. I need to renew my permit, get a real instructor, and look into school but where to I begin for improving myself? I just feel worthless and it‚Äôs hard to convince myself putting in effort is worth it sometimes. How do I gain confidence? I‚Äôve always had therapy on my mind but that costs way too much",06Dec2020,1
912,"  

I‚Äôm happy with life and I really mean that. Compared to how I was doing before, I‚Äôm really happy about all the progress I‚Äôve made, physically, socially and mentally but something is bothering me and I‚Äôm not entirely sure what it is.

I‚Äôve changed from how I was when I was younger. If I visited my younger self as I am now at 19, he would be elated but me now is just not content with life. Yeah I‚Äôve made a lot of progress over years and I understand I need to be patient and I have no problem with that at all but since I met this girl, I feel‚Ä¶.disconnected. I met her at UNI this year and we‚Äôre both freshers, she‚Äôs 20 and I‚Äôm 19. We‚Äôre both broke for the time being and we‚Äôre both attractive people. I told her I liked her and she told me she likes me. We‚Äôre taking it slow and spending more and more time together and I told her I cant do much better at the moment and I fear that she will find someone who has way more than me (im insecure about that and i told her) but I‚Äôm on my grind and she told me that‚Äôs ok, she understands. She seems to really like me and I really like her, I don‚Äôt force people to be in my life and if she leaves‚Ä¶yeah it would suck‚Ä¶. A lot but I will stay on my grind. Anyways I think what im trying to say is I think she would be a great asset in my life, I like her and I would like to actually pursue something serious with her but I‚Äôm afraid that she will grow impatient and leave. I told her that and she reassured me that she doesn‚Äôt want to leave and that I‚Äôm an amazing person, which I am, but my trust is shaky and I just cant help to wonder when she will go. Yeah as I said it would suck but at the end of the day‚Ä¶life goes on. In cases like this I would start to distant myself from the person in an effort to protect myself but that only pushes them away and I cant keep doing that. I do like her and I can‚Äôt keep messing around forever, I don‚Äôt want to lose her but I am prepared too, it would hurt and that‚Äôs ok my life doesn‚Äôt revolve around her but she would be great in my life‚Ä¶.but I am not content and I am happy an willing to be patient in order to progress and I fear she will lose patience and leave and I like her a lot, even if she leaves‚Ä¶ I know my life will continue to get better even though it would suck‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

I could go on like that for hours but any advice would be great on how I could stop and just connect back to me. P.S. I do have stuff going on in my life and I‚Äôm working on building myself. I didn‚Äôt pursue her but one of our friends linked us and we just went from there",06Dec2020,1
913,"Hello, I'm a female [18y/o] and I want your advice because I don't know any better. 

Today, I was overthinking. Whether I hurt the boy or not? And, Should I reached ou to him or be unbothered? 

Here is the backstory. I matched with a guy on F
friday and we met up on tuesday. 
It went pretty well.


On the way home, I sent a message that I arrived at the station¬†and asked if he wanted to keep chatting with me, and if he doesn't. Good luck for him. 

(Not in harsh way,¬†I know it sounds brutal but I added a nice ring to it üòÖ. 

According to people It's not a good sign. I just wanted to be straight forward, in other words, don't waste anybody's time. 

Well, there's room for improvement. Am I right?) 

And I also asked if he could send the name of the song that he recommended a few minutes ago. 

He replied, eventually, and wrote 

""Good, You find the train station! I liked to talk with you but we are in different life stages. üòîüòî

Good luck for you! ü§ü

Here's the name of the song ______"" 

The problem is my dumb *ss didn't reply back with a ""thank you! "".

Because of two dumb reasons:

1.I wanted to reply tomorrow; 2.And I didn't want to bother him, especially at night.



I'll never do the same mistake, again. Noted. 

And the rest is predictable. You guess it! It was tooo late and tomorrow I got unmatched. Damn it! But thinking back, it was fair. Moving on... 

I recently made another Tinder account with another name, same age, a quote in my bio and a meme as my profile picture.

I know he swiped right and I wanted to match with him to apologize, so... I came here to get some advice and maybe a ear-pull. 

I know it sounds creepy and maybe I should let it go. I just want to apologize. Is it wrong? 

Sometimes, I wonder myself and how melodramatic I am. 
As I'm writing this post, I'm laughing my *ss off. It did ease my ""pain"", I guess It was therapeutic.

Have a nice day, you all üåü",06Dec2020,1
