0,"So I’m in my junior year so grades are REALLY important right now and I really need to pass. I’ve always had issues focusing (either not being able to focus on anything or completely focusing on the wrong thing and not being able to pull myself away from whatever I’m focusing on) in school especially. But at home it’s so much harder, I’m not only being bounced back and forth across state lines between my parents but I also have pet responsibilities, parents who have nothing better to do than bug me (I obviously love them but it’s really frustrating) because one lost his job and my mother is a stay at home Mom (my step parents are both still working), I have 4 siblings who either don’t do their work or finish really easily so they want to hang out, and there’s SO MANY NOISES AND DISTRACTIONS for me! I don’t know what to do at this point because I’m ending up having to stay up until the early morning when it’s quiet to do work when I start at roughly 9 am. Does anyone have any ideas I can use to focus better?",06May2020,1
1,"I will try to keep everything as non-biased as possible as I'd really appreciate seeing what people think about this. Will also avoid saying too much for obvious reasons.

My company (I'm in Canada) has been working from home for nearly two months now. Two weeks ago I told them I was moving out of the province but wanted to keep working with them since remote work was proving to be possible. They said sure, but it will likely be contract. I was okay with that. I never gave written notice that I was quitting as I was told we'd have a conversation about the contract details early next week and I assumed it would happen then. I figured that I'd keep working remote as full-time from my new location until I heard otherwise and would then give my notice.

They kept pushing the meeting saying they needed to figure out how the contract was going to work (they told me this 2-3 times). It's a small company so I don't totally doubt them. I'm supposed to move this weekend, I asked if it's safe to assume I will remain full-time but they said no you will be done your full-time contract on Friday. They never once asked for a written statement and I feel like they've been ghosting me for a week and a half now (just poor communication all around). 

This is my first ""real"" job so maybe I didn't approach quitting perfectly. I acknowledge the confusion stems from lack of communication from both parties, but do you think it's okay to insist on another two weeks of pay? Given I never gave proper notice that I was quitting?",06May2020,1
2,"Hi, I'm just a high schooler (Junior) right now so I know I have time to decide what I want to do/major. But the corona got me thinking about the future. 

I want to go into a creative career such as the film and entertainment industry. But I also want to have a steady income (health field? maybe nursing). Should I choose to double major? Or should I be like Ken Jeong and only focus on getting a medical degree and then pursue entertainment. I heard a lot of people in the entertainment industry don't have a degree in it.",06May2020,2
3,"I (24) am living at home with my parents and siblings for the time being, and obviously due to the pandemic will likely not be able to move out for at least a couple more months. 

At the beginning, my parents were practicing social distancing and following the stay at home orders, but recently things took a turn and they started getting fed up, saying that this whole pandemic is “just like the flu,” the media is blowing it out of proportion, quarantining is completely unnecessary, etc. I however, am the only person in my house who is still taking this whole thing seriously. 

They’ve been inviting a couple friends of theirs over our house to hang out every now and then – and not sitting 6 ft apart outside, just casually sitting in our kitchen. Unfortunately there’s likely no changing their mind on the subject (based on previous conversations I’ve had with them about the pandemic), but I think they’re being incredibly selfish and irresponsible by continuing to invite people over and put the rest of us at risk. How do I approach them and express that I’m uncomfortable/concerned without attacking them or coming off as accusatory?",06May2020,2
4,Basically this person came to our business with a group and was upset we were limiting the amount of people inside (since the virus and all that). They became upset and left us a negative review with a completely made up story about how awful and rude we were. Normally I wouldn’t care too much since this happens occasionally but they’re how left two more reviews from fake accounts. I’m afraid they’re going to keep doing this but I know there probably isn’t much I can do to prevent it. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with something like this?,06May2020,1
5,"I know the title might seem a bit odd, but my driving test is coming up soon and I'm struggling.

I'm 23 and due to being a passenger in multiple car accidents, I've always been too scared to get my license. This year I decided to buckle down, be an adult, and tackle my fear of driving by getting some lessons before taking the driving exam.

My issue comes from the fact that I'm a great driver when I'm with my family and friends - no fear or worries on the road at all. However, once I'm in the car with a complete stranger, I panic and start to mess up on the simplest things. It isn't helped that I was, well... raped by my male best friend while he was driving me around so being in a vehicle, alone, with a man makes me have a panic attack.

My anxiety has made it to where I've failed two driving exams because I was too scared and forgot to do simple things; it doesn't help that our instructors and examiners where I live aren't very nice and reassuring. (I'm from BC, Canada) I'm not allowed to ask for female examiners because it's seen as trying to ""cheat the system by asking for a preferred person"", but I'm worried that I'll never pass otherwise.

Do any of you have advice on this? My next driving test is coming up soon and I can't afford to fail it. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",06May2020,1
6,"I recently started dating this girl named Amari. She's absolutely gorgeous and we vibe really well together.

But I've noticed something that really worries me and is slowly making me lose interest.

She has crazy moodswings. She never gets angry at me, but she'll be so happy one moment and then start crying the next. She's on her period rn, but she's been like that in general.

Yesterday and today were especially weird. We were hanging out yesterday and got food. We were heading to her house and I expected to spend the rest of the day with her because that's what we had planned. Then all of a sudden she gets all quiet and tells me to drop her off at home. And then she started crying.

I decided to just drop her off and let her rest, I felt a little hurt because I missed her and I wanted to be with her that day, yet she just wanted to be left alone.

Last night I was video chatting with her and I then went to sleep. When I woke-up I saw that she called me around 4:00 in the morning. She never stays up that late. And for most of today, we haven't been messaging that much because she's just been laying in bed crying.

Her brother committed suicide 5 months ago and her mom is pretty distant. She's kinda poor and I feel so bad for her. 

I used to be depressed, but I finally got over it and gained confidence. And now that she's all depressed, I just can't deal with that negativity because it used to haunt me.

What do I need to do? I try to comfort her, but she dismisses everything I say. I want her to be happy and her pushing me away sometimes is making me lose interest in her.",06May2020,1
7,"My moms friend just came over to give my family hair cuts and did my moms hair (we were careful and wore masks/gloves). My mom is naturally a dark brown, but has been dyeing it blonde since she married my stepdad. I just found out that it’s because he insists her hair be blonde and she doesn’t actually want it blonde. It turned out a little darker than it should have and now my stepdad is actually pissed off because her hair isn’t blonde. I told my mom that that is really weird and she shouldn’t have to keep it a certain color for him, it shouldn’t matter what color her hair is. She agreed but says he wants it blonde so that’s what she keeps it. Is this weird or am I just looking too much into it? Should I say something to him?",06May2020,3

9,"I told my crush that I liked him this past weekend and he likes me back! However, since then I have felt a pit in my stomach. I’ve never been in a long term relationship and am overthinking everything (ie. is it a good idea to get into a relationship with him?) and i’ve lost my appetite.

11,"I’m genuinely confused if it’s okay to be petty. I haven’t seen my best friend in about a month or two and she invited me to just go to this local store with her just for a day. I told her I wasn’t home so I couldn’t go and the other day my parents invited her to come and get some food. she ended up not coming because her family was cautious about not being out too much, which I understood. But my dad got petty because no one showed up even though I told him no one was gonna come to get food simply because they’re following the stay at home order. As far as I know she isn’t sick and her family is quite healthy. Today she asked if I wanted to go with her to the local store again. When I asked my dad, he got mad and said no because she didn’t come last time we invited her and that I’m just a dog on a leash like I follow what people say. Is this okay? Because I’m someone who doesn’t like to be petty unless if it’s something horrible. She’s gonna come for my birthday since I’m not doing anything in a few days and of course I’m going to be cautious. But I just don’t think this is her fault and my dad shouldn’t be angry, right ?",06May2020,2

14,So I hadn't done it in a while (that I know of anyway) but apparently last night in my sleep I went and looked for food and a pan to do some cooking but ended up going to the bathroom then back to bed. This wouldn't be a big deal but now I'm kinda worried it'll happen again and a lot of the time I sleep in just my underwear but I live with my boyfriend and his mom and it would be extremely embarrassing if I walked around the house in my panties or worse.

15,"I’m using this to give advice and not seek it. I’ve always been the kind of person to sleep at 2AM and wake up at like 8AM cause i always wanted to be awake and not wasting time sleeping as life and time is precious and i don’t want to spend it asleep.

But ever since the lockdown i’ve been on a 12-12 sleeping schedule meaning i go to bed at 12PM and wake up at 12AM and because i’ve been spending more time sleeping the days are just whizzing by. time has been passing so fast it’s almost scaring me a little. but it’s helped me get through the quarantine a lot. One morning i ended up waking up at 8AM and i was shocked to see how much of a difference those 4 hours made.

TL:DR if you’re wanting to pass the time as fast as possible, sleep longer then usual, the effect will surprise you",06May2020,2

17,"So me (26F), my partner (35M), and his mother (65F)(we're not married yet, but I'll refer to her as MIL) have been living in the same house for 5 years. 

It started out as little things when I first moved in, I can't have any possessions of mine outside the bedroom beyond my toothbrush and kitchen utensils. I can't read books with out MIL exploding that it's a waste of time if it's not the bible. I can't eat fruit, though I'm not clear why, but it starts a rage fit for MIL if I do. 
I knew MIL was emotionally and psychologically abusive to my partner, her doing it to her husband too is why he left her. She is incredibly controlling of all men in her life and doesn't like them having females in their lives. This includes hating her brother's partner, having her other son's baby girl taken away from him by creating false allegations of domestic violence and convincing his GF he would hurt her and the little girl (he's never hit a woman in his life, let alone his mother), and as a result, 6 years later he's still fighting for access to see his daughter. So knowing all this now, MIL's hatred of me was inevitable from the start, but I wish I'd known that back then. 

In the meantime things have escalated dramatically, it started out with small things, like cutting up my clothes or hiding them, and putting bleach in my mugs in hopes I wouldn't notice. Then it went on to me not being allowed to make a sound in the house, not using the landline to speak to my grandparents, not being allowed to use the rest of the house outside the bedroom except for when I make me and my partner dinner, resulting in me getting down to eating one meal a day when he's working, because it's just not worth being screamed at over something as simple as getting a drink. But now it's an endless tirade of verbal abuse. There's no escape, 

I'm a survivor of childhood abuse, which unfortunately for her and luckily for me, has not left me an easy target. I won't take it without a fight, I will stand up for myself, I won't believe her lies, and all attempts at psychological abuse are futile, but that doesn't make it not stressful or exhausting. I will argue back when she starts. She hates that unlike every other target, I haven't abandoned my partner (as she's requested numerous times) or laid down to her whims, and will defend myself. Everything has escalated much more since lockdown began. I accept that there is likely something wrong with her, normal people aren't compulsive liars and don't start screaming and crying out of the blue for no reason, or wander around the house talking to themselves. 

I don't know if it's because I'm autistic, but I'm not one for lying, and frankly I find lying confusing and don't really understand the point of it. Having come from abuse, I make sure to always keep records, so I have multiple secret recordings of her tirades, as evidence in case she does eventually physically assault me. I've sent friends copies of the recordings too, just in case. 

I've been to my doctor, I've been to social services, I've been to the housing department where I've been waiting for housing for 2 years (I'm disabled and need somewhere accessible), I've spoken to charities like Women's Aid, and because it's not spousal abuse, there's nothing anybody can do until it escalates to needing emergency services involvement, i.e. I get physically assaulted and the police are involved.

I've no idea what to do because I can't keep living like this, but there isn't anywhere for us to go. The constantly living on pins waiting for her to start screaming again is impacting on my health. While she's focused on me though, she's not focused on trying to destroy him. He's improved so much mental health wise since I believe strongly in communication, so he began talking and reaching out, and as a result is more confident and less depressed. She hates this, and to quote her ""He was better when he was suicidal!""

I don't particularly want to wait around until it escalates to needing me to call 999 because she's stabbed me or something, but seemingly there's no resources for non-spousal or familial abuse where the victims are over 18.

I can't afford, and in a lot of cases don't qualify for a mortgage because my only income is PIP and his income isn't enough to cover a mortgage alone, and private renters suddenly no longer have a place available when it comes down to needing to put in an accessible shower, which a lot of charities will help with, but landlords don't want in their house. I know there are things like part buy part rent, but again, I don't qualify for things like mortgages. I just feel completely trapped. Atm for the area I'm in (Highlands), even registering as homeless isn't much of an option because there's a waiting list for homeless properties, and due to PTSD I can't handle living in flats because of the sounds of neighbours above or below. I don't know what to do, but I'm exhausted from the stress and don't know what to do now or where to go from here, and I've no interest in getting physically assaulted if I can avoid it. 

Is there any advice on either how to escape or how to cope with this constantly? Because I can't think of anywhere else to reach out too. 

Thanks for listening anyway, even if you don't have any advice. Thanks for trying to help x",06May2020,1
18,"Please pardon any formatting issues, I'm on mobile. 


My Mom has been talking to a man for 7 months and she swears he's the one meant for her. To me, it sounds like the biggest scam in the world. This man was deployed to Syria to work for a private military company that he is contracted with. He tells her all the horrible things going on over there, and she worries about him. I certainly don't blame her for it, but it's really tormenting her. 


The only evidence she has of him is **one** picture. Their interactions are maybe texting for a hour each night, and three phone calls over the course of their *whole* relationship. She says that he has a bad speech impediment like he speaks English as a second language. Alone, that's not cause for suspicion of course but in context it may be useful information.


She has texted who was supposed to be his mother and has spoken to his sister on the phone. He was supposed to come home a few times now, but there's always something preventing him. Usually it's another job to do, but this time it's money. He says that in order to be released from his contract for this company, he needs twenty seven thousand dollars. His family has been able to gather the twenty, but they're seven short.


My Mom has been divorced for nine years now, and she's decided it's time to move on. Rightfully so! She deserves happiness more than anyone I know, especially now that my sister and I have left the nest. There's some empty nest syndrome happening here and she's lonely. Plus there's the whole second chance at romance thing too. She's often said that she feels it's too late for her, especially when a few of her dates with other men went sour. She is a wonderful woman who deserves happiness, but I might be a little biased.


The real problem is that to me, the man seems too good to be true. This is also only what she's letting me in on, I'm sure there's more. He claims to be quite wealthy with several rental properties, sports cars, a ranch in Texas and land in Australia as well. He supposedly shares most of her interests, and says all the right stuff. He says that he left Texas a while ago to come to Tennessee and start a new life, leaving his two teenage kids and ex wife behind. He's looking for his second chance too.


So, prince charming needs seven grand to leave Syria and be with Mom. He swears he has the money to pay her back, he just can't get to it. Last night, my Mom came to me crying begging me for the money. I certainly don't have that much laying around. But, if we were to pull together we might have enough to bring him home, per his story.


I'm convinced 100% that this is a Nigerian prince-type scenario and he doesn't exist. To me, it's all a facade; a long winded scheme. She asked for me to cash in the savings bonds that a late, dearly loved relative left behind. I was saving them as a last resort to get myself out of some trouble if it should arise, especially since they're still accruing interest. I refused. She sobbed. She said that if I cash mine and my sister does the same, she would have enough to send them. As far as I know, she hasn't spoken to my sister about it yet. If we both turn her down, she's wanting to pawn off a family heirloom in order to gather the funds. The idea of it still turns my stomach! She's not in the right headspace and not thinking clearly.

I'm so worried about her. I know in my gut that he's going to take that money and vanish, or worse just want more. I want her to be happy. I really really do. It's just not going to be coming from Syria. Though, I can't help but wonder if I'm just being ultra paranoid. She's my Mom and I'm going to be protective of her. Do I just give her the money and let whatever happens just happen? I do not want to see her get hurt! What do I do? 


If I don't give her the money, she's going to hit the pawn shop. We need to stop her. How?


I apologise if I may have left off some details, please feel free to ask for clarification on anything. I'll admit that I'm not in the best headspace myself.",06May2020,1
19,"I’m 15, from the UK and I live with my mum, dad and my brother. The past few years my mother has slowly turned crazy. She hasn’t tried to murder anyone or anything like that, she just clearly isn’t right in the head. For example, she told my dad it’s disrespectful to have a globe in front of the window due to the current epidemic going on. This caused a massive argument as my mother was worried people were going to look at the house in disgust. Sounds stupid, I know. A few days ago I woke up to my mother shouting and screaming at my dad (who was working from home on the computer and was on facetime to his colleagues). She believed my dad was streaming porn, or something along those lines. He wasn’t, he proved he wasn’t yet my mother still believes he was. Very recently I walked out of my room to see my dad shoving my mother over, as she was crying. I’m still not too sure why this happened, but I heard my dad calling my mum a “physco”, a “bitch”, etc. This was the first time I recall the fights getting physical. I’m not sure if my dad has cheated on my mother before, but i’ve heard brief words of things like “I gave you a second chance” and her calling him a cheater (could just be her overreacting). I’m worried incase they decide to get a divorce and i’m forced to pick one of them over the other. My mother doesn’t work, so if my dad left she’d be screwed.

I picked it up and giggled while asking him what are you taking these pills for? He says without any expression that it’s for his anxiety. His doctor prescribed it for anxiety.

She can rot in hell for all I care and I don't often wish ill on people. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is over the past week she has been constantly bombarding me with texts and emails and snapchats asking just to talk. Apologizing. Saying she just wants to apologize and she messed up. She tried contacting me about 6 months ago too with similar messages but I never replied to any of them. She has now contacted my other email too. (Obviously she has some issues). Though it's been a year I still haven't been able to feel alright about things in general because of her. I never got closure. She mocked me and betrayed me and cut all contact with me. I want closure. The tables have turned it seems and now she is the one who is emotionally distraught. I am doing ok myself now but still I feel the need for closure. She did some really fucked up things to me and I think that because of type of person I am maybe confronting her (via text/phone of course not in person) may help me. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I confront her I intend to tell her calmly how she messed up and make clear I will not give her another chance but I also want to express how she hurt me. I just want closure. I just want to truly put an end to this. After the confrontation I intend to block her on everything. I just want the ending of our communication to be on my terms. I want to prove to myself she has no power over me anymore and I can confront this monster and walk away unscathed. I feel I need to do that to feel better. I feel like I've ran from it and tried to ignore and forget for too long.

23,"Hi y'all, I posted this on a couple other pages but got no responses (also this is my first post on reddit other than the other post so apologies if this isnt allowed/ i get something wrong)

(tw suicide mention)

Ok so basically, recently my best friend of 4 years has been acting distant.

Context: last July I (19F) left the country to go to university while he (19M) stayed here for uni. I knew going to an entirely new country half way across the world 8 timezones away would put some strain on our friendship, but honestly never noticed while I was away. We would text and call just as much as we did before I left (which wasn't ALL the time but he just was never on his phone all the time like I was, so i get it). He never showed signs in losing interest in our friendship despite me being so far away, and I thought everything was fine. Last November, I wound up hospitalised and on a 72 psych hold for suicidal thoughts, and he was amazingly supportive throughout all of it, constantly checking in on me to see how I was doing, sending me videos and memes and all that jazz; things a best friend 8 timezones away would do when you're in a bad spot. After that, I decided to withdraw from uni, return home, and focus on my self as it was evident I wasn't capable of being away from all my friends and family yet.

I returned home at winter break, and thats when I started to notice things change. At first everything was fine, we were excited to see each other along with all our other friends from our friend group. However, I noticed that if we weren't hanging out one-on-one he'd give more attention to the other guys in our group. I get it, boys will be boys, but it kinda sucked because they all already live in the same country, same timezone, and had seen each other frequently over the previous months as they were close enough they could see each other on weekends. I'd been gone for 6 months, but again, fair enough, I understand. It wasn't until one night I was alone with him and one of the other guys from the friend group that I truly felt shitty about the situation.

I briefly left the room to grab a drink, and omw back i heard my best friend say to the other guy (who is also a close friend of mine but) ""I know I will be best friends with you, \[person he has been best friends with for 5 years, understandable\], and \[person he met at uni\] for the rest of our fucking lives."" I waited a few mins to return to the room because I didn't want them to know I heard and cause any drama, and also I was pretty upset. Later that night I ordered us all food and they said they would pay me back but never did which is like whatever, they're my best friends I can cover food this time, but when the food came and we were eating, neither of them thanked me or even payed any attention to me. Eventually around 2 am I told them I was gonna go home because I felt like shit and they just said bye let me go home (a 19 y/o girl in the city alone at night) and when as soon as I left I pretty much broke down sobbing. Even my Uber driver was like what the fuck do you need to go to the police or hospital or something and I was like nah just take me home. When I did get home i realised I didn't have keys and despite calling my parents/banging on the door they didn't hear me so I just sat on my doorstep sobbing until an hour later my mother let me in (it sucked but was also therapeutic).

I put all this aside for the most part so i could just enjoy to the rest of my break with my friends before they all returned to uni, but any time I wanted to hang out with them I had to be the one to initiate, and this trend pretty much kept up until we went into the lockdown. I felt like almost every time we hung out I had to be the one to ask and insist on getting a response instead of a ""maybe"". Since quarantine, me and my girl friends have tried to get our friend group to do group calls to drink/play games/ catch up/ whatever, and at first it worked but we slowly stopped getting responses from the guys in the group.

Finally, a week ago me and my best friend had a small dispute over something stupid that ended in me saying he has a superiority complex for refusing to watch the tiktoks i send him because the app is popular (which as far as i can tell is his only reasoning). I was hurt because he refused to watch the things i saw that made me think of him. I acknowledge what I said was hurtful, and fully intend on apologising. However since then, he's left me on delivered, and all the other guys in the friend group have been essentially ghosting me and the other girls in the group. they used to frequently talk in the groupchat, but now its just me and the girls and occasionally one guy (mentioned earlier at best friend's house). they all used to see all my instagram stories and like my posts and interract with me and now its radio silence. 

One friend insists its because of end of semester exams, but the rest of them have only begun their spring term. I understand being stressed with moving to online working, but again I can see these people active on social media, reading the groupchat, and still not talking to me or associating with me in any way at all.

These have been my closest friends who have gotten me through so much and are now ghosting me. I understand people grow apart but I have been trying my best to maintain these friendships. I'm already struggling with my mental health and being trapped at home due to the lockdown, but now losing most of my closest friends has me worried I'll do something drastic, and I don't want to go on a psych hold either as I know hospitals are already so stressed and understaffed.

I don't know what to do. I'm losing my support system and losing my mind. how can i either move past this friendship or try and salvage it?.

(not gonna reread and fix typos or format bc im already crying enough rn lol)

TLDR: my friends arent putting effort into our friendships and i feel alone",06May2020,1
24,"Disclaimer: I'm fully aware that we're in the middle of a global pandemic and that I'm probably being a customer service nightmare for worrying about this, but I'm panicking and don't know where else to turn.

My laptop finally died on me after 5 years of everyday use. I need a laptop for work (I'm a journalist) so I treated myself to a new laptop. The model is decent enough for journalism and cost me £299, but it cleared out all my savings.

My savings were so low because I had just paid rent and my bills this month. My logic was new laptop = I can do work = I can afford to pay rent next month.

Now I have no idea what they did to the poor laptop while it was in transit but it never stood a chance. It's stuck in an eternal boot loop and just selecting an OS causes the poor thing to overheat and die. It's now just an expensive paperweight.

The problem is that the store I bought it from currently isn't accepting returns until the UK exits lockdown and the main stores of the chain open again. They refuse to budge on this - even though I've plead my case, sent evidence of the fault, offered to send it back through a courier service, and told them that I literally need a laptop to work and pay my bills, they're saying that there's nothing they can do.

I told my boss my problem and he said that if I can't fix it, I'm fired. I know I was stupid for spending all my savings on the thing, but my logic was sort of there (laptop = work = money = bills paid)?

I don't know whether I'm looking for actual advice or for someone to just sympathise with me, but anything is appreciated. Thanks for reading.",06May2020,2

27,"Okay guys I'll try to be as detailed as possible, I really need advice and I don't know what to do...

I met my now ex-boyfriend (Lets call him Bart)  almost 6 years ago while I was studying abroad in the US. We met in the elevator of our apartment complex and it was love at first sight, the moment we saw each other that was it, it was game over. We spoke a couple of days after seeing each other and we basically started dating that same day. I was 21 and he was 18 and we had a passionate relationship to say the least, we were both very toxic and fed of each other's toxicity. Despite that we had a connection unlike any other, we could spend ours just looking at each other in awe, we felt comfortable with each other, we were best friends. He comes from a super toxic household full of drugs and manipulation and I saw that from the beginning, I saw how his father would manipulate him financially and emotionally. My mistake was trying to get in between that I guess, his father didn't like the fact that I would question the way he treated Bart so he quickly tried to break us up but Bart wouldn't budge.( I forgot to mention, I was studying as an international student in the US and its super expensive, I was pretty well off but my sophomore year, my father went bankrupt so he told me I had to go back home. Bart said that he would't let that happen, he offered to pay for my tuition and all my expenses so we could stay together , so I did, we talked about getting married and that would make our lives easier) Back to Bart's dad, He caused a lot of problems in our relationship until he finally made us break up almost a year later. He is a very rich man so he threatened Bart to cut him off and fire him from the company he owns(Bart is super smart and he hopes to own his fathers company in a near future) I pleaded to Bart, I told him we could go elsewhere and start over, we didn't need money. 
I was young and idealistic, I thought love was enough. Looking back I understand that is a lot of pressure for a 19 year old. We broke up and I was heartbroken I decided to stay in the US and overstayed my Visa, hoping that if I worked illegally I could pay for tuition, my parents pleaded me to go back but I was stubborn and I thought if I left I would never see Bart again. A little over a year went by(Bart moved back to his hometown) But he  would still text me from time to time, telling me that he missed and he was sorry, I become resentful towards him, I hated him for breaking my heart. Sadly my father past away while I was in the US while living in the US and guilt just consumed me because I wasn't there, I spoke go Bart, but yet he did nothing to see me. I decided to go back to my country knowing quite well that they would ban me for several years from entering the US. I arrived home and I was destroyed, looking back I can say that those were the darkest days of my life.Bart pleaded me to get back with him, he said that we would figure out to get back together, the months after that were a complete nightmare, filled with drug abuse and suicide attempts, I felt so lonely and I missed my dad so much, I was manic. I don't get along with my family and part of me resented them for asking me to come. During this time Bart would appear and disappear, finally I decided to buy a plane ticket to South America I needed a break or was gonna kill myself, when I left for South America Bart ghosted me out of the blue, but I was in Argentina living life.I spent the next 3 years and half backpacking through South America and Europe.I was running away from the pain and although I look back fondly at my trip I was manic and angry, I made a of mistakes along the way and I became very self destructive, Bart would text me and call me every other month and then he would disappear. He would always let me know that he missed me and he made a mistake, during my travels I had my fleeting romances and they were beautiful. My romances were furtive and mostly physical but never did I stop thinking about Bart. He finally bought a ticket go visit me but he never showed up, again I was heartbroken but I decided I've had enough. I met the perfect guy, he was a dream, I wasn't ready for a relationship, I still carried all the weight of my anger over my father's death and that made me angry and bitter but poor guy was fixer and he thought he could fix me, we went to Europe together and finally we broke up. As soon as I broke up with him I went back looking for Bart( he doesn't have social media, so he's not the easiest person to reach) I stayed in Europe until I started running out of money and my declining mental healthy became more evident, finally with 5 dollars to my name I came back home, the prodigal daughter was back home. 

I came home and finally it hit me.I realized all these years I'd left mental issues and my fathers death dictate my life, I hated the person I became. Fast forward a year and I've gotten help(I'm stil a work in progress) but everyday I try to become a better person, I have a stable job, I eat my vegetables and I work out. I got a message from Bart around two months ago after not hearing from him for over 6 months, I got my message late so I replied a couple of days later but I never got an answer. He video called me around a month ago(we hadn't seen each other since we broke up at least not live) What I saw broke my heart, he was skinny and looked like a crackhead, he told me he was fresh out of rehab for heroine and crack head. We spoke for around 10 hours about everything that had happened in the last what? almost 5 years. We both apologized for what we did in the past , we confessed that after all this years we couldn't get over each other. 
He told me that he tried to date but couldn't. I talked about my crazy travels and failed romances, we also cried and I finally got to ask him all the questions all the questions that badly needed an answer. He cried for so long and told me that he needed me so of course I reciprocated and told him that I was always gonna be there for him. 

Bart is in rehab again he didn't last too long outside and he finally decided that he wants to be clean once and for all, he is finally facing his traumus, crazy family, mental problems, etc. we text regularly and he calls me when he gets the chance. Before he went to rehab again we spoke about the future and what it held for us, he said that we would see each other again, he was no longer 18, so it would be easier. 
After the long story here are my questions for you guys. After all this years my love for him is just as strong as before, I want to think there is a reason why either of us couldn't move on, we've grown up and in the process we've made mistakes and learned from them. I'm want to think I'm no longer that toxic selfish girl, I'm getting help and i'm trying to be a better person and I know so is he, we always said that we would find each othet again, when were better and ready. Given the situation of the world right now non-essential travels are not allowed but hopefully by the end of the year things will be better. I'm working remotely now so as soon as I can I'm going to travel again. 

I want us to see each other after this whole COVID-19 thing is over and we briefly spoke about it. All these years I've been waiting for him to be ready, things have always been on his time, but I'm done with waiting. What should I do? Should I continue just waiting for him, until he is finally ready? Should I just tell him upfront that if he is not willing to meet me halfway after all this is done I want him out of my life once and for all. We haven't seen each other in almost 5 years and we never got the proper closure, so I need to see him to know if what I feel is not just me holding on to memories. Do you i think I shouldn't even pressure since he has enough on his plate with his addiction? Am I being selfish for even thinking about bringing it up? I want to hear y'alls opinion no matter how harsh and honest.
Thank you xx",06May2020,1

34,"I reconnected with my good friend whom I haven’t seen in years a few weeks ago, She is actually the girl I lost my virginity to in high school. We kind of just went our separate ways at one point but apparently still thought of each other frequently over the years. I got out of a years long relationship a few months ago and stumbled onto her FB profile through a mutual friend so I sent her message asking how she’s been over the last several years. This turned into us texting or FaceTiming each other daily and becoming close friends again pretty quickly. We have deep conversations which eventually lead to us questioning why we never tried having a relationship even though we both pretty much loved each other since we were teens. She wants me to come stay a few days with her and so on and so forth. Now here’s the complicated part...she is in the Navy and plans on making a career of it, so she will be traveling the world until she retires. I’m not sure if I should keep pursuing this relationship/hook up or whatever it may become due to this. I know it would be like some fairytale twist to my life if I ended up being with her because she is the girl I literally have dreamt about being with since I was 14. In reality what would happen is I would spend a week with her in Florida then she is going to get on a ship and be gone for months. An amazing high followed by a devastating low. Is it worth it?

36,"So, I applied for a position as an IT Recruiter for a foreign company. The position didn't truly have proper requirements, hence how me - a 18yo English teacher - could apply. The company made me sit through some tests, mostly to test my English, common sense and logic through some random math problems. A couple tests available also included stuff regarding Linux use, and basics of the IT world - what language is for what, which one has the highest pay rate, etc. I am not sure those were mandatory, but I took them. When a recruiter contacted me personally, she did not list those particular tests as part of the mandatory tests I had to take. I was interviewed by the recruiter, passed, and this friday I have a technical interview with a Sourcing manager. I do not know what that means. What is the technical aspect of it?

I've recently moved to a new home and the room I am in is so badly designed that even in the middle of winter with the fan on full blast, it is boiling hot. It's like 10 degrees warmer that the rest of the house. I think this is because the east-facing wall is a giant window. I'm keeping the blind shut but it's unbearable.

43,"Well...I fucked up. 

Before I was sent home from college due to COVID I was really on top of my schoolwork. I sat in the front row of my classes, payed attention and asked questions. I had straight As for the first time in my life while taking a difficult course load. 

Since I’ve been home, I’ve taken on many more responsibilities including taking care of my little sister and helping her with her schoolwork. This is highly time consuming, but my parents are essential workers so this isn’t a choice. I also live in New York so I’m basically stuck inside 24/7. I’m diagnosed with bipolar 2, so I’m not a stranger to depressive episodes, but being isolated has made it 10000x worse. 

Now, we were assigned a programming HW and I was pretty behind on the material. I managed to catch up and was making progress, but later that day I was going for a run and smelled something in the hallway of my apartment building. I alerted the super and they figured out it was coming from my neighbors apartment. The super called the police and they found his body. Apparently he died of COVID several days prior. For the next few days I was really out of it and was having trouble concentrating on anything. I did my best and failed the HW. 

For the next assignment, I asked a friend who took the class last year if they could help me and they sent me their assignment. I kind of changed things up and rewrote certain parts. 

Then last week the professor reached out to see if everything was ok because I hadn’t been going to class. I responded saying thanks for checking in and that everything is fine, I’m just very busy with family responsibilities etc. I didn’t really want to explain anything and he’s a nice guy and I didn’t want him worrying about anything. 

We got back the second HW and the TA left a note: Please talk to the professor this has been flagged for plagiarism. 

I know I’m in the wrong and want to apologize, but I don’t know what to say. I’m genuinely sorry and I didn’t use my judgement at all. I don’t want to give excuses, but at the same time I do want the professor to be aware that I was out of it and that this was a huge mistake. I deserve a 0, but I’m afraid that now I’m going to fail the class or get a mark on my transcript which will ruin my future. 

How can I apologize and should I explain myself? I’m freaking out right now because this was literally the last HW and now I might have to retake the class and I’ve possibly ruined my chances of going to graduate school. I’ve never done anything like this before and need all the advice I can get. 

Thanks for reading this.",06May2020,1

They got into an argument and my sister left because she felt like our mom never listens to her when she expresses her feelings. My sister vented to me about her feelings and said how she has felt this way for some time and connected to me always being the loud one/taking up the attention, which added in her feelings of not being heard. I told my grandma this and she asked “Do you know how much attention you demanded as a child?” I’ve heard this about myself a lot. I was basically the bad child always acting up, possessive of my mom, unruly. I’m not like that anymore. Sporadically, my family will go down memory lane and talk about the stuff I did as a kid and how volatile/attached I was to my mom.However, I do feel ashamed of being that way. And now I feel like one of the consequences of that was my sister feeling like she wasn’t heard/didn’t receive a lot of attention. How do I move on from this feeling?

48,"Parents got a divorce 3 years ago because my mum was cheating (with a family friend that my dad was friends with lol). The settlement still isn’t finalised, a lot of fighting over who should keep what (particularly the family home) which me and my mum now stay in (i’m 22F). 

Dad wasn’t much better, got married to someone else 3 months into knowing her, before the divorce was even legally finalised. 

I’ve accepted all of this and am on good terms with both my parents and their new partners. I’m happy living at home (mostly because no rent and free food lmao), but recently my dad has been making me feel guilty about living in the family home and being in good terms with the man my mum cheated with etc. Since we fought over it, it has been playing on my mind that my mum made a mistake and i’m supporting her mistake by staying with her? (Also, I come from a culture where it is custom to stay with family until marriage lmao) 

It has just reminded me that I won’t be free of my parents drama until I move out?? But:

1. Don’t have the finance to support that right now but I could work towards it?

2. Me moving out would cause a LOT of drama for my mum; a very emotional thing for her i think and very stressful for me having to deal with her emotion.

3. I recently adopted a dog who will grow to be medium-big sized; which means i need to find an apartment with some sort of outside area (more expensive).

50,"My mom always does her best to be supportive of me but she and I have very different beliefs about most matters and its difficult to continue living with her like this. She believes quarantine is bullshit and wants to move to Texas because of it so she can avoid the stricter restrictions (I'm 15 so I can't move out without becoming an emancipated minor and she's the best option otherwise). She thinks it isn't racist to say the n-word (we're white) and she says the r-word often too, whenever I call her out on it she acts like I'm attacking her for not wanting her to say hateful slurs.

51,"So my aunt and her kids started living with me and my mom and sister about 2 years ago. We started living together because my aunt had just got divorced and needed a new place to live. My grandma wanted my aunt to move in with us, but my mom was opposed to it since they don’t really get along. A couple months passed by, and things were good, but when the summer rolled by, my aunt started going crazy. She would go out most nights and ask me to babysit her kids. I helped her the first couple times, but then it just got too much. She would leave everyday, during the day and night. Even the days she had off from work, she would just leave the kids home. Eventually, I stopped watching her kids because my aunt would keep lying about what time she would come home, and I’d end up watching them for hours and hours. I told myself “she’d probably stop going out now right?” WRONG. Now that she can’t ask me or even bribe my sister into watching her kids, she’d just leave them anyway, without telling anyone. Well, that’s not so bad right? No, it’s very bad. My house has 4 bedrooms upstairs and 1 bedroom downstairs. The 1 bedroom, which is my aunt’s bedroom, is very far away from the other rooms, so it’s basically sound proof in there. I can scream in that room and no one would hear me from upstairs. So if soemthing were to happen to the kids, no one would know. A lot of the nights, her kids would wake up crying and wander up the stairs, in the dark, to my mom’s room to sleep with her. My aunt found out about this, and since they don’t really like each other, my aunt would tell them to not go up there anymore. She would tell them to suck it up and stay downstairs, in their room, until she comes back. 

Now that everything is closed, because of quarantine, she can’t really go anywhere, but things are not better. She would invite her boyfriend to come over, and he would stay here for WEEKS! He’s not aloud to sleep upstairs with me and my family because there’s only women and it would be weird for him to sleep up there. Before quarantine, he would sleep in the family room, on top of a twin sized mattress, but for some reason, during quarantine, my aunt kicked the kids out of the room, so that her boyfriend could sleep in their room.... The kids have to sleep in the guest room, by themselves. My aunt would put them to sleep, and then go downstairs to sleep with her boyfriend. Again, the kids would wake up crying because their mom isn’t there, and then she would yell at them, saying “we’re in the same house! Stop crying!” I tried explaining to my aunt that they probably have issues because she keeps leaving them at home alone. 

Since no one is helping my aunt anymore, she feels as if we have taken advantage of her or some BS and threatens to shoot us or tells us to go die on the daily. It’s just terrible living with that. What can I do to make this better?",06May2020,1

56,"Hello Reddit,

She wants that i literally control her life for her and teach her how to have good sex ( Im literally average i would say and i never had sex with her). She wants to meet up and yeah she said that i can do with her what i want lol. She's actually attractive too...but i dont know. Im 18 and she's 16 (In Germany thats okay with consens lmao).

57,"What should I do? I tried being Mr. Decent, but now I'm a bit ticked. 2) seems wrong. 1) seems assertive, but potentially backfire-able. I don't know what to do. Grant me some perspective, 

So today, I received multiples of a product I only ordered one of. This represented nearly $250 of extra product.

I decided it was best if I called to return it, even though I did my research and legally the FTC would allow me to claim them as a gift. I wanted to do the right thing. It's a mid-level corporation, that I was under the understanding did some good things lately.

But on the phone, the person I was talking to seemed kind of annoyed. They asked, ""Can you return it in person at the store?"" to which I responded, ""I have vulnerable family members in my household and I'm not in a place to where I can expose myself to COVID-19, and it's a very long drive to your nearest store"".

After a long sigh and pause, they then asked, ""Can you go to a (Enter courier here) Store?""

To which I responded, ""No, I'm trying to limit my exposure.""

They then finally offered to send me labels in the mail, which I could place on the package and have a shipping company come and pick up. After another 5 minute wait of them randomly typing things in the background (took them about 20 minutes to answer the phone in the first place), they said monotonely - in a way that screamed 'I hate my job', ""They'll be in the mail, thanks for being honest. Bye.""

So now, I'm kind of pissed. I did what I thought was right, but they took a half hour of my time and seemed annoyed I wouldn't expose myself during a pandemic. And while I'm not expecting a reward, I could have gotten a bit more than a tepid thanks. I mean, a coupon would have been nice.

I'm now tempted to either:

1) Call back and say don't send the labels, and keep the extra product.

2) Or just not send them back and say the labels never came.

I was trying to be the nice person, but instead, they seemed profoundly annoyed I wouldn't risk my own safety and they had to spend some extra time on their computer to get some labels printed out.

What should I do? I tried being Mr. Decent, but now I'm a bit ticked. 2) seems wrong. 1) seems assertive, but potentially backfire-able. I don't know what to do. Grant me some perspectrive, r/Advice.",06May2020,1

But she lives with a housemate who’s extremely fragile. She is on supplemental oxygen and has a tracheostomy. I asked upper management if the person (who’s COVID19-free) could stay at another place for the next two days. I was quickly denied.

64,"I've already posted this somewhere else, but I'm really feeling lost in despair and guilt right now so I wanted to post this here to see if anybody had any sort of advice they could give me. I've never hated myself more than I do now.

So my coworker and I had been getting along really well the past ten months, which is as long as the both of us have been working there. We quickly moved from work friends to real friends, and have been hanging out all the time on the weekends (and sometimes even after work).

So on Sunday morning, she calls me and asks me to take a walk with her and make margaritas with her. And for the record, I pretty much never drink. I've never gotten drunk before, I always stop myself after one or two drinks, and she is well aware of this, but she likes showing me new things. I figured hey, there's no harm in that.

So we have a great day, take a walk around a little marina we have in our town, go get lunch, come back to my place and watch a movie. She makes us margaritas, and I definitely underestimated how they would affect me, 'cause after two glasses I was feeling pretty dizzy.

She has the idea that I should film her singing and dancing sexily for her Snapchat audience. I say okay, and I go along with it. So I film her dancing, singing, and swinging her booty around, and say encouraging stuff to her like how great and hot she was and stuff. She reacts positively to it, asks me if she's looking sexy and stuff like that, to which I say yes.

She sits on the floor alongside me (to the point where our shoulders are touching) and we watch back all the stuff we recorded. She likes looking at herself, so we're there for a while lol. After two and a half margaritas, though, and me having pretty much no alcohol tolerance at all, my thinking isn't exactly straight, and I put my arm around her shoulder. She doesn't react, so I feel like I'm fine. I've done so before and hugged her before, so my drunk mind doesn't see anything wrong with it.

Eventually, however, I look at her legs (she's in shorts) and start rubbing them. I have no idea why, I would never do that in any other situation (especially 'cause we work together), but again, my inebriation got the better of me and I keep going.

She doesn't react, we're still laughing and talking and watching the Snaps and watching YouTube and stuff. She never pulls away, she never says stop or shows any discomfort, but after doing it for five minutes or so, I guess a part of me that knows better realizes that I'm being an idiot and I pull away. It was like nothing ever happened.

Feeling kind of gross, I asked her if I was making her feel uncomfortable, and she said no, not at all. I said okay, and I never touched her again after that, but I still felt gross doing that to my friend. We continue the night having fun, singing, dancing, and even she breaches the touch barrier with me and takes my hands while we dance so we can swing our arms together and other drunk stuff like that.

A few hours go by and everything seems okay. I take her home, we leave on good terms, and she even calls me later that night and we talk on the phone for about half an hour about life and stuff. We say our goodnights and everything seems on good terms.

Fast forward to Monday morning, we both go to work and she is avoiding me all day. She gives me a very brief ""hey"" when we walk in and doesn't talk to me or make eye contact with me all day. She leaves without even saying goodbye when the day ends.

A few hours after work I text her and ask her what's wrong, and she tells me she doesn't want to be my friend anymore. I'm flabbergasted, combing through my mind to try and find where I went wrong in the day before. I ask her why, and she says that she feels uncomfortable being my friend because I felt up her legs the day before, which was crossing a huge boundary. She wants me to leave her alone and only talk to her when it's work related.

I tell her that I respect her wishes and that I'll leave her alone, but that I was beyond sorry and hope that one day she can learn to forgive me for my misdeeds. I feel like such a terrible person. Literally the one time I get drunk in my life, with someone who is just starting to trust me deeply, and I immediately turn into a disgusting animal. I'm gonna regret this forever, 'cause I lost out on an amazing friend all for five minutes of me not using my head. I just feel so lost and disgusted with myself. Tuesday was no different than yesterday, except she didn't even make eye contact with me.

If anybody here has any advice or something for me, then I'd definitely welcome it. Work will forever be awkward for us, as well as a constant reminder of what a piece of shit I am. This is exactly why I didn't want to drink in the first place.",06May2020,1

My wife, also a first time mom is overly anxious about introducing him to family at this point (3 weeks), not only due to covid, but she's also dealing with the anxiety of everyone holding him, spreading germs etc, Corona just so happens to make it worse.

66,"Hi there.

I'm a college student but I've been struggling with mental health issues for a pretty long time. I clawed my way out of depression in high school but due to some very toxic environments/friends/pressures, I developed anxiety. Once I started therapy in college, that's when I got a diagnosis for anxiety and started doing my best to build a support network. What's worked best for my anxiety has been mainly distractions like hanging out with friends, socializing, etc. Due to the current situation, I was forced to move home which has severely impacted my mental health. Home is a generally unhealthy environment for me as my dad is the main source of many of my mental health issues and my mom was also toxic for a while (it got better, but after many draining, screaming arguments). Obviously, I can't use my previous support system due to the pandemic. However, my anxiety has gone off the charts lately. I'm extremely paranoid (I recognize that my paranoia is irrational but it feels extremely real) that somehow something will go wrong and life will screw me over, I'm so anxious sometimes I can barely move, and I'm on the verge of tears nearly 24/7. I've been continuing teletherapy, but it's not the same when I can't implement the majority of the strategies I've been using as coping mechanisms.

71,"Since before I was born, my mother has always been really religious. It’s never been a real problem with me until recently. She’s a pious Christian, and studies the Bible for more than an hour each day, and has a lot of other religious feats. I’m 15(M) and I’m Christian too, while not pious, I’m still more religious than the usual teen. Trouble recently began a few years ago, when she’d force me to listen to sermons and other teachings. So what, right. As my focus grew more on school, sports and a future and not on religion, she’s been really pushy about it, especially since my music taste has darkened in a sense and I haven’t been as involved in the church youth. Sometimes I feel like it’s being shoved down my throat. 

I’ll go into a lot more detail here, since this bit happened today. We were in the car, riding home, and I was talking about my frequent headaches that have been bothering me. (Which is going to be further examined later). She told me that it’s likely a curse, due to her recently passed father’s involvement with the free masons. I told her how I was doubtful about that and she said that I wouldn’t know because I don’t read the Bible. She went on, telling me how it’ll be passed down for 1000 generations. I was pretty weirded out at this point. After that, I said “There’ll probably be a cure for headaches by the time I have kids anyway”. She looked at me and said “They’ll be cut off or you’ll have the mark of the beast on my forehead! But you wouldn’t know since you don’t read the word.” (That’s how it went, I don’t remember exactly). I told her that I know what that is and that I’ve read revelation three times, since she made me study the Bible. We got home by then and the conversation briefly ended.

I really don’t know what to do or how to feel. It’s getting to be a lot now and I’m stuck here. Anything helps, thanks.",06May2020,1

74,"My landlord is completely unreasonable. She rented me my current room over a year ago and she constantly complains about me going out late and “not following rules”, even though I do my best not to get in her way or interfere with her life. She never specifically told me any rules when I moved in and all she does is just complains about things I do. 

(For example, she has 4 different sponges for different dishes: 1 for cutlery, another for oily dishes/pots, one for non oily plates and one more for non oily pots/pans. She keeps them all together and they look the same, and she constantly yells at me for using the wrong sponge.)

She’s been borderline abusive, asking me if I’m stupid and if I was even “brought up right”. The amount of times she yells as me has made me scared to even come “home” some days. She reminds me too much of my abusive father who I ran away from in the first place, and provides little to no leniency for anything. 

Just recently, I got an acceptance from a top university. It’s quite far away and I think she has already assumed that I will move out by then (which wasn’t a wrong assumption). She has mentioned recently that I was the “worst tenant she has ever had”, that I was “extremely disgusting and messy” (very hypocritical considering her and her daughters who live there are extreme hoarders). 

She told me that I was going to have to pay to replace the mattress I was sleeping on for over a year (which she said was “new”, but the mattress already had noticeable questionable stains when I moved in) and to give extra money for cleaning fees before I leave. She never asked for a deposit initially and I pay month-to-month so I believe she’s being quite unreasonable by asking this of me. She also wants me to tell her 3 months in advance if I decide to move out. 

My boyfriend secured an apartment for us for June since he was tired of seeing me stressed out all the time, and we could finally afford it after saving for months. She said that she didn’t want me to move out until July since she thinks it will be difficult to get another tenant to replace me while the pandemic is still quite active. Yet, we already paid first months rent for June at the other place. I’m also allowed to move my stuff into the place by May 15 since it is vacant. 

I have a storage locker if that information helps at all. She locks the door and yells at me for going out at night so doing anything at night may be close to impossible. Her daughters also camp out in the living room to watch Netflix before sleeping so I would be caught easily if they see me try to leave with my belongings. They’re also there almost all day every day in the living room so they’ll see me every.

77,"So basically I have lived in the same house my entire life and my mom has lived in it for almost 25 years and plans to keep it for the rest of her life. The issue is that next door we used to have about 3 small houses (it's a really big lot) all owned by the same guy, until about 2 years ago when he decided to knock it all down and build a 4 story apartment building. The construction has been going on for over a year and a half and has caused noise from 7am-7pm everyday of the week except Sunday (some days are better than others), trash/concrete from the construction to go all over our backyard, damage on our fence from the construction, I can't really ever go in my backyard anymore without being looked out by 5 construction men, and sometimes there will also be a bunch of construction trucks/cars in front of my house that block the entire street (to the point where I can't even back out of my garage). My mother refuses to sell the house even though everyone has told her to because being that we live in Miami the real estate is way too expensive and she got this house a long time ago for a good deal and knows that she would not be able to get any type of deal like that anymore, plus she's a teacher so it would be hard to find something nice that she could afford.  

Also whenever people see the building and how out of place it is in the neighborhood they always think that it is illegal, but since they recently changed the zoning of the street that we live anyone can build up to a 5 stories. The man that is in charge of the whole thing is impossible to reach. Due to all of the damage and lack of privacy that he has given us over the last year we have tried to reach out to him a couple of times, but he never responds. Sometimes he will pull up in his Bentley, but neither one of us have ever spoken to him because he is never there for long and when he is the only reason that we know is because of his car. He usually hides, probably because he know that we all hate him, and really the only reason why I know what is car looks like is because he will either park right in front of the construction or on the grass in front of our house, and nobody on our street owns a Bentley (it's a fairly middle class neighborhood, but just in a good location).  

Also the building has 6 big balconies that are directly above out backyard/pool, but nowhere else. I am not sure if this was done on purpose, since we HAD a pretty nice backyard, but there is no balconies anywhere else around the building and now we have ZERO privacy.

Anyways so I have realized that at this point there is not much that we can do about the building. My mom has gotten a lawyer to try to get the people in charge to pay for all of the damage that they have done to our house and also pay for some sort of awning to over our pool for SOME privacy. I am expecting for the building to be done and on the market for rent by around September.

 Basically what I am asking is what are some things that we could do to stop people from wanting to rent(mostly the people with the balconies over our backyard) or at least that could really piss off the owner of this building since he's a complete shit head. My mother was thinking about buying these REALLY bright lights and shining them directly on the balconies and also putting up a big sign that says ""expect construction 2021"". We have also though about putting really loud obnoxious music on the speakers outside, but that would piss off all of the other neighbors. Any suggestions?",06May2020,1

80,"TL;DR: 25F - I feel like a guy way overshared about his past on a first date and it turned me off. I'm not sure if I should go with my gut or give it a chance, but if I turn him down I have no idea what to tell him.

I had dinner with a really cute, charming guy right before all the lockdown stuff. The date was going well and we were getting along. We were flirting over drinks and I made some cheeky comment like ""oh, is that what you tell all the girls?"" in response to something he said, I don't remember exactly. As soon as I said that, I could see him get nervous and he explained that I was his actually first date in a couple years because of some bad past relationships. I think I was like ""oh, I'm sorry to hear that"" but didn't pry because it was the first date, but he opened up to me anyway and started going into a lot of detail about how his ex was manipulative, would threaten suicide and gaslight him, and he couldn't escape because he thought she was his soul mate.

I felt for him because that's a really horrible thing to go through, but honestly at this point I was pretty uncomfortable, I just wasn't really mentally prepared to get so much emotional stuff dumped on me and that kind of thing takes a lot of energy for me to process. I tried to be sympathetic but short in my responses, but he didn't really seem to pick up that I was overwhelmed by the conversation and went on for maybe 10-15 minutes about his trauma. After that I said goodbye pretty quickly after making sure he was in an okay mental place.

Now ever since then, he's been texting me and talking about a future second date, and I feel like a total dick because him dumping all that stuff on me kind of killed the butterflies. It's not that his past itself is a problem, but it made our first date emotionally exhausting and I feel like most people try to avoid oversharing and would get consent to talk about that kind of thing with a stranger. I don't know if there's any tactful way to tell him that. I still think he's attractive and he hasn't brought up his ex again, so I don't know if I should cut my losses or if I'm being weird and should give it another chance. :/",06May2020,1

I'm watching the country reopen, and where I live is slotted to reopen within the next two weeks. I don't care about the numbers or the number of cases or the economy, I care about how people are so frighteningly willing to let others die so the economy can go back to whatever shitty normal it is. I'm so depressed with how people are treating each other and how many people are getting lied to about work being the only way to save their livelihoods when we could honestly just use some of our country's immense wealth. I've lost any sort of hope that I'll ever do anything in life, because I found that my anxiety is too bad to work in customer service and I was suddenly fired from my first and only desk job. I've spent six months looking for a job, failed, and am on my last bit of unemployment. I live with my parents, I have a college degree, and I feel like a fucking failure. I tried to sell art, but nobody wants it.

My Dad works at a hospital as support staff, so he's not on the front lines, but he's still in a place he shouldn't be and he'll probably be back on full time next week. He's in his 60's, he smokes, and I'm very, very afraid that he'll die. My Mom is even more at risk. I'm afraid I'll be alone in the world with no marketable skills, no real job history, and no chance to achieve anything worthwhile other than just letting myself die. I hate where I am, I hate how many people tell me to shut up and stop being so idealistic, and I hate how many people tell me that I need to be more patriotic.

I'm so fucking tired of trying to help. I feel like giving up. I obviously can't convince people that they need to care more about other people than the fact that they and everyone else they know is doing fine, so nobody should be helped. I don't know how to stop caring about what's happening around me, because I'm very aware of the fact that tomorrow I could wake up and be alone and the only thing I'll have left of my parents is a box of fucking ashes because a bunch of goddamned people want money instead of safety.

I'm so, so tired and every time I go online, I just get more and more depressed. I know there are good people in the world, but at this point I wish that my parents sucked so I'd have no qualms about packing up and leaving and never looking back. I have never felt more alone and unwanted in my life, even though I'm surrounded by people that love me, because no matter how many letters I've written to the people in power, all I ever get back is a letter saying either it was considered unimportant or they'll ""consider it."" I don't want them to consider if my parents should die, I want them to fucking do something.

TL;DR: I'm too fucking stressed about everything, but my ADHD means I need something to do. I use the internet to write and to talk to friends, but there's literally no way to avoid seeing the shit happening in this country. How do I stop caring so much?",06May2020,1
84,"This is kind of a dumb one. During a bit of a manic episode I bought tadpoles on ebay last year. Last month apparently conditions were right and my pet frogs decided to have a clutch of eggs. Now, I'd be thrilled, but I am honestly only keeping the frogs because I don't know what to do. I've read conflicting info on whether they're okay to release to a preserve or park ranger, and no local reptile or pet shop will take them because they're southern leopard frogs and I live in southern california. I've read both that they're native, but still considered invasive because of endangered frog species??? They are sweet, and I've loved learning about them and how to keep frogs as comfy and happy as possible, but what in all the hell am I going to do with so many more potential frogs?

85,"My father is a very difficult person to deal with. A lot of the time, I'm afraid of talking to him, or get nervous when it comes to me bringing up something important. It's worse if I think he's going to disagree with me.  


For example, I'm at home away from college during quarantine, and he has an ancient router that desperately needs to be replaced. We've mentioned it once or twice, but he still hasn't done it, and I'm not able to do almost anything on the internet because of it's constant issues. I want to have a real, final talk, saying that it needs to be replaced as soon as humanly possible.  


A more pressing concern is the fact that he makes a lot of posts on Facebook that clash with my own idealogies. I read something today that worried me a lot, where he said that he was going to start ignoring quarantine recommendations in our area, saying that ""it's not as bad as the flu,"" and other similar things. Me and my partner are friends with an immunocompromised person, and my partner also works taking care of an old woman. There is a genuine concern that if we were to become carriers of this through my dad, we could kill people. I wanted to bring this up with him today, but got very afraid when it came time to do it, and put it off until tomorrow.  


I know that I will have to talk to him about this eventually, because it's too big of a concern not to. But, how do I become more confident and stop fearing my father when I need to discuss things with him?",06May2020,1
86,"I've made so many mistakes in my past growing up. I didn't have parental guidance coming from a dysfunctional home, and I had a shitty upbringing with lots of trauma that I'm currently trying to work through, but that's no excuse for some of the things I've done. I've never hurt anyone physically but I've been known as ""the dickhead guy"", and I was and still am (albeit to a more regulated and self aware degree) pretty selfish and sometimes even aggressive. I've been involved with some pretty nasty friends growing up and started abusing drugs when I was 17. I got myself clean almost a year ago now. 

I also deal with mental health issues which have been present for as long as I remember, to which I've just gotten a diagnosis for myself at 21 years old; GAD, depression and Aspergers. I am currently, and always have, had to look out for myself and find my own way. I've started reading and listening to podcasts etc to try to find some mentors (trying to fill the gaps left behind from my parents lack of nurturing and presence). I am trying to become a better person, and get my shit together. I've been addicted to porn for a few years and just now trying to whittle off it; I've gotten a therapist and joined SAA with meetings planned after quarantine.

But even now, when I realize that life is not meant to be lived like that, that a dysfunctional environment isn't normal.. I can't help but feel guilty for everything I've done in my past, for the person I was and all the mistakes I've made. It's a mental road block which haunts me every day, because I was so young and I knew no better, I've become resentful. I'm angry that nobody was on my side trying to show me how to live in this world and give me some kind of proper upbringing and instill some proper morals instead of seeing me as this wasting kid with no potential.

How do I move forward with making myself better without feeling like I'm not worth it and like my past somehow defines me as a terrible person? I want to forgive my parents but I just can't. I can't imagine how you can bring someone into the world to just provide the bare basics of care: food and shelter. I have just started a maths degree at uni and I want to do well but I still have people around me convincing me that I shouldn't work as hard as I do, and that I need to slow down, etc. I feel trapped in a prison environment at the moment. I dream of owning my own place and starting my own family away from the people who have been there from the start, how do I convince myself that I'm worthy of that?",06May2020,1
88,"Hello!

My question is for those of you who have received a psych evaluation as a result from suicidal tendencies ( cutting,  attempting, etc).
This is a 2 part question &amp; it might belong somewhere else on reddit, so i am posting elsewhere too. I apologize if you see the same post twice.

My question is,  did a psych evaluation help you in any way shape or form? Please share your experiences. What happens there?

I can't imagine someone getting out of one &amp; suddenly being ""all better "" after only 3 days. But is there any hope to it? It seems like the main recommendation out there.  

My follow up question is &amp; this may sound rhetorical to some:

Is it worth recommending someone who is expressing suicidal tendency.  What if they refuse?

My grandmother has been diagnosed with lung cancer during this, adding more anxiety to my daily life. My dad is being furloughed currently which is affecting my family's income, which isn't great to begin with. School is giving us an extensive amount of work that has worn me out. I know my parents must be stressed out of their minds but I can't take their constant nitpicking and berating. I already hate myself enough and their comments and expectations make me feel worse. I hate not being able to see my friends or therapist or psychiatrist in person and I feel like I'm going crazy. Today, I couldn't take much more pressure so I snapped at my parents, which resulted in a huge fight. I feel like an asshole for trying to defend myself for once and justify that my mental health issues aren't ""theatrics"" (as my dad with severe anger issues always says)

98,"I suffer from severe derealization, crippling me with intense fear and confusion on a daily basis, and it has been for over a decade now. See, in a teen-hungry quest for knowledge I learned something about 'reality' that completely destroyed my mind (thank you, mushrooms). I'm past 30 now, and it hasn't gotten any better. In fact, it's gotten worse, as the 'thing' keeps burrowing deeper into my consciousness.

(Please don't ask me to explain it, I've been trying to put it into words ever since it started, and I'm no closer to a descriptor now than I was then).

I'm no longer able to connect with people, because of this abstract bridge between us. So I have no social life, lost all my friends. No love-life. I can't work anything other than menial labor, because the agonizing fear takes up all my mental capacity. &lt;This also makes me unable to enjoy anything. My creativity is dead, I used to write music for hours on end, now I barely even think about it. Lastly, the 'thing' has made all bodily and mental sensations incredibly intense (or maybe that's just the perpetual stream of fear-adrenaline), that just sitting on a chair can be mentally exhausting. I'm so tired..

I **need** to 'forget' the thing, or at least become unable to access that part of my brain. Please don't suggest therapy, been there-done that.

99,"Hello to anyone who may come across this post! I hope you all are safe and doing well! I am trying to keep this as short as possible while providing enough details about this situation. 

I’m 21 (F) and so is my friend. We’ve been friends since high school and I am the only friend that she hangs out with on a regular basis. Prior to this pandemic I would say we would hang out 3x a week or so. She is a great friend and we have a good time when we hang out for the most part, the only issue that I have is that she TRIES to be just like me, or at least that’s the vibe that I get.

-Ex: I got a gym bag from a certain brand, she wanted the EXACT same one after seeing mine, SAME color and style. 

-I got some Levi jeans, she bought the EXACT same style. 

-I started using a small backpack to carry my stuff around, she bought herself a backpack to use as well (mind you she only carries a wristlet wallet!) 

-At the gym I started tying my big shirts with a ponytail holder (girls yk what I’m talking about) a few days later she started doing the same thing

Those are just SOME examples out of all the ones that I have. Now I do know that some friends tend to have similar styles and it’s okay to see something that your friend bought and like it and want to buy something similar as well, but she likes almost EVERYTHING that I like at the store, wants to buy the EXACT same style, brands, try’s to imitate the way I style my clothes, and is even trying to talk like me at times! Now I don’t want to bring it up bc she’s a sensitive person but it’s annoying! Any tips on how to go on about this?",06May2020,1

101,"Note: I also posted this under confessions. 

It kind of all started a few years ago when he started acting up in school and that was the start of it. My parents tried to send him to a summer camp so that he would learn from his mistakes (he was around 13) and he ended up emailing the camp and cursing at them. This was just the start. Fast forward to a few years later when he was around 15-16 when he tried to get my mom to take a knife from him and stab him. This was around the same time he pretended to have a seizure after having a fight with my mom and then started crying because she just ignored him and walked away. This was just the start of his manipulation. 


He would constantly bring up having a gun in our home to his school counselors (even though we dont have one) and neither I or my parents understood why. One time, my dad had to hold him back after he was close to hurting me for saying “Hi” to his girlfriend at the time. Only for saying “Hi.” I’m a 19 year old girl, but I was about 17 at the time and still barely have any muscle on my bones. So, he knows how intimidating he is and uses that to his leverage. He started claiming that he was s* abused when he was younger (despite me and my mom both being there for the event he described), yet ridiculed me for starting to become comfortable about talking about my trauma. He gets into screaming matches with my mom constantly and is terrible to her. He’s also lazy and is the stereotypical image of a “gamer” that does nothing but stay indoors and play online. He ignores my mom when she talks to him and always talks about how she abused him as a kid, which she didnt. He constantly paints her as the villain and I can only watch as her heart continues to break. He uses her words against her, twisting it however fits his narrative. I guess that’s a good quality for the profession he wants to become (a lawyer). 


To be fair, I have a much better relationship with my parents than he does so I feel like this is a cry for attention? Even if its the bad kind. Hes 17 now, almost 18, and tried to overdose on my antibiotics towards the beginning of 2020. Thing is, my brother is really smart. He knows its not easy to OD on antibiotics, especially with the few he took. His ex at the time also told him that day to never speak to her and a few hours later he texted her that he was attempting suicide. She also acknowledges that he depends on her for his own happiness but does nothing about it. Maybe it was a cry for attention or maybe it was the breaking point?


It seems like all he cares about is his girlfriend (who got back with him after his attempt). 
He’s supposed to leave for college in the Fall, but now who knows with this Corona thing going on. I hope it ends soon for my own selfish reasons. I cant wait until he leaves our house. I’m tired of all the fights he starts and the attitude he never seems to drop. I’m tired of his manipulation and his own verbal abuse. But I cant say anything about this to him because hes depressed. And if I did say anything, it would mean me not supporting him through his mental illness. But his depression is only causing me to spiral down my own. He often forgets that I have been diagnosed back when I was 13 (with anxiety as well) and feels like he is misunderstood. I, unlike him, was not allowed to be put on medication so I’ve had to learn how to cope with my symptoms. 


I cant stand to be around him anymore. I stayed up for over 24 hours with him at the psych he was admitted to and still attended my university classes the day after. The night of his attempt, I started driving him to a hospital, speculating that he tried to OD, but I somehow let him talk me out of it. This built a lot of self-hatred within me. If he actually did OD, I wouldnt have been able to forgive myself and I dont think he thinks about this. 


Is it wrong to hate him? I know he probably cant help but be like this, but just the sight of him fills me with anger. I don’t know what to do anymore. The two people keeping me sane at the moment are my mom and my boyfriend. 


He has Reddit too and uses it often. I wonder if he’ll see this post. If he does, I just know he’s going to start an argument over it. Maybe I will regret this.

(I’ve been thinking about this for a long time, and have attempted to, but constantly make excuses on why I shouldn’t) I also have a fiancé so I don’t think they’ll take it very seriously.

My parents are the kindest most genuine people ever, and have constantly stated throughout my childhood that they would still unconditionally love their children if they weren’t straight, so I always thought coming out to them would be easy, but when I was recently thinking about doing it, I went into full blown panic mode and completely pussied out. Part of the reason is because my stepdad’s family is very homophobic (for example; his mom’s favorite grandchild came out as gay and his mom full out bawled and claimed God was cursing her with a gay grandkid AND made her sons watch straight porn at a young age to keep them from being gay (?)) She also has said before(in front of my biracial mother) that I cut my hair too short, and looked like a black (she used a more vulgar word) lesbian, and told my SO that he let me cut it too short.

The other problem is my dad’s parents (I want to come out to both sides of my family) I have a cousin who’s a lesbian and recently got married to her partner. During Christmas we met her wife for the first time, and my gram was very nice but visibly uncomfortable. My gram doesn’t take the marriage very seriously, and told me that she wanted me and my female cousin to marry nice men the other day (even though she’s ALREADY married to a woman!!)

I really want to come out and not feel like I’m holding it heavy on my shoulders or constantly tiptoe around being attracted to women (gasp), but them not taking it seriously is really holding me back. I feel like since I’m with a man, it won’t matter that I find women attractive too. My fiancé is being very supportive and encouraging, but I think even he gets tired with my overthinking.

Neosporin, some other ointment my sister brought over, then changing offs, in case it was allergies. It doesnt seem real uncomfortable. He licks in the general vicinity, but not obsessively. I called the vet, before we tried changing food, and they recommended I kept a cone on him, in case he wanted to lick it. Input a cone on him. My mom would take it off, and I would out it back on. She eventually started telling at me, and told me to keep it off. I called the vet back, and said that I though it was the food, and they thought it was a good idea to try that, so we did. I checked a couple days ago, and it looked really good. I checked today, and it looks like it's back. Not as bad as it was before, but theres certainly something there. I realized that I need to stop justifying my mom neglecting her dog, and I told her he needs to go to the vet. She told me no, and that shes having a friend who used to be a bet tech comes and look at the rash. That wont be for another 6 days, and I told my mom that's too far away. She said shes not gonna take him. I said that I'm gonna take him then. She then said ""hes my dog, and your not taking him!""I called the vet. And explained what's going on they said he should be fine for another 6 days, and they reccomend I make him wear a cone. Well, I put the cone on, and my mom freaked out, and took it off. I feel bad, because if I really wanted to, I could have just kidnapped him, and took him to the vet, but I dint want to deal with the consequences. Another thing is, for the past 2 days, hes been licking under his tail, right above his anus, and it's a little pink. I'm pretty sure his glands are full. My mom even said that too., but she said her regular vet, isnt doing it. I didnt believe her so I called her vet. She was telling the truth, but then I called the other vet, and they are doing glands, but for 33 dollars. I then called the groomer, and they are doing it for 10 dollars.

112,"The entirety of my life that I can remember I have been enduring an overwhelming fear of death. Not in dying or being dead, not how or when it will happen. But in what happens after.

I'm not afraid of Heaven or Hell, of choosing the wrong religion or a life wasted. I am afraid of oblivion.

I find myself constantly thinking about, worrying over, and just unable to escape the thought that one day I might not exist. That this is all there is. That not only will I not have any memories of this life but that there won't even be a ""me"" to have those memories.

I obsess over it constantly. Any moment of free time I have is spent dreading it. I find that I have desperately tried to fill my life with anything I can do to not be alone with my thoughts. I am an avid gamer, I have a spouse and two children, I read, and even have a somewhat unhealthy addiction to pornography. All of this just to pass the time. So my days aren't spent sitting in a chair and thinking about being nothing. About being gone from everything.

I can't even adequately put it into words. And no one that I talk to seems to understand the way I feel about it. It is literally physically painful to me. My head hurts, my heart hurts, and I sometimes realize that hours have gone by where I was just staring into space absorbed in my own thoughts.

When I talk to people about it they tell me things like: If you cease to exist you won't be there to think about it! Guess you'll just have to wait and find out! You're too young to worry about stuff like that. etc.

I don't really know who to talk to or how to stop feeling this way. And I am not even sure how talking to someone or getting answers can help. I just don't want to stop existing. I don't ever want to be just gone, unable to keep enjoying this world in some form. Even as a ghost, a reincarnation, an angel, whatever. I just don't want to stop existing. 

If anyone has advice, or maybe understands the way I feel, I would love to read it. For now its late here and sleep is another way I pass the time without this feeling. So getting on that.

115,"Hey! This is gonna sound kooky as hell but I genuinely need to know.

So I moved to Baltimore from my old abusive home after highschool. In that house, I was denied psychiatric care because ""God will take care of me."" My grandmother took care of me in that house-- care being a generous word.

Recently I got a very lucrative money-making offer though, but I have to move back in for the rest of the year to receive the cash because I have to be present. I can't go into more details than that-- BUT!

My problem is I've been taking medication and I've felt the best I have in years! But if I go back I'm scared my grandmother may find and tamper or try to throw out my medication. She won't listen to reason and she refuses to consider that perhaps it's necessary for me to take my medication.

He came over unexpectedly and broke up with me because distance is hard and he doesn’t want us to end up hated each other because of it. We wouldn’t have a lot of time for each other because I work weekends and he would be working with his father during the week. 
Now a bit more about him, he has depression that he has been struggling with since before I met him and it has been extra terrible due to the virus and staying indoors and the idea of moving back in with his parents. 
I went over today to collect some of my things and he wanted me to come in to talk. He asked me to sit down and said that he made a mistake, that he was sorry and asked for my forgiveness. I care deeply for him and don’t want him to be out of my life but I don’t know if I should forgive him. I know I should trust my gut but I don’t trust it.

I will have to stay in school a year longer now (I was supposed to graduate this semester) Ive already come to terms with this and Im moving forword. all my work experience is in retail, I've worked a few management positions as well. I also run the skateboarding club in my college and I've grown it so much that we actually have journalists wanting to cover our club. I designed merch for my club and I've done countless volunteer work like hosting skate meets and growing our social media presence.

Ive never been that academy gifted, I have a learning disability and was in special ed my own public school career but what I lack in grades I make up for in my determination to learn and not give up. Ill be 30 in august and im trying so hard not to be stuck in retail the rest of my life.

120,"It is poorly described, english isn't my first language, I apologize for mistakes.

I have two loving parents. I know for a fact that they really love me and my sister (16f) but they're both from emotionally damaged families and were really hard on me while I was growing up.

I know it was out of fear, and wanting to push me to be the best, but their overprotective and unjustified distrustful behaviour during my teenage years didn't do wonders to my mental health.

I say unjustified 'cause I really was a good kid, with very good grades, and I was terrified to disobey. They weren't violent, just extremely severe and controlling. My father, who owns a restaurant, knows a lot of people and manage to make me believe he gave my picture to all his friends so he would be informed if I went out without his permission, which I rarely had. And I wasn't doing great, so I wasn't even willing to try to mess around. I also thought he had access to my internet history, my texts, etc., during a long time... He didn't, of course, and I don't think he knows I actually believed he did. But he used to tell me to be careful, because he could see everything I was doing.

We constantly fought, because they wouldn't understand my sadness, and I resented them for always expecting the worst out of me, even though I've never done anything to deserve such mistrust. They also had such high expectations, I always felt like I wasn't enough, and even though they just wanted me to be the best I could be... Well. 

&amp;#x200B;

It got really bad when I was 17, for two reasons :

\- first one, they paid for my driving licence that I didn't want to pass, because I was terrified of driving (I've been hit by a car at 11), and they absolutely didn't care. I suppose they thought that pushing me in it would help me overcome my fear, it didn't. We fought about it every-single-day. I still don't have my licence.

\- second, I started dating a girl. I'm bisexual and I've never struggled with my sexuality, but talking about my love life with my parents was absolutely out of the mark. I wasn't afraid of potential homophobia, but they knew the girl, thought she was just a friend, and they didn't like her. She was dealing with a lot of trauma on her side, and came out as quite rude so I couldn't really blame them, but it drove another wedge between us. I couldn't tell them I was in love with a person they spent all their time putting down like that.

Anyway, the relationship was pretty bad, I got really hurt and hit the bottom. That's how I ended up in a psychiatric office. I talked about my parents, of course, and she suggested she could supervise a talk between us three, and I was so sure they wouldn't listen and dismiss my feelings, I was literally crying just thinking about it. I couldn't confront them. So she, with my agreement, asked to see them and did it for me. I wasn't here for the appointment, I didn't want to.

I don't remember much of the conversation we had when they came back. Just my father saying he was sorry, and that he knew he was an assh\*le. I think they were both very distraught. I felt very guilty for causing them pain. My mother stopped getting mad when I talked about leaving for college, and I moved four months later.

They give me financial support, and being away from them did me so much good. I still have a lot to work on, but I feel so much better, and our relationship actually improved. I have weekly phone calls with my mother, we listen to the same music, watch the same TV shows, I enjoy talking to her, and my father, well, he doesn't really live past his restaurant, but I've worked with him during the summers so we have one thing to talk about without fighting (even though we still fight a lot when I come back for holidays, he doesn't know how to not take out his frustration on us).

I came back during lockdown, because I knew that I wouldn't take care of myself if I had stayed alone for that long. It wasn't amazing, but better than I thought it would be. 

What I discover is how the relationship my sister has with my mother, is so different and so much better than what I had. They're so close, my sister tells her all about her life, they're *friends*. And my sister gets to do so much things, and she's so spoiled, I'm amazed by how my parents improved their behaviour, and I'm so glad for my sister who's living her best teenage life, but also, I'm sad? 

I want to have that, I want to be able to talk to my mother about my life, and my worries, but I can't bring myself to do it. We've tried, a few times because I can tell she would like that too, but it's too weird.

I think they don't fully recognized what they've put me through. A few months ago, one of my best friends came over and we were talking about high school detention and, I wasn't accusing or something, I just recounted that the only time I got detention, my mother grounded me, and my mother, who was listening, looked at me, very surprised and went ""Why would I ground you for being in detention ?"" and yeah, good question mom, 'cause you did. And then she remembered, 'cause she stopped talking. And there's a lot of details like that, when I recall something they did, they always start by not remembering or questioning me, because today it feels absurd... It happened nonetheless.

Also, I've vaguely talked to my mother about the break up in high school and I think she thinks now that's why I was so depressed back then. It didn't help me for sure, but, it wasn't the only reason...

And so last week, my sister broke up with her boyfriend, and my parents were so supportive and tolerant about that, and we've talked about it with my mom and there was, something in the air I could tell she wanted me to open up about my own life, but I couldn't. My stomach flips, and I panic every time she tries to ask about anything personal, I can't bring myself to open up to her and it makes me sad, because I see with my sister how great she can be, and I want that. But I can't bring myself to be vulnerable in front of her, I fear she'd be judgemental like she used to. And I don't know what to do. I can't imagine telling them that I'm mad, or something, because I feel guilty for making them sad over me. They will be, I know they care.

I don't know what to do, I wish I could just forget and have something great with them, I could really use some people insights and advices, I don't know if I'm in the wrong for being resentful, if I should confront them even though I feel it will damage more than repair us?

I'm sorry, I've really wrote a lot, and there's probably a lot of mistakes. I want to say that I see a therapist, but it's complicated since I don't want my parents to know, I can't go too often because I don't have the money, and I didn't have the occasion to talk about all this, and quarantine's been quite rough, I needed to let it all out tonight.

Thanks if you read it all, means a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: i want to improve my relationship with my parents even though we never discussed how hard they were on me when I was a teen, and I don't know how to do without being resentful which would lead in more damages than good.",06May2020,1
121,"Maybe it’s my ISO anxiety. My bdd is getting worse and Im scared to discuss it with him. 
So When I met my boyfriend it was amazing. He did compliment me and say I was cute.
We are very open and have allot of banter. We were laughing at our old messages to people when we were single.
One thing I noticed was he was straight forward with a few other girls. With me it was more flirty here and there, calling me cute and then keeping the convo civil. With the other girls it was more complimenting them allot and he seemed more nervous in his messages.
This didn’t bother me but out of no where I thought what if he just settled for me ?

But according to him he said those girls weren’t his type. I did jokingly bring it up once and he said it was because he didn’t wanna mess anything up with me. And he finds me more attractive than the girls he was straight forward with.
But I remember when he used to just say I was cute. He did call me hot here and there but it was more cute. I remember he would have a different way of complimenting other girls back then. And I would be “cute” or “beautiful” 
Except when we got sexual. He did mention only reason he did that was because he wanted it to make sure he’s not messing up anything with me. And he also admitted he did have a bit of ego when he first dated me and thought I would be up my self if he had said other compliments. And tried to make me feel a bit jealous but admitted he was wrong and at the time he said he felt a bit insecure so thought he would keep it lowkey with me. (Tbh I never really noticed). There was a point when I was talking to him about me and my bestfriend getting called sisters. He told me I have a more cute baddie look and my friend has a more baddie look. I’ll admit this got me a bit upset. He was confused as to why I was upset and when I told him it was because he admitted that he finds my best friend more “hot” he immediately got shocked and confused and said he never said or thought that. Turns out he thought baddie meant having a more “serious” look. And he never knew it meant hot. He for some reason thought it meant the style mixed with a vibe. And that he never implied baddie with being hot or sexy. And that he meant that I had a cute look with a bit a baddie vibe. 

however few months into the relationship he compliments me heaps. Idk why but it got me wondering was he telling me the truth or was it that maybe he just settled due to past bad relationships.

I may be analysing things allot. It’s probably my insecurity acting up this isolation. I keep having number of different thoughts. 
I do remember his friends and work colleagues mentioning how he was hyping me up to them more than he has with any other girl. 


Btw I’m not going to leave him or argue with him. I’m hoping it just my iso anxiety

He is also my first serious boyfriend.
If I can get a male perspective on this maybe

126,"I’m currently living with my best friend since high school (9+ years.) I agreed to move in with him about a year and a half ago; he always had a nice car, new clothes, etc. and it seemed like he was very financially responsible, so I thought it would be a good idea. Before we moved in together we set some ground rules: no pets, and we split all chores and household expenses. 

He stuck to the rules for the first three months, but I haven’t seen a dime for wifi, lawn upkeep, trash, or groceries since. Right before he stopped paying for the basic bills we agreed on splitting, he also talked me into getting a dog. I reluctantly agreed because we were both lonely and in good financial positions. He doesn’t help pay for her food or vet bills either. 

Two months ago, I suggested to him that we should get a lawnmower so that “we” wouldn’t have to pay as much for lawn upkeep this summer. He agreed, so I set up a payment plan so we could both pay for it. He hasn’t paid a dime on that either.

The house is almost constantly a disaster because he never cleans. The only time I have to clean is on weekends because I work 10 hours a day, every day of the week (I barely have time to wash my work clothes,) but it’s hard because he constantly has friends over destroying the place. When he isn’t at work or at home with his buddies, he is at his sugar daddies house in Little Rock. I didn’t mind him being away as much until last Friday. I got home from work to find him hanging out with one his friends and a new puppy. I knew he had been visiting his friend’s puppies at his house. He asked me a week prior if we should get one, and I was very upfront and forward with him. I reminded him that we don’t have room for another dog, and that we can barely afford the dog we have now, so I was understandably upset when I found out he went against my wishes. But, as if it wasn’t enough that he had brought the dog home, he has now left me on my own to care for the dog for the last 4 days so he could go hang out with his sugar daddy some more. 

In the last year he has gotten a promotion, and used the extra money from that and his sugar daddy funds to buy a COACH wallet and backpack, go on a cruise and two other vacations, as well as bought endless new clothes and over $1500 in skin care products from some ridiculously overpriced brand. Meanwhile, he owes me well over $3000 for various expenses and I’m struggling to buy gas and groceries and save money for a new car that I desperately need.

I have no options for moving out. I have no other friends I feel like I can trust financially, I certainly can’t afford any place in the area on my own, and I don’t have parents or family I can move in with. 

I’m at my limit. I don’t want to end our friendship, but I feel so used and stretched thin financially while he is living his best life. I am not good at confrontation, but I feel as if I have to do something. How do I bring this up with him?

134,"Throw away bc I want to be as anonymous as possible.

I am apart of a meduim-small business that was just acquired by a nation-wide company . There are 10 departments with 10-15 employees underneath those departments. All employees really care about this place and have been associated with it from a young age. We all just found out our marketing manager Tiffany (we'll call her that from now on) got a promotion to create a new team at a similar local business. 

Every employee has the same belief of Tiffany, she just doesn't do her job. She sits at her desk and watches netflix. She brings her dogs in and plays with them all day. All material published contains spelling errors. She steals donated items for competitions.. like really nice ones that are up to $800. She's antisocial, as the ONLY marketing person of this business how does that work? Bottom line is that she's not qualified for the position. Her lack of marketing is screwing us all over because we get the angry patrons when something is publicly wrong and we get daily customers. In addition, being a liaison between customers and employees is needed, and we get none  of that. All this and somehow she's coerced the director (37m) that she's amazing and can do no wrong--even after countless meetings with multiple employees about her.

Both were hired at the same time and thats how their work relationship started. Its a close business so word spreads life wildfire. Their relationship always seemed a bit off, such as: always having meetings, her always crying to him when an employee writes a nice email about flaws about her work, always whispering and gossiping to each other. He has always acted as her security guard. 

We hoped that with this large business coming in that she would be let go. Obviously that didn't happen. I'm not upset with this promotion, she can market over there and fail miserably again but me and my fellow co-workers are extremely upset that she will continue marketing for our business.

So my boyfriend is great he compliments me heaps, makes me feel great.

However we got into a slight argument. It started when I was talking about how me and my bestfriend keep getting called sisters. He later said yeah only difference is she has a more baddie look and i have a more cute baddie look because he sees more hot than baddie”
Lol

I straight away thought he technically called her slightly hotter (btw I’m not insecure of my best friend, even if he thought that I guess I got mad he said it out) 

Turns out when I confronted him and said that he shouldn’t have implied my friend was hotter than me. This got him confused and shocked and he said he never said he found her hot or said she was hotter and got upset I twisted his words. When I then told him it means the same thing. Cause baddie usually means really hot. He got shocked and upset. He said he never knew that is meant that and for him baddie just meant style or vibe. He said he was simply implying on that other than physical appearance. And that he only mentioned cute with me due to my expressions. he was someone that prefers a more cute baddie.

“Yeah babe the thing is your friend has a more baddie baddie look, while you have a more cute vibe so a cute baddie but I can’t see you as a complete baddie cause your more hot than baddie“
Lmaooo

He gave me examples 
Such as for him cardi b would be a baddie while  doja cat would be a cute baddie. And mentioned to him baddie doesn’t mean some is physically more attractive but more the overall vibe they give off, style and look but not implying hot . And that he thought Hot was better than “baddie” lol. He mentioned bille elish being a baddie but Ariana being a cute baddie.
And that’s how he took it as 
(Btw all the celebs mentioned are equally really attractive in my opinion lol. Just to make it clear I’m in no where near trying to compete. It was just general examples he gave me)

He also got upset and spoke to his friend before we talked it out. He said that his friend corrected him and that he got confused and in no way meant to imply anything in the wrong way. 

And that he was someone that preferred a mixture of a cute and hot look which he has referred to me. But insisted the whole “ baddie “ was a misunderstanding and he never meant it that way at all. 

Also to make it clear I don’t mind is my boyfriend compliments my friends. He has hung out with them and I trust him a 100%. Just that through me off thinking what if he ended up settling for me

137,"So recently a bird built a nest on our front door. It's on one of those circular things you Hang on your door. When we noticed this, there was already multiple babies in the nest. It's obviously not in a safe spot, it's on a circular thing and on a front door which is moved frequently, which can lead to the nest falling off. I haven't touched the birds at all, the parents are still there, there's about 3-4 babies, and they are all alive. It's not as big of a concern rn, but after this whole lock down, we're gonna have guests over that might disregard gentleness for the front door. IDK what to do, for reference I'm in california, u.s.

138,Anyone have any advice of how to get rid of thoughts that just keep going when laying down for the night just when in silence i can watch twitch streams but once i click off of them i lay there and continue to think and will stay up for hours with just my mind,06May2020,1
139,"Hey guys, 
I never make these kind of posts but I wanted to ask advice on how to deal with this from someone who won’t look at me different. 

Let’s jump in.

So I classify myself as a dark complected attractive young man whose a sophomore in college. Throughout my life I have had the problem of getting a woman just to be bored with her after a couple dates into it. Though all of this changed when I met this girl. The girls in the past were simply either not interesting or have the same drive for themselves as I do for me and them. 

Though this girl is different. She makes me think on what to say instead of predicting what she will say and get prepared for it. She is also just simply someone I’ve grown to have a deep affection for and someone I’m both happy and saddened to say I’ve never felt this way towards in my whole life. 

Though my best friend knows how I feel about her he decided to talk to her at this party and flirt with her. Now after I told him to back off and he says he has I feel as if her whole demeanor towards me has changed. 

Maybe it is all in my head, but I’m deeply hurt and something like this to come true would shatter my spirit. And when I get a deep depression all I do is bury myself with work and not talk or do anything with anybody. 

How do I go about this? 

Thank you for your time.",06May2020,1
140,"Before covid I was a driver for a school district, picked up one student from home to school every morning. The kid was always very quiet but whenever he did speak it was always for advice about life or school work. The mom was present for the morning pick ups and would occasionally text me if needed,  I grown to respect this kid over the span of time, he seems smart with a good head on their shoulders. I know graduation is this month and I know this student was a senior before covid. So my question being could I text the mother to see if I could drop off a goodie basket as a congrats? I used to give my kids candy/stickers when I was a monitor for the buses but I'm not sure about this situation since I no longer drive the student to school.

142,"My boss is not only unusually handsome and intelligent, he's also genuinely a good guy. While this wasn't an issue at first, as I have gotten to know him better over the few years I've been working with him I have developed a strong attraction. This wouldn't be a huge issue but it has gotten to the point where it's interfering with my ability to do my job well - it is hard for me to focus during work conversations, and I wouldn't be super surprised if he can tell.

I don't think that I am in love with him, but he is often on my mind and clearly I am more emotionally invested in the relationship than is fully appropriate.

We are both married to other people, so a relationship is not an option, even if the attraction were mutual (and I have no particular reason to think that it is). Quiting my job/transferring is also not an option for the foreseeable future.

143,"I am a freshman in Computer Science. My courses are semestral, and I have 7 classes this year. In my country there are two main exam periods, January-February, then June - July, where students can attempt each exam three times, plus another call in September, for a total of seven. For anxiety related reasons I utterly wasted my three chances in January - February, showing up for only one exam and failing it. Going into this session, I was determined to do better, but I kinda crumbled under the whole quarantine and online classes thing: I have not followed almost any of my classes the last two months, just passively wasting my time. I am really ashamed of the situation I put myself into, and I want to fix it as well as possible.
As said, I have 7 exams to give over 4 total calls. There is a progression line, so my first semester exams lock me access to the next ones (big psychological factor into me avoiding lectures on this semester classes)

My courses are as follow, making up a total of 60 credits, where more credits mean more time working on the exam (roughly named, I do not know the American counterparts): 
First semester:
-Calculus.     12 credits
-C++ fundamentals.     9 credits
-Linear Algebra.    6 credits
Second semester:
-Databases (blocked by C++ fundamentals, need to pass that first).   9 credits
-Algorithms and Data Structures (also blocked by C++ fund.).    6 credits.  
-Advanced Calculus (blocked by Calculus and linear algebra).   6 credits.  
-Physics (blocked by Calculus).   12 credits.  


I have my first call in a month (starting 9th of June): I feel fairly confident in C++ fundamentals, need to do tons of exercises on Calculus but feel like I have a good understanding of most of the theory, but would need to start from little more than scratch Linear Algebra. 
How do I organize for this? I intend to work as hard as I can to pass Calculus and C++ Fundamentals, but the simple knowledge of having to then rush through hours upon hours of lectures on the other subjects in the span of roughly 3 weeks between exam calls seems unfeasible to me. (The first call is in the beginning of June, the second right between June and July, the third one at the end of July, then the last one in September). What would be my best course of action to get out of this session with a good number of exams under my belt? I am going to wake up and study until I go to sleep every day, but I do not know what would be the best way to organize the situation. I am 100% going to postpone physics to September, as it is too big to catch back on during the exam period and I will therefore study it during summer.
The other issue, and the main one, is that I feel a clock ticking: I feel fear of failing again and being too far behind to come back. Fear of failure is what pushed me away in the first semester, and while I made progress it is still a lingering feeling that roams my mind from time to time, making it hard for me to give 100% at a time in which I would need to be at my 200%. I have trouble sleeping at this point, either because I feel like I am wasting precious time that I should use to study or because I feel like I cannot make it at this point. If I revise a concept and do not truly understand it, or if I run practice tests and cannot find the solution, a feeling of dread overwhelms me and I kinda lose motivation. I need to get rid of this feeling, but I don't know how to do so.
Any advice you might have on this situation is gladly welcome, and I can explain any unclear aspects of it in the comments.",06May2020,1
144,"So my boyfriend has been having some serious suicidal thoughts for the past few months and has almost acted on them twice (to my knowledge). These thoughts are giving him a lot of trouble sleeping and he'll have up/down days and weeks. I've been as supportive as I can, but I'm still really worried about him, as this is also affecting his physical health.

He's also not in the best family situation - he's stuck at home with his parents who seem to care but they definitely don't have the right idea of how to handle it. They think that just kind of putting it off and talking about God will help him (and I'm religious, but sis that's not gonna help).

I know that his parents are willing to take him to therapy if he agrees to go, but he really doesn't want to because he's uncomfortable with the whole idea of it. This is a problem though, since his family isn't really helping at all and he can't see any friends right now due to quarantine. I know that he needs some form of intervention right now, because he's not in a good situation. He also needs somebody with authority to tell his parents that they need to take him more seriously (and I know can't do that without them blowing me off and getting mad).

To those who have gone to therapy and maybe didn't want to in the first place, is there anything that I can say or suggest to help him decide to go? Or is there some sort of alternative that you know of that he might be more comfortable with? He just needs something to happen, and soon.",06May2020,1

146,"Hello everyone, English is not my native language and I'm on mobile. 
So almost one year ago I decided to move in with my boyfriend. He lives in a big house that he shares with his brother, their mom and mom's boyfriend. Shortly before I moved in the family also decided to get a puppy that is now around 1,5 years old. 
I moved in to have a place I can ""rest"" while I learn a job. I mean resting in a way that we didn't need to pay rent, mom made the food, we could use everything like the washing maschine or the two cars. We took money aside during the year I live here and planned to move out in summer 2021. 

But shit hit the fan, I guess... The mom's boyfriend bought the house we all live in many years ago. It is devided in 3 flats: one on top of us, one under us and ours, the biggest one. He renovated all the flats with little money, time and effort so there are a lot of things that looks like someone started to work on it but never finished. The only exception being the bottom flat. There lived an old lady that had her flat done more then 30 years ago. She went into an old people's home some months ago. This is where it went downhill. The mom's boyfriend, still not having finished everything up here decided to go down there and renew EVERYTHING. He got the floor out, hammered walls away etc. and got help by his brothers. They know how to do stuff like this and mock him constantly while working. For some weeks now you can hear them shouting to each other through the floor, hammering, and all other noises. When being with us, the mom's boyfriend got more and more rude, to a point where he yells at all of us. As far as the mom told me, this happened for years, but never ever did he yelled at them like this. 

The other day my boyfriend saw this guy yelling at his mom and kimda snapped. He threatened him to stop or he gets even more loud. My boyfriend is really tall, muscular and very protective. The guy now want to kick him and me out. The mother and her other son could stay, but they wanna move out too, asap, with the dog.
He said he's gonna sue us, if we dare to take the dog away and now is gone/downstairs all the time and comes home drunk in the evening. The mom and him don't share a bed, luckily. 

So last weekend my boyfriend basically told me we gonna move out in the way that him and I get a flat in the middle of the biggest city (where he works and I learn my job) and his mom and brother get something in a village/outskirts where a dog is allowed. 

I am so scared. This all came way to fast. Sure, we have money on the side for furniture, he has a good income, we will not end up on the streets... but it all happens so fast now. Did anyone experience such a thing? What were the biggest troubles of a ""first flat together""?",06May2020,1

149,"I (25F) just went through a terrible break-up and can't help but have jealousy and resentment towards my friend for having a successful relationship. It sounds ridiculous as I type it, but it is what it is. I know I should be focusing on my own happiness and working on my own insecurities and whatnot, but it's easier said than done, especially during this lockdown. 

Long story short, my ex-boyfriend (30M) of three years was cheating on me with at least 8 of my colleagues. Everyone at work knew but kept it a secret from me until one of the girls laughed in my face and told me all about it in front of several other colleagues two years after it began. It was humiliating and as a result, I had to suddenly quit a job I loved and now work somewhere I hate in addition to being heartbroken. It was a big, hurtful mess and turned my world upsidedown so I'm still trying to figure out how to deal with it.

At the same time, my best friend (25F) and her boyfriend (27M) have gotten really serious, moved in together, and have plans to purchase a house together in the fall, and to ultimately get married. I can't help but resent her every time she talks to me about her relationship. I know I should be happy for her but I'm nothing but jealous and angry. I hate being so ingenuine when I say congratulations to her, and don't get me wrong, part of me is happy for her, but mostly I get frustrated and don't know how to stop those feelings from taking over. I'll usually stop responding when she begins to talk to me about her relationship because I can't handle it. This brings me to my next issue:

On top of this, I feel awful for being a bad friend to her because I do want the best for her, but my resentment and jealousy take over. How can I work on myself to be happy for her and others?

150,"So for some backstory, I am a 14-year-old boy who, like most teenage boys, love to play video games. I have mostly played on Xbox but a few years ago I got a new PC for Christmas. I love playing on it with friends online, but my one problem is that it is essentially in the middle of a hallway. I was fine with it at first but as I started to grow up, my urge to move it into my own room had also grown. And just a  few years later I got a laptop as my birthday/Christmas present. I think it should be noted that my parents trust me and don't have any screentime limitations or parental restrictions on any of my devices including my phone. 

A few years ago I did ask my dad if I could move it into my room which to be fair, I even agree I was too young. He said no and mentioned that he is concerned for me and that he didn't want me looking at porn or anything. I want it to be known that I have never looked up porn on either of my computers to this day. But I also asked him about my brother who has his computer in his room. He is now 20 and is staying at home with us during quarantine and the summer months. Many times throughout the day I can hear him screaming with his friends on the computer and many times he or his girlfriend will walk out, have to maneuver around my pc setup, and use the bathroom. It sounds stupid but those kinds of things bother me. I believe he was around 15 when he got his pc in his room and when I asked my dad why he said it was because ""he was at an old enough age.""

I've now become a teenager since that conversation and like almost every other teenager in the world, I want my own privacy. I get good grades in school and when I'm not locked inside my house because of a global pandemic, I hang out with friends and get good exercise. How can I convince my dad to let me move my computer into my room? I also want to know if there is a way without having to put on any parental restrictions on my computer.  I'm sorry for the long post I wanted to add a lot of details.

151,"Hello,

A friend of mine recently passed away. 
He was my best friend in primary school and through some of middle school. Later in life we’d lost touch, and became rather alienated rarely exchanging a few words over social media. 

The circumstances of his death, as well as the life path he chose for himself shortly after our friendship faded away was questionable - as he had become a drug dealer. 

I found out about him passing away, the day before yesterday. He died on March 24th 2020.

Doing some research online I came to discover he had been stabbed three times - once under his ribcage and twice to the chest and his cousin had been injured with a stab wound in the leg. From what I gather this was a drug deal gone south. 

It happened on a street perpendicular to his family home where he still lived with his parents. 

I knew his parents pretty well, and I’m sure they still remember me from the countless sleepovers and time spent at their house. 

In light of these recent events, I wanted to write a letter to them. Notifying them I know of his death, asking them how they feel and maybe even cheering them up telling them how their son wasn’t all bad (despite his lifestyle) and how I still cherished the memories I had made with him. As well as, asking  them where he was buried so that I could visit him and pay my respects.

Although, I’ve been thinking about this for a while, I’m on the fence whether or not I go through with it. Whether it could rehash some painful memories or be an unwelcome addition to an already tragic slew of events. This has been bothering me non-stop. And I don’t know how to handle it. 

I’m only twenty one years old. I’ve never dealt with a similar situation and I would appreciate advice. 

Thanks in advance,
I wish you all the best in these tough times",06May2020,1

155,"I (21M) met my most recent ex-girlfirend (21F) ""Theresa"" during a housewarming party my first week back for my senior year of college in August of 2019. She was a former roomate of one of my good friends and we clicked immediately. 

We started seeing each other constantly after meeting and went on several dates, some of which ended intimately. We had both agreed to not officially ""date"" as it was our senior year and she would be moving back to the Bay Area to teach with a program she was locked into after graduation whereas I was going to do political work in DC. 

Eventually we became very close, a de-facto couple if you will. Finally, in October, Theresa asked me if I wanted to try and have a real relationship with her. I was reluctant but said yes because she was absolutely amazing. I decided in my head, though, to reinforce my hesitation to date long-distance whenever I could. To the point of being obstinate about it. For context though, this was the only point of contention in our relationship. We literally never fought about anything as we were both really good at disagreeing civilly. 

Fast forward to February, just a week after valentines day. Theresa and I are in her apartment talking, and she comes to me with her dilemma. She has internalized at this point that I'm going to break up with her in May, and she said it was stressing her out combined with the general anxieties of graduating. I gave her a few days, during which time I was a nervous wreck. I realized at this point that my obstinance was mostly because I feared losing all physical intimacy, but our relationship had grown so much by this point that I didn't really care about the long distance anymore. But, when she came back saying she thought it was best we breakup, I froze. I didn't want to seem shady or like I was going back on all I had said (since I substantiated my anti-long distance stance with some embellished stories), so I agreed with her. 

We didn't talk for a while, but when the 'rona came round we sort of reconnected and helped each other process the early end of our senior years. She threw an end of the world party the week before we all got sent home from school at the end of March, and we ended up hooking up there and I stayed the night. We've been talking everyday since being home, not necessarily in a romantic way though. 

She was the best girl I ever dated. Do I admit I played up my insecurities with long distance? Is it even worth it at this point?",06May2020,1

My dad is abusive, has been since I was young it’s complicated. Our relationship is complicated, infact my relationship with both of them is complicated. 

I was lucky enough to be accepted on a clinical phd for clinical psychology. I’m earning a decent amount but here’s the thing. Since starting the course it’s like my whole words come crashing down and I’ve just stopped. I don’t make an effort with the coursework and it feels like pure laziness but here’s the thing, I’ve always been a hard worker. I don’t enjoy placement and so much has come up for me since starting this course: realising how traumatising my childhood was,how my people skills suck, how I struggle to make friends and relate to people. I’ve just plummeted into depression. 

I thought I really wanted to do this because I was passionate to help people but I can’t fathom doing a phD. I feel everyone will say it’s such a missed opportunity but I’m so unhappy.

I feel stuck in a childish level of emotional intelligence and maturity. I just wanted some advice from the outside world.

157,"So my clinic just re-opened after being closed for a month to everyone except urgent care. I just came back to work this week and was told that we would be practicing social distancing, limiting seating in The waiting room, cleaning between patients, and staggering our schedule so to ensure only one person per hour or half hour for emergencies. Literally no other clinics of our type are even open right now and some aren't going to be open for routine visits until possibly September. Our clinic isn't even a life-sustaining business aside from urgent care so I don't know how we're even allowed to be fully open right now.

Instead we are absolutely flooded with basic routine physicals. Two, sometimes three, patients per half hour. Waiting room still has same amount of seating. People are waiting around because our physicians can't keep up. Our exam rooms are far too small to practice any kind of social distancing, and to kick it all off we're going through our cleaning supplies like crazy we'll run out before the end of the month because everything's apparently on backorder. 

I and a couple others share the same concerns and don't feel like we should be seeing anyone except urgent care visits let alone have full staff back to work.

I've told him so many times how much it bothers me, that it gives me a headache and that I don't like to be in the room when he smokes. I'm constantly running out of candles, spray and incense and oils for my humidifier because I have to have them running all the time when he is home (which is all the time now, thanks to quarantine). I have to leave the room and try to relax/sleep on the couch when it gets smokey in here. He smokes to get to sleep at night and can't fall asleep without it, so he's hitting the bowl until the moment he falls asleep. I stay out on the couch until I hear him turn the light off. It's not SO bad when I am able to have all the windows open and air flowing in the house, but in the colder months when it's way too cold to keep them open, it's unbearable. I feel like I'm trapped in a fishbowl. When he is able to buy cartridges for his vape pen, I am the happiest girl in the world. No smell whatsoever. But they aren't always easy to find (it's not fully legal in our state yet) . It's also how dirty and messy it is- he gets ash and resin everywhere, on the floor, his desk, tables, sometimes the bed or burns a small hole in the blankets... I found a small nug of weed buried in my cat's tail once... he's a very floofy long-haired boy with sponge-like qualities.

We have two cats in our small one bedroom apartment, which is another concern to me. I don't know exactly how much the smoke affects them, but one of our cats absolutely despises it and runs out of the room every time Eric lights a bowl. He comes back, because he loves him and is kind of dumb, but bolts away every time. I also worry about using strong scents/incense around the cats because I've read that it is harmful to them and that they are more susceptible to harmful chemicals because of how small they are, and low to the ground, where eventually spray and smoke settles.  

Why doesn't he realize how much it upsets me? I'm trying really hard not to be a bitch about it or to nag him or complain. We've been together 3 years and have lived together for most of our relationship. He's wonderful and loving and we have an incredible connection despite our differences. Does anyone have any words of advice? Right now I'm nesting on the couch looking up air purifiers and products to neutralize the smell. Any input on those kinds of solutions?  It's hard not to feel some resentment when he won't consider my feelings. I appreciate any kind of support right now.",06May2020,1

I am 17 and will be turning 18 within the year. To be honest I’ve had friendships with people older than them. The difference? My mom didn’t know about it. 

We have been texting constantly for about 4 months now and the chats are fun and never cross the line. They have a significant other as well and are very committed.

I didn’t have these doubts until my sister would grill me about it, try to get me to stop talking to them, and accused them of being a groomer. And then today my mother asked me how frequently we exchanged messages and I lied and said not so often anymore to which she said “Oh, I’m kinda glad”. 

I don’t feel that us talking is wrong. I know where to draw the line. And having talked to bad people and creepy people before I don’t see that in them at all. I just need some advice and maybe some other moral compasses.

A few months ago my friend decided he was done dealing with his parents and wanted to move out but when they found that out they threatened to kick him out so he left. He had no where to go so I let him stay with me at my house. I live in a house with another one of my friends alone and so we figured things would be fine here for him but after a few months go by, just a week ago, he got a call from his dad claiming they missed him and wanted to see him. My friend would constantly try to talk to them and try to see them but they didn't want to. He went only to see his siblings since he missed them and doesn't want anything to happen to them. After a few days i find out from one of their family friends who I work with that after tricking my friend to go to his parents for the night they possibly forced him to another family friends house for ""rehab"" since my friend would smoke a little bit of weed. I have not heard or seen my friend in over a week and his dad took the phone i gave him and wont stop asking me to bring him my friends xbox and playstation. I keep ignoring his texts because they are from my friends snapchat on my old phone.

Since we are all in quarantine and I'm unable to attend school. We've obviously resorted to online. But I can't find any motivation to do any of the work. I've been able to do some for my Biology class, and worksheets for my woodworking class. But stuff like maths and English, I just can't get myself to do.   


I've never liked reading. I have a hard time focusing on it and I end up reading half of the sentences a few times before actually understanding what it means, which just is not a fun experience to constantly have to take that long on something so simple.  


I've also never liked math. Most of it I understand, but I absolutely hate doing the work. I have no interest in it at all and it's just extremely boring for me.   


I know that I have to do the work or I might not get full credit for the class, I don't know specifics on how that will work but regardless, I know I need to do it.

But I can't.

Every time I think about doing schoolwork or the fact that I have an AP test in 10 days (which was a huge mistake to have taken an AP class when school is obviously not the thing for me), I get really bad anxiety and it really, really brings me down. My whole mood shifts from having a good calm, happy morning, to my mother asking me about me completing schoolwork or not, making me upset and shifting my attitude for basically the rest of the day.

180,"Hello, 

My fiancee and I just got an apartment in a far away area without touring it first due to the Coronavirus (I know, stupid right?).  We thought the place looked gorgeous online, and signed the lease papers,  but unfortunately when we showed up to collect the keys, we immediately were hit with the scent of stale cigarette smoke.  We contacted the landlord shortly after to express our concern with it smelling of cigarettes, as we are non-smokers, and she seemed sympathetic to us and is having a cleaning lady come in to wipe down the walls, place vinegar cups to place around the apartment, and spray deodorizers that are supposed to help mask the smell. 

We have tried these products for a day now and have not noticed much improvement.  We have already put down our deposits and first months rent.   This is supposed to be a non-smoking rental property, and we were disheartened when we arrived and it reeked of smoke.  For reference, it is a non furnished apartment, with all hardwood floors.  

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation?  Does any cleaning product/hack work for getting smoke out?  Should we even bother with trying to work with the landlord on fixing the smell of the apartment or just try to break/get out of the lease altogether?",06May2020,1

183,"So both of my sisters and I have always loved singing. When I was younger, I wasn't very good at it at all and had to work for years to develop my voice into something I'm confident with and proud of. My little sister on the other hand, was a very good singer when she was younger, but now belts constantly, is off pitch, and strains her voice. This happened as a result of no longer being in voice lessons and therefore without instruction, she's regressed. Now, normally I'd let her be because who really cares if you're a good singer or not, right? The problem is she has told me that she would love to be a famous singer. My family and I also have to constantly hear her sing around the house which is unpleasant because it's very very loud and hard to listen to. She's asked me before if I liked her voice, and I lied because I didn't want to hurt her. I know it would upset her if I told her the truth, but if she really wants to go into a career involving singing I feel she should know that she has things she would need to really work on and change before that. So bottom line is, do i tell her the truth or keep lying? If I do tell her the truth, any tips on how to phrase it to be the most helpful and supportive? I don't doubt she could be famous because she's very driven, she just needs to work on her vocal skills first to get them back to how they used to be.",06May2020,1

They are an embarassment of a replacement. But, I have the option to defer until next year and start my final year again (hopefully the world won't be on fire then). 

On the pro side; I'd get the full course experience (which includes a paid for overseas trip which was canceled this year), I would get to stop these shitty zoom classes which are making me life and I have a very good relationship with the year level below me so joining their group won't be a problem.

On the con side; What would I do for the rest of this year, is it a hinderance if I delay my entrance into the industry for a year (21yo vs 22yo) and due to the nature of the course, student numbers are very small meaning we are all vERY close with each other - these are my best friends and seeing them graduate a year before will kill me (some may choose to defer later on in the year but I don't know that for sure and I have to make my decision before then).

Also something to consider is, when would be a better time to enter the industry e.g Is the end of this year better because everyone will be looking for cheaper talent OR worse because no one will be able to afford to pick up new talent?

189,"Every aspect of my college journey has been hard. This journey has been tiring and stressful, and I have no idea what to do.

For starters- my life at home is not the greatest and I want to move away from this environment. People always tell me to attend the local community college, but I can’t stay here for longer. It’s damaging my mental health severely. I have no money or really any way to move out. 

I applied to MANY different scholarships. I believe I have pretty good grades (3.6 GPA), plenty of extracurriculars, and demonstrate financial need. I took my time on all of them, had others proofread my applications, and got amazing recommendation letters from my teachers. After recently talking with my school counselor, I came to find out that I received no scholarships. None. 

This news has completely shaken me. My dream is to go to this college and become an educator someday. I can’t wait to start this journey, but after realizing I’ve received absolutely nothing... I can’t even stand without feeling like fainting. 

My dream college has supplied no financial aid either. When I received my financial aid award from them, I opened the letter to receive a near blank piece of paper. That shook me too. By the way, this university isn’t out of state and isn’t a private college. It’s just a state school, nothing crazy. They have one of the best programs in my area of study around here though. It’s also past May 1 now and I have no other options at this point. 

I’ve worked in retail before but sadly my place of employment closed down. Due to COVID-19 (and my anxiety caused by this stress), I haven’t found work. I’ve saved up $1000 to help with expenses only revolving around college supplies. My family is not well off in the slightest either- my dad blew my entire college savings on gambling back in elementary school. They have nothing to give me and no way to help me.

People tell me I’m in over my head. But I can’t take this anymore. My mental health is getting worse and worse, and I thought the path to college would be easier to obtain. I didn’t expect to receive no help when I’ve reached out so much. I shouldn’t have to sacrifice my dreams and goals because of money. To me, that’s messed up. Sadly that’s just how the world works.

Anyways it started after the end of my 1 year relationship which I was cheated on since she had been pretty much openly seeing one of my close friends behind my back. All is somewhat forgiven now but I’m still very fucked up over it since it was my longest relationship and my once best friend.after this all happen I moved to a different school(not related to the story but thought it should be mentioned) before moving tho I struggled to find out who I am as a person since my life once revolved around this girl who was now gone and I hated at the time I even tried to hook up with another close friend(mind you I was and still am a virgin which I couldn’t care less about either way) but that ended up going no where since I backed out cause I didn’t wanna seem desperate and i generally didn’t wanna have sex with her. Trust me these are all important details. Once I moved and finally settled out here with new friends I thought I could start over maybe find a new gf but that was a big maybe still and I was still hurting and trying to heal which was made worse by the night of my 17th birthday we both kissed for the first time since the breakup and broke me from the inside out especially since we would never get back together. And when I finally got in the better mind set to start a new relationship I found that each girl I had liked at my new school didn’t see me in that way which I wasn’t upset over until recently. When a girl who I was talking to reached out to me after ghosting me then had the nerve to ask for hw help(by this I mean she wanted me to do sections of work) then when I tried to talk about something besides the work I was ghosted until she needed help I was obviously hurt and stopped trying but I feel bad cause she says she’s in a bad relationship atm and Ik how it looks I’m talking to a girl who is already dating someone after the same was done to me. And trust me I hate myself for it which is why l stopped talking to her cause I’ll eventually try and flirt.

192,"I met a guy on a video game and we immediately became friends. At first, I got comfortable with him because he seemed like a nice and open person. He also admitted that he liked talking to me. We shared instagrams/discords and sent pictures of each other back and forth like snapchat (the reason why I’m paranoid about this will come later in this post).

But strangely, only after talking for a day, he would act extremely attached to me. I don’t know if it’s just me but it seemed really strange that he would have such a strong, positive feeling about me without knowing me for very long. I admit to texting him first but at some point he began texting me so much to the point where it made me uncomfortable. So I questioned him about why he likes talking to me and trusts me so much but he never answered my question directly. 

He would ask me if he wanted him to stop texting me because he was being annoying but in a way that wasn’t out of courtesy. I would be like “hahaha that’s okay you’re not annoying” but in my defense, in a situation like this, it was hard to admit how I was really feeling.

He also opened up about his life story, which I found interesting but for the wrong reasons. I understand that someone’s life doesn’t always work in a logical sequence, like how two always comes after one, but it just seemed so orchestrated. I admit, I might be way too paranoid about it and that he could be telling real stories. Even so, everything just seemed way too fabricated(?). He would also brag about how many girls he dated, how good looking he was, and etc. and it just seemed as if he was putting in way too much effort to impress me. 

I also brought up the fact that our high school was having virtual graduation but that thankfully we were having a celebration rescheduled to a time when the coronavirus situation would be handled. Then he asked me if I was going to go. The conversation was fine up until the point when I thought he was going to ask if he could come. That was an extreme red light for me because I thought he was actually going to come to where I was living and that terrified me so I immediately changed topics.

He also brought up online dating at one point out of nowhere and told me “success stories”. I told him my opinion on it and how I didn’t really believe in online dating (just for me personally, not trying to shame anyone who met people that way). He just seemed really thrown off by my opinion and didn’t bring it up again. 

But the last straw was when he would constantly ask if I could call almost every single hour. And when I did, because I didn’t want to seem rude, he made it seem like I wanted to call. And when we did call, I told him I was doing homework or studying but he would continue to text/call despite that. I know I made it seem like it was okay to contact me at the time because I felt bad if I declined but I felt super distracted and I thought he would have the decency to leave me alone. At one point I told him that I’m just going to stop talking to him because of an uncomfortable situation he created and he brought up his anxiety and mental health issues that were triggered because I wouldn’t talk to him. Idk if I was just being paranoid again but that seemed like mass manipulation to me because he was trying to threaten me into talking to him. So I ended up blocking him.

I know my story doesn’t seem very extreme but I was extremely uncomfortable. But the fact that he knows my first name (relatively), the school (college) I go to, what I look like, and the state that I live in, I can’t help but be scared and paranoid that he has this kind of personal info on me. I kept mentioning it but I developed an even more extreme paranoia about this and now I feel like I have panic attacks more often because I’m scared that his “obsession” is going to turn on me.

If anything seems unclear, feel free to comment. I’m not quite stable at the moment and couldn’t write this post to the best of my abilities.",06May2020,1
193,"(Obvs a Throwaway acc) 

First some background:

I am 20M, around 220lbs. My family is poor but I've graduated from a private High School (scholarship) and I've gone to college with a full ride for 2 semesters. Unfortunately due to a mistake on both college's and my part, I was wrongly given a scholarship and I was forced to pay my second semester. Because of this I became heavily depressed and flunked out. Now I live with my mother and I'm working at the same Daycare she works at (only one car between the two of us) part time, so I'm helping with bills and the such, making sure I'm not a financial burden at least. 

My mother has been patient with me. She expects me to go back to college this fall and if not to find a stable job somewhere. With this whole pandemic, it's most likely I'll be let go from my current job in the upcoming weeks.

Here's the thing. I have... suffered with depression for as long as I can remember. My social anxiety has been getting worse and the thought of talking to strangers petrifies me. The thought of going back to college and facing my failures terrifies me, and so does going out there and finding a job. I hate myself because of these fears, which only feeds my depression, which feeds my fears and so on and so forth.

I'm just... stuck at what to do. I wanted to be an animator originally, but I can't find the motivation/passion in me to pursue that or any creative career. I've been lying to my father, telling him that I'm ""studying"" during this ""off year"" and he's told my mother and I that he'll stop supporting us financially. I feel like time is running out for me and that if I don't find a good source of income or a goal/drive my life is over. I don't... know what to do. Or I guess more specifically I don't have the will to do what I have to do. Every choice I've made to this point has been the wrong one, and I'm scared to make another choice because of this. I just... need some advice or guidance to help get my life on track.",06May2020,1
194,"I’m writing this on behalf of my girlfriend who is still too distressed to be thinking about this right now. I was trying to make this brief but now I’m looking back after writing it am just realizing how long it is, apologies if it is too long. Any advice/opinions/stories are greatly appreciated, as we aren’t quite sure what to make of this and don’t really know what to do.

About one month ago, I stayed the night at my girlfriend’s apartment, and the next morning was when it all started. She was getting ready to take her dog out for her morning walk, and my gf starting putting on her shoes as she let her dog outside. But right as the dog got out the door she started barking, VERY aggressively, like much more than she normally does with any other strangers or other dogs. I was inside and could hear that it sounded like an abnormally panicked and stressed bark, but honestly at the time I just brushed it off and continued to focus on my work. It was after my gf came back inside that I found out what really happened. 

She lives on the second floor of a garden-style apartment complex, so basically that means that her apartment door opens up to a hallway, but that hallway is technically “outside” because the it just goes directly to the outdoors, if that makes sense. She lives in the far back corner of the apartment complex, and the adjacent lot is some kind of old warehouse, so there’s not a whole lot of visibility from other people there. Prime spot for sketchy people if you ask me. Anyway, she finishes putting on her shoes and walks out the door and sees a tall blonde man, with a black leather jacket and a baseball cap, just standing literally right in front of her door, who is staring directly at her completely emotionless and doesn’t say a word. And he also doesn’t move out of the way, just stares. This is while her dog is manically barking at him, but he’s not even noticing or acknowledging it, just staring at my girlfriend who’s still standing in her door. This lasts for probably a few seconds - with no expression from him but a focused gaze. Given my gf’s personality type, she isn’t the type to let this affect her routine, so instead of coming back inside she just walks around the man without saying anything and goes downstairs to takes her dog outside to the grass. As she’s walking around, she notices that the man was still on the second floor, but had walked over to her side of the hallway and was watching her. So she walks over to the dog park on the other side of the building, only to notice that he had walked to the other side of the hallway too, still watching her. She stays outside for about 20 minutes longer than usual, with the man watching her the whole time, before ultimately walking back. She walks to the other side of her apartment yet again and walks up the stairs, and while doing so can still see the man’s legs as he’s standing on the staircase between the second and third floors, at the opposite end of the hallway. As she’s walking toward her apartment door, the man walks down to the second floor, stops completely, and stares at her for a few seconds. My girlfriend stares back expecting him to say something, but he doesn’t. And then suddenly he leans forward and begins marching toward her, fast and holding a dead stare. And this is when my girlfriend panicked and rushed inside as quickly as possible.

She told me this story when she got in and she was clearly distressed. The dog didn’t seem normal either. We had heard a few stories recently about how sex trafficking had been accelerating in our city in recent years, so this made it all the more scary. We’re just a few hours from the border of Mexico, in a medium-large city, so it makes sense that traffickers might target a city like this, as they would have a large population of young women to target, and the traffickers would be able to make a quick escape out of the country with minimal risk when transporting their “cargo” to its destination, where that ultimately may be. This is what my girlfriend and I are afraid of. That this guy is a hired kidnapper in a much larger sex trafficking ring, who had potentially been watching her for weeks or even longer, waiting to make his move, but fortunately hesitated just long enough that day to let her slip by. 

She called the police and an officer came by to get her story. When she described the man to the officer (tall, blonde, blank but focused stare), the officer shockingly asked, did he seem like he was European or Russian? This was crazy because 1) that’s not an ordinary question for a police officer to ask, and 2) that’s exactly how my girlfriend described him to me earlier. The officer looked surprised and then went to his car to talk on the radio for about 20-30 minutes. When he came back he refused to give us any more details, but insisted repeatedly that she always lock her doors, never go outside alone, and especially never go outside at night for any reason. He dodged all of our questions about what other reports there had been about this man and what else he might know, and instead just kept repeating how careful she needed to be. So we were just left wondering what this man could be. 

I convinced her to lay low for a while and just live with me, so she stayed with me for four weeks, during which everything was fine. Then just 3 days ago we decided that she had probably stayed away for long enough, so she moved back into her apartment. 

But just earlier today, he reappeared. She was outside walking her dog when she saw a giant white cargo driving up to her — the kind of van without any windows in the back — and inside was a man smiling and waving. The van was still pretty far away, so she had no idea who was inside, and she just alwaved back. The man then pulled up the van to where she was with her dog, and got out of the van and just looked at her and smiled and waved. That’s when she realized that this was the same man that she saw standing in front of her apartment door last month. She acted casual, and apparently this time he seemed friendly. (By the way he did have a very thick accent, so it seems like he might not have spent much time in the US yet). She said hi and asked if he just moved here and he said “yes” without adding any more details. Then he said “I’m __, what’s your name.” She answered with a fake name and that was the whole conversation. Then she started walking upstairs to her own apartment and he followed right behind her, except when she went to her apartment on the second floor, he continued walking up to the third floor. Okay, so as of this point in the story it seems possible that he’s just a strange guy who happens to have moved in one floor above her now. But that doesn’t quite make the whole story fit together, and we also found out some more details just a few hours ago. 

A little bit about this cargo van - there are **many** things that are strange about it. First of all, cargo vans are the scariest vehicle because they are presumably what a kidnapper would use, because there are no windows on the sides, which means that no one can see in, and even if they were pulled over by a police officer, the officer would need probable cause to be able to look inside, since the inside of the back of a cargo van isn’t readily visible from the outside. A captive might run out of oxygen with a few hours spent in the trunk of a car, but not in the back of a cargo van. Like I said earlier, we’re worried that this man is part of a larger sex trafficking ring, and they see my girlfriend as one of their next targets. The van is brand new, and clearly a new model based on the body styling and the thick coat of gloss on the paint. It looks freshly waxed. No one who worked in construction/shipping/cleaning/etc (the typical legit users of cargo vans) would reasonably buy this fancy new van as both their work van and their daily driver. The front cabin windows of the van have no tint whatsoever, but the windows on the back gates to the cargo area of the van have the darkest tint I’ve ever seen on any vehicle window. I happen to know a bit about window tints, and I know for sure that this dark of a tint is illegal in most states. This means that the manufacturer didn’t put this tint on the glass - the man put it on there himself, which means that he doesn’t want anyone looking inside. So, of course we looked inside. We saw a minimum of 8 different license plates on the floor, and a motorcycle. The motorcycle could be explainable, but I can’t think of any good reason to have all of those license plates. If this were a super old cargo van, I would say that maybe he just let his old license plates accumulate in the back over the years, but this is a NEW van. This means that he definitely INTENTIONALLY PUT all of those license plates in there after he recently bought the van. What could be the motive for that?

The first time she talked to the police, they told her to call them again if she saw the man again or if she had any more info. So she called them today and told her that she saw him again, where he was, as well told them all about the multiple license plates stored in the back of this brand new cargo van. The dispatcher responded that they couldn't take any action based on that kind of info, which honestly makes sense, but also kind of seems like the beginning of so many real-life horror stories just before someone goes missing for good. My girlfriend is staying at my place again now, for the foreseeable future. 

Are we just being overly paranoid? Does this seem reasonable? Is there any plausible explanation that could make everything about this story make sense? My girlfriend and I are trying to figure out next steps, including whether she should ditch her apartment for good and move somewhere else, where that man won’t be able to find her (preferably a large downtown apartment building which I feel would be much more secure). The only plan we have so far is that she’s going to go to the police station in person tomorrow to hopefully get a real conversation with somebody there. All inputs are appreciated.",06May2020,1
195,"The main reason why me and my ex boyfriend broke up was because of the army. His recruiter kept telling him not to get to close to anyone and ultimately, that’s what made him break up with me.

Well he went to take his physical today and the only thing he failed was the hearing test. Apparently he has to wear ear plugs whenever he’s around anything loud for the next week and then he has to go back.

I don’t know how to feel. I don’t want him to fail because it’s what he wants, but then again I feel my heart shattering. I care for him a lot and I’m pretty sure he feels the same. I keep going back and forth between wanting him to fail and wanting him to go, and I’m starting to feel awful. I feel so selfish!

198,"Im sorry if this is long, and it’s on my phone so I’m sorry in advance also if this comes out in a weird format

Me (20f) and my boyfriend (20m) have been together for 5 years. I am usually two hours away at college while he works full time and lives in his own apartment. This is usually how it is. However because of the situation, I came home for “summer break” pretty early so now we are only 10 minutes away. We always made the distance work no problem while I was at school, we would both visit each other pretty often, our relationship is amazing and healthy in just about every way I can think of. However I live with my grandparents while I’m home. So I’ve been taking quarantine and social distancing very seriously, mostly for their own safety. I only ever leave the house for essential things. I am fortunate enough to not have to work right now. So I only leave for grocery shopping basically. I have not been able to see my boyfriend for over a month because of this. He is an essential worker, and is at risk every time he goes in to work. We are really struggling with this.

I choose not to see him for the safety of myself and my family. Because while I miss him like crazy, I would hate to be the reason my grandparents get sick. We’ve been doing okay for the most part but today it hit us harder than usual. He’s been very lonely and depressed and I feel terrible I can’t fix it. We couldn’t even spend our 5 year anniversary together. (However we did have a beautiful Minecraft date that I think to be very memorable). He wanted me to move in with him so we could be together without risking my families health that way. But I’m not ready for that. I am a very practical person and tend to treat major life decisions like a business deal. I made a PowerPoint covering major topics that would need to be discussed before living together, and it states in the PowerPoint that we can not live together unless we are both working and making enough money to afford to pay 100% of the bills. Like I said before, I don’t work. So we can’t move in together because I’m uncomfortable financially depending on someone else, it just doesn’t seem fair to him. 

Then I suggested in order to see each other we should do safe activities such as: hiking, chilling in my backyard or walking around the track outside my house. These are things we could do at a distance and even wear masks or gloves if need be for precaution. We wouldn’t be able to show physical affection, but we could see each other and enjoy each other’s company. This didn’t sit well with him. He said it would be painful to be so close and yet so far that he couldn’t touch me, and that it would just put him in a bad mood and ruin the time we spent together.

So at this point I feel pretty defeated. We are trying to accept that we can’t see each other until the CDC or other health professionals deem it safe, and we know that could take a very long time. So what on earth could I do to make this easier on us? He’s not meeting me half way at all. I even offered to play games together earlier and he turned it down. Any advice?",06May2020,1

201,"NEW UPDATE FROM MY LAST POST:

I talked to Lexi about it and she was extremely supportive and it went better than I thought (thank you for your comments!). However, she wants consent from me to talk to Alex about what he did wrong. She says she sees him as a close friend and would feel conflicted staying friends with him knowing he didn't own up to his actions. I completely understand why she would want to do that and appreciate her even asking for consent. I don't know if I am comfortable with that though... I'm scared he's going to twist my words or say something to make himself look ""better"". BUT I also don't want to deny and say no because that might make me seem suspicious. I really don't know.  I'm honestly just scared of him because he's a liar, my rapist, and my ex-boyfriend... but to other people's eyes, he wouldn't do anything like that (Lexi also said she wouldn't have even imagined him doing this). 

Also, she asked me if she could let the others know and I said yes but there's a part of me that's worried she might not... She seems like a really good person but because of that trait, I feel like she might want to protect Alex's rep or something. They are close friends so I am a bit worried. 

When I told her about him trying to normalize it, she said that she's sure he knows what he said was messed up, or at the very least SHOULD know that's disgusting. I didn't get the chance to reply to this but he didn't apologize or do anything about his comment. I think it's because I didn't confront him about it since, at the time, I believed it was a ""me problem"". Should I address this?

LAST POST:
Hello, I (18F) was wondering about your opinion on this. 

some context but below is the reason\* 

Beginning of last summer, I was dating a 20-year-old boy (let’s call him Alex) and on our third month together, he fucked me while I was asleep. When I confronted him and asked him if he had sex with me when I was sleeping, he lied in front of my face over n over until I told him that I knew because my vagina hurt and there was a small rash from the friction between my skin and underwear. He THEN apologized after 20 minutes of lying to my face. When I asked him if he at least used a condom (i wasn’t on any contraceptions), he said YES.

I talked to my friends about what Alex did to me (something I didn’t do when I was raped before). They told me to give him a chance. Keep in mind that I was in Grade 11 in a first relationship talking with 17 years old friends. Dumbest mistake ever. After a few days, Alex and I talked. I didn’t quite say that I was giving him a chance because I explained how badly he hurt me. He apologized and cried again. I asked him, Why’d you lie to me? He just cried and said I didn’t want to lose you. I asked him again, did you use a condom? He replied NO. I was infuriated, apparently, Alex didn’t even remember or realize he lied to me and said he wore a condom. I snapped and said shit like tf was he going to do if I get pregnant. *thankfully I got my period* He also started making excuses for himself and started normalizing the situation. He said things like, “this happens in a lot of relationships. The guy wakes up with his girl riding.” DISCLAIMER I DID NOT GIVE CONSENT TO HIM DOING THINGS WHEN IM UNCONSCIOUS.

Moving forward, I told him I was willing to give a chance. We dated for 2 more months and our breakup wasn’t good but it wasn’t bad.

I think back then, I didn’t even realize how tainted I was. My mind automatically blocks out anything that was painful and on top of that, since my friends said to do it. I actually did think it was just a “me problem”. I didn’t realize the depth of this situation until recently.

REASON\* The reason why I want to talk to Alex’s friend (let’s call her Lexi) is because a day ago, Lexi and her friends have been advocating against sexual assault and rape. They were exposing this guy on Instagram. However, Alex also posted on his story about “how we need to protect the community from people like this.” This triggered my trauma and I want to tell Lexi that he’s the kind of person who didn’t even own up to what he did to me. The person who lied and tried to normalize it. The person who was going to KEEP lying until he was caught.

I want to talk to Lexi because I was deeply hurt and traumatized. He was my first boyfriend, someone I let in my life and someone who I thought I could trust. I also opened up to him that I was raped and sexually assaulted before. Him doing this just reopened a scar that wasn’t even fully healed yet. This is something that always haunted me and he knowingly and consciously put me back in that disgusting black hole. I don’t want to expose him to the whole world but I want to talk to someone about it and also warn them (like how Lexi and her friends are warning others).

Would that be weird to do? I met Lexi through Alex and we’re not too close but she’s a lot older than me and has much more insight on cases like this. She also helped us out during our relationship a lot so she knows a few of our issues (not this one though). I want to talk to someone who knows him (not out of a grudge or anything, to speak my story to someone who actually knows him).

Is that okay? What do you guys think?",06May2020,1
203,"Tbh, this is probably a dumb question because of everything that's happening, but I figured I'd get some different perspective so here I am.

 Some background: my BF and I have been casually looking at properties and houses for almost a year now. We are looking for something pretty specific, at least 5 acres with a ready-to-move-in house that's no more than about a half-hour drive outside the city and a large workshop/barn where my BF can build his camping trailers to sell. It's pretty hard to find, and it seems like everything we've found over the last year that we like gets snatched up almost instantly. So we've just been keeping an eye on the market.

Well, today I got a notification for a new listing and this place fits almost all our criteria. It's 10.5 acres, a beautiful spacious house that looks to not need any repairs, and a large barn work area where my BF can build his trailers. The criteria that it doesn't seem to fit is that it's further outside of the city than I would like, it's also kind of on the other side of where we were looking (we were looking at the south of the city, this is to the northeast) and also it is on the higher end of our budget. And I mean, those missing criteria aside, is it really a good time to be buying a house?? With the COVID-19 thing happening, we may not even get a chance to view the house in question and we kinda don't like the idea of putting an offer in on a house and property that we can't actually go to see. 

Still, it fits most of what we are looking for and it's really frustrating to constantly look at a house, love it, then lose it because someone else jumped on it before us. And we might be able to do like a skype tour of at least the house, though I don't know if it'd really give us a better idea than the posted pictures of what the house is like. 

So I guess my overall question is: Should we bother with buying this house rn? Or any house really.

Again, sorry if this seems just like a really dumb question.",06May2020,1

We live more or less than a hour away from each other, but we've only been together irl twice. Tho we talk almost 24/7 through text.

I suffer a lot with anxiety and she has always helped me a lot with it, but that anxiety as gotten between us before, I've always been really afraid of committing so I never allowed myself to tell her how I really feel. She as already told me before she liked more than just as a friend, but I didn't say the same simply because I was scared shitless and I really thought I wasn't ready for a relationship, it'd be my first relationship... And truth be told, I don't want to screw it up.

The real reason I haven't told her yet is because I'm just afraid that I'd freak out and disappear along with my insecurities. I'm just afraid it will be weird since we barely see each other irl, we do have long meaningful talks... but through text it's just easier,  I wouldn't know how to behave along side her in the real world...

Immediately, my anxiety went off the charts. This has happened many times in the past. 
(Note: I’ve set aside my problems, feelings, and issues to help him only to find out through his girlfriend that he had never wanted my help in the first place and I have only been wasting my time and making him even more stressed by venting to him, all due to his lack of communication with me.)
His girlfriend also insulted me over text after asking if John was feeling alright, and if there was already I could do to help him. 
I have blocked his girlfriend due to her unreasonable amounts of jealousy towards me and her overall rudeness. I didn’t block John just I did unfollow him and move him to my general chats instead of primary (insta), in case he ever wanted to talk to me after a while or vice verse. I still love and care for him deeply. 
But I’ve made the conscious decision to keep my distance for a while and try to detach myself from him. 
So, does any have any advice for coping methods? Whether it be for clinginess, anxiety, or grief any advice is welcome. 

TD;DR: Friend I’m rather clingy to was being very distant and his girlfriend was being a dick to me for asking what was wrong. Found out he never wanted my help and I was actually stressing him out, though he never cared to tell me this. Has now cut him and gf off from my life for a bit. I need some healthy coping methods for anxiety, clinginess, and grief.",06May2020,1

217,"I have been trying to lose weight lately just because it’s a healthy thing to do. I’ve made a lot of progress and I’m really proud of myself. People have been noticing and that’s great, I feel great. 

Since I started around two months ago I have lost about 25 pounds. Im 6ft tall, 18, a little overweight, and a guy so I’m sort of the best possible demographic in terms of losing weight right now. The weight was just sort of melting off and it was great. But I’ve reached a plateau. Every single morning I weigh in at about 184.6 pounds. Then when I go to bed I always weigh 186.4 pounds... exactly. No matter how much I exercise or how much I eat I can’t get past this point. I feel like I’m just focusing on the negative right now, I’ve made serious progress and a couple weeks ago I would have killed to weigh this little. But it’s hard not to want to keep going. I guess the advice I’m seeking is do you guys know any tips to sort of get the payload in motion again? Just little things I can do that will jump start the progress again.

TL;DR: I’m a guy whose been losing a lot of weight lately but I’m stuck at a plateau right now. Any tips for getting the numbers moving again.



Also I recognize that it’s night time here in the States and I might get a lot of Non-Americans reading this so in the metric system I weigh about 83 kilos. Idk if that helps or anything.",06May2020,1

220,"This is about one of my coworkers.. anyways

I been with this company for 4.5 years. He hasn’t even been with them for over 6 months.

My husband knows this coworker of mine. They went to one of these programs years ago to get work experience to build up a resume. My coworker wanted to add us both on facebook. We accepted.

Then my coworker wanted me to add his girlfriend (she doesn't have many female friends according to my coworker). I only added her because I remember her from middle school and she remembered me.

2 weeks later my mom asks me “how do I know this girl”. I told my mom that she is my coworkers girlfriend and I knew her from middle school. Mom then tells me she isn’t comfortable with me knowing her because my mom is her therapist and shes my moms client. Mom mentions she can get in trouble with her boss now. During all of this my coworker asked me if I knew this person (he said my moms name) and I didn’t know how to respond because my mom is upset I know him and his girlfriend because of her job. A few weeks later both my coworker and his girlfriend go to therapy and my coworker asks my mom about me!!! My mom texts me later on all angry but then says she had a talk with the both of them. ( i had no idea that my mom had this girl as a client in the first place and second my coworker shouldn’t be going around asking people if they know me while his girlfriend is in therapy or asking me if i know my mom. He put me in a bad position)

They still had me added on facebook but readded me when they both created new pages (i did accept again). I am not sure if Mom said something to my coworker again because I noticed recently he deleted both my husband and I off his friends list. However his girlfriends request is still pending as i never accepted it yet..(mom blocked her as she doesnt want clients to find her on facebook. I don’t know if she realizes her client made a new page)

I did notice that other coworkers I have added still have him on their friends list. What should I do when I return to work? Ignore him? He put me in a bad spot with making my mom mad about this like I had control over it. It is bugging me when I know it shouldn’t.",06May2020,1

My girlfriend has dated four guys before me, only one of which was a serious relationship. My dad is supportive and just doesn’t want me to rush into anything with her because it’s my first real relationship. I understand my mom’s concern but if I’m happy why would I keep looking?

223,"I'm going to try and sum this up as much as possible, I've been a forklift operator for about 6 months at a privately owned dairy company. About a month or so ago, a new line ""lead"" took over on my shift and has made my work life a living hell, here's a list of what all of the shitty things he has done but haven't been reported due to lack of evidence.

- Doesn't wear any PPE on the floor (can't have any cameras or phones on floor)
- Sits on his ass all night and tells me to hurry up (every other line lead I've worked for has never sat down that much, also if we're so busy, come help asshole)
- I'm not happy, I make almost $20/hr with great benefits but it still isn't worth going through this every day.
- Makes fun of me about my height (I'm 5'3"" he's about 6'4"")
- Argues with the production line leads when they ask to bring me up to production to help out (again, he can get off his ass and do his job for once)

I'm sure there's more, but honestly I think I've brought up enough, however, I just recently got a attendance violation which prevents me transferring jobs within the plant for 120 days. I don't know whether to just walk or try and bring it up to HR but we're already so short staffed and there's not really anyone to take his position over. What do I do...?

225,"I am still talking to this dude online nowadays who lives 4 hours from where I live in NJ. It’s probably been almost 2 months texting him. 

The first instance he asked me for money before the end of April was for a “soccer ball.” 
( He had let me know he had a job before the COVID- situation had ruined things.)

Anyways, told me the ball was only $10.00. I couldn’t give him money since I was laid off way back in March. 

( I filed for unemployment recently and got direct deposited money and didn’t want him to know.) 

He said it was okay but then forward to last week of April I was notified by him many times that week he was going to pay me back in 2weeks if I gave him money( only $15).  I was suspicious cause I probably know he has no job and he smokes also ( money to buy smokes?)  

I’m a nice person I could just send him the $15 and go about my day and say no afterwards unless he pays me back. It’s been past his bill due date 
( I am aware it is not my problem ) 

and I see he’s still answering me on Snapchat which I thought he wouldn’t be able to have access to his phone services.

Note: this dude I’ve talked too is pretty decent and we’re probably meeting up after quarantine or in the future but idk his true intentions. He states his parents won’t pay for his phone bill or his friends won’t help him out so I was his only option I suppose.

I’m half “Ashkenazi” and I didn’t even know that was the term for it before I did a DNA test a few years ago (before I knew all the trouble about them so oh well.) Honestly before that, I knew I was “half Jewish” but the meaning behind that is so convoluted. 

To some people, I’m Jewish and to some I’m not. I saw a post somewhere the other day where people were arguing wether or not being “Jewish” is a race and saying Jews aren’t white. Why aren’t these things common knowledge, why isn’t the word Ashkenazi well known as a race? Why have I myself, been confused about who I am on a genetic level my whole life? Why is there so much debate around this?

i have moved out of my parents house for a few years now, and with the covid-19 thing happening they’ve been asking me to move back in since my university classes have switched to online learning. 

my parents are not bad parents, but they do bring out the worst in each other. i lived my whole childhood in a toxic household because of their constant fighting. i also went through a bit of “emotional abuse”, i use quotations cause my parents did have their ups and downs, and us kids went up and down with them. it wasn’t perfect but they gave us what they could. 

anyway, before i moved out i barely had an identity of my own, my self esteem was at an all time low and i had an eating disorder; also due to bullying i experienced in school growing up. when i started living on my own therefore having to be independent, i discovered my own interests, i became exposed to a whole new world, i started dating, i left my religion, i got my heart broken... etc. that has made me into a whole different person, a person who has a long way to go but i still have improved a lot. and a lot of that i think is due to the fact that i was able to separate myself from my family. i’m a highly sensitive person, and living in a household where tensions were often high really messed with my head. having that peace and tranquillity while i am alone is what i needed. my parents have calmed down in the few years i haven’t been living with them and fights have became less frequent too, but if i do move back in i cannot be my full authentic self. i have the tendency to put their needs above my own, and for the sake of my self development i need to stay independent. how can i explain this to them in a way where they won’t take it personally? i’ve fought them on it so many times but they keep bringing up traditional family values and shit like that. stuff that i personally do not believe in, but just cause they believe it they won’t accept my personal view.

238,"So, my brother and sister in law had twin boys in August of 2018. So right now they are a year and 8 months old. They have another kid on the way. But I don’t know if they are fit for kids tbh. My sister in law wants 7 (maybe even more), but my brother wants 3, but even with those two kids, they don’t really take care of them and my sister in law barley even takes care of the one inside her (smokes like two cigs every two days which isn’t a lot, but in the end, it can cause some issues with my niece). Luckily nothing happened with my two nephews, they’re both really smart and catch onto things fast, and I’m hoping that’s how it is with my niece. Okay, sorry I’m rambling. So, they feed my nephews whenever my brother or SIL are feeling hungry, it’s rare that they feed my nephews on a set schedule. They also have lived with me and my mom for a year (in April), so I’ve seen all of their parenting habits, when my mom went to go pick them up, she found my nephews drinking water in their bottles and not milk like a normal infant would have and they had pneumonia. Their house was a mess and they kept my nephews in a crate for basically all day (sometimes they would take them out). Another thing is that they never take my nephews outside, they always wait for my mom or I to take them outside but (before this whole virus thing happened) we would always be working, sometimes I would have to work a double (I’m 17, so this and school plus sports was taking a toll on me, I wouldn’t get home until 1 AM sometimes so by then my nephews were asleep). Now, thanks to this virus I don’t work and I’m able to take them out more but even when my brother and SIL go outside to smoke, they don’t take them out in the backyard so they can run around and get tired. They always get angry at my nephews for crying or “being spoiled” is how they say it. They also get angry whenever my nephews don’t go to sleep but how do they expect them to go to sleep if they keep them in the same room every day barley letting them go outside? I just don’t know what to do. They’re moving out this weekend and I honestly feel afraid for my nephews, I want to call CPS on them but I don’t know if I’m old enough or even have enough evidence to show that they’re bad parents or if that’s even the first step to take. Of course I wanna wait a few weeks to make sure that my nephews are safe and I will ask for photos to make sure no bruising is going on. I just don’t know what to do, we tried to have a civil convo with my brother about what he should do and what he should do more often (bring the kids outside more, backyard of course, feeding them on a set schedule, not getting as angry at them) but ironically enough, my brother would get mad and start calling us names (which is why they’re moving this weekend, because my mom has enough as this was happening since they came to live with us, my brother disrespecting us).

240,"My (25F) mother (43) has been having some wild symptoms starting back in October. She has been an on and off drug abuser for a large part of my life, with her choice drug being prescription pain pills. She has suffered a lot of trauma in her life time, and minus some narcissism issues and some kleptomania, she is a fairly good person. A mother, a wife, a friend, a grandmother. After going on months of adderall binges and abuse, she had an experience frighten her where she was *possibly* caught by a co-worker selling adderall to another co-worker. This is a big no-no, especially as she is a healthcare worker. This experience, started a downhill spiral of psychosis. She left my father, who has been beside himself with having no idea what to do. He’s a wreck right now and has been for months. She believes that cops all over my state are stalking her and monitoring her every move. She believes that she is living her version of The Truman Show and that everyone wears contact lenses with cameras in them. She believes that she has a whole bunch of fans that communicate to her through YouTube video suggestions, and sits in her car for hours doing a weird dance and singing (quite horribly I might add) at the top of her lungs, in which she calls ‘performing for her fans.’ 

She believes we are all out to get her. That we are enemies. She hides knives all over the house. She comes home with bruises on her arms from ‘swinging on swings’.’ I could seriously go on. My dad and I are at the point where we are fearing for her life and ours, as she is so unpredictable at this point. As of right now, she is in a hospital with a 72 hour hold, which I am praying to god will lead her to being institutionalized so she can get the help she needs. We are seriously afraid for our lives and hers. We have no idea where to go from here. I have no idea how to process any of this. To process the mother who I’ve pretty much deemed as gone since her mental health hit bottom at the end of October. To process the grandmother that literally abandoned her grand daughter to play this game in her head. To process my father being the weakest and most broken and beaten down I have ever seen him. I know this is something she may not have chosen for herself, and mental illness is a bitch, but this is all so outrageous I don’t know how to feel.

We remained close even after we broke up if not better and he moved on and found a girl he’s head over heels for, and when the year began she joined our school.

if I’m honest I was a little worried because she was so pretty I naturally assumed she’d be a bit self centred (keep in mind I overthink everything) but when I met her she seemed super kind and genuine and we really hit it off and we became close friends but things started becoming weird once me and my ex started chatting a lot during school, one night she called me and told me she was having dark thoughts,she had previously told me about her battle with anorexia,anxiety and depression so I immediately did my best to comfort her, she then started calling me often which I didn’t mind at first, until she started telling me about her relationship and it’s problems.

Being her friend naturally I listened but gradually the tone started shifting, she would talk about the fact he doesn’t FaceTime her as much anymore and that he would tell her that he was going to bed but still be on his phone. During this time he would also message me and voice his worries about the relationship and that fact he was dealing with some personal issues whilst trying to juggle a relationship. 

One night in particular was weird, my ex had been messaging me about how he was struggling and this went on till pretty late at night, suddenly I get a message from her saying can I call you and obviously I said yes, so she calls me and starts telling me about how her boyfriend has gone to bed and he hasn’t talked to her all day then out of nowhere she says “I know he’s probably messaging you” “ I’m not bothered” but it wasn’t in any kind of tone she said in a kind of friendly manner but something about it made me feel guilty like I was the problem. After this the only time she ever called me was to voice her worry about her relationship and every call had this undertone of me being the problem. 

Following this they took a break and got back together after week and it seemed like everything was getting better then a couple of weeks later I get a call and she tells me she been having breakdowns and panic attacks the entire week because she thinks her bf is going to leave her for me and I’m not going to lie this kind of fucked me mentally because I was causing her all this pain just by my friend , a dude I’d know since the beginning of school.

Sometimes these emotions, sadness, hopelessness or even stress just flow over me and I can’t do anything about how my body will react to it.

Instead I just have to lay down and try to prevent myself from hyperventilating while I sob. The harder I try to get a hold of myself, the more I lose control.

I’ve felt intense loss lately and it’s difficult to hang out with people without tearing up. A thought will pop up in my head and I just can’t help but to cry.

My problems are always the same, my friends are probably tired of hearing me talk about how I once again self sabotaged the good things in my life.  I don’t want to burden anyone with my sadness, make them worry about me, and because I am repulsed by my own vulnerability I don’t reach ouch. Besides the only person on this earth who knows how to calm me down is no longer with me. 

How do I become in control of my emotions, so that I can overcome them. I want to be happy.",06May2020,1

249,"My (24M) girlfriend (26F) broke up with me a couple weeks ago. We were in a long distance relationship and she said before we became romantic that she doesn’t like LDRs but then she developed feelings for me and said that I was worth it. We dated for a few months before she started acting off for a couple weeks and then broke things off. 
Now 2 weeks later I still can’t seem to get over that I was no longer worth it. We had a talk 2 months in about how hard LDRs were but we both knew the other was worth it. And 2 months later...I wasn’t worth it anymore. She made me so happy and we had such an amazing time together and I just don’t understand how that could be thrown away.",06May2020,1
250,"This started back in September when I realized I feel in love with someone. I really did love them, but they didn’t return my feeling...which of course I’d be fine with it only they hadn’t given my false hope, that person was flirting with me, saying that they might like me only for them to say they didn’t. Whatever I guess. We stayed as friends which that itself was enough for me. A few months pass the very end of January was our last “normal” conversation. We stopped talking she ghosted me. Our very last messages were back in March. It’s been about 2 months and I still can not get over her, no matter how hard I’ve tried, she does leave my mind and it’s driving me insane. I still love deep down but I also hate her, I hate her so much. Now I’m scared it’s seems that I refuse to fall in love again in fear of getting hurt. I’m so scared, I’ve done everything to prevent myself from falling in love. I pushed most people away, I’ve become cold, heartless, etc. I’ve been think of the worst things, why can’t I stop myself from falling in love?, will I ever have the ability to love again “freely?” What should do?",06May2020,1

254,"We both come from conservative, Christian families. We don’t follow in those footsteps. I (M) recently had an argument with my mother about how abortion has nothing to do with the man since he’s making the least sacrifice - long before we discovered that I could potentially be a parent.

My partner (F) has spoken to her mother about the fact that she’s pregnant and her mother is pushing her to keep it. The thing we’re trying to avoid is the extreme mental and physical toll at this point in her life, and I support her 100% in this decision. I didn’t push one way or another, I just want to support and provide as much calm, rational thought as I can for her because no decision in either direction is easy for a woman to make.

She doesn’t want to lie and tell our parents that she miscarried or something. She wants to be honest, and I think that’s a good policy. But I also don’t want to blow up with our family if we don’t have to.

255,"My mom attempted a suicide and was in the hospital for 2 months when I was 18. My dad is very poor and I couldn't go take a 3 hour ride to see her, I didn't drive and he also was in contact with the doctors, telling me how it's better for her not to have visitors (he was probably trying to protect me as he saw how affected I was and still am about it, taking sedatives, antidepressants, have been through hell and back pretty much). Meanwhile, a very shitty relative who my mom hasn't spoken to most of her life lived close to the hospital, went there to tell her how her daughter sucks, how I'm probably ashamed of her (that made me extremely mad) and was contacting the whole family on my moms side to inform them of all of this. They all live very very far away but we were all always close. They never thought of calling me personally to ask me, except one of them attacked me on facebook during that period, when I didn't understand the severity of what was going on behind my back. It's been few years since, of me trying to heal myself from that and many other hardships I endured, along with helping my mom accept that she needs help which she refuses to as she is dealing with a severe illness. Recently I found out how they all have been talking behind my back, calling me a selfish cow, an entitled princess for going to university and not taking care of my mom (mind you, there is no need for that as I have more siblings and my dad), and various other lies they have heard from that crappy relative. I relapsed completely after finding out and are really shocked. It's mostly me who they are collectively attacking. Maybe I would be able to understand if they asked for my side of the story before reaching a conclusion and spreading lies, without ever contributing themselves to help my mom or anything.

I’m smelling her vagina. I used to think when I would go to the bathroom after her she was on her period cause that’s when the scent was the absolute strongest and nauseating. She was telling me how she’s just been emotional the past two days so I took the opportunity to ask if it was that time of the month. She goes on to tell me, no I won’t be due for that in another week or so. I know I’m not the only one who can smell it. We work in a small area with about 12 people. Should I tell her she needs to be looked at? I know it’s rude as hell to say something like that.

How can I improve my physical appearance? I’m not saying personality doesn’t matter but usually guys are more visual than women and physical appearance matters a lot to them.

264," 

I can't believe what just happened, and I'm ashamed- which is why I'm using an alternate account.

I would like to preface this by saying that my family is in no means abusive. My dad doesn't drink, and the last ""physical fight"" that I can vaguely remember is probably when he grabbed me hard by the arm when I was 11 or 12. I'm 18 now.

My dad, and quite frankly my whole family has been on edge recently probably from this whole COVID thing going on and being trapped inside. I went into my work (an athletic club) for a few hours today to help move some gym equipment around to prepare for reopening in a few weeks. My dad comes home, in what at first seems like a good mood and asks what I did at work today, so I explained it to him (side note: I was in a good mood too, I was happy to explain to him anything he asked, and I was even going to ask if he wanted to go on a bike ride with me). After I explained what I did, he asked follow up questions about something about my work that was completely unrelated to what we were just talking about. I understood the questions and answered in a confusing tone because I didn't understand what the context was for him asking those questions. I was genuinely confused about what he was talking about. In an annoyed tone, he then says: ""Fine I guess I'm just going to a get yes or no answers from you and you can't give me a complete sentence."" I tried explaining that I was very confused about what was going on, but he wasn't having it. He accused me of being rude and disrespectful, as well as for playing dumb with his questions. At one point he even made an analogy of me being like a corrupt politician who uses dumb phrases like ""I don't recall"" or ""I don't know"".

TL;DR for the last part: Basically a pleasant conversation turned sour when I misunderstood what my dad was asking me so he accused me of being disrespectful.

We had a long verbal fight where he eventually took my phone (which is fine because he paid for it) and kept accusing me of playing dumb and being disrespectful. I kept firing back trying to defend myself and I did so in a way that was actually disrespectful now because in my mind (and I still think this) I was right. Usually, when he gets pissed off at me I actually did something wrong so I don't escalate the fight but this time I was escalating it and accusing him of basically being stupid because he was arguing over a misunderstanding and I thought I was right. He told me to go upstairs, so I did, but my mom continued the argument on my side so I walked back downstairs (which was a mistake). We had more verbal arguments and he's basically yelling at this point and he reveals that he actually wasn't in a good mood by saying something along the lines of: ""I WORKED ALL DAY TRYING TO HELP KEEP ALL THESE SMALL BUSINESSES FROM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, AND THE WHOLE THING IS STRESSFUL AND I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH YOUR BS RIGHT NOW."" So basically, although he still hasn't admitted it, he came home already in a sour mood but tried to mask it. He was stressed out.

The argument continues and I swear to god I was standing my ground harder than I ever had in an argument ever before. He keeps telling me to go away because he wants to eat dinner. He gets up, walks towards me, and grabs my arm. I push it away, firmly telling him to not touch me. He grabs me again and slaps my face. Game over. I grab both of his arms and wrestle him, pushing him back towards a wall. He pushes me back so I shove him away. He comes back towards me so I shove him again. My mom is screaming in the back. At this point, I realized in my head that my father had just slapped me for the first time ever and I responded by physically fighting him. I turned around and went upstairs, and said something like ""Wow, I bet hitting your son felt good.""

Once upstairs I overheard my parents talking/arguing, with my dad trying to explain his case to my mom, justifying himself, and then turning her to his side. He basically said that I'm not getting my phone back for a long time, blah blah blah whatever,

Here's my problem: I don't care about my phone. It's important and sucks because it's how I communicate with people for school, as well as managers. But I can do that through my computer What is important is college. I cannot pay for college by myself and I will heavily rely on my parents next year. You would think this shouldn't be a problem because eventually we will make things right and life goes on. I don't think it's that simple because I don't plan on apologizing. After all, I don't think I did anything wrong. He has a trait of NEVER admitting he's in the wrong. I've watched for years how various family members have arguments with him, and even when he's wrong he NEVER apologizes and NEVER admits that he was wrong. So, if I'm not going to apologize, and he's not going to, then therein lies our problem. I'm not going to ""man up"" for this one. I'm done with the bullshit. If this continues I don't think he's going to pay for my higher education. If it comes to that, I'm fully prepared to just walk down to the armed forces recruiting office down the street, but I'd rather not because I know my mom would flip out.

What should I do? Keep in mind the difference in this scenario than a lot of other ones. We have no history of physical fighting or abuse, and this just happened out of nowhere. The fact that was fought with our fists is what makes this so complicated because it's never happened.",06May2020,1

I will be working in my research lab entirely alone for the next several months and won't really be able to talk to anyone except exchanges via email at the beginning and end of my day... And I'm kind of a social guy. So I'm concerned not having anyone to talk to (even through Zoom or phone calls) will be detrimental to my mental health very quickly. 

Other things I'm looking for advice about, what about having a beer or something after I get home from work. It feels... idk, wrong to be drinking at 8 in the morning. But it helps to unwind. Especially when I don't have anyone to talk to. It feels like a punishment to not be able to drink anything at all during this.

My mom(37f) is the most amazing woman I have and ever will meet. She's a single mother with 4 kids. Therefore, there was and still is a lot of pressure on her. She did the best she ever could to provide for all of us and she has done a good job. Maybe too well as we are entitled spoiled brats. We always grew up in a loving home. We were dirt poor but I wouldn't trade it for the world because we are happy. She never had luck sith dating. My older sister(17f), my younger brother(13m), and I(15f) are the result of one man that she left when I was three due to the constant cheating and neglegance of his kids(us). Then she had another child with another man with whom she is no longer with. This resulted in my youngest sister(11f). She has been dating this guy for years now(idk how many) but they are always either arguing or acting like the happiest couple alive. As of recently they atopped sleeping in the same bed. She has taken over the living room couch while he takes the bed. In fact I haven't seen him in a couple of days. She has been drinking a lot recently and spending most of her days outside drinking. I am scared she's realizing she's going to die soon as she is going to furn 38 on the 21st of May. She has a history of smoking. Started when she was 12 and didn't stop until about 3 years ago. She doesnt seem the same, I feel like somethings wrong with her maybe she's going through depression. We talk to her and she refuses to tell us whats wrong. I can't help but imagine the worst. I don't want to lose my mom. I can't imagine a life without her. My only dream is to take care of her when she grows old but I'm scared that isn't going to happen.

The conversation goes exactly as follows. 

Her: ""and WHY do you post this for everyone to see? my hips and lower back are hurting, but I don't announce it.""

Me: ""It's Facebook. People post stuff like that all the time. If it bothers you, scroll past. No need to be rude.""

Her: ""I just thought of our conversation about change. not being rude...just honest. later""

Me: ""Okay... I disagree. But that's okay. Later""

Her: ""doing what you have always done brings the same results. doing something different brings change. ""

Me: ""Okay? You're not making any sense. I don't see the connection here.""

Her: ""you told me you were working on change.. that's the connection""

Me: ""I am. Just not sure what it has to do with this. I don't see anything wrong with sharing this. I'm in pain. Just thought I'd share. I was hoping to get some suggestions for relief. Lots of people don't care. But some do! I for one don't mind hearing other people post about things like this. I figure if people don't like it, it's extremely easy to keep scrolling and move on. I honestly am working on trying to change a lot of things about myself. But this isn't connected to anything I'm trying to change. I think that sometimes you read to deep into my posts. That's okay! I know you're concerned about me. That means a lot. I appreciate your help. But I really do not understand why this was wrong.""

All she did was sad react it instead of helping me to understand. So I was hoping you guys could explain to me why I'm wrong. 

I also feel like she wants me to become  become totally, always-happy, no negativity at all, constantly smiling person. That's not me. I feel like she wants to change everything about me and that hurts. I agreed to change to become healthy. Not change who I am. She says she loves me, but I don't feel it. I feel like I'm a project to her. 

How can I keep her happy enough to get her help without making myself miserable?

272,"Last summer I fell in love with a guy named Joel. Since I’ve had a bad past with relationships It’s been hard for me to feel love and attraction towards someone, and Joel was the first guy to spark emotion in me in a long time. Sadly though Joel wasn’t over his ex and he told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship but still wanted to be friends. I respected him for his honesty, but since I felt a lot more for him than “friends” I proceeded to cut him off and tried to get over him. We didn’t speak for about 9 months, besides a DM he sent me on ig telling me he loved me which I replied back to.

Long story short, we talked again for about 2 weeks and he asked me to go over to his house  multiple times. But since he kept asking me to come on such short notice and I live a city away from him, I kept turning him down. I slowed down on texting him thinking and expecting he would try a bit harder to make actual plans with me... Until last night when he sent me a video of him kissing a random girl... which really upset me. I deleted him from Snapchat and deleted his number. Then I get a text message from him today asking “are u mad?” which I didn’t reply to.

What on earth should I do? Why would he do this? I’m almost positive he was trying to make me jealous, but still, why? Any advice or feedback would be very much appreciated. Thank you.",06May2020,1
274,"Don’t call me an asshole for asking such a stupid question because I’m being dead ass. I’ve always had trouble comprehending things, even the most basic at times, BUT at the same time I’m very quick on my feet and have superb memory. Every time me and my family, or if im at school, WHEREVER i am at i can pick up on littlest details and remember things once and never have to hear/ see it again. 

For a family example: Everytime we play games or if my mom asks me to memorize a number they always go to me. If anyone forgets where they had their doctors appointment i can tell them, or where they last put something 9/10 i always know. When it comes to myself now thats a different story 💀 Maybe 6/10 for remembering things of my own, but besides that my brain responds so quick it annoys people at times. I’m also the same way when it comes to texting, or responding to whatever someone says. Most times i have to force myself not to reply so fast so I don’t seem clingy or weird. 

###If i met you at Walmart and you told me your name, 10/10 if see you again than I’ll 100% be calling you by your name. Or if i traveled some place i never been before i can remember the routes we took to get there, and how we can get out of it. If i seen a phone number i needed to write down but didn’t have my phone, or a piece of paper, hours later I’ll still remember it. Or the name of a song, literally anything and when it comes to smaller details that’s where I’m the best

My mind always has plans from 
a-z when it comes regular life things but i mean my mind is like that ***for everything***. Most times i scare people because they think I’m nuts or psychotic meanwhile I genuinely can pick up on things fast and remember them automatically

I want to be a Paramedic/ Firefighter when I’m old enough, plus do other things on the side obviously but being in the medical field has been a dream job of mine since i was 9. I’m 16 now and haven’t looked back yet on those dreams and i highly won’t. And for a medical field example or just an everyday one, ***every time i see something bad going down my brain automatically goes into scanning mode. I see my surroundings, i think of how i can help, or what i should/ shouldn’t do. Which route is more smarter and safer basically without me getting hurt or others.*** I’m not trying too sound like a superhuman but you could ask me anything , ask my family/ friends how i am and they’ll all annoyingly tell you I’m correct. I’m not trying to be an asshole either, I’m genuinely curious about this and wanted to share for feedback cause most times i feel ashamed since I’ve always been told to shut up or not to be like that. Embarrassed? Not really just like maybe i could not be like this? Idk its weird but i just want to have this sorted out so I’m not on my EMS journey having second thoughts all because of how my brain operates

277,"(On mobile) I don’t know if it’s relevant, but for some background, I (19F) have already had therapy for different issues when I was about 14 and 15, and have sought it out again through my university my first semester. 

Recently, I’ve had borderline-obsessive thoughts about past traumatic(?) experiences, and things that still bother me from when I was younger that never were talked about when I first received therapy (because that wasn’t exactly what I was there for). 

It’s very difficult for me to approach my mom about things that bother me, and even more so with things like this. I hate worrying her, I don’t like any kind of confrontation, and I feel that the things I’m having trouble with aren’t dire enough for me to get immediate treatment. 

Another thing to add is that I live in a small, rural town. The only therapist I’ve heard that practices here is someone that my mom and I know, so that would definitely be a no-go for me. My only other options would be to go to the city that’s an hour away, and money isn’t tight or anything, but I feel like I would be a burden if I asked. 

How do I approach her about this? And what would be the best way to handle it?",06May2020,1

279,"Disclaimer: This might be a small issue but as a student it means quite a bit of money to me.

So, I am a student studying in a foreign country and recently had to return due to the Covid-19 situation. I had to buy a separate ticket as the airline and agency were unable to reply and change flights for me in time.

I bought a return flight from agency ""cheaptickets"" since it made more sense to me as a student as i do know my start and end date of my school year. So basically i have already flown my first half of my flight in January and due to the Coivid-19 the return flight has actually been canceled by the airline itself. Since i bought it from the agency, the airline would not help me with my situation.

However, after waiting for 1.5 months for a reply from the agency, they only send me one line `""Please be informed airline does not allow any refund in case of partially flown`."" no other help or alternatives. I requested help from the airline again about such situation and suggestions that i can bring up to the agency and yet the airline told me to contact the agency without any follow up whatsoever. Right now, it has been 8 days since i asked the agency for any suggestions as well.

Furthermore, i have went online to search for the refund policy of the airline and i found this

`""If a ticket has been partially used, the difference between the purchased price and the applicable fare for the flown journey, minus any applicable charges and taxes, is refunded.""`

Is there anything i can do?",06May2020,1

285,"A year or so ago, I was pretty close with my entire friend group. I might go as far as saying I was what held it together, as I was always helping people and resolving conflicts that arose. I was also always the level-headed one.
A lot of people in my friend group started dating each other. Which I'm not envious of, I am very asexual, but those that did seemed like they kind of seperated from the group.
Then I kind of had an emotional breakdown and left for a while. No one even bothered reaching out to me or trying to help, even though I'd dedicated like years worth of time trying to ensure they were all okay.
When I came back people stopped talking to me really, and I kept trying to hold everyone together and it didn't seem like I was getting anywhere.
Even my best friend whom I literally would have died for kind of started ignoring me. I'm not sure what I did to solicit this, none of them act angry or avoid me, just no one I know seems interested in being around me anymore, and they all seem so happy around each other.

On top of this, with my family, my younger sibling has expressed that he hates me, and my mother regularly tells me how useless she thinks I am. So, the only thing here I feel connected to is my older brother, who is essentially just nice to everyone.

I don't feel like I'm tied to anything or belong anywhere anymore. Part of me is screaming that I should disappear. For a while I kind of thought that meant I wanted to die, but I honestly like being alive.
I don't have enough money to afford and apartment, and with the pandemic I seriously doubt it would be wise to live on the streets. But, if I vanished entirely, no one in my friend group would even notice, and I sincerely doubt my family would notice. I don't want to stick around in a place where I don't belong.
Is there anywhere I can go to escape? Maybe somewhere I can just be alone? I don't want to always be around people who forgot I exist, I would honestly rather live in like the woods or somethubg.

I only have $200 in my account and no stable way of earning more. I don't think I could really go anywhere with that. But, if anyone knows if there's anything I can do, I would love to hear it.

Over the last few years, I have been teaching myself programming. Right now, I'm pretty confident with my abilities in JavaScript, Python, C#, and Java. If I had to pick something specific, I am best in NodeJS (if that information helps at all).
I really want to start being a lot more productive with my programming. I have a lot of small projects that have entertained some friends of mine in classes, and other projects to help me practice and understand concepts.

Now, I want to work on something that is worth my time, and something that could help me start earning money. Over the past few months, I have started a couple big projects, but ended up abandoning them. One in particular was going to be a game loosely similar to skribbl.io, but with my own original idea. The problem here was having to develop a system with multiple ""rooms"" and the hosting costs that come with them.

I thought this quarantine would be an amazing opportunity to get a lot of work done and be productive, but I am two months in without starting anything. I spend my days primarily watching youtube, helping around the house, and talking with some good friends of mine.

There have been occasions where I really wanted to start work on something, but I ended up distracting myself on youtube before getting any solid ideas. 

I understand this may not be a huge problem compared to other things on this sub, but if anybody has ideas on what could help me out then I would really appreciate that.",06May2020,1
290,"Throwaway account because my main is follows by people I know irl and I’d prefer them not to see. Also I’m on mobile so apologies in advance. 

Hey guys, so this is a very convoluted story, I’m going to try to present it in the best way I can, but I’m really sorry if it’s unclear. I’d really need an outsiders perspective. I just can’t make sense of things. Also, sorry but this is going to be a long one. 
 
First, a lot of background. I’m currently a 17 year old female. My mom and dad divorced when I was &gt;1 year old. He payed child support but was never *really* apart of my life. For a very long time, it was just my mom, my brother (3 years older), and I. 

And then my mom started to date, let’s call him, Rob. I can’t remember how old I was exactly- but I wasn’t in middle school yet- so 9 or 8. Rob was, to put it mildly, a strange guy. Here’s just some information to explain what I mean- my mom met him through our small, less than 200 people, church. He was the children’s minister. He had 3 sons around my age, and an older daughter, all from a previous marriage.... but here is where things get weirder. At a much later date I found out (from my step siblings and mom)  that he had a previous MARRIAGE to a member of our church and DATED another woman who goes to our church. His most recent wife was also a member of the church *and* he met my mom **through the church**. I also know he has had at least 3 other marriages (maybe more but I’m not sure).

But there’s more, my stepbrother told me the reason that his mom and Rob got divorced is because his mom thought Rob was cheating on her.... with my mom. I don’t think my mom would ever be the type to cheat (especially because my dad cheated on her).... but I do remember they started dating almost immediately after the divorce. 

My mom told my that my Robs most recent ex accused him of being emotionally and physically abusive but “she didn’t believe that”. Rob also has a history of alcoholism. Which I’ll talk more about later. 

But back to when they started dating, it started fine, I got along with his kids and all that jazz, he had his own house but would come over when his kids were with their mom. And then at some point, I can’t remember when, to be honest my memories of this time are super muddled, he got kinda weird. He just sorta began crossing boundaries I don’t think I was still 8 or 9, but he started just coming into my room. He didn’t knock (but my mom had a rule about no closed doors so I guess he couldn’t have). And he would sit on my bed when I was in it and talk to me. And then he went to laying in my bed when I was in it (I have a twin mattress, so not a lot of room). Sometimes I would come into my room and he would be laying in my bed already, I remember not wanting him to be there. I want to be clear, I never remember him touching me inappropriately. I don’t have memories of what it was like when he was laying down with me, but like I said it was a very small mattress and he is not a small man. So there had to be a contact, even if it was totally innocent. I also remember at least once my mom being in the room while we were laying together, and she didn’t seem concerned at all. 

He also really liked to scare me, he would put on a mask and hide outside a window, or crawl *underneath* my bed and then pop out to grab me. 

And there was this incident.... I’ve never told anyone about it, but I guess if I’m laying things out.  I started master bating at a young age, probably 10. (I blame this on the internet, I had wayyy too much free reign in that regard, and I specifically remember looking up what it was and how to do it on my own). But anyways, it was night, I was in my room doing my thing, it was dark, except for a dim lamp and my iPad (I told y’all, I started early), with my door slightly ajar (mom still had the rule). The hallway light was on. I saw a shadow pass and pause in the doorway. I freaked out, thinking I was gonna be caught. But then it passed and I heard my moms bedroom door open and shut. I thought I was clear and got back to it. And then my moms door opened again. Rob came into my room. I scrambled to turn off the iPad. He sat down on my bed, close enough that my feet touched his thighs. I had a blanket over me, but from the waist down I was bare. I was covered but I felt exposed. I just remember being scared. He asked me what I was doing. I told him I was watching videos on my iPad. And that’s all I remember. 

That is probably the most worrying story.... but I have to repeat, I don’t remember him actually doing anything. For all I know he could have just gotten up and left and I just have a shitty memory. But it’s weird, why did he come in my room in the first place? If he thought I was doing something bad why didn’t he ask to see my iPad? And why does this memory make me want to cry? 

Okay, and the last thing I have. His daughter. I’ll call her Maggie. Maggie is around 6 years older than me, and she apparently acted like a mom to my stepbrothers growing up. Whenever I was in middle school, my stepbrother opened up to me about Rob’s drinking problem. He told me how Rob was court ordered to not drink around his kids (an order he did not, and still does not, follow). He told me how Rob got super drunk once while they were fishing, and how he had to hide his keys because he refused to not drive. And he told me about how one time Rob got drunk and tried to “hug Maggie” and she got angry at him because of it. Maggie always seemed to have a good relationship with Rob, but once she went to college, she almost broke all contact with him, but she has come around once or twice. 

This information really upset me. I’m pretty sure that once I was in middle school, his weird boundary crossing stopped. But like I’ve been saying, my memory is really bad. But learning this information about Maggie and Rob really freaked me out. So in the summer of my 8th grade year (I was 13) I decided to live with my dad: it ended up not working out (but that’s a story for another time). And I moved back in with my mom a year later. I’ve been back for about 3 years, and basically Rob and I have ignored each other. He hasn’t done anything weird to me since I was a kid. He’s still a children’s minister; but I have to be honest, I really don’t think he’s doing anything to the kids. I’ve been in class with him, and there is honestly no time where he could do anything. 

But he still makes me feel bad. I hate looking at him. I hate when he looks at me. I hate how he smells (nicotine and vodka, covered with cheap cologne). I just hate him. But I don’t know if I have a reason to? I will repeat again; despite all of the other weird things he has done, I have absolutely zero memory of him touching me inappropriately. What do I do? Am I overreacting? If I’m not should I tell someone? I don’t have any actual evidence, and I don’t have anywhere else to go....",06May2020,1

292,"Looking for good advice.

Been working at job A for 10 years, decent pay, flexible hours, decent benefits and in a very cushy position. Spend most of my time supervising, tell people what to do then putter around on a forklift or do some oddjobs outside the warehouse. Averaged out including benefits and perks I'm making 27.40 per hour.

Was offered a job at job B through brother in law.(found out later he gets a 500 dollar finders fee)

Scheduled to meet the boss on a sunday as they say they're not as busy, figured we'd have a sit down or walk around and chat. He was too busy dealing with customers weighing in and out and doing cash transactions to have a decent conversation but thought I managed to get an idea of the job and pay, pretty straight forward work.
Had forgot to ask more about the extended health benefits in person but text him later to confirm.

So here's the texts when I ask to clarify everything

So he says
I can start you for sure but it has to be at the $20/hour as that's what I start my other guys at. There is a $5/hour premium on Saturday and a $8/hour premium Sunday and we pay 1.5x after 40 hours - if you work hard you will move up and get lots of hours

(Ok great, currently working the same hours without overtime or extra incentives on weekend. And we had discussed working it so sundays would be the overtime day, so 20 per hour for Wednesday Thursday Friday then 25 on Saturday the sunday overtime plus 8 so 38 per hour sundays. And room to grow, sounds great, so I'd be making right around the same per cheque on average less 20 cents per hour. Figured oh well, one raise and I'm ahead seems like a no brainer. )

So I say

Ok, do you have any extended health benefits plan?

(Current company I work at has a basic plan but I get alot out of it. Works out to about $3.50-4 per hour over the course of the year. So this could make or break my decision to leave comfort for bettering life for my family.)

He responds

Yes - as well as a $500 Health spending account for whatever you need- as well as we pay up to one week sick pay - we pay $150 a year to new work boots and we pay a year end bonus

(Okay first word says it all, worst case it's a basic plan worth about the same or it's better, figure I can't lose there. Plus 500 for any medical expenses that the company will cover receipts, cool! Chip in towards boots?? Awesome!! And bonuses are always great. So far I'm looking to be ahead, averages out to 27.20 if they have a similar basic plan, sounds great.)

So I give notice at my job, everyone's shocked and sad to see me go, but understand I have to do what's best for my family. Great bunch to work with.
 Worked my final 2 weeks, had a little pizza party at lunch my last day as a farewell and good luck. They will be missed.

So I go for my first day at job B go through the walk around, punch in here coveralls there signed tax papers and straight into a morning safety meeting. So far so good do the usual new guy stuff, here's some crappy jobs no one wants to do, have fun. Bang them all out and within my first few hours already they are struggling to find odd jobs for me. 
So they stick me on a lawn mower... get it ready to go before lunch they say... okay no problem, it's a flippin lawn mower (resume says forklift, tractor, and cat 950 loader with 3 yard bucket... 3 pieces of equipment I haven't run but sure I can... i mean it's pedals and levers not rocket science. Oh and a steering wheel, very important :D ""here's a lawn mower!"" Lmao, check oil new gas check spark plug. Alls good park it by the building and take lunch. Oh paid lunches I find out, SWEET!... boss man is bringing pizza?! COOL!

So i take this opportunity to ask exactly what the extended health package has to which the friggin owner who hired me on actually chuckled and says ""it sucks""
So I'm like well wtf?? That's not funny... Whatever, he's in a joking mood laughing with the guys.. got a few different stories, some people say there's extended health benefits others say it's a $1500 per year per employee health account just submit receipts to office... so yeah... my current benefits I use alot, it's worth between $6-8000 per year to me... others say it's just $500 so lots of vague answers... not impressed.

Pissed off I go out to mow the grass, woohoo!, mower I find out has about half a rivet holding the pull start assembly on.. great, well I get it going and mow away start running the numbers in my head and basically I'm making $3.30 less overall than expected. I'm pissed. Whatever, finish the day out... done mowing and still time left, so I'm off to find mr. Commander for next job. Pulling weeds, fantastic!... whatever, new guy right... bottom of the figurative scrotem pole as I would put it.

So end of day, I've calmed a little, figure I'll go into the office at the end and ask again.
So I ask to see a booklet showing what the plan covers. Can't produce anything but say it works out to be $500
I say per year? (Maybe it's a monthly thing, that's fine)
He says yup per year.
I say per family member or all together. . .
Just 500 per year...



So I think I got most of the info in there but basically I switched jobs for what was supposed to be equal compensation as what I'd worked 10 years and achieved, thought it was a good move, start off where your at currently and work your way up, seems logical.

 got screwed by brother in law for 500 bucks
And screwed by the company,
 no benefits
 Thursday through monday shift 

 neither weekend day is overtime as was discussed for my Wednesday through sunday shift before I gave notice at cushy supervisor job.

So basically i left an easy job for more labor intensive work so I can make $3-4 less per hour. What a slap on the dink...

My gut says to go back to job A tomorrow and slide right back into my spot and just let job B figure out I'm not coming back, doubt they'll even care... probably not the first to drop out after one day. 

My brain says calm down go in to job B tomorrow morning and rediscuss compensation and clarification, ask why I was lied to. 
Either I'll find out definitively if there's actually a benefit package and lifes good at job B, proceed up the scrotem pole
Or quit after one day, punch brother in law in the dink and just head back to job A to pick up where I left off and work the afternoon...
Or option 3 is see what else I can find that might be out there offering more and leave job B asap for job C

Agitated so I hope it made some sense...

Coincidentally, I get a call from AAA 30 minutes later from a rep asking me to repeat everything I had already told them that happened in the accident... because they needed to “investigate further.” Long story short, the rep (who was rude the entire call) told me the damage on the passenger door panel would absolutely not be covered since it “had to have been damaged before the accident.” I told her that I clean my car regularly and know every single mark/scratch on my car. The mechanic already fixed it since they approved the INITIAL quote with the door panel on it!!! I don’t know what to do. Mechanic said it’s around $800.

299,"I'm sorry for what is likely going to be a long post. These feelings have been building up in me so a long time.

I was not sure what subreddit would best fit my post but I guess I've settled on general advice. I will give a long backstory and a TLDR at the end. 

I am a 19 male in Minnesota USA actually now 20 as it is my birthday today . I hated life so much during high school, my dad was verbally abusive  to me and possibly physically abusive to my mom (I've never seen him hit her but I've seen him throw things at here like a hammer, and she would probably hide that from me if she was abused.) until they separated due to him cheating on her when I was 15/16, my mom thinks I knew about that and hid it from her however I would never and I lost all respect I could have ever had for my dad when I found out that he was cheating on her. I hated home life so much that I tried to become a emancipated minor when I was 16 however my mom would not agree and lawyers said it would be extremely unlikely that I would be able to become a emancipated minor without consent of both parents. I was working full time during high school but I spent most of my money on weed as it help my pass the time faster when I was at home, I often hid in some woodlands from when I got off school until the next day using weed to sleep through the mosquito bites and cold. I currently live with my mom and was paying my way through my local community collage for computer technology until I was put on academic suspension. I appealed academic suspension and was let back in for one semester until I was again put on academic suspension. I do not owe anything to my collage and do not have any student loans. I lost my job as a grocery store shift manager in the beginning of march when the store permanently closed. I've been on unemployment since and feel massive guilt about the extra $600 a week I've received making my income more than I earned while at work and more than many who still have to work are earning less while exposing themselves to the risk of covid. I had/have a major crush on a girl a knew from highschool but she since moved away for a 4 year collage and I never felt like anyone could love me so I was always to scared to ask her. I still feel like I should message her and see if there is any chance we could be together but I not only know that it would be a no but also that even if she was interested that we now live 3 hours away from each other. Honestly I often feel like paying one of those cuddle services or a sex worker for a night of snuggling and then donating the rest of my money I've saved to charities and taking a drunk nap on some railroad tracks to end it all. I hate how lonely I am every day. I only have 1 real friend and he had to move 2 hours away. I've somehow managed a 46 days without weed after 3 years of daily smoking so I can pass a job piss test but I feel although that is also contributing to my sadness. Also not sure where to fit this into the post but I have some crazy social anxiety that makes it hard for my to think of what to say when talking to people and just generally makes me seem really really really weird. Also not sure where to fit this into the post but I sent a anonymous message to my crush 3 months ago with a throwaway snapchat just telling here how amazing she is and I immediately regretted it as is really just seemed creepy and now I fear if I do reach out to her she will think of that weird random message. Honestly if anyone takes the time to read this jumbled mess of garbage I appreciate you more then you could ever know. Thank you so much. I feel like I likely left out details from this post so if you have questions I would be glad to answer, thank you for your time, your a great human, thank you for reading this and being here.

DLDR = I'm a 20 year old male loser in Minnesota USA. who has extreme regret for not expressing my feeling to my crush in HS. I feel massive guilt for extra $600 unemployment and has a crushing urge to cuddle even though I've never even kissed/held hand with a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions are. Please feel free to only answer one or whatever any response will be greatly appreciated.

1. Should I message my highschool crush even though she moved 3 hours away to see if she would ever consider spending time with a loser like me?
2. Should I wait until this covid stuff passes too look for a new job/find new housing/move out of my moms place?
3. What are your favorite charities?
4. How long do you personally think this covid stuff/lockdown will last?
5. Should I wait to get a job/other self improvement to then try to talk to my crush or just forget about it because it would be creepy to get a random message from a guy you haven't talk to in almost 2 years?",06May2020,1
300,"Confused

My boyfriend is an alcoholic. I’ve been with him for a little over a year and I moved in with him after a short while of dating. Currently we live with his family due to economic struggles. His mom gave him an ultimatum to go AA everyday for a month because he relapsed recently very badly. He took my car while drunk. I very much care for him but I think I should move out. I am only 21 and I don’t know how to handle all of the stress and worry of when he might drink again and do something so idiotic. He doesn’t want me to move out but I think I should at least for the time being. I don’t know what to do.",06May2020,1

I know it's to get your diploma, but I don't have any friends nor  can I imagine my family bothering themselves to come to such a thing (toxic family, long story), so I can't imagine staying any longer than necessary. It also somewhat pains me to imagine the event to be over and watching people's families and friends hug them and congratulate them, knowing full well I've never had that kind of support in my life. Apart of me just wants to arrange something with the school where they can just give me my diploma privately, but I'm terrified I'll regret not going to the ceremony in the future.

303,"Currently an undergrad. When covid hit and many students went back home, I decided to move out of dorm into an apartment because I don't enjoy being at home due to my relation with siblings. I haven't talked to them in 7 years, and the last time I was back home in winter break, I got into yet another fight. 

I'm paying $730 for a 2bedroom, and I have the place to myself because the person who leased the place couldn't find a second person to sublease. However, my father is the sole supporter of the family back in Korea, he works on the business side for an airlines. Obviously the industry has been hit, from what I read on news they are putting half of the employees at a time on unpaid leave. Am I being selfish? Should I just go back home?

I asked my father to just pay for spring quarter rent, so 3 months, and for summer I will pay my own by getting a job(hopefully). But still, 3\*730 = 2100$, and that's just rent. My school tuition is -900, the grants cover more than enough and they deposit extra 900$ to our account.",06May2020,1

306,"First, let me apologize for how many components there are to this story. I F21 (before the virus) attend school in NYC but am originally from 1000 miles away. In addition to going to school there, I also worked multiple jobs in NY. When the virus hit, school was made virtual and I was kicked out of my dorm. I wanted to try to stay in NY for work (one of my jobs is in a hospital so I knew I would still have that at least.) However, I soon found out that my father was diagnosed with esophageal cancer after being in remission for a brain tumor. I quickly made the decision to go home to my family. Since then, I have been able to do my jobs remotely, which is great. I was offered a remote internship for the summer, and it conflicts with the hours that can be worked remotely for my job. So, I’m pretty sure I want to return to NY.

Given my father is sick and not doing so well, I feel horrible for leaving. However, since being home, my resentment for my parents has increased greatly. I had some issues with them prior but still respected them and maintained a healthy relationship. Over about the past year, I have finally processed something that happened to me because of my parents, and it’s led to my resentment that has only escalated since being home. My last year or so of high school, my parents’ friend emotionally and mentally abused me and sexually harassed me. It got so bad that the last three months I was home before moving to college, I was scared for my life because he was so crazy, volatile, and violent. I tried endlessly to get my parents to intervene in the situation or support me in some way. However, they did absolutely nothing. At the time, I was mad but I didn’t realize how bad what they did was. More recently, I’ve realized how much trauma this has caused me and how much my parents couldn’t have cared less. For this reason, I resent my parents and don’t think it’s the worst idea to go back to my life in NY. 

I need some guidance in terms of what to do, and processing my feelings toward my parents. 

TLDR: I might go back to NY for my job. Even though my dad is sick, I don’t feel that bad for leaving because I virtually lost my relationship with my parents after they allowed their friend to abuse me. 1) Should I go back to NY? And 2) Am I wrong for resenting my parents?",06May2020,1

310,"


Pretty much title, I’m pretty much entirely worthless. I posted here yesterday as well so I apologize for the Spam I suppose but I feel like I just need to get this out. My mom does not love me, you know how the stereotype is that everyone’s mom loves them and tells them they’re attractive even if they aren’t? My mom is not the case in this situation. I’m so fucking abhorrent to look at that even my own mother and sister have both told me that I’m a 2/10 to look at. I  have never in my life felt like I’ve been loved anywhere I’ve been and instead it feels like I’m always just tolerated. I am a burden on my family and anyone that I interact with and I’m just over it at this point.

I feel like I’ve said this in all my posts but I have tried everything I can think of, I’ve lost a little over 80 pounds, I’ve bought a car, I go to college, I have maintained at a minimum one job and at the moment two, I bought a whole new wardrobe, yet I am never going to be good enough. It is hard to think of what I wouldn’t do if I thought it would make a girl want me/ be happy. I would easily sell all of my things, I would rip out of college, Id give up any hobbies they felt were not attractive. All I want is for someone to believe that I am worth the commitment and emotional investment, but so far I am still not worthy.

I don’t care about living anymore. Even before I posted this I was drinking and thinking about dying tonight. I think about it every morning when I wake up and every night when I go to sleep. Nobody values me and nobody on this planet would miss me. The only thing I worry about besides the basic human fear of not knowing what is on the other side, I just don’t want someone to clean up a mess I made doing so. I don’t care about finishing my degree, I don’t care about my job, I don’t care about losing any more weight, I don’t care about any sort of improvement when I know that whatever I do or accomplish nobody on this planet will ever give a single fuck. I will never have anyone to share my achievements with, any holidays with, I’ll never have anyone to come home to, I’ll never have anyone to take out and try my best to make happy, I have nothing to live or look forward to.

I don’t plan for the future anymore, Ive always tried to be as self aware as I can and to pretend that I’m not going to die in the next couple of years feels like I’m being disingenuous or playing pretend. I’m not capable of dealing with this kind of pain for the rest of my life, I’ve talked to my therapist about it but at this point I don’t believe it’s fixable. A therapist isn’t going to be able to wave a wand and make me somebody who isn’t fucking worthless, they can’t make me so that I’m not so fucking abhorrent to look at that I can’t even see myself in the mirror without ruining my entire day, they can’t make it so that women feel attractive to me. I’m just tired of being a burden and I find some solace in the idea that one day my final kind deed to the world will be that I ensure that nobody will ever have to see me again.",06May2020,1
311,"I've been living for 20 years now. Every since I was a little kid, I feel like the world has had this predisposed non-importance in store for me. I've been struggling with this for a while. I just feel unwanted and like if I left it wouldn't make a difference. Maybe someone would notice that I'm gone at some point but it wouldn't be a big deal. I've juggled back and forth about the how's and why's of why I haven't been involved romantically with someone and I can only assume it's either because of my nature or because I'm just not a person people are attracted to, and I'm afraid both of those things are permanent. 

I can't think of a single person who would put me in their mind first, no my mother does not. Neither does my dad. I can't say I blame them, I've never achieved any academic success, dropped any extracurricular because if laziness, gained 100 pounds and lost it again only to look like something out of a Del Toro movie. Sometimes I catch them staring at me, and I ask them what they want, but they get flustered and look away. It's not the kind of stare that offers solitude; when they do this and I see them, the looks on their faces spell disbelief and disappointment. 

I turned 20 earlier this year. 20 is a really nice round number and it's been making think. Think about my experiences, weighing my options, look out towards my horizons of which there are none. I think 20 years is a good amount of time to judge whether or not any of this is worth it. If I haven't been able to find happiness in that time then how am I supposed to go on, and then expect that it'll come to me ""some day""? I can't do that, I can't string myself along for all that time. It'd end worse than it is for me right now.",06May2020,1

I was initially going to take a gap year (or 2) but, given the current situation, traveling and/or starting my career aren't really options for the foreseeable future. I figured grad school would be a productive use of my time during quarantine/social distancing/recession.

However, the university of my graduate program officially announced that Fall 2020 will be held 100% online. I've had online classes before (including this semester) and, although it's not terrible, it's not ideal for my learning style.

Cost isn't a huge issue because I qualify for a grant that covers \~75% of my tuition and I'm privileged enough to live with my parents.

318,"so this girls i’ve been talking to and hanging out with for awhile. she called me tonight just to say hey and tell me goodnight. something didn’t seem right so i asked her what’s wrong and she broke down. apparently she had a pregnancy scare. she said she hasn’t had her period in 2 months. she bought a test and sent a picture of it to the guy and he blocked her on everything (test was negative). she was ugly crying because she couldn’t believe someone would do that without even know if they were having a kid.  she kept insisting it wasn’t the about the guy, just the fact that someone would do that knowing they could possibly be having a kid. then she was asking me why i was so chill about the situation and why i was helping her. she said if it was the other way around and it was me in her shoes, she would be mad. she said this happened before we were talking. but that doesn’t really add up but i didn’t say anything because i didn’t want to make the situation worse for her.

But now that i think about it, she must have been with that guy while we have been talking. i mean, it’s not like we were dating but still. the whole situation just had me thinking now and idk what to do. i’m not going to ask her about it because i don’t want to make things worse for her.",06May2020,1

There's an app I use a lot called Amino, i'm guessing some of you might have heard about it, to give some insight on the app for those who aren't familiar with it it's basically based on the creation of communities of various subjects (mostly anime based ones) 
Some days ago after loging in I found one community wich purpose supposedly was distributing cp (aka child pornography) at first I thought it was probably just some kind of bad dark joke however I couldn't stop my curiosity so I ended up joining it, sadly the community's description was no joke after all, the admin of this place had posted some videos of girls as young as 8-10 years old is my guess engaging in sexual activities, some of those were really utterly disgusting and hard to watch. I didn't report the place to the app itself because I knew that wouldn't cause any legal actions against the guy uploading the videos, so I did some research and decided to report this to a page that worked on stopping the distribution of child pornography. I guess that probably was enough but I was getting kind of anxious, so I decided to dm this guy that was uploading the videos, maybe that way I could find out where he was getting the videos from and report that aswell, after asking some questions to him he straight up told me that he got money out of selling those videos (bassically this community was a way for him to find new customers) to this he added he has a contact that gets him the videos, I'm hoping this ""contact"" just downloads the videos from some illegal sites and doesn't records them himself but who the fucks knows what's actually going on here.

I was asking him more questions when suddenly the community aswell as his account got banned, the app managers found out and deleted everything, so now the site I reported him to before can't do anything. Before this I thought ahead in case something like this happened and kept the guy's profile picture on my phone (a picture of himself) that and his username (wich i'm guessing is his real first name) are the only things I have

I am possessive and a compulsive stalker; lonely (and I mean it, I don't even have one person whom I can trust or be happy with for too long); always preffered staying home rather than ""finding friends"" (I kinda live only a social life in games) and, most importantly, my self-esteem disappears in the moment I see any person I care about talk with someone else or interact in any psychological way with them. That's why I've realised that I regularly ghost these ""new"" friends that I inevitabily find in time: I feel like a spare wheel whose existence is remembered only when other people are not available. So... given I already had an appointment to the psychologist, which was postponed, what advice could u give me on how to fool myself into thinking I am just as important as others when it comes to friends who know eachother for more time than me?",06May2020,1

335,"I’ve (m 26) had a roommate since late November 2019. She sleeps on my couch (f 27) and doesn’t really contribute to much - cooks dinner sometimes and cleans sometimes and that is about it. She was illustrating politics cartoons for a family friend and that’s how she was acquiring money, but she actually stopped that before moving in. I was under the impression she was still doing this and had some type of cash flow in some regard. She insisted that she wouldn’t be staying here long and I thought I was doing a friend a favor by letting her stay here without paying rent or contributing monetarily outside of the groceries that she sometimes buys that we share - I still purchase my own groceries though. 

After these past 6 or so months I’ve found that we have highly incompatible interests and personalities. Lately, it feels as if all of her time/effort has been cultivating relationships with people that she’s met on tinder that will provide her with drugs (weed and LSD specifically). Now, before she moved in I had asked if she did any drugs as I don’t do them myself and it’s against the lease (obviously illegal) to be in possession of things such as LSD. This isn’t to say that I have anything against people that do drugs, because this isn’t true - I just feel like all of her time and effort is spent acquiring/doing drugs instead of actually being helpful to the living situation. Feel like I’m being taken advantage of at this point.

To complicate matters: I listened to the advice of others and had her added to the lease as not doing so would be violating the lease myself. I feel like this may have been a mistake as I don’t think I have leverage to actually get her to leave if she doesn’t want to. 

I’d like to bring this up, but I feel like she’s going to react poorly. When she first moved in things were romantic for about 3 weeks before she called it quits. I can’t help but feel like she’s going to bring me wanting her to leave back to the fact that she’s been staying at a guys house she met on tinder - but it’s truly not about that. I just want my space back and I feel like I’ve helped her out enough. I’m looking for suggestions on how to handle this conversation as part of me feels bad for Kicking someone while they’re down, but then again, I feel like I’m just enabling her. 

What makes it more difficult is the fact that her family is super appreciative of all the help/support I’ve given her, but she herself doesn’t appear to be so. I truly just want this situation to be over with the least amount of confrontation. 

TLDR: Allowed an individual to move in and agreed that she didn’t have to pay rent while she was looking for her next place to go, but feel like she’s not actually looking to leave. Trying to strategize on how to ask her to leave.",06May2020,1
336,"I’ve been applying for jobs since December of last year, and I didn’t get a call back from an employer until around March. I was really glad I got a call back and went to the interview. By the end of the interview the GM told me I had the job.

Once all the paperwork was filled and the hiring process was over the General Manager told me that she was going to call me during the weekend so I can start training, but she never did. It’s been 3 months now and I still haven’t gotten a call back. I’ve been sending countless emails and calling the restaurant to get in contact with her but she hasn’t responded or is “never there.”

I have tried to sign up for Unemployment but I’m not qualified for it. Apparently the restaurant that hired me doesn’t show up on my employer list on the unemployment portal, probably because I never received payment from them, and I don’t have documentation of my termination. Also I can’t base my unemployment off my other employer since I willfully stopped working for them.

He'll beat us up whenever he disagree to us and will find anything to mock us like he's better than everyone. My mom know that full well but she doesn't do anything and blame me and my sister for it. I think the problem will be fixed if she just divorce, but she said I was an ungrateful brat to ever told her that, and all I wanted was to destroy this family and break her heart. Her point is everything has a reason, and dad won't beat us up for no reason. The tension increases over time and now we're barely talk to each other, but she now even complains that we don't speak to ""family"" much but there's nothing to talk, especially it's very likely that we will get beaten up if we say something wrong, and everything can be wrong. It's her fault but she'll never admit it.

 I got bullied throughout middle school and with the same point my mom think that it's my attitude to cause that and teachers are simply don't give a fuck at the beginning. I asked my mom to move to another school but she said that people at the new school will be skeptical and think that I must have a problem to move to a new school and I will get bullied again. I only need to fix my attitude.

I don't have anyone else to talk to except my sister. She help me a lot with everything. But now she moved, and I have to deal with this alone. I can't get away with this, since I'm only 16 and can't do anything if I get out of this family and I don't want to continue to live like this, I feel like death is the only solution but I've never had the guts to do it, and I still have a lot of things to do, I don't want to end here.",06May2020,1

Background on my family

My parents passed away when I was 14 and my sister was 19. My family besides my parents were complete shit. My sister got married towards the end of last year to her amazing husband who is 24. His family cut him off entirely for being bi. And I live with both of them

My sister told me yesterday that she was pregnant and I was extremely excited for her. But today after it really set in that I’m going to be an uncle I got kinda scared. How do I be a good or amazing uncle? I want to be a really good uncle because me and my sister and her husband will be the only family the baby has. And it will be new for all of us since they don’t have anyone to kind of guide them since none mine or their friends have kids. So I was just wondering how should I be with the baby? I have never really liked babies but something is different about it.",06May2020,1
339,"Hey everyone! So this year I’m going to college and I have two path options to become a registered Nurse but I’m not sure what to choose. Do any registered nurses have advice?

1st option is to go straight to a Four year (Sac State)

Cons: A little bit harder to maintain 4.0 GPA, Can’t work, nursing program is not guaranteed 
Pros: will get ‘College experience’, school clubs, study group opportunities

Or 

Do 2 years at a CC and apply to to Nursing program at  Sac state 

Cons: No ‘college experience’, must transfer into nursing program
Pros: Easier for grades, Can Work, Will have Savings, Can apply to other nursing programs

Just for reference money doesn’t matter because I do have Fafsa + Cal Grant! Also, the nursing programs at sac state don’t have guaranteed admissions and so I basically need to maintain a 4.0 + extra curricular + speak another language + volunteer hours 😳",06May2020,1
340,"also i’m sorry for how long this turned out

So i’ll admit, i’m younger than most on reddit. But i need advice about a girl i’ve been friends with since kindergarten. 

About two years ago, we got into a fight that started with her saying something kind of terrible about my (then) recently deceased aunt. there were other problems, and i won’t say i didn’t do anything, because i was definitely immature at some points. but besides that, we stopped being friends for about a year and a half. (this is relevant to later on)

My friend and i are fine now, and closer than ever, because we’ve come to realize our mistakes and actively communicate more. my problem lies with someone she’s friends with.

now my friend, i’ll give her rachael as a fake name. now rachael met this guy who was several grades above us. (i can’t judge as i am currently dating someone a few grades above me) he even seemed really cool at first and she was excited to talk to him. i was semi friends with him too.

they got to talking and became really close. i didn’t mind, but then rachael told me he started asking her to do things that she was uncomfortable with at first. now i’m not gonna say he pressured her, but when she became more comfortable with him, she agreed. 

that was all fine, but she found out that he was “talking” (the equivalent of right before dating someone, usually people exclusively “talk” to one person at a time) to multiple other girls at once. she was hurt, but continued to be friends with him, and do the things they both agreed to do.

rachael would also get hurt whenever he would get girlfriends, often people we knew, and then he would almost completely ignore her until he broke up with said girlfriend. she’d say she was done, but when he came running back, she immediately forgave him. he used this to his advantage multiple times, seeming not to care about how much it hurt her.

he would also ask if they could sit together on the bus in the mornings, but rachael can be very anxious in person and didn’t agree, even though he kept asking and making jokes about it. but if she would ask him to hang out, he would say he didn’t wanna be seen with someone so much younger than him. this obviously hurt her as well, but she didn’t care.

and since they’ve still been friends, he’s actively sought out younger and younger girls because every girl, our grade and over know him because of this reputation. (tbh idk how he got so many girls in the first place. his personality sucks and he’s a lackey for his “friends”)

he would even get upset when his girlfriends broke up with him, and would complain to my friend about how they did so. after rachael checked up on him, he’d admitted he cheated on his girlfriends.

he recently dm’ed a girl on instagram that was a few grades under us. they were about 5-6 years apart. he didn’t care and asked for her snapchat so they could talk on there. thank god this girl texted me and asked if i knew him. i told her most of this info and she was out of there. she blocked him on snapchat, but he went to instagram dm’s to ask her why. she came up with an excuse to get him off her back, then blocked him on instagram.

rachael found out and confronted him. he said he had no idea what or who she was talking about. i sent rachael the screenshots of the convo the younger girl sent me. she showed him and all he said was “bruh” after this she started making jokes about how he was just dumb, and used the laughing emoji.

the thing is, me and my other friend ( let’s call her jolene) warned rachael about this guy, along with other girls in highschool that have known this boy and rachael for years. she didn’t listen to anyone. the boy even heavily insulted jolene and i several times on several occasions just because he felt like it. rachael still won’t listen to anyone.

her reasoning for staying friends with him is because she “cares about him too deeply”, her motto is “forgive but don’t forget”, “he’s really not that bad” among other things. whenever i was in a toxic funky kind of relationship with my ex, if i’d try to give her advice about this boy, she pointed out that i can’t really give advice because i’m stuck in a similar situation (i’ve been out of the “relationship” for a quite a few months now, and i also have a very loving and caring boyfriend that wouldn’t pressure me to do anything like my ex did, among other things)

since i’m out of said situation, she can’t use it as justification anymore. instead she brought up our fight from two years ago, saying “i forgave her so how is it any different”

i explained that the reasoning for it being different was that we talked it out, figured out what made our friendship go sour, and now have better communication. we also talk to each other whenever we see one another repeating past behaviors. this has worked out well for rachael and i, but this boy and rachael haven’t talked about anything like this.

i just don’t know what to do for my friend. i care about her deeply and usually she’s the first to kick assholes to the curb, but she’s really struggling on this. her closest friends, jolene, our other friend, and i have all told her that it’s unhealthy for her to be friends with him. her own mother has even expressed her dislike for him. nothing is getting through. 

is there anything i can do at this point? she claims not to have feelings for him anymore",06May2020,1

So to catch everyone up to speed on what I mean my girlfriend (23) who lives with her mom in a small rental home has had people move in across the street about 8 months ago. A couple (30ish) and their two young children. They seemed normal at first but things have been getting weird lately. It started with small thing their dogs kept getting out and barking all day, to the point where police were at his house daily and neighbors started a petition for him to do something about his dogs. Next I caught him sitting in his truck looking directly at me and her through her window, probably an accident but I asked her and he says she’s caught him doing that a lot. She has thin drapes that she sometimes forgets to close sometimes and her bathroom is in shot of the window. Didn’t seem like I could prove what he was doing so I let it slide and gave him the benefit of the doubt of not being a perv. But recently things have been getting really weird, he asked me to help him move some heavy stuff one day before covid hit and asked me weird questions about myself and asked for my phone number. I told him no. He keeps asking me even after covid to come over and help him even though I politely tell him no, I can’t have contact with strangers every time. He has started asking my girlfriend if I’m around to help him out with stuff when she walks her dogs, even though I’m clearly not there cause my cars not out front. He’s started bringing in their garbage cans even though they haven’t told him to do that. Today was what I consider a really creepy red flag, he came over to their house even though we’ve made it clear are families are under quarantine together and asked if he could borrow my girlfriends laptop. He said it was to watch some DVDs and he didn’t have a DVD player. This creeped my girlfriend and her mom out to the point where she called me just to tell me how creeped out she feels. I want to draw a line in the sand but don’t know what is the proper way to do it? (Also just an FYI my gf wants me to handle it but hates confrontation and I’m not sure how her mom feels about it. Also his wife doesn’t speak English, he doesn’t let her leave the house and it was an arranged marriage from what he told me when I helped him move stuff. Just thought that might be important in case anyone wants to through out talking to the wife as an option)",06May2020,1
344,"TW: Pregnancy, ab*rt*on, depression, m*sc*rri*ge.

Decided to try posting this here in reddit since it got declined frm an advice group on fb for being too “heavy”, apologies in advance and delete if it isn’t allowed. I’m barely learning tw’s as well so apologies with that. 











I’m 21 years old and recently found out I was about 6.5 weeks along being pregnant. This is my first pregnancy after two miscarriages from 2017 and 2018. I’m young but fully in my heart, I know I’ve wanted to be a mom for a really long time. The most recent appointment I heard the heartbeat and got my first ultrasound, and it was definitely life changing.

My partner and I are not together, and we haven’t been together since he left me the night before a major surgery by moving out of the apartment we shared while I was working a 13 hr shift. Even though we broke up, two weeks later we did end up hooking up and have been doing so since late January. He mentioned he wanted to work on things and four months later, while we still are not officially together, he considers us together. 

I told him I was pregnant and while he tells me the choice is definitely mine, he has been pushing for an abortion because he feels “we” are not ready for something like this. I’ve told him I would think about it and while I did, my answer has stayed the same that I would love to proceed with having the baby. 

In the times leading up to tonight where I told him my decisions, on numerous occasions he’s referred to the baby as a “parasite” and “clump of cells” bcus it’s not truly a baby yet. I’m allowed to talk about my symptoms but not my actual baby. 
Tonight, I mentioned that I wanted to keep the pregnancy and move forward and he was once more trying every way possible to convince me to have an abortion. He says I use the child as an idea that it’ll repair our relationship and financially “we” are not ready for this. He says I’m forcing a kid he does not truly want on him. 

For context, I’ve told him multiple times we would work out us and if it worked, great. And if it didn’t, I wouldn’t mind a healthy coparent relationship. Financially, he isn’t working due to his job being shut down with Covid and is on unemployment and hasn’t really put in much to get a better job from being a server bcus he does live at home with his parents since we broke up and he doesn’t have a car. He’s stated multiple times he will ride the unemployment wagon til the wheels fall off so he can save as much money as he can for an apartment and car. I’ve been working from home and recently got a raise to about $15 an hour at a guaranteed 80 hours every two weeks. I have a support group, friends offering to help with baby stuff from when they had their newborns, to which he turns a nose to because “who wants used stuff?”

Tonight’s conversation has me feeling really emotional and not sure if I’m doing everything right. I guess I just needed to vent this out and get advice.",06May2020,1
345,"today it hit me that it’s literally now been a year since my ex (of three years) broke up with me. I feel angry and upset at myself that I’m still hurting and sad over how the whole situation ended. There’s no turning back and there will absolutely never be an “us” ever again so I don’t understand why I can’t just let it go. 

We stopped talking months ago and I felt I could finally see myself moving forward but very recently (2 days ago) he ended up getting some of my mail and I had to go pick it up. It was like all of those emotions I initially felt while trying to heal from the break up hit me right in the face, even an entire year later I found myself crying about it all over again once I got home.

349,"I have been debating posting about this and I’m not sure what to make of it. 

Context: I am a women, and my two friends involved are men. They were together romantically and identify as gay.

A couple years ago I got really drunk with some friends at a party and we all got a ride home together. I was in the backseat with these friends and one other girl. I was close to the door, my two guy friends were in the middle, and the other girl was by the other door. During the ride home, it was very obvious I was highly intoxicated, which I shouldn’t have been but I trusted these people. During the ride we were just joking around and play fighting, but soon the other girl got tired of all the noise so she told us to stop. So me and the two friends started kind of poking at each other silently and I don’t remember how it turned into this but it did. Suddenly I feel them start touching me between my thighs and breasts. Both of them did this and they tried to play it off as a joke because they are gay, but I told them to stop. They kept playing around and eventually unbuttoned the top of my jeans and go slightly under my shirt. I couldn’t do anything but they stopped after that and laughed about it. I felt very confused and uncomfortable but I decided not to think about it because I was very drunk and fell asleep.

I never brought it up again despite how uncomfortable I felt after that but I brought it up to a friend and she said that it obviously wasn’t like that and I shouldn’t think about it that way because they are gay. I didn’t think they did because they got enjoyment out of it, I just didn’t want them to ever touch me like that again even as a joke. I don’t really know what kind of advice I’m searching for but I feel like I shouldn’t think of it as harassment because it was a joke and because they are gay but I don’t know how I feel anymore. I notice now that I really just don’t like being touched like that anymore and it makes me sick.

350,"Context: Me and a friend are both 16 year old boys. Whilst not sexually active with girls, my friend would masturbate around 4-5 days a week - a perfectly healthy amount for our age. He was also the person that encouraged me to begin masturbating myself. While I do not watch pornography, my friend would from time to time (he put it as ""whenever he felt lazy or unmotivated"".) We would both participate in No Nut November, but it was mostly just as a lighthearted challenge. 

However, recently my friend has completely cut masturbation and pornography out of his life. He has begun frequenting the r/nofap subreddit. When I asked him about it (we are usually very comfortable talking about such things), he explained that consistent masturbation causes major health defects such as intense depression, erectile dysfunction and even cancers in the liver and other nearby areas. I called bullshit and did some research, and tried to show him the evidence against what he was claiming (I am aware that porn addictions DO exist, and can cause horrible depression, but my friend was definitely not addicted.) Upon being shown this evidence, my friend claimed that most public health websites are actually payed by the porn industry to promote masturbation. I recently had a look at r/nofap and found it to be both extremely toxic and manipulative, as well as spreading extremely outlandish rumours about the dangers of masturbation. While I understand that nofap can simply be a self-imposed challenge to test one's self-control, my friend seems to be taking this much more seriously. I have created this alt account so my friend won't see this post, as he checks my posts often (not as a controlling thing, more just curious about what I post.) I really need help expressing to my friend that this is potentially dangerous, as he is very stubborn and will not take to my current attempts at helping him.

Fast Forward to now I'm almost done with college hopefully before the year ends and thankful for everything I been through the past year. I'm more self relent and taking better care of myself and I saved enough to move out for my first apartment. I kept quiet about my plans because I didn't want anyone to tell me that's a bad idea or anything like that. I looked at several place over the last couple months and found some place I liked but then this whole COVID 19 happens. I was really looking forward t ok living on my own had a decent job and was ready for the step in my life well life has a funny way of saying that not going to happen.

352,"To preface, I know depression isn't something that you can fix but as her partner I don't know how to help steer her to get the help she needs.

I've been with her for about four years now and her battle with depression has been a constant issue in her life. Most of the time it's okay, but every now and again she will have a depressive episode that last up to a week of suicidal thoughts and depressed late nights.

During these, she always talks about how she doesn't get the point of life, the wakeup-work-sleep-repeat and why it's worth going through all of that for her entire life. She says that she doesn't feel like she's where she wants to be but she doesn't know what to do. She's talked about wanting to be a mortician but hasn't ever followed up with getting into the schooling or anything. 

Her issues of being unhappy where she's at has consisted since day one.  She hates her job, and works as a manager at a local food place but makes decent money. We've gone from living in an apartment together to owning a house and making decent enough money to get by, we have great roommates and pets but nothing ever seems to make her feel like she's where she wants to be. 

Sorry if this is a little mixed, i tried to get as much relevant information as possible. She doesn't go to a therapist, but I've tried to convince her for a long time to see one. She does  take antidepressants that help, and has made things better but there is always the underlying issue. What can I do to convince her to get help? How do I convince her that life is worth living?",06May2020,1

This doesn’t have anything to do with the pandemic it has just highlighted the fact that other than school and work I really don’t do anything else. I used to enjoy playing video games but they just bore me now no matter what I play. The only thing I have that resembles a hobby is reading politics. I know it’s not really a hobby and I don’t even enjoy it. It just stresses me out. I am constantly reading stuff and not having anything to do has made it worse. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep because of it. All of the stuff I read I have absolutely no power over. I just don’t know what to spend my time doing.

354,"I, (20 m) experimented with the same sex my freshman year of college through grindr but decided it wasn’t really for me. I don’t have that kind of attraction for the same sex anymore. Im so scared of my Frat brothers or GF finding out about my past because of some evil blackmailer and losing everything I care about. If I felt I was gay I would just come out, but it was just a certain phase in my life. Note, I fully support the LGBTQ+ community, but I don’t identify with it. Just experimented before.

My past doesn’t bother me personally, but I live in horrible and constant fear of people I care about finding out from someone else. I’ve had someone try to blackmail me before and I just couldn’t imagine all my friends and family finding out. It would ruin everything I have. I hope people don’t interpret this as me being in the closet, sure I want to keep my experimentation phase there but it doesn’t define me and I wish I could just live in the PRESENT. Not have to worry about being dragged back into my PAST.

355,"I'm 22 years old. I'm 5'7. I know what you're thinking. ""Ah come on man, that's not even that short. You're like 2 inches below average."" 

I know. I know. I know. 

I know how stupid this all is. But around Summer 2018, a girl called me ""so short"" in front of my SO at the time. Her boyfriend is even the same height as me which is weird, but it really fucked with me. My SO came to my defense and it was really sweet but since then I started to feel insecure. 

Same summer, I get called short by my sister, laughing at me, saying I'm short for a guy. Not a few days later, friend's little sister says I'm pretty short for a guy. A few months later, this classmate of mine who I guess thought was single was having a discussion with her friend about if she should date me. She did not know I could hear this conversation take place as I was in the bathroom of the school and could hear them speaking in the hallway. She was saying I don't know, maybe, he's short. 

At work, 2019, one of my coworkers calls me short every once in a while. He's very insecure about his height I guess because he's barely 5'11 yet he still makes comments about my height. It pisses me off because if I say anything, I'm that guy. 

Another occassion at work, someone mentions I look like a certain celebrity. It was a nice compliment and gave me a bit of a boost and right after someone said ""no he DOESN'T! Maybe if that celebrity was fatter and shorter."" 

This year went on a date with a girl and she said I was short. I don't think she meant it in a bad way, as it was in relation to something else and our dates have gone very well. But...

What the fuck is going on here. Why are so many people bringing up my height in rapid succession? I used to never hear anything about this and suddenly it feels like the world has gotten so mean to me. I always go out of my way to make people feel secure and safe and it just sucks that this is what I get. I've been insecure for almost 2 years now and I just want to be free of this pain already. It's fucking with my head. I obsessively measure myself to make sure I haven't lost any height or something. SERIOUSLY. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON. Why are there all these instances of people bring up my height now? If I try to comb through my memories before that, very few instances of being called short. Why did everyone turn on me like this all of a sudden? It's killing me.",06May2020,1

I adhered to the 30 day no contact rule. We were together for 3 years (2 amazing, 1 rocky). I had to move away (same time zone) for work. 

For you guys that don’t know what No Contact refers to. It’s a strategy that you can use after a breakup to cut all contact to allow you and your SO space and opportunity to miss each other. It’s a common strategy people use. I used it because I felt like it was the only option left. She told me she was done like she had before, but I decided to hold her to it. 



Her (day 0): Doesn’t matter anyway. I’m done. 

Her (day 1): If you do anything during this quarantine...watch Tiger King! 

Her (1 hour later): (sent funny coronavirus parody video) 

Me (2 days later broke rule): i bought your son some stuff before the pandemic. I want to send along with your blow dryer and other items left here.

Her (1 hour later): I dont need those things, especially not right now. That blow dryer is going to cost you a lot to ship! 

Her (day 4): You were in my dream last night. How are you doing? 

Her (day 5): Sent me a video of her son thanking me for some gifts.

Her (day 22): how are you doing?

Me (day 30): I’m good. I grew a mustache, been working out. (Attached picture of improved physique) 

Her (1 hour later): “Glad to hear everything is going well! I’m doing really well too, I actually starting seeing someone and I’m feeling really good about it. Take care. “

Me (minutes later): “why did you text me then?”

Her (minutes later): “You’re not my enemy, I just wanted to make sure you were well.” 

Me: (minutes later) “I forgive you. I will always love you. I gave us space to detox to start fresh. But this is the way it was meant to be. The universe told me and it was right.”

Me (hour later): This doesn’t feel right. I know you are mad at me. Are you speaking the truth about moving on? Or are you secretly hoping for me to fight for you? After almost 4 years of dating hearing you moving on after a month is crazy 

Me (minutes later): (Attached image of love note I left her in her house from November she hadn’t found yet)

End of conversation (so far). 

I think I fucked up by being soft the way I did. But what’s done is done. Her telling me she found someone really hurt (as I think she intended it to). Shows me she is really pissed. 

I feel terrible.  Do i still have a chance?

358,"Title is simplifying the situation a bit. Sorry it’s long. 

We’re both in our twenties and have been online friends for ten years. Fandom was a huge part of our friendship when we originally met but over time our interests have diverged. I don’t participate in fandom very often while she does.

She is part of a fandom for a series that doesn’t really interest me at all. I have tried watching the show and it’s fine, just not my cup of tea. She is very into the series and has joined a group that regularly hosts fanfiction events for the series.

I think it’s great, she really wanted to have more friends that were into it, she has picked up writing as a hobby again, she’s producing more fanfic than ever and is having a great time. I’m really happy for her and that she has found such a supportive community. She even began to date a new gal a month ago, her life is on the upswing after some upsets.

Unfortunately I am currently going through a rough time for a variety of reasons. (Career, friendships, family, etc)

Normally whenever I feel upset I would text my friend about how I was going through a rough bit. She would reply, asking if I wanted to talk about it and depending on what it is I would either vent or just talk to her about whatever to distract myself. 

We usually catch up late at night as we are both winding down for bed. Some days we talk longer than others depending, with weekends being when we talk the most. 

The past couple of months our bedtime chats have become shorter and shorter, sometimes only being one or two short messages and nothing else. When we do talk she only talks about what happened in her fanfic group chat that day, what her next fanfic is going to be, asking me for an opinion on fanfic, etc. 

She mentioned a little while ago about how she is sorry that fanfic is the only thing she talks about. I told her it was fine, that I would support her and chat with her about it, but there is only so much I can say since I don’t follow the series. I also told her that it was fine that she can’t respond right away since I understand people get busy.

I have sent her a couple of messages like I normally would about how I am feeling not great emotionally, only to get a response right before she goes to bed that sorry she didn’t see my message, also this is the new fanfic idea she has. It feels rather tone deaf.

I’m not looking to use my friend as a therapist or anything, I just wish I could talk to her like we would normally. Especially right now when I am going through a rough time. I have grown a bit resentful of how much time she devotes to the fanfic group, reading fanfic, and talking about it, while we interact very little by comparison. 

I want to support her and her interests, but I also could use some support myself. I don’t want to come across as controlling or as resentful of her new found happiness but the current friendship dynamic is causing me to feel more alone than ever. How do I tell her this without making her feel bad about having other friends and interests?",06May2020,1

She also blocked me on all social media and my phone number after I said we should stop talking (I was so hurt at the time). Ever since then I feel somewhat empty inside. The thought of her family just ignoring I exist and her blocking me really affected me. Don’t get me wrong there’s days where I feel happy and motivated.

A little heads up: I mention depression and suicidal thoughts in this. 


2 years ago I got a contract of employment of indefinite duration at my dream job. I've been with this employer for 5 years now, it's a safe job, the odds of loosing it are quite low and the payment is good. My colleagues [except one who hates me] are nice. 

The thing is, I make loads of mistakes. I tried several things to avoid making them, like making notes, letting look someone over it, carefully thinking about what I say, meditating, doing thinks slowly, drinking more water and sleeping more. Yet it never gets better. 

But I feel like I am a burden to them. Like I am chasing away customers with my stupidity. 

3 years ago I was diagnosed with Depression. While I am doing better now, thanks to therapy, I still have down phases where I think about killing myself. I noticed that these thoughts get stronger and sometimes are caused by the mistakes I make at work. 
For example: I forgot to scan something yesterday and customer was like 'it's right there.. You put aside without scanning it' My boss saw that and many other customers. It was really embarrassing and also not the first time this has happened. 
And them my performance gets even worse, because I just can't stop thinking about how much I suck. 


I'd like to do my job well but I don't know how to avoid being like this. I am afraid of it still happening, if even I'd change jobs. 

Do you guys have tips on how to handle mistakes better or how to avoid them?  Or maybe advice on how to concentrate more and stay concentrated. ;;",06May2020,1

I then discovered porn like at 9. I didnt know what it all was i just knew it felt good and it wasnt until i was 13 that i realized what i was doing. Sex was always on my mind and i couldn't really concentrate in school. 

I would get good grades but i would only learn things in the moment. I feel like everything messed with my head.

Sex is all i knew and i was so ecstatic with having a bf that i was afraid that if i didnt go along with it he would break up with me. I know this will have consequences in the future and i regret it so much. 

I cant seem to let myself be happy. Nothing really makes me happy. Im graduating college in a week and i dont feel anything. I have a job that i will be starting soon and i dont feel anything.

The story is I received a call late night a couple days ago from my sister. Panicking, shreaking telling me my father is being flown to a nearby hospital and is breathing only through a ventilator. Of course I cry a bit, but somehow quickly regain my composure to stay strong for my younger siblings who eventually make arrangements. One flying from the east coast ticket costs are $1000+ for 2 her and her significant other. I eventually call my uncle his brother no answer.... call my mom no answer... I'm kind of in a loss for words, and confused. In search of a better understanding I call the hospital. Now coincidentally enough prior to the call I used a call recorder app just in case I didn't hear something correctly. My mind at this point is dazed and running very rapidly. I used the recorder strictly because I needed to verify that the information I heard is documented for myself. Now some of this conversation will be summarized, these are exact words but edited a bit to shorten. 

EDIT:(( SORRY FOR THE GRAMMAR))

Saturdsy 12:40AM

DOCTOR: ""what do you know, and what do you want me to tell you?""

ME: ""I want to know whatever you're able to tell me""

DOCTOR:""I'm allowed to tell you everything. He was found with Narcan in his system..he had no pulse, he wasnt breathing, ambulance arrives and gave him a lot of medication intubated him in the field they transferred him over to here, and what I'm looking at is him not responding to anything. He has been down for a very long time reflected by the magnitude of the acid his body has produced. We will drop his temperature in a controlled fashion for 24 hours we should have a answer for you in a day. By initial examination he lacks function to his brain but we were oddly able to get his heart functioning for a short period of time"" 

The doctor says sorry tells me to make reservations to come there in the morning. I try to rest and accept that I have go to the hospital he was transported to early in the morning to see my father on his death bed. Time goes on. My mom finally returns my call, I break the news to her she trembles. Her voice is quivery. Eventually she tells me that although they are divorced they've recently became best friends again. She goes on  we reminisce about old times, and Its finally starting to hit me my dad is going to die. I get off the phone with her after our emotional ""I love you's"". Shortly thereafter I   receive a call from the doctor. This call only recorded my audio and not the doctors.

Saturday 2:39AM

DOCTOR:Jordan, I'm sorry you should probably get here as soon as you can, if you want to see him alive you have to come see him now. We have possessions that we found. lots of jewelry in his pocket, bags of pills, and a lot of counterfeit money and other items that we cant say over the phone that we would like to release to you.

ME:okay we will head there now.

My mind is kind of going crazy this was a lot thrown on me at once. I jump up put on something suitable for a four hour drive, and hit the road. Very hard for me to focus on the road it's like 3AM. I'm just asking myself ""Why dad... why did you do this?"" Thinking he tried to harm himself. I receive a text from my sister which reads ""I'm heading to the hospital now"" it's a 45min drive from where she is driving I'm nervous her, because I'm nervous for me its dark, cold, and we aren't emotionally fit to be driving. I'm about an hour out from the location. I recieved a call.. a picture pops up and it says DAD 2019..... I cant believe my eyes, I'm looking at it, I'm thinking maybe somebody found his phone, maybe whoever gave him these drugs wants to call to apologize. My mind is really running looney at this point. So I answer..

Saturday 5:18AM
ME:

Voice: Hello

ME: who is this?

Voice: I'm okay this is your dad!

I go on to say some expletive words kind of shocked still, he tells me he was asleep. His phone was off. I tell him you have no idea what we all just went through emotionally, even to a point physically. My sister calls me, and says ""the guy at the hospital is not our dad!"" I say ""I know""... they still could not identify the man yet at this point.

I'm not a great story teller, but I felt like this is something I had to share. We went through so much emotionally, tears, memories, and the harsh reality of being unprepared. The way the medical staff handled it was very unprofessional. 

List of errors:
1. Identity not verified (same first, last name, same town) my father's name will now come up as a red flag.

2. Released all that information to me in regards of what was found in my father's pockets. 

3. When my sister arrived the doctor said the guy found had my my real father's ID in his as well as many others, insinuating that this guy was stealing Identification and that's how they came up with the conclusion of this guy being my father. This one is not true my sister called to verify if my father had his ID, he did.

4. My father is black, and not white how could they mess up that bad? Ages are different as well

5. I'm sure there are more, but I don't want to think about it anymore.

Point of the story, should we take legal action for negligence, and actually being emotionally... traumatized? Or should we leave it alone? Money was spent that we cant get refunded for. Oddly enough my mom knows the man who was found. The hospital used my mom to get in touch with his actual kids that eventually flew in from all over the country to see their father. I feel for them because they had to find out everything so late. Turns out the guy was a good man who battled with drugs. I'm sorry to whoever this offends just felt I had to get this off my chest

369,"Hey Reddit! I have a friend I've known for 4 years that I'm having some problems dealing with. We've always got along very well, so well that for a long time I've thought of him as my best friend. I'm the kind of person to get very attached to my friends, and my close friends have always meant a lot to me. Recently though, I've realized he probably doesn't see me as a close friend, and it was more just that I'm available a lot of the time when he is. He's made a new group of friends, and only hangs out with our old group when his isn't available.

I'm not upset at him or anything, I'm happy he has people he wants to talk to and I get that he wants to talk with them more. It's just a situation I struggle with. I have aspberger's and don't really make new friends easily, so a lot of the time in the past that I'd spend hanging out with him I now spend alone. I understand that it's not because I'm doing anything wrong, and that why he'd rather talk to them is more dependent on him than me. But just because I rationally know why he'd rather talk to them doesn't mean it doesn't sting emotionally.

This is something I've had a problem with in the past, where when I see someone as really close and learn that I'm just a hangout buddy to them, it hurts. I try to adapt and see them as only a hangout buddy as well but I'm never able to, and in the end I end up ghosting them. I don't want to ghost this guy though. He might not see me as his best friend, but I still very much value him as a friend, and I'm sick of throwing away friendships just because it isn't easy.

With that said he noticed that I'm being bugged by something, and messaged me asking if I'm okay. I don't know what to tell him, or rather, how to phrase it. I don't want him to feel blamed, or be uncomfortable, but I also don't want to lie or come across like I'm trying to manipulate him into talking to me more. If you guys could give me any help with phrasing, I'd appreciate it.",06May2020,1
370,"Hi Reddit,
Tldr: I'm lost in life and feel I can't move forward with and without the woman I love so much

    I'm a man who's stuck in life currently, I'm 20 and still live with my parents basement and I want to move forward with my life but have an issue. For the past year I've been keeping track of goals I want to achieve such as finally getting on my own but there's a catch 22 (so what if I'm using it wrong in sure y'all will get the point) I don't know how to deal with. It all begins with a girl, she's all I ever want and I love her to death and were in the same spot in life and I feel I can't move forward and give her my all at the same time. I feel that if we're together I'm going to be stuck in the cycle of love and just stay where I am in my life, it's hard to focus on myself because all I want to do is be with her and spend all the time I can with her. I feel I need to break things off with her in order to give myself the kick in the ass I need to start working towards my goals but the thought of leaving her terrifies me. I don't know how to move forward in my life even if I was on my own but being with her makes me happy, secure and comfortable. I feel that if I was on my own I would start getting off my ass and getting stuff done and on the other hand she gives me the confidence I need to do that and without her I would get depressed and not do anything for myself. I want to be able to move forward with her but I can't, for some reason all I can do is be with her.

    Is there a way any of you think I could do it with her? Without her? I am absolutely lost in my life and have no idea what I want to do with it, I have dreams for when I'm old but they're vague in my head and there's of alot missing information. Any advice would be helpful, I've given myself a year from now to achieve most of my goals and fear I can't do it with her and without her.

Every time me and his older brother would hang out, he'd just  be lingering around like an annoying ass kid, making fun of my hair, the way I talk, my clothes, body etc and sometimes he'd hit or punch me for no reason just to get a reaction. I know I shouldn't have let that get to me but at the time it did. His sister just told me not to take it personal and maybe he had a crush on me and my first reaction was ""yuck"".  After that whole debacle, this Covid-19 pandemic happened (still ongoing) and my school is cancelled for the rest of the year. And a few cases were in my area so having a crush was the last thing on my mind. But sometime last week, I was walking past his apartment going to run an errand and he came out and I didn't even recognize him. He had a mustache, got taller, was dressed differently, had a deeper voice and had got rid lisp he had before like he hit puberty during quarantine.. he even spoke and was being nice to me which has never happened. I didn't think much of it after that until a few nights ago when I started having sexual dreams about him... like wtf? Last night was the third time in a row and each time I wake up thinking maybe he isn't that bad? 

I feel disgusted with myself. He's in 8th grade about to be a freshman (9th grade) and I'm in 11th grade about to be a seinor (12th grade). Just that alone sounds disturbing because of the maturity difference. So he must be about 13-14, I think his brother mentioned him being 14 once. Either way I feel grossed out. I've NEVER been attracted to this kid before, if anything I used to fucking hate him. Now all of a sudden it's different. How can I...dream about something else? Thoughts? Opinions? Advice?",06May2020,1
374,"My friend has been dating this girl for the past couple of months.

Through another friend of mine, I discovered that she has an onlyfans account where I’m assuming she is selling intimate photos of herself based on photo captions and unhidden posts for non-subscribers.

I guess there are two situations: My friend knows about his girlfriends onlyfans and is supportive or he has no clue. Based on some other discussions I’ve overheard about this same girl, I made the assumption he likely does not know about it.

However, I realize that this may not seem my place to inform my friend about this, and I don’t want to insert myself into something that is none of my business. At the same time, I asked my mother about it and she gave me a different perspective: she wished that throughout the years that my father cheated on her, those who knew what he was doing behind her back would have told her and saved her a long, unhappy marriage and painful divorce.

I don’t really know what to do; Im conflicted and can understand both sides of the argument.

My mother suggested that if I want to go the route where I inform him, I inform him as a friend, and out of concern (in which concern was already my feelings on the whole matter). 

 I don’t want anyone to ever have to go through the pain of having an unfaithful partner, but if he is accepting or encouraging of her onlyfans, then good for them.  Do I keep quiet, or do I have a discussion with my friend?",06May2020,1
375," So my dog is potty trained, but he was a tough one to teach. Anyways, just now he was just acting pretty strange and kept standing in front of the door so I took him out, but because it was 2:30 am, I didn’t have my glasses and couldn’t see, and he had quickly peed, I rushed inside and pulled him. He ended up pooping in the house and I watched him do it, but I wasn’t sure whether to scold or not because he tried signaling he had to go out, so I just stayed quiet. Now he is sleeping on my bed.

377,"I worked at a second-hand clothes store for eight months. A little background about myself: I have something called Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and something else called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). You can google these if you’d like. These two disabilities make it very difficult for me to work. My ex-roommate (the assistant manager there) got me this job knowing I had these.



Because POTS causes major fatigue and EDS causes major pain, I had to call in fairly frequently. I understand this is a problem, and I understood it had consequences. I took my reduced hours until my ex-roommate pointed out that our other coworker, let’s call him Zach, calls in weekly and leaves early often because of his Crohn’s and never gets penalized. She was right. He did call in weekly, sometimes more than once a week. He did leave early often. He never got his hours reduced. He also got away with texting and putting his head down at work (whereas I was told specifically not to text and to leave my phone in the back room, which I agreed to do). 



Anyway. I eventually got a doctor’s note with my diagnoses and recommended accommodations thinking maybe they didn’t believe me or maybe they needed a note from my doctor to prove I’m actually disabled because I was fed up with getting penalized. I called in less often and pushed my body too hard and went home in extreme pain and fatigue daily. When I showed the owner my note, he cut my hours to less than 10 hours per week instead of meeting my recommended accommodations (frequent breaks, drinking lots of water, extra bathroom breaks). 



I also suffer from mental health issues like depression and anxiety. My ex-roommate knows this. I had told her I was feeling suicidal, friend to friend, and she told our boss. I received a call from him saying I’m not allowed to work until I get a doctor’s note. I got the help I needed, returned with a note, and he didn’t schedule me for over a month, and when he finally did, it was for less than ten hours a week still, and I could tell that everybody knew about it as well. 



I had had enough by this point. I wasn’t making any money. I was being discriminated against for one reason or another (whether it’s my weight or gender or disability, I don’t know). Everybody I talk to tells me I should file a complaint because I was being discriminated against, and I feel like I  was, but I also can’t tell if I’m overreacting. 



Thankfully I now have a job that accommodates me and keeps my private stuff private. I just need advice on whether I should move forward with the complaint or if I should just let it go. I don’t want anyone else like me to get discriminated against or to go through what I went through. It was horrible and embarrassing and made me feel totally worthless and hopeless. I felt like nothing I could do was right.",06May2020,1
378,"This is a long one, TL;DR is at the bottom

I just finished my first year of uni. I met this one girl at school, we recently got really close so we we're disappointed when I had to go home due the pandemic. We promised to try and keep in tough every now and then but that just results in blank snaps from each other. We exchange the occasional ""fuck I miss you"" or talk about the date we have planned for whenever I get the chance to go back to school (I live in a different territory than my school). She makes me feel really happy and the feeling is mutual. 

Earlier this afternoon I got pulled over by a cop because I was talking to this girl on the phone. Let's call her Jane, Jane and I caught up with eachother as it's been a while since we both spoke to eachother. She was telling me about the problem with a boy that she likes. Nothing out of the blue, hell while I was at school, she happened to be talking to a friend that I made so I was helping the both of them with eachother. But after I got a 300$ ticket, I though to myself, Jane clearly doesn't like me like that, but do I like her? Also before anyone says it. Yes I have been friendzoned but that's not the issue. A while ago, a girl gave me commitment issues (another problem entirely) so now I am just constantly looking for someone to fill that hole. The feeling of being loved is something that I've been looking for a while. I've had mild episodes of depression since then but recently the episodes have come back and slowly increase in strength. 

Jane is a great woman, she shares the same way I value my friends, I've never met anyone like her and I think she'd be happy with me.

Jane doesn't necessarily likes me back, she is currently in the talking phase with someone else but she does care for me.

I don't want to change anything from this friendship as I am perfectly happy with how things are. But I could be happier on depending how I tackle this issue.

The issue? Do I like her because I genuinely like her? Or do I like her because I have been feeling down? 

TL;DR: Female friend and I recently get close but get separate due to corona time. Me getting pulled over by the cops makes me think if I like her for her or me being a sad boi.",06May2020,1

We hooked up a total of 3 times. Our last hookup is when shit went downhill. He mentioned he had fucked other ppl (2 people) and I was like lol. I didn’t mind, maybe I was a bit jealous but honestly not really... more like “why is he bragging? should I be tilted?” Anyway I was like “that’s cool 🤨” and we continued to chill. 
So here comes the horrible part. We get to sex and while I’m sucking his dick he asks me “how it feels knowing another girl sucked his dick last week” and I was feeling vulnerable bc his dicks in my mouth and also caught off guard so I responded too truthfully... “sad because I like you”. 
Then the next day I thought about how I felt and I texted him telling him I didn’t like it when he mentioned that girl during sex.

I'm a man who's currently stuck in life, I'm 20 and still live in my parents basement and I want to move forward with my life but have an issue. For the past year I've been keeping track of goals I want to achieve such as finally getting out on my own but there's a catch 22 I don't know how to deal with. It all begins with a girl, she's all I've ever wanted, I love her to death and were in the same spot in life but I feel I can't move forward and give her my all at the same time. I feel that if we're together I'm going to be stuck in the same cycle of love and just stay where I am in my life. It's hard to focus on myself and what I want because all I want to do is be with her and I obsess over her. I feel I need to break things off with her in order to give myself the kick in the ass I need to start working towards my goals. The thought of leaving her terrifies me. I don't know how to move on with my life even if I was alone. Being with her makes me happy, secure and comfortable. I feel that if I was on my own I would start getting things done but I know that I would just get depressed and not bother doing anything. She gives me the confidence I need to start moving on with my life. I want to move on with my life and make something of myself with her but for some reason all I do is the same thing I always do, nothing.

Is there anyway I could do this with her? without her? I'm absolutely lost in my life and have no idea what I want to do with it. I have dreams for when I'm old but there's alot of info missing like what I would be doing and how to do it. I'm scared I'm going to be a loser. Any advice would be helpful.

388,"I'm genuinely lost and need advice on how to proceed with my life, I fear that I messed up and I'm feeling depressed. 

A little background information. I'm German and I'm studying law at a university in Germany at the moment.(M20)

I feel like I never really knew what I wanted to do in life and was always influenced by what my family imagined for me. After I finished my Abitur (final exam of highschool) I was kind of pushed into studying law by family, because I had no real other plans and wasn't allowed to take some time to figure out what it really is I wanted to study/ do in life. 

I moved to a different city by myself and had a girlfriend (who I've broken up with now, because of multiple reasons) in the meantime. I had never felt so free and happy, like I did when I started living alone. 

I made the mistake of not connecting with my fellow students and giving my all to my studies, because I enjoyed being able to do the things and organising my life the way I wanted without being influenced for the first time ever. 

I always thought I would like studying law, but I really don't know anymore. Now I'm at the beginning of my second semester and I feel like I've completely lost track, I don't have any idea about the course materials or about dates and exams at all anymore.

I just feel so lost, I've been stuck at home with my family for three months now and it'll be another 3 weeks until I'll be able to go back 'home'. 
I feel demotivated and purposeless. 
I'd don't know how I'll be able to get into my studies again or catch up with them anymore, I don't even know if I want to.


I don't know what my perspectives could be and what I could or should do, not just study wise, but in general.

391,"When I was 13 years old, I wanted to find meaning to myself and my life. I had so many hobbies up until the age of 18, I did so many things. I even joined clubs at school back then. I always was one of those people who were like ""What's the meaning to my life?"" To find this answer I asked many to help me because I felt a hollow feeling within myself. I was always surrounded by religious people at the time so I became more spiritual. I tried to find my meaning through God, but this only lead me to convert out as I began realizing what religion really was, to me at least, religion is a cult. I will agree to disagree with your opinions, I don't wanna argue about that. 

When I converted out, I lost my meaning again. Then, I met my LDR boyfriend when I was 20 and we've been together for two years, he's become my new meaning to life. At first I was very happy, I guess it was the honeymoon phase, but slowly I'm beginning to feel hollow inside again. I became too emotionally dependent on him and my mood goes based off of him. Lately that hasn't been the case as I feel myself taking a step back, my emotions would be what would ruin our relationship and I cherish this relationship with all of my heart.

Due to a strict and unfair upbringing with my cultural parents, I was never allowed to have a boyfriend, I was so strict with my religion that through those years I did not even want one. That's why I feel like the relationship was built up so much in my head, it was a fairy tail for me, but as I'm maturing, I've realized the stupid mistakes that I've made in regards to this relationship. 

I can't be a teenage girl having her first boyfriend and being immature, I need to be an adult with aspirations and goals, and the relationship should be there for us to grow with one another, and lean on each other only when we truly need to.

Before age 18 I would:

\-Sculpt (was in a sculpting competition)

\-Do different kinds of art

\-Play certain video games

\-watch anime

\-Was a huge world history fanatic

&amp;#x200B;

Things I do now:

\-Have motivation to finish school just so it would be easier for him and I to live with each other.

\-Only watch anime when it's with him.

\-Play video games when it's with him.

\-Wait for him to wake so I could spend time with him.

\-Respond as quickly to his messages even if I'm in the middle of something. 

\-I base my everyday around his day.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is getting to him, I know he's being nice about it though. He consistently reassures me and he hates doing that because he always reminds me now that insecurities are unattractive, he's right they are. I was diagnosed with clinical depression in the past but my therapist thought it was a mistake and that I might actually have environmental depression. I don't have friends anymore, most of them were toxic and I cut them out, those are long stories within itself. Honestly I could keep going but this is long enough already.

Due to some family tragedies in my early 20's i fell into a deep depression that lead me down a path of failure. Recently I have recovered some repressed memories from childhood that I now realize must have contributed to that downturn. I voluntarly admitted myself to the hostipal late last year due those memories. It gave me a severe case of imposter syndrome and I was in fear of hurting myself. Now i have worked through those issues on my own due to complications with finding a therapist.

Now at 27 I only have hospitality jobs on my resume and going to receive an associates degree in liberal arts at a local community college. I was accepted in an EOP program at a state college i could return to (i transfered out to return home due to the family tragedies) It would be difficult but doable. I have been trying to find employment the past couple of months but to no avail. I was planing to major in audio engineering and using that find employment to fuel my creative endeavors. I wanted to start an internet career via youtube, twitch, and podcasts. I do have the creativity to build a community on those platform but profitablity on those platforms will take some time.

This has changed with covid 19. The time I thought I had. I no longer have.
I currently live with my parents in NYC (which as you know is the epicenter of covid 19). My father is at high risk and stopped working just in time. Both my parents are considering retiring to their home country Dominican Republic. They have a home they can retire to comfortably and me too if should decide to do so (i am using that as a last resort plan)

This is my biggest worry. If i am able to find employment at all within hospitality or otherwise in NYC, I will be putting my parents at risk. They have assured me that we are in no means at a point of desperation when it comes to finances but i still feel accountable. There are positions in remote job markets but many of them have requirments i can not meet. 
My second biggest worry is if covid-19 does come back in a 2cnd wave in the winter it will most likely be more deadly. Presenting an even greater risk to my parents.
Unemployment here in NYC has been glitchy and unrealible so i can not rely upon that until I can. 

At the current moment i know I need to wait and see what happens with my states current situtation.
My forsight tells me that I need to find a solution quickly and act on it now before a second wave hits or anything unforseen happens. 

Should i go out find emoployment anyway and take the risk? Is there something i am not considering in terms of alternete internet jobs? Any information or ideas will be greatly appreciated!

It seems that reading more books trains comprehension skills but what if i comprehend the meaning wrongly(while reading)and end up not improving in reading comprehension?
 For social studies and geography, ive memorised the facts and all but always get a very average score for them, it might be because of my answering structure or poor presentation of my answers which makes me arguments weak. How can i improve on them?

For science and maths, im pretty much acing them. Anybody with similar experience as me and would like to give suggestions?",06May2020,1

401,"Hey everyone. I’ve already posted this in other subreddits to reach as many communities as I can about this. For anyone who cares to listen, I have a pretty serious topic here that’s been bugging me since my boyfriend and I had this conversation a few hours ago. I really need some input/advice. There is a lot to read because I have to give a lot of context so that you guys fully understand the circumstances. Tl;Dr at the bottom. 

For said context, my boyfriend and I have been living together for 2 years. The first year and a half, we were pretty heavy smokers, easily being high 90% or more of the day. 

For me, it was a recreational thing, and I did it a lot because it was accessible, felt good, and he was already this way when we met. I have ADHD so it’s easy for me to fall into other people’s habits, especially when we live together (although I would say this is true of non ADHD couples as well). Not that I’m complaining though; I loved smoking weed. 

Anyway, everything was fine up until about 6 months ago, when I started noticing a lot of behaviors I didn’t like from myself and my bf. Long story short, he has a very addictive personality and more anxiety than he knows what to do with, so as you can imagine, he started abusing it and would start having fits of anxiety when not smoking. 

Now, for just a little more context, he was abused as a child and as a result, anxiety and depression are his natural state of being, and thus weed was a distraction that eased the burden of his symptoms. 

For this reason, he was severely dependent on it (I was not faring much better, as I began to abuse it as well. Impulse control is not something I’m known for).

Okay, so now we’re at about 6 months ago, when I noticed that we were both slipping away into a void, mentally, financially, emotionally, you name it, and so after discussing it together, we decided to quit together, cold turkey. Fine, great. 

It’s been 6 months, and I’m honestly doing fantastic. I’ve picked up a new instrument, started gardening, have a stable job, and life is good. So what’s the problem? Well, remember when I mentioned that anxiety and depression are my bf’s natural state of being? Well now that a thing, and big time. 

It’s steadily gotten worse, too. At first, it was minor, like sometimes, very infrequently, he would get anxious and want to go to bed early, to which I would respond by giving him lovins (read:cuddles) and wishing him a good night and hoping that he felt better. 

Then it started happening a few times a week. Still no biggie, we can figure something out to distract him. I picked up the violin, and he picked up the guitar around the same time. That worked for a while. 

Later on, it started happening after work, then before work, then before bed, then after waking up, and so on and so forth, until one day, he became suicidal. 

I remember something was going on with him all day but he wouldn’t talk about it, and then he got up and left. I thought he was going on a drive, which isn’t unusual when he’s upset, and when he comes back, he feels better, which is great, but he didn’t come back for a while. I got worried/curious and looked out the window and saw that the car was still there? Confused, I called him and turns out he was sitting in the car the whole time, talking to someone from the suicide prevention hotline. 

That was a big scary no-no for me, and we had a long and serious talk about his problems and how we can help him and we laid out a plan of action. Not to mention that ever since then, the person he spoke with at the suicide prevention hotline, referred him to a sexual assault center for therapy, and to my amazement (he is not the type to take leaps like this), he made an appointment and has been having weekly sessions of therapy since (yay!). That was about 3 months ago. 

Fast forward to today. After his therapy session, I usually ask him how it went and he’ll usually tell me about the things they asked him and his responses and whatnot. But today, when I asked him, he just said “fine”, and I knew something was up. Not wanting to push him, I stayed silent and waited. After a while, he said that his therapist asked him, “if there’s one aspect of your anxiety that you could change, what would it be?”, and he said, “My anxiety about work”. And that is true, his anxiety about working, I would say, is the major trigger for his depression and his panic attacks. 

I suppose that discussing work on his off day right before having to work tomorrow, did the trick, and I saw this anxiety attack coming, but didn’t anticipate it would be one of the “bad ones” as we call it. 

Naturally, I was worried because he’s feeling a way that he normally doesn’t, going as far as feeling physically ill (I can’t recall that ever being the case before). He mentioned that his anxiety about work was brought to the forefront of his mind because of his earlier conversation and now he’s feeling desperate. He said he just wants to stop feeling this way all the time and was considering suicide as a viable option. 

Of course, this is not something any partner wants to hear, so I immediately snapped into dead serious mode and ended those thoughts right away by distracting him with questions about why he’s feeling this way about work in particular (just trying to dissect the underlying cause) and what we could do. To his credit, he knows what I’m doing, but is open to discussing it because he is aware that he shouldn’t be thinking this way, and knows that he is able to feel better by letting go of those thoughts. 

But then he started mentioning weed, and obviously every part of my brain was like “uh-oh”. 

He said he wants to start smoking weed again. He said that weed was always the one thing that made him feel better about everything, regardless of what he was doing throughout the day, because it forces his mind to be distracted. 

Of course, my first reaction was to list off every reason why that was a horrible idea, i.e you were addicted to it and you’ve tried quitting several times because you cant self moderate or control yourself and it always gets out of hand, even when you were smoking, you were still having anxiety attacks almost as frequently as you are now, etc. 

And he admits that I am correct and that he knows how he sounds but was still saying things like, “I will control myself, only doing it on my days off and once at night before bed”, or, “if I can’t stick to that, then I’ll just throw it all away because I’ll know for sure then that it was a bad idea”, and “it’s the only thing that I know of that will work and it will only be temporary until I can get insurance and get medications”. 

He started this job after the open enrollment period for benefits, in other words he has to wait until the next open enrollment in November in order to get health insurance through our work (I got him a job where I work, so we’re technically coworkers but in different departments). That being said, 3rd party insurance is too expensive and usually doesn’t cover mental/behavioral health anyway, and we’re not married so I can’t put him under my insurance.

They’re even talking about promoting him and all of the supervisors are super supportive and they believe in him and praise him constantly and have spoken with the higher ups about choosing him for the position and he has a high likelihood of getting it, but we’re working from home due to the pandemic and things are a little uncertain about when he would get it, if he gets it, and how it would function if we’re still working from home, etc. It’s a lot to think about for anyone that has mental health issues, particularly anxiety. 

All of these circumstances and more have led him to his current state, and the only thing that crosses my mind are red flags. I know for a fact that it would make him feel better, but these are the words of a desperate addict wanting a quick fix (obviously I know that weed isn’t the worst drug in the world, but it alters the mind of a person with mental health issues in a negative way (in his case, it does)). If I cave, I could potentially be putting him (not to mention myself) in a harmful situation. I quit because I was addicted to it in a lesser way but addicted nonetheless and I don’t want to relapse, so I definitely don’t want it in this house, and most certainly do not want him to be doing it whether it’s here or not here (in secrecy or something). 

But the catch-22 here is that if I say no, I’m letting him continue to suffer this way. He goes to therapy, he has distractions, he’s financially stable, we have two wonderful dogs and a kitty that provide us with love and company, a beautiful little A-frame cabin in the woods, and yet the anxiety and depression have only gotten worse even though both of our situations have drastically improved. 

I don’t know what else I can do to help him feel/get better. I’ve already listed off every healthy thing I can think of like exercising more, eating better, regulating daytime activities, setting a daily bedtime, getting a new hobby or trying something new, confronting the things that make you uncomfortable, thinking more about the things you’re grateful for as a way to appreciate the things you have as opposed to the things you lack. I admit most of those suggestions suck and sound stupid to someone who is in a deep state of depression, but I feel like there’s something more that can be done. Something we haven’t tried yet. 

Or maybe I’m trying too much? Maybe there’s something fundamental I’m missing? I don’t even know. I feel like there’s nothing I can do, other then let him try weed out again, because I’m as desperate for him to feel better as much as he is. I hate seeing him like this, and I would do anything to make the pain of existence cease even if it’s just for a little while before it wears off, but I just wish we didn’t have to resort to weed again because that is truly a slippery slope for him given his history of abuse. Not to mention he used to abuse bath salts and spice when he was younger so he’s no stranger to the lifestyle and mindset that comes along with it. 

We ended our conversation on that note because it was late and he has to wake up early for work, and we both went to bed a little upset (him a lot more than me), and I just feel so bad about it all. My heart really goes out to him and his pain right now. 

What would you do in my shoes, honestly? Am I doing the right thing by saying no? Or am I really just making things worse? I just want what’s best for him and I told him I’d think about it, but really I just need someone else’s opinion on this, because I’m at a loss. 

Tl;Dr: My boyfriend has severe anxiety and used to be debilitatingly dependent on weed, and we’ve been clean now for 6 months but his anxiety has gotten worse so now he wants to start smoking again and I don’t know what to do, help me.",06May2020,1

406,"School is absolutely horrible to my mental health. That would actually be okay if I had good grades, but I'm barely scraping by. I'm constantly in fear of having to repeat a year. Essentially I trade my mental health and all other aspects of my life just for a passing grade.

Quarantine has been so good to me because I'm no longer required to take tests. The only obstacle is the homework which I push myself to at least complete. I have been in quarantine for over three months and my last visit to my therapist proves that my mental health is improving, but schools are resuming soon in my region and suddenly it's like I haven't made any progress at all. The prospect of returning to school literally scares me and I really just want to run away. I have no idea how my classmates do it, or maybe they're all like me and I'm just weak.

I'm aware that I need a university degree to get anywhere in life. If I drop out it will be like I've never had an education. I will probably not be able to support myself or my family. But being in high school, I feel like, is pulling me back from the life I should have. I do not feel like I am living. I do not want to dread waking up each day. I do not want my depression or anxiety or sleeping pills. I just want a normal life.

409,"Hello,

I'm not in this situation but my brothers but I'm worried and curious on how to solve this issue.

This happend when a group of guys came in and wanted to learn the sport (bowling). I don't know where this interest came from all of a sudden, but hey! New people wanting to learn the sport? Great!! But they don't have the right intentions. Or at least, I don't believe so...

After a while I'm asking my brother (he's a young coach) how it's going with the new students and if they're making progress. But he says they're a lot of trouble...

* They never come in on time and even showing up an hour late, apparently this is common in their culture? ( Don't know if this is helpful letting you guys know..?)  
Having them to pay a ' late fee' to avoid this behaviour doesn't work. They'll spend that fee without question and just wave it off so it's not teaching them anything. Sometimes even giving an attitude when the training lanes are full but they still demand to play. 
* They come to practise whenever they want. In every sport, I think, you're expected to come in everytime to learn (okay, sometimes you can't make it..). But with these guys, if there's no league or competition going on: They're nowhere in site. But a few days before a big tournament. They are everywhere, Swarming the training lanes and demanding to play and full attention of my brother (who's a coach). Basically they demand a personal trainer.   
Sadly when they want to have full attention of the coaches, the others kids who do get on time and come in regular are just left alone and getting less attention and that's not fair!  

* My brother did also a side job as a personal coach for them and they hired him a lot but with their mentality of being late, he gave up because they almost never show up or were extremely late.
* Speaking of League and trainers: They pass information along on how to train, how to bowl (and I believe a lot of misinformation) Aka: they imagine they're the coach will coach others without any knowledge and skills as a trainer at all. (Don't know if there's advice for this since there's not really anything to stop this behaviour...)
* The guys talk about how they know better and which bowling ball to purchase which is just trowing away money. Because each strike ball is different and it needs to fit your style. A lot of them have a mild, normal style but they'll just buy bowling balls with an aggresive hook because the effect looks awesome. Even with advice of the coach to play with another ball because it's better. No, They won't listen. They want to play with the awesome ball even though that won't help them scoring points.
* The parents are involved too and they're soo much focused on winning instead of progress. And they'll blame the coaches for it. I believe there was one time when a parent looked down on a teammate (A kid!) because he didn't score well enough but he played consistent and knew what he was doing.

Sorry, this is maybe a big rant but I'm curious how to tackle the situation. Most important being late for practise and just respect the common rules.",06May2020,1

ive lately been going from binge eating, to starving myself and making vomiting. i dont cut myself but i rub my arms and stomach with scissors or anything that i can find near me, i cant bring myself to actually do anything worse and even if i did idk how i would hide it. 

if i tell her that, will she have to tell my parents? im too scared for them to find out bc i dont think they will understand and i dont want to go through the stress of being controlled and getting my stuff confiscated. should i ask her first what she considers she has to tell my parents? and if she does tell them after she says no, what can i do?

413,"First post to this sub so please forgive me if I do things wrong. 

I’ll preface this by saying I feel like I know I should seek therapy, but I’m so scared to and want someone to give me their opinion. I’ll start by saying that like most teenagers, I was incredibly emotional. My feelings were often really intense, as in, if I did something wrong I would feel terrible about it for weeks on end, constantly reminding myself about it. Anything I did that would negatively impact someone else would loop in my brain and make me feel like a complete piece of trash, even if it was something minor like saying something that was incorrect. 

Then I left school and started working and slowly, my confidence started to build (customer service) and I adopted a “I don’t care what you think” attitude. I felt better and I began crawling away from my negative loop. I ended up working here for about 1.5 years. This job had a particularly awful manager however, and the way she treated me at work led to me seeking medical advice and getting a depression diagnosis. I wasn’t medicated and got a week off work, no follow ups other than when I went in for other unrelated things. 

Recently (about 6 months ago) I moved to a new town away from my family with my boyfriend in the same field (customer service), and even though the workplace is much nicer, I’ve found my strong negative emotions are coming back. I did something incredibly minor in the grand scheme of things (I told a customer we had stock of something because the system said we did, turns out we didn’t have it) and I feel like the worst person in the world. I don’t know what to do. How do I stop feeling like this?? I’m so tired of feeling like this. Does anyone have any strategies they’ve used to deal with this sort of thing? I want to help myself. I feel guilty posting to this sub because I feel my problems aren’t suitable to be here, so please be nice.

422,"I am from a small town and a lot of updates of what's going on is shared on Facebook. My brother's girl friend found a very young husky puppy and kept him for a few days. After some back and forth with the owners she reluctantly returned him home to his original family. There definitely was some drama about her keeping the pup hidden but i won't get into it. What concerns me was the family who lost the pup looked familiar so I did some digging on our local SPCA page. Turns out this family 2 years ago had a husky puppy that grew too big for his choke chain collar. The collar got so embedded in his skin that it started causing his head to swell. The RCMP was involved and it was classified as a case of neglect, expect to many parties were involved to press charges (parents, kids, grandparents). They claim it was an ""accident"" but no amount of excuses can justify what happened to that dog. He had to undergo surgery and did make a full recovery and got adopted far away from here.  The family is a young couple (early 30s) with 4 kids, I think the parents are now split up. I dont know if this family should be in the care of another husky puppy after what happened to their last one. Maybe people can change and they learned their lesson, but I feel it's too soon.

I still think that Harvard has a lot to offer towards me reaching this goal, but it comes with a lot of downsides, and there's a college near me in New Zealand that is pretty good with film and writing, the same one Taika Waititi went to (legend). The downside of Harvard is, unlike in New Zealand, I'll have to do that first year liberal arts degree that the US does, and I'm at the point now where I'm not bothered working hard for anything other than to pursue my interests, mainly in film and writing. I also feel like in later years I'll also be weighed down with courses I have to take which don't relate to my interests, and be driven crazy by the workload -- I really don't want to spend the next four years knuckling down every minute, even if it's for a presigious degree, and especially at the expense of my mental health when it comes to a social life. I say this because I know the kind of people Harvard attracts are those who are willing and able to take on a massive workload for the next four years. Don't get me wrong, though, I would happily lock myself in for a few days if I had inspiration for writing. But for me, with shit like learning a language, or writing essays on obscure academic topics that I don't really benefit from learning, I'm not sure I'll have the drive to study.

So now I've got no idea what to do. On one hand, there's Harvard, a crazy opportunity especially when they're footing most the bill. On the other, there's the more laid-back college, and possibly just as much relevant learning while actually not going insane studying things I don't care about.

A couple other things: I eventually plan to move to LA, so I figured it could be useful to be studying in the US in order to actually move there when it comes to the time, like by transferring to a California university, or gaining an employment visa. 

I appreciate any advice people have, especially those who have been to university in the US or elsewhere, and any insights into the US college system because I don't understand it too well in the sense that I don't know if there are courses you have to take, like if I'd be forced to do a History of Literature or something along with my creative writing courses or stuff like that. I really don't know much about it.",06May2020,1

426,"The title. I need my parents to get rid of their cats. This will sound incredibly selfish but I need to do something about it. 

I’ve recently moved back home from university and my parents have cats and I have allergic reactions once a day to them. I take daily anti histamines but they have no effect, and they make me drowsy and affect my mood too. 

My parents are very emotionally attached to the cats and care more for their emotional attachment them than for my physical and mental health. 

They won’t even agree to replace the carpet with laminate flooring either. 

Does anybody know how I would go about this situation or am I just being selfish? It is taking a real toll on my mental and physical health. 

it is stopping me from exercising as due to being on anti histamines and feeling ill I have no energy to do any exercise and I’m usually quite fit and active. It is also making reading/studying a lot harder as well due to the side effects of anti histamines",06May2020,1
427,"I’m fostering a beautiful 10 year old cat (who will call Pickles for the purposes of this post). She’s got a meet and greet with her potential new owner tomorrow, but I’m feeling unsure about it.

History: My foster cat has had at least three homes: in a shelter, her owner who she was with for 9 years, and now me. Pickle’s owner died when he was 93 and she was left in the house all alone, being by a family member before she was put into a foster home (me).

Now she’s had a bit of interest with potential adopters but they’ve all fallen through. This new lady is 86 years old and seems really interested, but with Pickle’s history (i.e elderly owner passing away and coming into rescue) I’m feeling unsure - I would hate for her to be rehomed again if anything happened to this lady. The lady says her neighbour would take her but I still feel a bit weird about it. 

I can’t see in a crystal ball but Pickles could live for another ten years (but so could this lady). I don’t want to discriminate against someone because of age, and I feel like pets are so amazing for older people. I’m just worried I’d be potentially putting Pickles through another rehoming if another owner became unable to look after her. What do you guys think? Am I stressing over nothing?

430,"I'm currently studying for a professional doctorate and it requires me to go into schools (as a outside visitor, not a member of teaching staff) for the placement part of my training. Where I live (not US) schools have been shut for some time now and I've been able to continue my training through working from home. 

My partner is immunosuppressed and therefore this has been an anxiety inducing time, even though we only leave the house for exercise. 

There is now talk of schools reopening even though it doesn't feel safe for them to do so, and I'm worried I am going to be asked to go into them sooner than is necessary. If this happens I think I will refuse as it would mean living in separate rooms from my partner not eating with him etc and my mental health probably won't take the strain (the course is already pretty stressful and I'm suffering with COVID-19 induced anxiety rather a lot at the moment).

Getting on the course was really hard work and my partner thinks I'm stupid putting my place on it at risk for him. But really it's for my own sanity (also part of our job in schools requires us to acknowledge when we are not mentally healthy as we won't be able to carry out our role in the appropriate way). Its all speculative at the moment, as I don't know when schools will be reopening, but not a moment goes by when I don't worry about what will happen.

Disclaimer : English isn’t my first language. 

So my family is from Belgium and still living there. My father divorced my mother a long time ago and he’s had a girlfriend in Cambodia for a few years (he often travels there). She got pregnant. Although it feels strange (I’m a the age when all of my friends are having baby), my sister and I are happy for him. He tried to marry her and have her come over here but the process is really complicated (you’d think having a child together would be reason enough...). They had a religious ceremony in Cambodia but didn’t get the permits for a civil one. He had to go back to Belgium to try to get her a visa from here with the help of a lawyer. But with the pandemic everything came to a crashing halt. 
My little brother will be born mid-June in Cambodia. Of course my father (I think he loves being a father more than anything) wants nothing more than to be there for the birth and to be with his girlfriend and assist her. 
But again with Coronavirus, getting a visa is near impossible. 
Does anybody know of anything we can do to help move things along?

Thanks for him and for little baby brother and sorry for the rant.",06May2020,1
435,"Sorry for the format, I'm on mobile.

So a little background. I didn't start school till I was 22 and am 26 now- changed my major waaay too many times during that. I have some mental health problems and slipped through the cracks when quarantine started so am currently unmedicated and have been the majority of my school career. And I just joined a sorority for stem last semester I would feel bad leaving immediately. I don't really have any friends I can talk to about this and my family puts way too much pressure on me for me to ask them for advice, so I'm asking you guys.

I started at community college and made the jump to university this past fall because I failed too many classes at the community college to get financial aid. I'm still barely at a sophomore level after 4 years of school. Honestly, I think I've failed 70% of the classes I've taken. Financially I'm in the red 80% of the time and am barely scraping by through escorting. Emotionally I have a breakdown at least once a month over school.

The thing is, I understand the material really well. I was even paid by the community college to be a tutor a couple semesters. If I were to do the work, I could easily be an all As and Bs student. The worst part, though, is that I really love learning. I am constantly looking for ways to use my classroom knowledge in daily life and often find them. What I hated most about retail was after about a month there was nothing new to learn. 

But I feel like I'm constantly at war with myself trying to beat myself into doing homework or studying, even when I'm medicated. Even when I'm already sat down with the homework out I have to fight myself to stay there and focused. It's just so much effort beating myself up with no real results. At least working retail I never had to fight myself just to do a simple task.

Einstein said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. I feel like I'm going insane and should jump ship now, but there's so many responsibilities I'd be dropping and I'd lose all support from my family. I just don't know what to do and feel awful all the time.",06May2020,1

I’m living with so much constant regret and self hate, everyday is a real struggle. I’ve also recently lost my bf from an overdose, the whole situation is a living nightmare! The amount of fakeness in this world makes me sick to my stomach, everyone around me is acting like they were always there for my bf when they really weren’t. I’ve recently lost weight when I had no weight to loose and I’ve now lost fat under and next to both of my eyes which has just made me want to kill myself even more.

I was so unhappy there that I was depressed and I started having suicidal thoughts (not only because of what I was studying, I didn't reallt fit there, didnt' like the city or the weather...). So I dropped out and came back to my home country and started studying Videogame Design and Development.

I'm now finishing my first year and I'm the happiest I've been in a long time. I love the dregree, I have made a lot of great friends, my university is great and I'm no longer going to see my psychologist. But here is the problem: The place where I study is in a relationship with a univeristy with bad general reputation (so I don't study there, I study in a different ""school"" which only offers 3 dregrees which have something to do with design, but the diploma I get comes from that university). My father says that I have to leave because the reputation is really bad, and he wants me to change to one of the better univeristies in my country which also offers the degree and has the same reputation. But there are several problems: The degree there is purely based on programming and they barely do anything videogame-related until the third year, the teachers are old guys who have been teaching computer science all their lives and have barely played any games, the content and teaching are way worse (my father aknowledges it, but doesn't seem to care), I would probably have to do an extra year there as I haven't done all of their first year courses, the degree there is only 3 years old so there aren't even any student who has graduated there, and on top of that the university itself is an hour away from my house (while the one I'm at is only a 10 minute walk).

&amp;#x200B;

So that's my situation. My father wants me to leave a great place where I'm happy personally and acadamically, which is also the best place to study Videogame Desing in my country, to go to a more reknown university with worse academic content.

Since then I’ve dreamed about my grandfather multiple times. But today is the 1st time it was so detailed. I woke up to my whole family sitting around a table eating pastas and meats. 


There was 8 of us. 2 of my cousins my 1 brother aunt and uncle along with my grandmother. My father was also there who hasn’t been doing well health wise. I was so happy all of us together it was so real. Realest dream I’ve have ever had. I was so actually happy and me my grandfather had a in-depth conversation about life, along with how everything was going. 



I told him life was getting tougher and tougher and he told me I have to pull through for him. He told me to be the most successful person I could become and be great. He said I can do it. Me and him where alone in the kitchen and then literally my whole family walks In , we start eating. 


After a little bit of eating a family specialty dish my grandfather gets a call on his phone. It’s from another one of my uncles who use to own a restaurant off the shore. He told my grandfather he was opening up another restaurant. So my grandpa decided to take us all there , we got into a car (it was the car he had driven me in my whole childhood/life) . 



My dad ended up coming over and telling me he loved me but he wasn’t coming. The aunt and uncle signaled to my grandmother in another car there ready to go, my grandfather turned around and told me he loved me very much. He told me to make him proud. My brother looked at me and then my grandfather said the same thing. After all that happening I started to realize it was a dream and got scared. 



I think lucid dreaming could be used properly because in my head I remembered my grandfather had passed away already and I was thinking I was dead. I started to get scared and like it was the last time I ever saw him my grandfather looked at me and said the last words he would ever say to me.

457,"Hello everyone. Wanted some different opinions about something that's bugging me (let me know if I'm overthinking this though).

In school, I used to be very good friends with these two people - Nathan and Sophie. I was a mutual friend and kind of helped them get together. 

Nathan was a good friend. A footballer, a singer, witty but also douchey and a complete ass to people who he didn't know/like. I was also in a band with him. 

Sophie on the other hand was smart and disciplined generally good at things. I got along with her better because we come from the same part of the country and had a similar background - middle class, trying to do our best, make it somewhere in life, etc etc. We go way back - she was my first crush in middle school or something like that.

Even though he shit the bed in school, Nathan got into an expensive private college (thanks to his parents - they know our country's Prime Minister on a first name basis). He became unbearable to be with. He got into drugs, stopped giving a shit about everything else. He got some new frat-type friends for whom I was a nobody. I tried hard to continue being a friend but eventually stopped talking to him. 

I stopped talking to Sophie too, even though we were better friends by then. Nathan had once  confided in me there was no one he was insecure about (with regards to Sophie) other than me, and I didn't want to be a cause of worry for him - their relationship was becoming strained as it is 

A couple of years later, I shifted to Europe (France) for graduate studies. Sophie messaged me to catch up since she was also in Europe (Italy) for her master's degree. She and Nathan were taking a break at this point. I was going through some crap of my own and I kind of pushed her away. That's the last I spoke to her. I feel pretty shitty about it since she was really struggling to settle in and I didn't do anything to help.

Anyway, Nathan later ended up cleaning his act up - he's doing quite well thankfully. However, it turns out that he doesn't want anything to do with me since I'm the one who went to 'fancy places' and left my friends (including him) behind!? I had a recent meetup with all our school buddies and the guy literally didn't speak to me unless we were in a group. 

The thing is, Sophie is still in Italy - and it's been hard for her there with Covid-19 and everything. I don't know if I feel guilty or what but I want to be of some help, even if it's just a word of support. The thing is, with Nathan being so hostile to me, I don't want to make it seem I'm preying on Sophie or some BS like that - he can be quite irrational when he's angry with people.

She doesn’t do it now, but I had to stop her multiple times. It makes me feel so weird and uncomfortable.

As well as I live my parents who don’t know I’m dating them at all. My parents (I live as previously stated with my parents and so do they) think I’m at work late when I’m at their house. I feel terrible for lying to them but I don’t think they’ll like my SO that much based on their appearance since my parents are very traditional (I am not) but my SO is very alternative looking. Since I’ve kept up the ruse I’ve been at work for so long I feel like my parents are going to be mad if I tell them because they’ll know that I hadn’t been working late all those nights. 

Their house smells like cigarettes since everyone (except them) smokes inside constantly so I always come home smelling like cigarettes and the smell doesn’t come out until I wash my work clothes. Also I don’t have a car and neither do they so I have always arrange a ride with a coworker to drop me off and pick me up which I  feel so bad for asking nearly everyday. They always want to come to my house or “live closer together” which I don’t want anyone coming to my house. I don’t know why. I’m weird about my things as well as my house isn’t set up for visitors- there’s nothing to do (no gaming consoles, nothing is set up for visitors. We have board games but they’re all meant for more than two people playing). They don’t have a job ( they worked with me at my job for a while but got left off the schedule which is essentially just fired ) so i pay for any food we eat together or movies or “recreational activities” which is expensive. On my days off I like do lay in bed on Reddit or watching Netflix and they want to call and talk but I’ve done nothing and there’s nothing to talk about which leads to sitting in a silent call for 1-2 hours listening to them tap on their keyboard while playing video games. One of my longest kept friends offered me an extra MacBook they had and they said I could have it if I wanted which I said yes.  And they said “are you sure friend doesn’t like you” and that makes me feel like my friends can’t do random nice things for me because I’d do the same for my friends as they do for me. Also an important note is that I’m the first SO they’ve had in years so I feel so bad for feeling this way when I know they like me so much. 

I feel like I rushed into the relationship fast because it’s all new and exciting but now I’m having second thoughts. I really do like them and really don’t want to hurt them but feel like there’s so much more to do separately. Help. Please. I need some good advice on how to handle this.",06May2020,1
461,"So, my name is Alex and I've NEVER been in a group of people without at least another person also named Alex. Thus it always causes confusion whenever someone calls my name.

I do have another name, which is just as common, so my friends have to call me by my family name (or a shorter version) so that it's not that confusing. Then, when my friends come over, confusion again! And my full name is completely the same as the one of my uncle. 

Recently I found out I was supposed to have a different name (one that is not as common and much easier to pronounce than my family name) and I kinda love it.

Don't get me wrong, Alex is a beautiful name, and having foreigners able to spell it is a bless, but I am a very out going person and this confusion is always a pain in the ass.

464,"somewhere around 3 years ago I had a huge conflict with someone who was close to me at some point in my life, we were friends for like 5 years at that point and things ended there. our relationship was not healthy to say the least. basically instead of ending it it just climaxed to a point where it sorta exploded in our faces and both parties were deeply hurt at the end. I still think about it every now and then to this day, I want that to end and I’m thinking maybe if I had a proper closure it might help with it. however, there’re 2 problems I’m worried about, first with that friend who’s a full narcissist which makes me worried like he would not just settle for a friendly ending and might take that as an opportunity to deepen my wounds instead. my second concern is with myself as I’m not confrontational at all and I might say something stupid as I actually do feel guilty as a big part of the conflict was me making a very stupid and hurtful mistake. 

I thought of contacting him many times over the past 3 years, but it always end as just a thought at the end.

466,"You see, I have Made a Group Chat that has lasted for 2 years now. These Friends I have are from my Grade, they all come from different classes in my grade and we all are good friends for the last 2 years. This group I'm the admin of is A Very busy group. The chat is always talking sometimes for 24 hours. It rarely dies out. There were times the group chat would become so laggy were the App would crash for all of us.
But ever since April the group has been dead. No one is talking much which is very odd because everyone is bored out of their mind because of Quarantine and they usually spent time on the group. But something didn't feel right because whenever the group was dead I assumed they had stuff to do but the Members of the group were Online. For the 1st week I thought they must be browsing Instagram and thats why they are not saying anything at the group.
2 weeks later I realised how odd it was that everyone would be online at the same time but it would be dead in my group. 
I started to come to the conclusion that there must be a 2nd group no one is telling me, because the odds of everyone being online at the same means they probably all on another group and Aren't telling me about. So to see if they was true or not I slowly started asking the group ""why is it so dead here, where is everyone gone"" and the members of the group replied  ""Dude, Most of us are busy doing schoolwork, or probably on Instagram seeing other posts or just talking privately with others"" I slightly believed that but I still felt they were keeping something from me. So I Privately asked one guy from my group. If there was a 2nd group no one told me about and he replied ""No, I don't know of any other group"". 
This week, The same guy asks me to come privately and confirms the worst. He said ""I'm sorry, I lied to you last week. But there is a 2nd Group that's a Clone of yours."" Apparently everyone on my Group was there on this other group. He also sent me a screenshot from that group, where one of my Good Friends said  ""Don't tell Him about this group, He cannot know about this group."" He also told me, that this group was made 2 months back. After knowing this I was pissed off, I can't believe my Good Friends, Friends I knew for 7 years, Friends I trusted Everything too. Had all been Lying to my face everytime I asked them where they have been they said they were busy with work. They all Had been talking behind my back and have quite possibly betrayed me. They still don't know I know about their little secret Group. I tried hinting to my group 2 days back saying ""something doesn't feel right, how all of a sudden Everyone is missing but everyone on this group is still online. It's like I'm missing out on Something."" And I thought they would start to realise what they were doing was wrong or realised I knew about it and start to tell me the truth but they didn't and still denied and lied to me. After knowing everyone in that group has been keeping secrets from me. I have lost all my Trust and Respect for all of them.

It's been a year since I broke up with a girl, who I thought was basically a love of my life, but unfortunately I've done something that I shouldn't and for the worst I wasn't entirely conscious when I did it, additionally I was mentally getting up after drug abuse so I wasn't in a right state of mind either, you most probably know what I did and what I'm talking about,

Everything fell apart and I couldn't get myself moved on since then.

Every day I'm thinking why I've done something so wrong when I was that happy, and why did I even allow it, but most importantly that I hurt her in a way I did. I'm trying to get over it but basically I don't think I can forgive myself,

I do not have any suicidal thoughts or nothing like that, just the aftermatch regret is still getting on me and I don't see an end to it,

It just affects my whole life in general, well-being, openness towards others as I think I'll hurt them, I'm really enclosed in myself, additionally I don't think I can love another girl the same as I loved her

477,"So, a bit of background: the teachers at my school are not amazing, but there is one in particular that everybody hates: the Maths teacher. She is incredibly strict with her rules and has the best policy for making kids shut up: she makes everyone terrified of her, to the point that she has driven at least half of my class to tears in the space of a year. She goes crazy about the tiniest things: you don't understand triple equation systems because she only explained them for 15 minutes? You're useless! You didn't do the optional homework on imaginary numbers, a topic that is only treated in the optional pure maths classes in ""college"" in my country, when she knows full well you're taking humanities? You're lazy.

Anyway, she's taken to doing online classes and exams over Google Forms during quarantine. She gives us 2 hours between them opening and closing, one of which we have to spend in a separate videoclass. So, there was I, in the middle of a history class, when I check my phone. SURPRISE! Maths exam with half an hour of time left!

Luckily, my camera was turned off due to connection problems, so I could do some of the exam at least. There I was, shaking horribly, solving analytical geometry problems while trying to listen to our ww2 history class. 

I'm not bad at all at maths, so I managed to get quite a bit of the exam done - but I have no idea if the answers are correct or not. This teacher in particular is very prone to throwing huge shouting fits in front of the whole class if you do anything wrong, which almost definitely includes my quickly done exam.

I'm stressed, terrified, and still shaking half an hour after finishing: I have a maths class tomorrow. 

I'm considering just telling her I didn't understand anything because online classes aren't my thing, but my mum says I should come clean and message her before the class. I have passed the last two terms so I technically can't fail this one, and it's possible that I passed and am just overthinking everything, but I'm terrified for tomorrow.

489," 

I've had a wonderful relationship with this person. She has been incredibly caring and attentive and can be very sweet when she wants to.

During these last two months I've had massive amounts of time to think ans have realized I myself have issues with my self-esteem and a huge fear or rejection/being alone. I keep tbose in check by having the support and care that my current SO provides but I also feel that having her help me as if she was my walking cane will prevent me from developing a healthier relationship with myself.

She has also expressed that our relationship has prevented her from taking care of herself.

There are other issues too, about 14 months ago I found some stuff on her phone that, after having asked around quite a few times, now do consider to be a form of cheating (she allowed a tong in cheek flirty conversation with someone else to turn into basically sexting). I see how unhealthy that was from her side and from mine too (being so insecure as to check her phone without her permission).

I'm really unsure as to whether Ill ever be able to trust her completely again.

Last but not least, she has a tendency to allow herself to push my boundaries whenever she is mad. It started with little things like being moody and cold with me whenever she'd be upset because of uni or her family. It gradually evolved into being disrespectful, to even kicking/scratching me in the most extreme cases.

Now that we are forced to stay in a LDR (borders closed down while we were on opposing sides) I met my ex and apologized to her for my past wrongs. I let my current SO know and she reacted in a way I had never seen before:

Shouted on and on till her voice broke, going so high pitched I couldnt even make out the words while insulting me and hitting objects. She called me a monster, threatened to retaliate and attempted a break up. She then said I had ""awoken a monster"" told me she'd stop eating ans seek to hurt herself.

After that she stopped talking to me and blocked me on whatsapp and messenger for about a week. When the week was over she told me she ""forbid me"" from ever talking to my ex again.

About a week after that she apologized and told me she wanted us to talk, but at that point I felt so mistreated and hurt I told her I wasnt ready and needed time to figure things out and think about us.

I've been extremely lonely this past few days. It was my birthday too and I had to spend it on my own. My SO organized a surprise ZOOM call for me with a few old friends and I was really touched. Still when she asked if we could talk afterwards I told her I was still trying to figure things out.

At this point I can only think about reasons to break up, can't find specific reasons to keep this up but I still feel that I love her and cannot bring myself to put an end to our relationship.

On top of that I feel stress because I know her family expects me to marry her (her father is quite impatient) so that I can finally be presented as her partner instead if a ""friend"" and can finally enter her home. I'd hate to disappoint them.

She's also very stressed and lonely, being locked alone (cant see her family since theres high risk people living in her place and she has to keep working through this period). I'd hate to put her through that much hurt in this awful period.

So long story short, TL;DR, I can't think of objective reasons to keep my relationship going yet I'm unable to bring myself to leave it and I dont know why.

What should I do?

I kept checking up on her during the break and we talked about stuff i should fix, and it seemed optimistic. Then we agreed we should see each other.  She cancelled on me the next day, because she had already made plans with her female friend (the one i mentioned earlier) i checkup on her, then the next day she said she wanted to breakup.

I told him I wasnt interested, My time for talking it out is over, I understand that it would emotionally mean much to him, but I cant reciprocate these feelings, I wont react to any further attempts of contacting me.

But he keeps contacting me. And its annoying the Hell out of me.

Here comes the Problem though, I cant block him, because I KNOW that he checks every day if he can see the profile pics of people (when you block someone they cant see your profile pic), and when that happens he will 100% be super angry and come to my house or some shit, for him blocking someone is basically like deleting them from your Life, its the worst thing you can do to someone (in his mind)

I also cant tell him to stop texting me because: 1) I already said I wont react to any further attempts of contacting me and 2) He is the type of Person to always twist stuff in his Mind so that it fits his narrative, if I would contact him again even when I would say ""stop texting me"" he would twist it like surely I want to make up because I texted him again even when I said that I wont. 

(No I cant and wont contact the police because, even now he would never hurt me, hes just a dramatic, annoying brat)

I want him out of my Life, never hear from him again, but how can I do that without blocking or telling him again? He primarily uses Whatsapp to text me, but he already said in one of his texts that he would do it over Instagram too, I dont have any other social media to worry about.

He started smoking hash, I discovered that and tried to stop him but I thought that maybe he only was smokin some joints.. But two days ago the police came at my home because 4 guys came in a car and kidnapped my brother because they gave him 400euros to get some drug and the guy my brother went to buy it ran way with the money.. So the guys that gave the money wanted the cash back, that my brother doesn't have obviously. They took my brother to the house where the guy that stole.. My brother when got out of the car to go to the house of that guy managed to run away and I get home.. The guys that kidnapped my Lil bro did that during the day with ppl watching, police has images of their car, their faces everything.

496,"during this lock down period me and my girlfriend (with anyone) can not talk on phone and she can not do anything that will make her family suspicious of our relationship because of her family history.....

{tbh she had gone through a lot, In the past her family rejected her because of this relationship thing in childhood, she tried committing suicide then, but then she picked herself got strong and got out of depression and continued her journey with the dream of becoming a psychiatrist and helping other people in pain like she was in childhood. which is how we met, me a suicidal whom she tried to help}

everything was fine till April when she started behaving weirdly and was now replying to me in single words like hmm, okay, etc. because of which we started having tension between us and at the end of month everyday would end with a fight, also because of fights she was/ i could not ask her the reason behind this behavior.

while all this was happening my mother found out that my father is cheating on him and for the first time there were these big fights everyday in my house and on the 29 my mother fell unconscious on the ground during the fight, we took her to the doctor and dumb ass doctor said it can be cancer, fucking my already messed up brain even more. when we came home our parents decided to split if she has cancer and that my sister would be married with someone of their choice.

on 30th me and my girlfriend again start fighting on some stupid topic and at that time i got so frustrated that i told her ""fuck off bitch""......hippity hoppity few hours later i don't have a girlfriend anymore.

**real stupid part:** i decided to commit suicide because i couldn't see shit in my life, i wrote her the letter and began the procedure, right before i was about to get unconscious, her thought of making me promise to never hurt myself came and so i decide to not do it and the first thing i did was to tell her i couldn't. but it was too late.

the situation now is that she has stated that she has no love for me anymore and she doesn't believe that she can be a psychiatrist anymore. i destroyed the very thing that was keeping her going, all because i wanted to see a direction. she couldn't sleep for 2 days and had fever for 2 days out of fear. i know there is no apology for what i did.

what should i do, i still love her and can not see her pain like this.

A couple of weeks into work the recent lock-down measures were put in place so I’ve been working from home. Those who I’ve been working with have been super supportive and I just email or call if I need help. But I’m finding myself a little lost - I’m not sure if I’m doing well or not, I’m not really getting any feedback which I’d probably get if I was working with people face to face.

I’m not sure if I’m overreacting but it’s making me feel down, I was excited for this job but the whole situation is making me dislike the job as a result. I’m sure things will change once we’re all back in the office but I’m not sure what to do for the time being?

The problem is most of my prefeered careers has shot me down for being honest about a mistake. I got 2 left and that is trying to become a policeman and get no job after school. Or become a Paramedic where my honesty might put me in trouble.

My last resort option is to join the foreign legion in France because it is as close i can get to what i really wanted to do. And that was to serve in the army at home. 
The issue is the rumours and reputation of the Foreign legion is not good here and people say i must be crazy to do it. 
But i see a chance to save some money, see the world, learn french and make some connections.

499,"The landlord lives in the bottom portion of the house and I rent a room on the top portion. Her son lives in the top portion as well in the room next to mine so the landlord comes upstairs as she pleases. 

This landlord has been aggravating. We have no set contract and I just pay her monthly. 

When I first moved in, she helped me with her truck but she took my fan and mini fridge to store in her garage. When I asked for it, she said “r u going to raise my bill?” “ill wrap the fan and fridge for u so just leave it in the garage.”

Can she do that when I am renting a room and the utilities are all included? 

During this covid-19 situation, she has been hassling me for the rent (that’s a few weeks late) saying she will make a contract, involve a lawyer and have it notarized, etc to make sure I pay the rent. (I have been paying the rent btw up to now) 

She checks my mail too. She doesn’t open it but it seems like she tries to see where my mail is from and tries to see when Ill get a stimulus check in the mail. It’s stressing me out. Yesterday when I was asleep, she knocks on my door and leaves me a text message saying that my “so and so mail from gov came” i saw the mail she left and you cannot see what it is unless you put it by the light.

Is quitting my current job when there is no offer at hand wise?

513,"Since I know how quick people are to throw hands, here some facts to take in before you respond:

- My sister has MCDD, this is an autism spectrum disorder that's very closely related to schizophrenia. One of the main characteristics is the inability to view reality from fantasy, and identifying yourself with said fantasy.

- my sister has a intellectual disability. Her iQ is around 70. No harm in that, but that does mean she says *everything* that comes in her mind, without the ability to think about the consequences. 

- we allowed her to speak to a psychologist who specialises in children with gender problems. That therapist was very clear: *sister is not transgender.* 


Phew, now we have that out of the way. The real issue. My sister has identified herself with many things over the years, and when she does she is completely convinced it's *true*. 

There was this phase where she was convinced she was a psychopath. She actually went out of her way to murder baby rats that we owned, and showed no care about what she did. 

She had a phase about being a school shooter. Now in my country we ain't got guns, but my darling sister did take a knife with her to school to stab her friend she sometimes argued with. Needless to say, she was expelled and hasn't been to school in a year.

She had a phase about being a serial killer. I had to sleep with a lock on my door so she wouldn't do anything in my sleep. My sister hates me most in the entire world.

And then, 8 months ago: ""I am a boy.""

Me and my mom are used to her dropping these bombs on us and her therapist tells us to not show too much of a reaction. She *wants* the reaction, she essentially feeds on it. 

So we stayed very casual. We didn't disagree with her. We were like: ""sure. If you feel like that still in a couple of months we will see what to do about it, okay?"" 

That was met with screaming and crying. But I think, after reading her past phases, youll understand we aren't about to give in to her every whim.

Few months go by, her claims to be a boy persist. Okay. We allow her to cut her hair short, (*but not too short! She doesn't want to look boyish. That won't look good with her make up and pink clothes!*).

We talk with her therapist, the therapist is a wonderful woman and how she keeps up with my sister? I don't know. The patience that woman has, unbelievable. Therapist is very blunt and realistic though.

""I have dealt with multiple children with gender issues. That does not compare to the way she talks about it. In my opinion this is a phase.""

However, since this is not her expertise and we can't know 100% sure, we let her talk to a therapist who does specialise in children with these issues. 

The verdict was the same. ""She is not transgender. She seems need something that makes her special, but also lacks the feeling of identity. It's not uncommon for people her age to try and figure out who they are like this."" 

Okay, okay that's along the lines we were thinking as well. But then the real issue arises.

*what are we going to do?*

You see, the therapist was very clear about it: ""going along in this phase, beyond letting her cut her hair and allowing her to wear whatever clothes she wants, is going to make this worse. It is important for her to keep seeing reality from fantasy, so don't go along in her fantasy."" 

This means we never outright tell her: ""you're a girl!!!"", of course not. Anything hinting that we don't believe her results in her running upstairs and self harming. But we also don't actively support it either.

You want to wear boy clothes? Sure, go ahead. You want us to call you a boy?  No, we cant do that.

This gets really exhausting. Especially since my sister seems entirely lost on her own lie as well. Some days she is suddenly a girl, and then she is ""100% A BOY, MOM!!!!!!"". It's the small things where she falls through her own lies, like I mentioned - she has an intellectual disability, so even though she wants to be a boy. She cannot see the flaws in her own thinking when she mentions ""oh I am a lesbian"" ""I want to be a princeSS"". 

For now we stick with: ""wait until you're 18/16, before that there's nothing that can be done anyway."" 

Which, once again, is met with running upstairs and self harming. (And then going downstairs wearing a fucking mitella for three minor cuts that didn't bleed). 

One second its: ""oh I can't wait to have a boyfriend (poor boy) and be his good little girl!!"" (She is into ddlg and yes I want to cut my own ears off and my biggest wish is one single diner with the fam where I don't have to listen to her continuous bullshit) and the next I am talking to my brother and my sis thinks I said something insulting she once again she goes off upstairs screaming we are transphobic. 

Now me and my mom have self restraint. (Okay mine is wearing thin, but it is still there). Her twin brother, who doesn't really get involved in her idiocy, has had enough of it as well. It's hard to get him to understand that we kind of need to ignore all of it. He tries, but every 14 year old boy has his limits. Understandably.


Any advise from people or parents who had the same issue? How to cope with this without giving into the fantasy, but also not making a very sensitive person feel bad. We would like to minimise the amounts the time she scurries off her bedroom. 

We try to just never ever mention it, however she is the one that brings it up every *single* day. And if we don't ""take the bait"" she just pushes harder until someone inevitably says something she can take as an insult.

Therapist keeps saying:  try to ignore it, try to ignore it. But we have been ignoring this whole shit show from psychopath to transgender for like three years!!!",06May2020,1

 I'm currently a college student, but I also have a lot of baggage that is negatively affecting my work. I am constantly struggling with my mental health due to the immense amount of trauma I suffered as a child and as a teen. I take pills for depression and talk to my collage therapist every other week but it doesn't help much with my school performance.  I get upset because the seemingly mentally well students don't seem to be struggling as badly as I am. I want to ask for help but I'm ashamed that I can't function as a normal person and I'm afraid of everyone finding out how broken I am on the inside. My past is deeply shameful to me and I try to hide it as best I can. Whenever I need time off because my mental health is becoming too severe I tell them I'm sick, (which is often true) but even that is a source of shame as I see all my classmates finish their assignments on time. Every time I start to feel normal and good about myself my mental illness comes back to trip me up. I tell myself these are just excuses and try to push through but it only makes me crash even harder. Not being able to finish my projects is messing with my head and making me feel even worse. I need to know how to cope and balance mental illness with school.  I really don't want this to continue into my professional life but if it does please tell me what you do to work around it.

I'm not saying it's wrong to be a Trump supporter or anti-vaxer, but I'd like for my parents to at least look into these issues without just blindly following what one news source has to say. How do I get them to do research and form an opinion based on that? I'm worried that a news source will say ""the earth is flat"" or ""Trump invented electricity. Ben Franklin is the devil"" and then they believe it. They are Christians, so they don't care that much about science (evolution, earth being billions of year old), which is fine, but it's the mentality of blindly following what a biased news source says that worries me. Sorta like faith in a religion, I guess. They are smart people, but intelligence can mean nothing when there is an emotional trigger in a topic. People quit listening after you say something they don't believe no matter how good your argument, so I'd like to find a way to get them look at something more valid than Twitter and one news source. They can believe whatever they want, but I want them to have at least one research-based argument.",06May2020,1
532,"Hello, so basically I found out my boyfriend has a side piece. I will be breaking up with him, but he doesn't know this yet. I've already made the plans I need to safely and smartly leave.

Now, he asked what he could do to make me change his mind. His side girl is his best friend, and he said he doesn't want to have to choose between me and her (I know, right?!). So I told him that he needs to let me speak to her. I want to do this solely to make myself feel vindicated. I deserve this after what she did. (Yes, obviously I'm mad at him too. Hence the break up.) Also, apparently she has a history of doing this to others. I'd like to get redemption for all the women she's screwed over.

Basically I would like to sit her down, just me and her, and interview her. I want to ask her things that will make her think about what she's done and the kind of person she is. I want her to leave the room with her jaw dropped, and so she can think of what she has done and who she is. I do not plan on doing any violence to her. I want to ask her things like:

""How would you feel if I did the same to you?""

I know you don't like yourself, and I have a feeling you don't like yourself more that I could ever not like you."" (she has said casually she doesn't like herself before)

""I feel sorry for you.""

""I hope this has helped you understand why you will always feel like you are a plan B (something she discussed with me before) and never a priority. You will always feel this way and you will always ask yourself, ""why"".

""How do you feel about being a secret? That he wanted to keep you a secret?""

Anyone have any other things I should say? Thank you!

PLEASE do not tell me to just not do it and leave him. That is not the advice I am looking for.",06May2020,1

 I cant remember most of my childhood. According to my mother I ""lost my spirit"" when I was 7 years old, and she felt like she lost her child. I do remember some things. Sexual feelings around 8-10. Wanting to be sexual at 8. Is this normal for a child? I tried committing suicide at 8 according to my mother, again at 17, my childhood and teenage years I had no friends whatsoever and couldnt attend school due to my crippling depression, I was essentially a hermit.


I have been trying to look back and unlock those memories and have realized a few things. I was and still am scared of men. Friends fathers, male teachers, any adult males. I was heading to sleep just now and got the image of these big male arms coming to grab me and I jumped, i cant sleep now because i feel a massive weight in my heart. I dont remember being abused but I do wonder if I was. I've talked to my mother about it and she said she always wondered if I was abused. Was this the reason I lost my spirit and ended up like this?

How can I make sense of this all? How can I heal? I spend my entire life running from my childhood and its tiring. I feel like something has been stolen from me and I cant run from that feeling.

I am working from home right now and they is annual fire alarm inspecion is apparenlty today. We were NOT GIVEN PROPER 24hr notice so this is illegal. My desk is right below the bells, they are starting at top floor and working their way down which means I am last I cannot listen to this all daylong. I need advice on how to majorly dampen the sound of this thing. Ive done the bath towel method before but that wont be sufficiant for the whole day rigght above my desk. I also have small animals that are gonna freak out b/c I didn't have any time to make arrangemnets to get them out of here for the day.  


I am wondering about the little metal hammer that bangs on the bells to make them ring. It's a part that goes in and out and ive felt it before while ringing. It operates via electromagnet so no moving parts (\*\*\*\*\*THAT I AM AWARE OF) that go in and out other than the little metal hammer itself. It's just the north and south poles of a magnet going past each other many times per second.  


\*\*\*\*THAT I AM AWARE OF: What I am wondering is, if I were to shove something in between the hammer and the bell FOR AN EXTENDED AMOUT OF TIME to hold it in place and stop it from moving up and down/in and out, is  there any possibly of doing any kind of damage to the hammer or will it be safe?? I know it's fine for a couple seconds but I'm not sure about ALL DAY LONG. There are no moving gears or anything to break, all I'm doing is basically preventing the south pole of a magnet from following the north pole when the north pole passes. The all day long thing just worries mne for some reason. I'm not worried so much about breaking something as much as I am about something burning out or overheating it.  


Please don't let this turn into a fire safety topic and why I shouldn't do this - Please just awnser about any possible damage to the north/south poles of the electromagnet or any other ideas to keep this one particular bell over my desk silenced.  I don't have time to take an electronic theory courese  in the three minutes.

543,"Sorry, this is quite a long story and requires some background info. 

We live in Sydney, and her parents live 6 hours North near Coffs Harbour, and are off-grid due to fears about wifi, chemtrails and other various conspiracies. They have two younger daughters who live with them and are suffering from a lack of proper education, socialization and life experience. Her mother has some health issues that mean she can't drive and needs many medications/care. They are also avid believers of this Sovereign Citizen idea. 

Her father lost his license several years ago for driving under the influence, and since he is the only one at the property who can drive, he just kept doing so. He got caught just before he was meant to go to court to review the loss of license, and has now been detained. He got committed to be mentally assessed for spouting the Sovereign stuff but has been deemed mentally stable. Now he fully intends to continue presenting his evidence to the courts and police in the area that he doesn't have to have a license to drive because he is simply ""travelling"". I am obviously worried that this will get him arrested again, with more serious consequences.

Neither her mother nor her father will consider the prospect that this line of reasoning may not work, and may lead to her mother and her two younger sisters without a means to get food and other resources. I have no idea how to help them and I know they cannot be convinced this is a bad idea. What should we do?

547,"I am so stressed out right now. I’ve been an active member of this one discord server for over a year now, and through the months I’ve become friends with this one user. We’d talk about music and hobbies in our DMs and also communicated about site-related things on the server we are both members of.

She really wanted to hear by voice, and I’m a super nervous person. I got in voice chat a few times, but I never said a ton. Last night, she convinced me and we just started talking one on one. And I really regret it.

It was nice to talk with her and make her laugh, but I feel like her whole impression of me has changed. I try to be really polite and composed on the server, but have a hard time articulating when I’m speaking verbally online(particularly in situations like this, where I care about and will interact with the person again as opposed to over voice in a video game). 

I just feel like I didn’t come off how I wanted to. I’m really reserved and relaxed on the server, but I was kind of wild in the sense that I was speaking quickly, messing things up, and making a fool of myself pronouncing words in my accent. 

It was late at night too so I guess I just didn’t have the brainpower to really control myself and be calm. She said it was fun, and initiated a call with me after the voice chat started to get busier with others, so I assume she wasn’t actually that put off by me.

But it still makes me anxious. I wish wish wish I didn’t do it, and I can’t undo it. I don’t want her to read my messages in my dumb voice or take me less seriously now, and I feel less motivated to post on the site because I’ve done this. 

I just want to forget about it and carry on as normal, but it’s stuck in my head and I can’t stop thinking about it and getting embarrassed at myself. How do I manage these feelings and carry on? I really want to enjoy my discord and website again, but right now it just stresses me out to think about. I really like this person, and I hate that I have them a stupid image of me.

557,"So my boyfriend and I had a discussion over his lack of boundaries and lying to me about his hookups. Original post describing what he would do [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/g5wtoe/does_my_boyfriend_not_understand_boundaries_or_am/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

My boyfriend basically told me how he didn’t understand that stuff was considered “crossing boundaries” and he apologized. He cut those women out of his life and said he will never do it again, and this entire relationship has been a learning process for him because he’s never been in such a committed relationship before. I decided to give him one last chance to really work this out, as he finally realized that I was serious about leaving him if this behavior doesn’t stop. However there’s one thing I can’t stop thinking about: his parents.

So basically during our discussion, he told me how he went to his parents for advice on our situation. This is a pretty big deal, as he has a pretty poor connection to them and has never spoken to them about relationships before. They didn’t even know about his past, and before he spoke to them believed I was his first girlfriend. He explained our situation to them and I’m upset at their responses. He told me they called me (1) jealous, (2) ungrateful because of all the money he spends on me and does for me, and (3) his mother said that since we’ve had sex, there’s a connection between us and I’m less likely to leave. 

I believe that it’s 2 things: either my bf did a poor job of explaining the situation to them and they don’t see the full picture, or they have no respect for me whatsoever. I was particularly appalled by their comment on money. At the beginning of our relationship I would spend hundreds buying his mother gifts for her birthday, holidays, random flowers, etc. because in-laws are very important to me. I make far less money than my bf and it was a very big sacrifice for me, not to mention that he is a man, I expect him to drive me around and pay for dates. But I’m also shocked by what they are teaching him. Do they not see this as an issue at all? Are they teaching him that you can do whatever you want as long as you are the breadwinner? Also, my parents are extremely accepting and supportive of my bf. They give him life advice, invite him to family events, but not a single time have I ever been to any of my bf family events except one Christmas party. His mother especially seems unaccepting of me. She speaks Spanish and a little bit of English so I understand language barrier being an issue, but when I would meet her she says little more than respond superficially to my questions of how was her day etc. and doesn’t make an effort to get to know me. However my mom speaks mostly Russian but she still makes an effort to only speak English around my bf so he doesn’t feel excluded and tries to initiate conversation with him all the time. I am trying to learn Spanish to better connect with his family but I just feel so disrespected by what they said regarding our situation.

(A bit of background: his mom is a housewife and his dad is the breadwinner, so they are probably used to this dynamic of the man doing what he wants while the woman obediently listens. From the stories I hear, his mom has little say in the household and always just listens to the father. However I made it clear to my bf that while I am ok with being a housewife, that is not the dynamic I will accept in my family, if anything I am used to the woman having a greater say over children/family situations.)

I made this clear to my boyfriend and he says he understands and disagrees with what they said, and he admitted he could of done a better job explaining the situation from my perspective. But I still can’t get over what they said and I think about it every day. I hate myself for spending so much money and effort on his mother who called me jealous and ungrateful, and then expected me to stay committed to her son since we had sex while making no comments on his casual hookups with two other women. What the hell? It’s ok for him to not view sex as sacred but I have to? What do I do to stop thinking about what they said? I lost absolutely all respect for his parents and hate how they are raising his son to view relationships, and I hate how disrespectful they are to me. I don’t know what to do. 

I really love my boyfriend and I want this to work. He seems like he’s trying to change his ways and I don’t want some outside factor like his parents to ruin our relationship and progress we can make. How do I get over his parents?

558,"This is my first post so be patient with all my mistakes and drawn out story. Little background about me I’m in my mid 20s and my mom is in her early 60s. She has been with and living in this mans house for about 10 years and they are the same age. My mom takes care of him and waits on him hand and foot since they have been in a relationship because he got injured on his job. This injury was not bad enough that he couldn’t do everyday tasks it’s just he got used to being taken care of without him doing anything for himself. In the early years of their relationship she happen to “steal” money from him to pay for things such as groceries and bills for the household. I was in high school at the time living with them both, when the man found out about the money he kicked me and my mom out forcing us to be homeless. Eventually he let us come back but since that year he became very verbal and mentally abusive towards my mom. Also a fact about him since he became disabled he has been hooked on pain meds and continues to use god knows what kind of recreational drugs such as coke etc. No matter the fact that she payed back all the money and continued to take care of him he would still yell profanity, call her names, etc. When I left to go to college I cut all ties with her boyfriend not wanting any kind of relationship with him but still was very close with my mom. The last 2 years though have been rough on me. Her boyfriend kicked her out twice and those two times she came and visited me via train to my apartment where I also live with my own boyfriend. Currently she is staying with me again because her boyfriend was pushing her away by saying he wanted to start dating other people and that he thought their relationship was a waste. He also went as far as to leave threatening voicemails on both mine and my moms phones saying he was going to come find us and harm us. We contacted the police and district attorney but crazy enough they can’t help until he actually shows up here even though he has guns. Several people have tried to get my mom to listen to reason about cutting contact completely with her boyfriend but nothing seems to get through to him no matter how bad he treats her. She even went as far as to tell me that if my boyfriend was being abusive to me that she wouldn’t intervene because it’s my personal life. That broke my heart because that was not my mom saying that, that felt like a complete stranger who didn’t seem to care about me at all. All I have in my life as far as family is my mom and I have tried everything it seems such as helping her re create a new life in my state and trying to get her an apartment, job etc. but she told me last night that she would never be happy anywhere but back with him. That was also a heartbreak to me because she isn’t even trying to give a new life where I live a chance. I have my own mental health issues and her and her boyfriend go through these kinds of problems every year that I don’t know how I can deal with it anymore. I want to be there for her and help her because she is my only parent but if she doesn’t want to try and get out of her abusive relationship then I don’t know what else to do. I’m heartbroken and afraid that if she ever goes back to him he will harm her physically and that I’ll never see my mom again. I want to give her tough love but I don’t want to lose the close relationship we have. It’s like I’m hitting a brick wall and anyone who has been through something similar I would just like some advice or anything because I feel so alone in this world and thinking that I could lose my mom over her abusive relationship is killing me inside.

She just sent these messages. I marked it as ""unread"" and haven't replied yet because I don't want to be a sucker and give up my self respect because she broke up with me and I still liked her. And would probably date her again.

Anyway... what do these messages mean?

Are they just friendly hellos? Or what else?

Here's a screenshot. Thanks for your help.

560,"So I live with my parents, (and i’m still in school so please keep that in mind) and i don’t feel like i have any privacy. my mom will just randomly knock on my door, and will get super suspicious when i close my laptop when she comes in. they also check my phone randomly(texts, who follows me online, all my social media, pretty much everything). i know they’re just trying to keep me safe, but i know what to do and what not to do.  they have also threatened to take my door off the hinges because i locked it.(i lock it because no one knocks(except my dad), even when i could be changing, or on a call with my friends) they also always demand that i tell them who i’m texting, &amp; tell me they might check who my brother is texting when he won’t tell them.(they know how to hack our devices, i’m not kidding they’ve done it before.) basically, due to all of that, i don’t feel like i have any privacy, and i need to know how to tell them i want more. i know if i just straight up ask them they’ll ask why and if i was doing anything that needed more privacy, then say no. any other ideas?",06May2020,1
561,"I have been wondering recently whether I watch too much pornography. I Masturbate about every 2 days, sometimes 3 if I'm tired.

I have been watching porn for a few years. (I'm almost 19 now). I'm a pretty shy guy and I haven't been in a relationship yet. I've read before that watching porn can ruin interactions with other people.

I watch porn every time I masturbate, and I am now wondering that it may affect any future relationships. I do really want to have someone to be close too, and I don't feel as though I need to watch porn, but I'm not sure anymore.

I can finish without it, but I usually don't have a reason to not watch it.

I know that porn is a very unrealistic, and not at all what relationships are like.

Do I have a problem? Could this be a big problem that I can't see yet.?",06May2020,1
563,"This may sound so selfish, but I have been diagnosed with mental illnesses that have stopped me from opening up, yet my friend always encourages me to open up, and I do, no matter how painful and horrible it feels. Now she’s going through a tough time and has taken the route of completely ignoring me. She’ll say something along the lines of “I feel empty I’m sorry” and delete all of her apps that allow me to communicate with her, leaving me completely in the dark. Today I had spent the whole day messaging her crying because I thought she had hurt herself. She replied 8 hours later saying “I’m sorry I deleted my apps, I didn’t mean to worry you”. I find this extremely selfish because I’ve told her I’ve had to fight the urges of ignoring everybody but I don’t do so, because quite frankly, it’s a horrible thing to do. I’m angry because she won’t elaborate and won’t even let me TRY to help or talk to her. She was always bob the builder when it came to my problems, but when it comes to her, she’s fine letting me think she’s dead in a bathtub for more than eight hours. Do I have the right to be angry?",06May2020,1
564,"My ex [M 23] and I broke up April of last year after I found out he was cheating on me, just a month after I suffered a miscarriage. As far as I know he was cheating when he returned to school in January, I couldn’t because I was still fighting for my life after developing sepsis. My ex of course lied to me for months while he cheated. Whenever I lied, it was something small. I never cheated but I would lie about walking to the store with a guy friend because he would get so controlling and accuse me of cheating. He can also become very angry and has been physical with me more than one time. 

So since we’re trying to patch the relationship up (to start off as friends), we’ve said we should be honest with each other. He’ll say he’s only given oral to 1 girl, and then he’ll ask me how many I’ve given oral to. But I know how he gets when he’s mad so I’ll lie, telling myself I’ll take it to my grave, but then weeks later he’ll ask again and I’ll tell myself I need to be honest, and I say 2 when I know it’s been 3/4. But he told me he’s performed oral sex on 1 girl, but once I say a number, he turns around and says he was lying about that 1 girl. He’ll lie to get me to feel comfortable enough to tell the truth.

I know lying is bad, and I HATE HATE HATE doing it. I just don’t want to how to stop. We’re both single but I still feel obligated to be honest with him. But the other part of me, says I don’t owe him that honest. I just try not to make him mad so I can enjoy my day. He can turn my day upside down so fast.",06May2020,1

568,"Background:  been with my wife 15 years, 2 kids. She knows how many people I slept with before her, but I purposely told her not to tell me about her past as I have experienced jealousy in past relationships. I knew about 3-4, including one random hookup of hers, but it never bothered me and I never thought about it. Recently, I found out about a guy she slept with 5 years before I met her, a one night stand. Ever since, I can’t stop thinking about it. I can’t sleep, my stomach hurts, mind racing. Her phone is linked to our shared computer, so I can see her texts and social media. I actually found out about the guy when I was using the computer and a chat with her friends about how she recently ran into the guy at Tim Horton’s, and how awkward it was. Ever since, I’ve been stalking her social media, scouring her old posts, analyzing every little comment. In my head, I have her sleeping with 100s of guys, even though I logically think it’s less than 10, and fewer than my number. I need help. Anyone have any good coping techniques to stop obsessing? I don’t think I can bring it up to her because of the way I found out. Any suggestions on inoccuous conversation starters I can use to guide the subject there? At this point, I think I would be better off knowing the real number so I can stop obsessing.",06May2020,1
569,"Hey, I'm 18, male which might be important

Lately I've been growing more and more lonely, always been but it's getting worse. I randomly remembered that I had this beautiful girl in my middle school who tried approaching me when I was 15(last grade of middle school, I'm from Poland). At the time I got scared by concept of girl wanting me I think, I'm not sure honestly but oh how dumb I was

Lately I realized that her humor was right up my alley, as mentioned already she's beautiful, and most importantly, she's smart as fuck. I swear, she might be the smartest person I've ever met. Also kind of emotional as I remember it. So basically everything was perfect, I don't know what I was thinking, or not thinking.

Anyway, my psychologist suggested texting her, obviously she did that in her own way asking why do I think it's not cool to text her like that out of the blue.

And so we are here, do you think it's creepy or just not cool to randomly text her? I mean as far as I know she's got a group of friends, BF and some plans for life while I'm being me, lonely nerd lost in all this life going on. If anything, I feel like I would be a minor acquiantance for few days at best which would only make thing between us awkward.",06May2020,1

571,"So I'm a fairly ambitious person. My goal is to get my undergrad in medical ethics and become a medical lawyers. My parents are highly religious people and don't want me in a ""liberal, atheist environment"". They are dead set on me going to a Christian college in Missouri of all places (we're from the north) that doesn't have my major or anything I'm remotely interested in. My mom's excuse is that I might change my mind about my major. She's also said lawyers are mostly despicable people who just want money. She's always said I can do whatever I want, but then turns down the one thing I'm really passionate about. I've tried to explain that I won't change my beliefs, that hundreds of people I know have gone to normal colleges without ending up as atheists (no shade to them) and I don't have an impressionable character at all! My family has been borderline verbally abusive and I really can't take four more years living at home, but I don't want to go to a college that I don't like. I've cried the past few days about it (we got into a big argument a few days ago) and I don't know what to do. Another problem: I'll be 17 when I start college because I'm the youngest in my grade.

574,"I'm currently in 11th grade. A year later I'll enter the university entrance exam. I want to study now and decide what I want to do later but it's not possible. In my country we have to decide on which lessons we want to take at high school. There are 4 main ones. First one involves Mathematics and science. The second one has literature, history, geography etc. The third one is a mix of both and the fourth one is mainly about languages.

I selected the first one because I wanted to major in physics but now that I think about it, do I really want to study physics? I am interested in reading about it and watching videos etc. but is this the extent of my interest? I'm not sure.

Some friends and family say that I should just change my  class to language and select a new major because my English is fairly good so the entrance exam will be easy and I have a study problem. I don't study enough but that's a problem for another day.

I don't like to study language. Yes I am interested in learning new languages but I don't think that it'll be a viable job in the future. It's just a hobby to me.

I have to decide on a class because changing classes in the future will be difficult as I will have new subjects.

575,"Back story: me and their father have been separated for about 8 months. We both moved on pretty quickly but the divorce and separation was ugly. I have been with this new person for about 7 months. My kids have met him one time, they are 5 and 2 years old. Obviously the oldest understands more and has heard their father talking badly about my new partner multiple times (he has never met him and even reactivated an old social media account just to harass and insult him). I feel like my daughter already has this bad picture painted in her head of someone she barely knows. I have never been treated so good in my life and fully believe that if me and this person were long term enough, he would be a good male figure in their lives and love them like they were his own kids. In fact, he has actually expressed that he would learn to do just that. I’m terrified my oldest daughter is going to hate him or be rude to him over things her father has said. I bring him up casually and am trying to take things slow as to not overwhelm anyone seeing as they have never seen me with anyone but their father and I have never been in a relationship with anyone but their father, and my new partner has never been with someone who has kids. I feel like things are off to a bad start between him and my kids simply for the fact their father has bad mouthed him in front of them and it’s probably confusing for them.

578,"To make a long story short, I am trying to pass a drug test for a new job.

I took the first drug test last week but it came back diluted because I drank a lot of water to ensure that I had to go.

So the employer called me again and told me I had to retake it but don’t drink a lot of water so it doesn’t come back diluted. I don’t do drugs or anything like that but my issue is that I literally only have to go in the morning and in the afternoon after the time the testing  place is closed. 

So this morning I woke up and was like I’m going to hold it until I get to the testing place, well that didn’t work because I damn near pissed myself just trying to get ready to leave. Lmao so I went to the bathroom. 

So I’m just trying to figure out how do I ensure that I can go to the bathroom when I get there. I was searching online and it said not to drink a lot of caffeine?

580,"So little background story on me. I(F18) and my parents have an okay relationship. I'm not their favourite child but it's not so bad between us right now.
 When I was growing up though, it was really terrible. My father is a little narcissistic, he never gave me any privacy and I always got punished whenever I tried to demand for some, I don't want to go into much detail but as a teenager, my room door had no keys, the bathroom door key was taken from me, throughout my high-school i had no Internet phone, just a small phone they used to contact me and anytime I got any messages my dad had to read it first, if it was from a boy I was in big trouble. Trouble meaning my dad will threaten to follow me to school and find the boy and warn him to stay away from me. He did it twice...They basically tried to cut me from the outside world as much as possible. He also beat me multiple times for 'talking to boys'. I didn't even have any relationships through out high-school but all that is gone now and I've forgiven them. 
 Here's the main thing, I have a brother who graduates in a few months and if I tell you that every single day that he spent in university away from home, they spoke to him not less than twice a day, I'm not joking.
They call him morning and night to 'check up on him'. This may seem harmless but it's a sick way of monitoring someone's life cause if they can't reach him, they'll begin to call the numbers of all his friends one by one till they get a hold of him, then they'll proceed to yell at him for not caring about them enough to call or for making them scared by not picking up his calls, you know, make him feel very guilty and throw in some reverse psychology, so he'll keep on apologising and all that. He's their star child and even though he has told me that he is frustrated by it, he's 21 now, he can't stand up to them and tell them to stop.
I on the other hand just got into college this year and I'm 18, watching them do all of this to him when I was still at home, I've made up my mind that it won't happen to me.
They basically call every day 'checking up on you' by asking for details of everything you did that day, how many new friends you've made, it's worse with me because my dad keeps asking if any boy has tried to 'talk' to me which frankly is NONE of his business.
It has been getting on my nerves and I've been thinking of a way to make it stop without being rude or causing a fight. Fast forward to yesterday evening, I was doing an assignment when I got a call from my mum telling me that my dad is angry that I didn't call to greet him since morning. I almost flipped right there because I just called him the day before and frankly I was going to call after the assignment but I lost track of time I told him I was busy and ended the call. Now they're acting cold towards me. I believe this is just manipulation so I want to end it now before it's too late but I don't want it to be a huge argument. It's not like I don't want to talk to them anymore but twice or thrice a week is logical. They call me morning and night. Sometimes more than that. Its not even voice calls, video calls so they can see where I am and if I'm at home. Let's say as I'm talking to them and my eyes wander towards my door, they'll ask me to flip the camera to see if there's anyone in my room. I just want y'all to understand how sick this is. 
Please I'd appreciate any ideas on how to tell them to stop. Thank you

581,"At school before the pandemic, I was doing well in every subject (with the exception of Spanish, but I'll talk about that later). Once coronavirus forced schools to shut down all my work was moved online, to google classrooms. Recently, I have been struggling to complete any work. All my motivation gone, I am sat in a chair 8 hours a day staring at my work, not doing it. I am just scraping by in most subjects, however my main problem is Spanish. I used to be great at Spanish, however in recent years my interest in it declined to nothing. I live in the UK and am doing my GCSEs, and because I was a top Spanish student they made me take Spanish as a GCSE, even though I really didn't want to. I feel like I'm too far in to talk to anyone about dropping the subject, and if I were to pick up another one in it's place I'd be too far behind. I have huge gaps in my knowledge no one else in my class seems to have, and the online learning has made this hundreds of times worse.

I am used to being a good student, who would constantly get good scores on tests and good grades, however in the recent years I have grown to hate Spanish, and I detest studying it. This means my academic progress in the subject has been close to none, with the factors of online learning included, I am learning nothing and the subject is taking a huge toll on my mental health. I don't know how to deal with this. I have tried and tried, however I'm so far behind now that looking at the power points they give me I can't read a single word. In the last few weeks I have been constantly only being able to think about how if I don't get top scores like everyone else in my family did, I will have a shit life. I hate the subject so much, yet they made me choose it as one of my 4 subjects I want to keep learning to set me up for the rest of my fucking life. I am getting along in all of my subjects enough, however not this one. It is only getting worse. I have no idea what to do anymore about this problem.",06May2020,1

What is the right thing to do? 

On one hand, I do not mind not running for the role. I could find something else to do with my time, and I do not want to become the women's officer through hindering other women. The purpose is to support the community, so it seems pointless to try to do so by compromising someone else. 

But it raised a broader question that I will probably encounter in the future: is competition between women unhealthy? I can't fully articulate why, but something seems off with the idea of avoiding opportunities to give others a chance.

My life growing up was great. My parents got a divorce the first time when i was 3 got back together when I was 8 and had my younger sister and then got their last divorce in 2015. They always stayed friends. Never hated each other. My mom and I never really had a close relationship. She would constantly and still control my future and decides whatever she wants. Here’s the thing. My mom has a boyfriend who lives on her street, who lives with us. They been dating for 2 years. I loved him in beginning. Because I’m not as close to my dad or at least my mom tries to make him look like THR bad guy and convince me He is. My mom bf has a son who is the same age as My younger sister. My mom bf used to drink lot before easter for 2 years. He used to act ridiculous. Their would be so much fights. On Easter my mom and him got drunk. Due to corona it felt like not even easter. After dinner I went to my room to ft my grandma, I went out to kitchen to grab water, and I see my mom laying on the couch and her bf sitting on the ground. I seen my mom bf drunk so many times. But my younger sis never seen both of them drunk before. My mom kept saying “ I’m going to throw up” she went up to her room. My mom bf ( jimmy) asked me to bring my sister to bed. So I did, and my sister had a panic attack, she was crying and felt so scared. She told me she doesn’t like when they act like this. I told my mom her daughter was crying and obvi she ignored it. They both left the kitchen a mess so I had to clean it up. My mom doesn’t get drunk, she gets tipsy. One night while back both of them were drunk. They got mad at me for no reason. My mom bf got into my face and called me ass hold and said don’t make me come at you. I was having panic attack. My mom usually is the one who calms me down. But she didn’t stop jimmy from screaming at me. Ever since recently I seen my mom drink more than jimmy. Which is weird because before it was jimmy who drank more. Last night. My mom and jimmy invited my dad for dinner. ( they all friends) my mom got drunk last night. I was sitting at the island table with my dad and sister. We were just talking about random things. Jimmy was cooking outside and the screen door was open. My mom was complaining about her wanting to throw up, her feeling sick, and how much wine she had. ( she was over her neighbors house drinking) I asked my mom of jimmy was making grilled chicken too, because I was going to have it for tmr lunch too. Then I went into my room to charge my phone. My mom followed me and said to me “ stop going behind my back” “ jimmy told me you were talking shit about me” I wasn’t going to sit there and get blamed for something I didn’t do. So I went up to jimmy and stood up for myself. I said” I don’t know what you telling my mom? But I was talking about art with my dad, and asking my mom if you making grill chicken, Buy I wasn’t going behind my mom back and talking about her. Jimmy thought I was talking about drinking to my dad, when I wasn’t. Jimmy said “ I’m done with this bullshit. He left taking his son. Their house is on street with us. My mom told me “ look what you did, couldn’t keep your mouth shut.” Then she got into my face and swing at me, my dad told her to stop. My sister was crying. I told her I did nothing wrong. She told me “ I’m a mistake” “ I’m a bitch” “ something is wrong with me” my dad left to meet his gf. My mom kept screaming at me. She went to bed without putting my sister to bed. I went upstairs finding my sister under her covers shivering and crying. It breaks my heart because she getting older and seeing this. I tucked her into bed. This is the second time my sister is crying over this and is scared. I went down stairs, and table was still set up, food was out, everything was untouched. My little sister didn’t eat dinner, I didn’t eat dinner. I was being blamed for nothing. My mom gets mad at me for talking to my big sister about things. So I never tell my sister anything because my mom somehow finds out and gets so angry. She thinks my older sister will start drama and stir it up. But she is my sister and needed to talk to someone. I feel so alone at this house. My mom has jimmy and my sister has my mom bf son. Barely no one talks to me in house.

584,"I started working when I was 16 because my parents weren't well off. Around 17 I dropped out of school because my dad lost his job and they needed help. Worked in a Video store and did that for 2 years before I started working for this Screen Printing company. This was the first proper company I worked for and was the first time I was interested in something. I learned everything I could there and it really felt good.

But the owner of the company died and I lost my job. Started looking for a new job in the same line but no one was hiring. I seriously looked for months, just trying to get any job and nothing. Eventually I decided to start my own company. 
I had no money and no shop, nothing but I still had a place to stay with my parents and so I cleaned up the garage and stared setting up a studio. No one had a car so it was fine for me to use the garage. I actually built the equipment out of wood and parts laying around and then started to try get clients. The equipment actually worked pretty well for about a year but eventually I found a second-hand printer online for a reasonable price. In the first year I got a few orders, just enough to survive but I was on the verge of shutting it down. The next year was a bit better but nothing special. I had dreams of eventually having a shop and having someone work with me, but things just weren't getting there. I did this for about 8 years of my life but things didn't get better, I seemed to now be getting more work but it still was just not going anywhere. I actually ended up in the hospital because I was burnt out. I started going through Sevier depression, started killing myself just to survive. I was at this point living in an apartment next door to my parents, lived there with my long time girlfriend, we had been together since high school. I decided I should look for another job, I had so much experience I figured I should be able to find a job. This did not happen and so I carried on. In 2017 I ended up in the hospital again, this time I passed out, was out for a day and my body was rejecting my lifestyle. At this point I was working 18 hours a day and sleeping 5 hours then repeat. I was completely burnt out again and deeply depressed. My long time girlfriend left me and moved overseas and I was just done.

I gave up everything. I stopped doing anything. I just slept all day, didn't eat and was just empty inside. My friends and family were there for me, they tried to help the best they could and eventually I started improving. I actually changed my mindset. I started exercising, eating healthy sleeping properly and just trying to improve my life.

I decided I would work on my business again. But to grow it, to hire people and to expand and I slowly things started to work out, I got a few more clients, bought new equipment to speed up the process, interviewed potential staff and stated looking into a new location. 

Then Covid-19 happened. We had a shutdown for 5 weeks. In that time I lost all my clients due to them either closing down or just not having money to continue working with me. I myself have used everything I had to buy food and have nothing left. I've spoken to a few potential customers but everyone is very hesitant to get printing now.

I have been printing for 15 years, I am really good at it, the quality of printing is superior to big name companies and yet I just can't catch a break because I am not a well know company. I literally started from the ground up, I gave part of my self to this company and now I just feel finished. I have nothing left to give.

I am sorry for everyone the virus has affected. I just needed to rant. And maybe someone out there gets what I'm saying.",06May2020,2

I think it is logical to assume my usual sources of cheap dopamine are gone so my brain is rewiring and currently running on no dopamine. I would never but the past 15 days I've wanted to kill myself. I graduate college in dec 20' in bio and live at home. I can't talk to my mom about anything really I just can't communicate with her about this stuff. I feel very isolated and I'm ok with that but I want someone to care and help me figure out what I'm doing w my life. I'm considering applying to continue my schooling and get a master of science in applied mathematics because I spent 3 years studying engineering and love math. But I really have no reason behind anything I'm doing. 

I have alot of issues inside me but I feel like but I do a great job of controlling it and I pray everyday for peace and patience.

586,"I’m 20 years old with quite a bit of extra cash at the moment. And I’m also living with my mom. Expenses are low at the moment and should stay this way for many more years as my mom has welcomed me to stay home as long as I like. 

I need a good car and I think a tesla model 3 is a fine investment. I would take out a loan on it and pay it off over the course of 72 months netting about a $45,000. Obviously a tesla returns about $2000 of gas annually and they seem to almost be appreciating as even the oldest models are as updated as the newest models. 

So I ask. Is this a good idea? or should I just save my money for investing in something that might return faster. 

Thanks🤟",06May2020,1
587,"Hello, i am currently facing huge moral issue within myself and i just do not know how to proceed.

I currently have a flat and my mum lives with me, this has been the situation for 7 years. 3 years ago i got a girlfriend and we are now at the stage to be living with each other and to progress our relationship. My mum recently invested her money into my sisters house, which has 3 bedrooms and they plan to build an annex so she can live there. However my girlfriend is getting annoyed and wants me to push more to get my mum to move to my sisters now, and logically this seems fine but morally it just feels wrong to me.

I live in a one bedroom flat, my mum lives in the living room, she has her own bed etc so it is basically a bedroom. My sisters new place is massive in comparison, she has a fiancee and a 1 year old, so there is a spare room, there is also two living rooms.

For the last year i have expressed to my mum i want to now live with my girlfriend and whilst they were looking for houses, the key feature needed to be an already built annex, however my sister got her own way and they got one without the annex, so now i need to wait even longer for one to be built.

Back in January i blew up at my mum and basically had a melt down at her, and we came to the conclusion she would move in within the next few months and she could take one of their many rooms, however due to COVID-19 this was obviously been pushed back.

I am now in isolation at my girlfriends family home and my mum is at my sisters, it was my understanding that once this had all partially blown over she would be moving there, however recently she has been going back to her old saying, ""when the annex is built"". She is not happy living with my sister, she has told me as much and i do feel guilty.

Me and my mum have a strange relationship, i would consider her a friend. I had a troubled youth due to my father leaving, and did on several occasions try to kill myself, she was the one always there. So i do feel like i'm backstabbing her.

So the current situation is basically this; My girlfriend is putting me under immense pressure to basically tell my mum once this is all over you need to be gone and my mum is playing dumb and is i think wanting me to be harsh and tell her she needs to be gone, i think she knows how hard it is for me to be like that with her.

I do feel like my girlfriend is not understanding how hard this is for me, she has told all her family, VERY prematurely she is moving in with me, she is picking paint colors, furniture etc, which is fine, i dont mind that so much, i just feel like she wants this instantly, and is not appreciating the current situation. She is not the biggest of fans of my family and does think they take advantage of me.

So, should i be feeling guilty? Is my girlfriend being unfair? I'm honestly lost at this point, and it seems easier to just go into hiding and start a new life than have any of these conversations.",06May2020,1

589,"My husband and I (26, M and F) have been together since 2011. We got married in 2017. TL;DR at the end.

Hes known for our entire relationship that I am bisexual desipe never having been with a woman. It was just something I knew about myself. I never felt deprived of an experience and I have always been happy with our relationship. There have been speedbumps along the way but no relationship is perfect. 

A couple years before we got married, he suggested a same room, couple swap thing. I was hesitant but we had good communication about the whole thing. We found a couple on reddit about our age and had a really great time. I checked it off my bucket list and moved on. We occasionally looked for another experience but nothing stood out to us and I wasn't comfortable with a lot. We had one more experience, a MMF threesome which I agreed to because I thought it was something I wanted to do. 

That experience wasn't as great. My now husband didnt seem very interested and the guy we met up with was older and more experienced. I felt like I couldnt say what I wanted and I felt used (and sore). I felt pressure to enjoy it because its ""what i wanted"". He and I have since talked about that experience and my feelings. He was very supportive of me and never wanted it to be a negative experience. I told him I wanted to stop and he agreed. I never felt pressured to continue. 

A year or so ago, my husband made friends with a regular customer at his job. This guy is bisexual, married to a really nice woman, has 3 great kids. I've met him in passing once or twice so we all know each other at face value. He has a very vocal and obvious attraction to my husband. It seemed harmless enough and my husband never crossed any boundaries with him. This friend is in a poly relationship and has spoken with my husband about that. In return, my husband talked about our swinging experiences. The friend mentioned to him that if we we wanted to swing again, he and his wife were open/interested/available. I forget exactly how he phrased it. 

Now, in 2020, I am much happier with myself, my relationship, and everything. I go to therapy and have talked about the threesome that I didnt like. I take my medication everyday. I really feel ""normal"" again and I wanted to do another swap. He still talks to this friend so I asked if the invitation was still open. My husband jumped on it but his feelings were different. In the past, it was all about seeing me with another girl, fulfilling my desire to be with a woman so I wasn't ""deprived"" of my bisexual feelings, and how hot it would be to look over at each other while being with someone else. 

In the most recent conversations, my husband has only engaged the husband in conversation and has included things like ""I know my wife would love to see me with another dude. I've been wanted to go slow and try certain things first"". I get the distinct impression that this experience would be for his exploration. I'm ok with that- I just wish he would talk to me about it before saying those kinds of things in the chat. For any kind of swinging to be successful (in my opinion) there has to be communication and CLEAR expectations about what is going to happen. 

I want to ask him if he's been questioning his identity. I certainly wish someone had that conversation with me but I worry that he'll get embarassed/defensive. He had a very traumatic childhood- abused at home and bullied at school. I dont want to interrogate him but I would like to make sure that he knows I support him and that we're on the same page. 

TL;DR: Husband and I would like to have another swinging experience. He's been showing signs (I think) of being bisexual/questioning his sexuality that I want to be supportive of. Do I ask him about it? How do I ask him about it?",06May2020,1
591,"I notice men will call me the same things every time they show interest. I’m a prostitute to them, and sometimes worse. It’s like their getting cursed upon contact with me or someone I’m with when they talk about me. It’s okay and then gets worse. They walk away casually but I’m sure their scared sometimes. I cannot explain it. Down inside their words have affected me, I don’t want expensive things, people always want me to be your side chick and I won’t allow that, and I already know an abuse man from one who isn’t because my brain will pick on that you are.

I know my grandpa now has severe parkinson's disease and suffers from pain everyday. They're under at-home care from my uncle who doesn't properly take care of them and just collects the pay from the government as a family caretaker.

I finally gave my grandparents a call, a month after I got the number from my mom, after not talking to them for over a year. I waited so long because I was afraid of what I might hear and knowing my useless, inability to do much right now. I'm still in undergrad and I do have savings from all my summer jobs (which currently total to about 10k) after paying for my cost of attending college, but I don't know if that's enough to afford hospice care or whatever my grandpa needs.

I tell him I miss him and I will soon be out of school and in the workplace (I'm optimistic) to make money and support him but he's really waiting to die.

once that happened the husband said to “go my baby” and just kept saying that. my best friend and I both tried to reassure him that the baby is find and he literally just had a bottle so he was just sleeping but he just kept saying go get my baby. and then proceeded to say that my best friend told him that she never wanted my mom to be around her baby. I couldn’t believe that he said that and that she felt that way but never talked to me about it. they were supposed to be coming over to be supportive since hearing about my dads condition. 

a couple days later I texted her about it saying how I respect you guy’s opinion and my mom and I would never put their child in any danger and i’m sorry. she never texted back but had her husband text me saying sorry and that their new parents and can’t trust their own family memebers alone with the baby. which i understand, being a new parent can be scary and always worrying about your baby.

618," Hello Everyone! 

I have been thinking about posting here for a really long time and I finally got the courage to do so. I could really use some advice on what path to choose as they are very different and will both be life-changing. 

So as the title says I have a chance to be a pro footballer ( soccer ) player. I was playing D1 soccer and had the chance to sign with an agent so I ended up dropping out of college. I have been with this agency for about 5 months and it has been going really well. I have had some interest from a few lower-division teams. I feel like the highest level I can reach is USL 2nd division in the US and maybe a back up in the MLS 1st division US or some leagues overseas.  Football has been my life and has made me who I am I mean I can't even tell you how much it means to me and how hard I have worked. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then Covid 19 came and all the leads went away with the teams I was talking too. I was too stressed because in this world things come and go and you have to be able to focus on the opportunity. So because there has been no movement with teams there is a lot of free time after my training and workouts. So I decided to take classes to get my Real Estate classes because I know I can't play soccer forever if I reach the pro level and I have always liked Real Estate. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I've been taking these classes, and one of my friends finds out about me taking my classes and spoke to a broker for me without me knowing.  I ended up getting a call about 3 weeks later from this broker and it turns out they really liked what my friend had to say. He asked me to come in for an interview and I did because I figured I am young and it would be good training for after football is over. It turns out that it is a very very successful brokerage I mean Wall Street Journal has done articles on them, they work with some of the Sharks from Shark Tank ect.

Fast-forwarding they offered me a job. This is where I need your guys to help. It has been keeping me up at night and I have such a hard time deciding what to do. I know I am very lucky to even have this problem and I feel stupid posting this but this is what has been on my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Football**

If I end up choosing to still go after football it may or may not work out but I also understand that is with anything in life. Football is what makes me feel alive and I know I won't be making millions more like 30-40k a year maybe a little higher. For me tho the money wouldn't matter I mean I am playing football for a living that's all I need.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then sometimes I end up thinking this 

&amp;#x200B;

**Real Estate**  

If I do Real Estate I will be able to work with people who will help me grow and help me build and create wealth long term. I am really into investing and real estate investing so I would be able to hit those checks in terms of importance to me. I also grew up really poor so the idea of being financially independent is really nice.  But then I think I am just selling my life for money and that doesn't sit well with me. I also feel like a failure and I am not sure why I have done a lot of souls searching and all this keeps coming back. My family and friends are all for Real Estate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I have never been a real person if that makes sense I love the idea of building a life you truly love and following your heart instead of money. This is by far the hardest choice I have had to make. Does anyone have advice on what I should do?",06May2020,1
619,"I (11M) am suffering with the quarantine, in my country we can't see anyone which is terrible because I can't see friends which sounds babyish but my friends were the people that kept me happy.

The main thing is my school work, I'm getting a lot of work and I'm behind, I'm doing work for 6 hours a day but I can't seem to get as much done as I would in school. I wake up then workout then straight away go and do work then come down for dinner and relax.

Also my sleep schedule is messed up. I will normally head to bed at 9:30 and be asleep by 10:30 now I can't fall asleep untill midnight and if I do fall asleep normally I'll wake up at 5 in the morning and I can't go back to sleep

621,"Hello all, 

Ive been doing a lot of thinking about my current living situation and wanted some outsiders opinons on how/if I should do anything. I will try to give all the details. its a very long story so only read if you have some time lol.

Im currently 1 year out of college. I work as an engineer for a great company. I am on a roational program where every 6 months I move to different location. I completed my first 6 months and have since moved to my 2nd location. In this 2nd location one of my very good friends (23 M) lives here/works for the same company, so it was going to be a no brainer we were going to try and live together for my 6 months in this 2nd location 

Originaly I thought about buying a condo, then we discussed renting some apartment for a 6 month lease, and my friend ended up buying a house. So we decided that that he would be the owner and I would rent from him. we settled on a price $xxxx for the duration of the 6 months I would be there. it was a good price where the both of us would benefit.

1. When I finally moved to the 2nd location we first lived together in his 1 bed apartment for 3 weeks before he closed on the house. in this time I was sleeping on his kitchen floor on an air matress. Not great but not bad. I finally get to see the house and its a pretty great house for the stage of life we are in. I knew it was a fixer upper and that most of my rent would be going towards upgrades and that we'd be doing some of the work. but the house needed A LOT of work.
2. Another thing that started to bother me. 1 week before moving into the house my friend dislocates his shoulder (very unfortuante). This was tough because he was basically useless and Expected me to completely move him and his stuff out of the apartment and into his house for the following 3 weeks during this time the house looked like a warzone. His parents where around on the weekends which was nice sometimes to help with renovations but most of the time it just felt like if they were ""working"" I had to be working  
3. At this point we (him) are moved in fully. We are knocking down walls, ripping down plaster, drywalling, doing tons of labor intensive work. We work together. We both have some experience in contrustion/renovations so its going alright. Sometimes I feel as if I have to fix his mistakes. AND the house is still a warzone. So I go to my regular job and then come home and work on this house for 2-3 hours a night. my friends shoulder is better for the most part. we some what argue over design decsions. But truly, he asks for my opinon, I give it, and then he tries to get me to agree with his opinon. 
4. After 4 weeks of living in the house putting in over 80+ hours of work on it. We still dont have a couch and this is killing me. So my friend asks me if I want to put money $xxx in on a couch, and I say sure even though i know its a lost investment because Im only gonna use it for a few months. So this helps calm the waters. Yet they are choppy again when I start to receive venmo request for utilities. I thought that my rent included the utilites, but we never really stated so when he started asking for utility money I of course just caved. Despite all of these ""little"" things I have enjoyed working, learning, and living with my friend.
5. Its now current day, 7 weeks after moving in the house (10 week of living with my friend) and my friend elects to get should surgrey to fix his shoulder. I cant blame him, I want him to be healthy before summer. However we are probably about 60% of the way done with our planned renovation... So what does that mean...  I get to finish it. I start to do this work more on my own then side by side and it seems to help but, my friend is a very particualry person so he is always over my shoulder ""ya missed a spot"" typa guy. He lets me know that I dont have to work... But what I am supposed to do when i come home see the consturction site we live in

tldr: In conclusion my friend and I setteled on a price for me to live with him in his house and Im going to up paying another 25% ontop of that original rent we setteleted on (+ couch/utilities). My familty and friends are all somewhat worried about me because they think I am working too hard. which, this is wayyy more work then I could've imagined working on these renovations.

I just feel as if Im getting ""played"". But, I dont see any other option other then to keep working. The value of the house has gone up a ton since working on it,  so I've been thinking about asking for a % of the equity but, technically I'm not entitled to any of it.

Pls help what should I do?",06May2020,1

Over the past few years we’ve argued like any other couple but more recently acted like we hate each other and have both admitted we don’t like each other atm and they have admitted they don’t care for me. Problem is there is still love there, and we have been together for so long it seems like such a shame to throw away all this effort.

It really fucking childish. Once or twice it may be funny but it’s continuous. Then it progressed to chants in real life when I started to speak or say anything  they chant “shut up James! Shut up James!” repeatedly when we play basketball and they’re on the sidelines. They all gang up on me and attack me during a debates on world views which we usually have (eg. Legalisation of weed). It got to a point where I wouldn’t say anything and they would send it. I asked them nicely to stop multiple times(this was after a month). I let it happen at the start because I’m ok with banter, but this was beyond banter. They didn’t stop. I kept asking and everyone agreed to stop except a few of my friends. But what gets me the most is the people who said they’d stop still sneak in little remarks then say I’m jk but continue to laugh about it.

631,"(Tried to post to r/amitheasshole but exceeded the character limit so posting here).


This might be a bit of a long story but it’s starting to really, really stress me out. Me [20F] and my boyfriend [20M] are isolating together at his mother’s house with his family. He has three dogs - two are Poodle cross and are around 6 years old. The other dog is a Labrador and is 11 months old. 

His mother bought the first two dogs (the Poodle crosses) because they ‘don’t need walking’ (her words, not mine). I am aware that all dogs do need walking to socialise and to exercise, but for the first five years of their lives they were walked maybe 5-10 times max and have never encountered other dogs or people, really. The dogs have a huge garden to run around in but like to stay indoors and sleep most of the time anyway. 

So last summer they got a Labrador puppy. I’ve got a Labrador myself and know how much they need walking - once a day at minimum, especially when they are puppies. His mother works a pretty intense job and doesn’t have much time to walk the puppy so has thankfully hired dog walkers for when she’s not around.

So since lockdown began, my boyfriend and I have been walking the puppy pretty much every day. I have no issue with it, she’s well trained and good around children and other dogs. We live in a suburb where there is only one field where pretty much everyone walks their dogs, but now with lockdown rules and people only being able to go out to exercise and buy food, we are seeing lots of families, couples, people on bike rides etc. walking on that same path.

My boyfriend INSISTS that every time, we bring all three dogs on the walk together. I’ll add that the two older dogs are very unfit and also completely unsocialised around other dogs, children and people in general. They also have no training - don’t respond to their names, don’t know basic commands such as ‘sit’ etc. 

As you can probably tell, they are a nightmare on walks. It’s enough to have a bouncy Labrador puppy to keep under control, but on top of it to have two large untrained Poodles with us is hell. They jump up at children, growl at/attack other dogs, run away and don’t come back, everything you could imagine untrained and unsocialised dogs would do. I hate walking them all together so much as the path we take is so busy at the moment - we always end up being yelled at by at least one person for not controlling the dogs. 

But they simply CAN’T be controlled. My boyfriend insists we let all three dogs off their leashes every time we walk them (the field is a dog-friendly one where dogs aren’t required to stay on leashes) and he insists that it’s allowed and that we should ‘let them play’. But the second they see a family, or another dog, or a person on a bike, the two older dogs will bark like crazy and rush off into the distance and leave us running after them and shouting their names, to which they never respond. They have never bitten anyone but they bark and growl and become aggressive to both people and dogs, and I don’t trust that it would never happen. 

I’ve raised the issue with my boyfriend several times; I’ve asked to only walk the Labrador and not take the other dogs, I’ve said we can bring all three dogs but keep the poodles on their leashes, I’ve reminded him that the poodles don’t actually like walks. He has compromised once or twice but mostly just disagrees and says he ‘doesn’t understand’ and accuses me of not liking the two older dogs. I’ve tried to explain that the issue isn’t that I don’t like them, it’s that they are awful on walks. He just doesn’t get it and it’s getting to the point where now the puppy isn’t being walked because I’m refusing to walk the other two dogs, and he’ll only go if we take all three. We’re at a moot point and I don’t know if I’m being an asshole by getting so worked up about it, or if he’s being an asshole by allowing his dogs’ bad behaviour and insisting we don’t do anything about it.",06May2020,1

636,"My dad gets horrible seperation anxiety if he doesn't see me often enough. This leads to severe depression and him taking it out on others around him. He can be emotionally abusive so I worry about the people in his life when I stay home. But he is immunocompromised. Phone calls won't work. I tried but he just wasn't interested.

I have given in a couple of times during the pandemic and seen him. We were supposed to be six feet apart but he wouldnt follow that. Hes not taking it seriously.

I'll admit that there are issues I have with him that are adding to this. Everything was always some sort of secret test growing up. And he used me. He used me as an excuse to do unhealthy things, he used me to get back at my mom, and he used me as his main source of emotional support. His anger would make him do things that were erratic and he is still very unpredictable. It feels almost symbolic that his need to see me is coming before my need to feel safe.

I shouldnt hold any of that against him though. It's really not his fault. From what I can tell he isnt able to see from others points of view. He views everything through the lense of his own feelings/point of view to an extreme degree. That's why he seems selfish to me, even though deep down he is not, and Is a good person and father. 

I feel really guilty. Me not seeing him is causing him genuine distress right now. I've seen things get really bad for him and the people around him when I've not wanted to see him for a week, let alone a month! But at the same time, I think at this age its healthy to not need to see eachother that regularly anyways? But its not healthy to avoid him if he does things in response that aren't healthy, right?

With this compensation money I wanted to take my partner on a little holiday over my birthday as neither of us have been abroad before and then put the rest in savings. 
The original plan was to buy everyone a little something to show how much I love them, however the way she talks about my compensation and money has made me reluctant to do anything for her. She makes ‘jokes’ about me buying her things and keeps saying “if you want to buy me something with your compensation...” 
See my mum is extremely ‘money grabbing’ and my partner believes she might try to take it or make me buy loads etc as she has a way of making me feel guilty (she’s done it briefly before when I’ve had a sum of money).

641,"I (F15) am 5'2"" and weight around 101 lbs. I thought it was normal for me until my family called me fat. Now, they call me that everyday. I made a similar post about about this in r/ AmITheAsshole (I don't know how to link on mobile, just check my profile, there's more information there).

One time I was lying down on the couch and my siblings (F16 and M17) out of no where stared laughing and calling me fat. Now, my dad also calls me fat. Not only that, but he also told all of our relatives; both my mom and my dad's side. They believe him. I don't think I'm fat or even overweight, I look the same since the beginning of school. My friends also say I'm the perfect weight.

Because of that, my self esteem dropped. I stopped eating breakfast and never went outside my room unless I needed to use the bathroom or my parents call me to eat lunch/dinner. I don't get out of bed unless I want to draw. I always wake up at at 9 AM. If I have to be in the living room, I cover myself with pillows. Even though I'm starving a lot and feel my stomach making noises every ten minutes I tell myself to not eat.

Now they're always wondering why I'm never in the living room. I don't want to tell them because I feel embarrassed. I don't like talking to my parents at all anymore. As I'm typing this I'm tearing up because of how shameful I feel. 

Today, I found out I woke up at 8:00 AM. I remembered all my friends told me I should eat breakfast so I decided to go to the kitchen. My mom and my brother were already there and told me to eat the leftover spaghetti from dinner on the plate. There was only a very very little amount, an amount for an eight-year-old. I told them there's not enough but they said, ""What do you mean? That's a lot."" I was surprised my brother said that because he eats quadruple the size of that. So I decided to eat one small bowl of Mac n Cheese instead. As I was warming it up, my mom was going through Facebook looking at memes about weight so she can tease me about how I'm getting fat. I shrugged it off, but my sister went to the kitchen (mind you she's only one year older than me) and made more noodles for the spaghetti I didn't want. They did not stop her or tease her for eating more. Also, my mom saw a picture of Adele and commented about how she skinny she's gotten, saying, ""It says here she skips breakfast."" My brother says, ""Then you should skip breakfast, mom"" to which she replied, ""Oh, no! I'm going to starve to death!""

Some notes: My siblings got called fat a few times too, but they target me the most. My dad went to my cousins house and my cousin texted me, ""Your dad was telling me how you guys have been gaining weight and called you out specifically.""

One time, my mom weighed me right after I just finished eating lunch and I weighed 106 lbs. She told me I shouldn't weigh that much and not to go over 110 pounds.

I always feel hungry for dinner and tend to eat a lot more than expected. So my parents look at me in disgust because of that but they don't know I skip breakfast and eat little for lunch.

My dad (M41) started working out one or two years ago because he's complaining about his weight. Even though he's been doing this for 1-2 years, he still has a beer belly. My mom (F39) was overweight, maybe obese, and started working out a year ago. She's still overweight, but she's getting there.

I started doing some exercises in my room (Chloe Ting's workout on YouTube) alone because I'm afraid they will comment about me and I feel embarrassed when someone sees me working out.

I'm the shy type, I don't like confronting my parents because if I do they are going to yell at me, tell me I have an attitude, or threaten to slap me to teach me a lesson. Is there a way I can approach this without being yelled at?",06May2020,0
643,"My ex recently posted on here wondering if he should break up with me. I’m not sure exactly what he said, because his statement has since been deleted. But here’s the jist: we’d been together a year and a half. He was addicted to weed, and drinking. But not as much as he was addicted to lying. He had a real stuck up group of friends who were just as bad as he was, and they used to constantly insult me to him, calling me names. He never defended me. That bothered me a lot, yet he never stopped hanging with them or even asked them to apologize, even though he claimed to love me. The first time I got upset he was doing drugs was the summer of 2018, when he was doing acid at a friends house one night. At this point we weren’t dating but we were about to. He was acting crazy texting me and I told him I don’t want to date someone who’s on drugs so either he can stop or we just won’t be together. He begged for another chance and swore he’d never any of it again. Foolishly, I believed him. Last August I found out he never quit. It hurt. A lot. I blocked him on everything for one night, but he eventually emailed me the next day saying he was really gonna quit cause it wasn’t worth losing me over. Being blinded by love, I believed him. Ever since then, obviously I’ve had issues trusting him. I thought he quit the first time, but that was a lie. He said he’d stopped hanging out with those friends who had been mean to me and influenced him even worse to do the drugs. Anytime he’d go out with friends, I got really paranoid and it instantly ruined my day. I admit I would say mean things and bring up the past a lot, but that’s because he turned me into such a monster. Anytime we’d be together, it was great. We have a lot of great memories and I’m thankful for that. But anytime we weren’t together, it was constant anxiety and memories of the lying. I started to believe maybe he had really changed. But anytime I doubted that, he would guilt trip me so bad, claiming I was emotionally abusing him. He came from an abusive household, and I understand that’s a part of why he does the drugs. But I just wanted him to quit because 1) those are my values and 2) I want what’s best for him and I know that drugs aren’t gonna help him. They only made him more anxious and depressed. When quarantine started is when things went bad. He would hardly answer his phone, and he stopped putting in effort to even talk or make me feel better when I was upset. He just didn’t seem to care anymore. I called him out on that many times, and he said he just had been really depressed and he was gonna try to be better and show me more affection. I seriously tried my best to help him and uplift him, telling him he needs to tell his grandparents and that he needs to see a doctor. But he refused. He said they’ll all just make it worse. Or he doesn’t have the money for a doctor. He got a stimulus check, and I told him he should get health insurance. He didn’t. One day he just decided he wanted to be done. It broke my heart. He claimed it was because of how mean I would get to him because I didn’t trust him. He said our relationship isn’t worth it to try and fix anymore, even though I BEGGED for another chance and told him I’d be nicer, and that I believed he had quit the drugs. He then blocked me on EVERYTHING. You name it, I was blocked. The only way he talked to me again was because I kept calling him with no caller ID, and eventually he unblocked my number to text me. This was all about a week ago. I begged and begged for another chance, but he said he just didn’t know. He said he was done, but then that he wasn’t done, but then that he was again. I felt terrible because I thought it was my “meanness” that had ruined our relationship. And he made sure to make me feel guilty about that. Sometimes things would progress and we would talk like normal. One day we hung out after I convinced him to see me. We got ice cream and went to the park. We kissed a lot too. It felt like things were gonna be okay again. I asked him did he feel better about us and he said yes, and I asked him to unblock me. He kept telling me he wasn’t ready yet. 5 days ago I think, he got off work and I hadn’t heard from him. I kept calling and calling. That day alone, I called him 89 times (I know it’s pathetic). But he wouldn’t answer any of them. He would text me “hey” between every twenty calls, and when I’d asked what he was doing, I was back to no response. He told me he was out at the store with a guy he knew I didn’t really like too much, but he was at the “store” for four hours. Even his grandma didn’t really know what he was doing or when he’d be home. When he finally got home, I was worried sick. It reminded me of the days when he was on drugs and hiding it from me, cause he would never reply to my texts when that was going on. I eventually had a huge breakdown and was feeling really terrible, honestly wanting to just die. He didn’t make me feel better. All he said was he cares about me and that it’s gonna be okay. And then he went to sleep. I cried for hours that night. His friend messaged me and asked me how we were doing. I told him bad. He told me he respects me too much to let him quit lying to me, and told me that he never quit doing drugs and in fact smokes daily, and he had proof. He never stopped hanging out with his old crew. His friend told me that he heard from someone else that he had made a Tinder account, but he wasn’t sure since he didn’t hear that directly. So in a rage, I called him and told him off. I told him he would never change and always be a liar, that I hated him and never wanted to talk to him again. He hung up on me. I said those things because I was upset. But I haven’t heard from him since. I’ve sent so many emails and texts since then, like probably 15 a day. He doesn’t respond. I’m still blocked. He’s got a new girl I think, and she requested both of my Instagram accounts the other day. She has similar features to mine, but everyone I know says it’s a huge downgrade. Mind you, I’m pretty decent looking, I have a 4.2 GPA, and I have big plans in life. Not that it matters, but he almost didn’t graduate and is addicted to drugs and lying. Looking back, there were many signs that I ignored that he had never quit. I feel like a complete idiot for never noticing. I’m not sure if he cheated or not. 9 days ago, he posted to this same thread asking if he should break up with me. He said on there that he had not cheated. If he did cheat, then that just breaks my heart to another dimension. When he first met me, he was just a guy no one had ever given a chance, and he just wanted someone to love him. I gave him just that. I always encouraged him and believed in him, and all I got were lies. I do think he loved me and didn’t want to hurt me, and that’s why he lied. But I wish he just told me that summer that he didn’t plan to quit, cause all the heartache could’ve been avoided. Now I’ve spent a year and a half with a guy I fell so in love with, and who lied to me. It leaves me wondering if all of our relationship was a lie. I’ve emailed him a lot telling him I can look past the drugs and I just wanted us back. I’ve gotten no response whatsoever. I’ve tried to be with friends and stay busy, but everything is a reminder of him. I keep thinking of all the good times we had. And how I don’t want us to stop making memories together. I know I deserve much better. But it’s incredibly difficult to get over. I still love him, and I can’t imagine the day I’ll stop. I don’t want to move on, and I know this girl is just his rebound but it still hurts that he’s turned out to be just like every guy I’ve talked to, but worse. Am I in the wrong here? Everyone tells me to just move on and don’t reach out, but I just wanna see him again. I would give anything for us to return back to normal, even if ‘normal’ was me being lied to and feeling like a fool.",06May2020,1
644,"So to be clear, I have really dark humor. Nothing offends me and no matter how dark a joke is, if it's funny, I'll laugh. But I got triggered the other day which is something that rarely ever happens, can't remember me ever being triggered. I was playing an online game with my friends and we were in a group call. At one point one of my friends told me ""Do us a favor and kill yourself"". 

For some reason, my heart started pumping fast and I lashed out on her. Not cussing her out, but I just saying stuff like how I don't appreciate what she said, to not joke about that stuff and so on. I then left the group call and game and just went to play by myself. She knows about my depression, past regarding self-harm and suicide attempt btw. I myself make jokes about my past because it helps me deal with them better and even others have joked about it and I don't mind. But for some reason, I got triggered and did what I did. I understand that she was joking, I would never assume she meant it. But did I react inappropriately or even overreact?

It might be worth mentioning that it's been days and she hasn't texted me nor apologized. If she sent something along the lines of ""Hey that was insensitive"" or ""I didn't mean to offend you"", just something simple, I'd easily forgive her and move on but she never did.",06May2020,1
645,"Okay first, thank you for reading this. This is going to be a long story so buckle up. I am an introvert with type 1 diabetes and ADD. I did not have many if any friends growing up due to the fear of being hurt emotionally. I am often quiet and growing up I had trouble studying and working at part time jobs due to my ADD. My Type 1 diabetes also did not help with socializing as I often found myself focusing on surviving rather than living. The only thing I do seem to have is a stubborn will to keep going but these days its starting to run out.

After high school I went to college to become a mechanical engineer. I put my heart and soul into studying but I would always come short when tests came around. I tried for two years and was not making much progress due to having to retake classes. Through out my years at college, I never once skipped class or dropped out. I couldn't deal with quitting. The thought alone scared me. I couldn't quit, I needed to survive, I needed health insurance. Without out it I was doomed. 

I will never forget the one day in my calculus 1 class.  My professor had handed back the tests and was answering questions after class. Most of the class had failed including me and one by one they started to leave. It was only me and the professor. I asked him about some problems and after he had helped me he said ""You are the most tenacious student I have ever had"". I didn't know what to say but thanks. This further stoked my need to keep going. I still don't know if it is a good thing or not.

After two years in the engineering major I broke down and needed to change. I was suggested to go into computer science. With no alternative I agreed and for once fate shined down on me. I loved computer science and programming. whether it is on the job, in class or at home. I could not get enough. After struggling through 7 years in total, I completed college and graduated with a degree in computer science.

After college I worked at a small manufacturing company. I was there first developer and I loved working on projects and meeting with people there. I completely redid a lot of there software. It was a bit lonely being the only developer and the pay was not that great, but I was happy to be working on a job in my major. After two years, one day my manger came to me saying that I was not being productive enough. This was odd considering I always completed things way ahead of schedule so I just shrugged it off as just a reminder. A month later my manager says that I was still not productive enough and that I was being let go immediately. I was heart broken. These people who I had known for two years have just thrown me away so quickly and without warning.

After a month being out of work I got a contract with the promise of hiring at another manufacturing company. The pay was a lot better. The people there were nice and told me that contracts always resulted in full hire. After five months my manger came to me and told me that they could not keep me and that I only had a month left. I thanked him for the warning and was out of a job again.

Because I had a month to prepare, I was only out of a job for a week. I got a job with a credit union as a developer and they were eager to hire me. In the interview they said they were looking for someone with C# and developing experience. On the first day I was with three other people for orientation. This was odd, because I had never heard of other companies handling multiple hires at once. When I was being shown my job they told me I was going to be using a program called legasuite making front end panels for their back end software. I asked about what C# code I would be coding. They told me I would not be touching any of the code... Betrayed again. For three months I was furious. I could not quit because I needed the insurance. I hated that job so much. It was so quiet there. No one talked to each other. Just boring monotonous work. I even offered to write a program that would produce the panels, but they shot me down. I was at my lowest point. I had no friends, no one to talk to and a terrible job. But unfortunately, something in me kept me marching onward.

After three months, I was contacted by a recruiting company asking if I was interesting in a developing position downtown working with a team of developers. This was a contract to possible hire. I cautiously said yes as anything was better than what I was doing. I put in my two weeks and offered to help out as much as I could and they immediately fired me on the spot. My new job was paying triple the amount I made at my first job. I got to work with other developers. My commute was great. Benefits amazing. My colleagues were actually interested in my side projects were I programmed video games. I had finally found my dream job. I did not have many friends but at the very least I had a good job I liked. I was happy and I trusted people once more.

At the end of April 2020 the recruiting company called me and told me that they were reminding me that my last day was April 30. Shocked I said why? Confused, they said ""did no one tell you? They were supposed to tell you! Due to Covid19 the company was ending most of their contracts early with a possible rehire at a later date."" I could not believe it. Even my managers did not know I was being laid off early. I was already working from home so why would they let me go and with out warning? I felt betrayed again.

And that brings us to today. I am still single with not many friends and no job again. It is getting real hard to trust people these days. Or is it just me? I don't know. I have to figure something out, because I don't have health insurance again. I know there are a lot of people who have it a lot worse. But, I guess I am just emotionally exhausted. I don't want to go find another place to work at again. I finally found someplace I could trust and I am lost again. And on a different note how am I supposed to find new friends or ask someone out if I am constantly worried about being betrayed again? I feel hopeless  again... But unfortunately, I can't sit still and am looking for a new job. I just wan't it to stop, but my body won't let me. This cycle keeps going on and on and on. I just wan't it to end. I just wan't a normal, quiet, uneventful life. 

Thank you for reading this, even if you have nothing to say. I think I needed to get my thoughts down.",06May2020,1
646,"Hi redditors, before I start I thank you for reading this post and stay safe!

I'm a muslim F 16 and nearly got kicked out of the house and called the police. I apologise for any spelling, grammar mistakes etc. I make. I'm crying right now and my parents are talking crap about me and calling me names as usual.

 My parents and I don't have the best relationship with each other. They would constantly favour my older brother and sister and make my achievments seem like nothing. They would always make me feel like nothing and not listen to me. I remembered when I was getting bullied ( I had 6 when I was in primary school btw) and they had found out that I was getting bullied they did nothing. So I let it slide and ignored it and went to secondary.

Heres some info about me when I was younger: Yr 7 and yr 8 was fine. I was acing tests, was happy at the moment (in school at least) and even made my teacehrs shook at how well I was doing. However, my school was messed up and couldn't do anything right (as it was teacehers who were the main problem) and everyone told my parents to move my school and they refused. They kept claiming how they regret it now. They ended up paying alot for me and my sis to get tutored. (I only had one in yr8 and had 4 by yr11 because they all taught different things and couldn't cover one area). By the time I was in yr9, I had problems at home that started to really effect me. It got worst in year 10 and my grades dropped massively. I always kept thinking about commiting suicide and cutting myself but I stopped myself before I stabbed myself with the knife. Here comes yr 11 (where things become alot worst), my friend (which has been dignosed with social anxiety, deppression and having frequent panic attacks) has told me that I most likely have the same problems as her (e.g having social anxiety) as I experienced the exact things she has gone through and how I'm no longer enjoying doing the things I love to do (except that she was getting help). In yr 9, I had discovered reddit and looked up some memes and stuff. Then I came across insane parents and narcissist parents. I had realised that my parents had fit the description perfectly and when I did some research about toxic parents - turns out I have toxic parents. I had always found it weird how they didn't teach me stuff and expected me to do it and took credit of everything good I did when teachers or people in general pointed it out. I found it also annoying how my mum kept pointing out how skinny I was and how I needed to get some weight. When I gained a little wieght, my mum started to complain how fat I was and how I needed to loose weight ( mind her that I had a perfect wight for my height). Both of my parents always told me that I was ugly and shouldn't smile because my smile was ugly. My mum is more on messing me up emotionally and my dad is more on messing me up physically. In the beginning of y11, I started to get slightly better (by myself) but then I got very ill coincidently before all of my exams started. Even though I had the chance of doing the test in class, my mum still made me go and sit the exam which ended up resulting me have poor grades (aside of the fact my school couldn't teach stuff and rejected things that weren't in their way of liking). 

Before I typed this up, my dad recieved a message from a college saying I had an interview on the phone. After talking to them, my dad then proceeded to tell me how Physcology is useless (I'm taking Biology, Chemistry, Art and Physcology , my dad also wanted me to drop Art) and how his friend's daughter did chemical enginering and wasted her life trying to get a job. From this point on I could tell that he just wanted my to drop the subject and continue going on a medicine route that I was forced to go on. My dad then I started talking about how just because he is a parent, he knows everything.  Fast forward an hour, my mum wanted me to phone up a college to ask about my application, I refused because I was in a bad mood and when I was talking to the person interviewing me I stuttered a bit and gotten critisized for what I have done. The thing is that it was my first interview and I was not sure how to act and just tryed to sound mature and remeber the things I saw on youtube and movies when characters got interviewed. Luckily, I somehow managed to get a place.

Now when I refused, my dad started getting aggressive and kept asking me why. Me knowing that i'd get hit on the face again and get told what a useless piece of crap I am again. I just kept repeating myself on how I wouldn't want to. He then got even more aggressibe and asked me why I moved back and I just said your in my personal space. He said it was BS and kept comming closer. He then got mad and started to yell at me and hit me. I started to cry easily because of all the beatings I got when I was younger. He shouted at me for crying and started chasing after me when I was going to my bedroom. He then tried to kick me out and I grabbed my sister's jacket and my phone. He then cornerd me to my bedroom and hit me on my face, back legs. (Its not the first time he has slapped me but it still hurt me both physically and emotionally. I was just a little worried if he would smash me against the floor again and if he would try to choke me until I couldn't breathe again. I did find it annoying how my mum had the audocity to say ""At LeAsT i'M nOt DeAd."" and then laughed.) Out of panic I said I would call the police and how God will punish him, he said that he wanted me to and tried to get me call the police.He also said that God will never punish him but thing is I always try to research about my religion and other things.  Anyway, he kept screaming at me to call the police and said how they took his side. When he left the room for a moment, I tried to call my brother but he didn't pick up ( as usual and then I remembered that his phone is usually off and even if he did pick up he'd probably get mad at me even though he told me if there was problems going on at home, I should contact him). I then cried even harder and my parents forced me to go to the living room to lecture me. Luckily, the shortest I had a lecture from them was an hour but this one took and a half. 

The things they mentioned was:

1. How I'm a peice of crap and how selfish I am
2. How I am lucky and they are the best parents in the world
3. How they helped someone out because she became homeless because of her parents and the people she is giving rent to
4. How the police would take their side and encourage them to beat me up
5. Calling me names
6. Comparing me to other people (yes, the also compare me to grownups who have everything as well)
7. More comparrisions 
8. How they thought I was ""smart"" (which is funny because if I recall they never called me smart)
9. More comparrisons and that I'm a piece of crap

Honestly, their lecture just proved me that I can't trust people in the world which is ironic because I'm asking for dvice from you guys. Then again, I  trust random strangers on the internet then my own parents, especially for asking for help or anything really.

They kept shouting at me and caused me to have low self esteem which is one of the reasons why I want to take Physcology (so I can help people and a few other things). My dad said he doesn't want to talk or look at me. The longest where I didn't acknowledge his existence was for 1 week and a half. I had to always apologise even though he created problems and such. I kind of envy my sister for having my dad say he's sorry to my sister when she was in the wrong.

I'm also suprised that my mum hasn't gave me the silent treatment yet, tho she probably will because when she came close to me right now (when typing up this post) and I moved away from her. My dad got mad at my mum for asking if i want to eat and that I should just starve. 

My dad said that he wants to disown me and kill me etc. To be honest their threats haven't scared me so much as compared to this because at times (thanks to them) I just don't feel any emotion or think anything. My mind just goes blank completely. 

To be honest, I'm starting to not trust my own memory because of them and I can't even tell if I was right for reacting to the way I did. ( Well I probably wasn't because I don't cuss at them or anything --or at least I hope I am right).

Thanks once again for reading this! I appreciate it C:",06May2020,1

651,"My boyfriend and I had been trying to get pregnant since February, and I finally got a positive pregnancy test in November. Initially, I was very excited. That was what we both wanted and we couldn't have been more elated. Before we ever found out I was pregnant we knew we had to get a different house. Ours is one bedroom that is, to put it mildly, falling apart. There is literal wildlife coming into the house, the floor is falling in, the ceiling leaks right next to the bed, the driveway is a mud slide. So many things are wrong with it. We were going to stay there until we found out I was pregnant (to save money) and then move somewhere else. Within the course of seven months, everything has completely changed. He doesn't want to move. I found houses and we went and looked at them and he has a problem with every single one. Stupid problems like he doesn't like what cars the neighbors drive or he doesn't like the shape of the yard. He finally broke down and told me he doesn't want to move because he's lived in that neighborhood his whole life and he's comfortable there. He doesn't see the problem with the house at all. He keeps telling me that the bugs coming in is just because ""It's that time of year."" The floor and the ceiling are because ""It's just an old house."" The driveway is ""The best driveway in the neighborhood."" I have finally given up on that and asked him if we can start buying essential baby things. He told me, ""We don't need to buy anything until probably mid-July, let's just wait."" He is due July 29th. I'm getting increasingly discouraged about everything. I finally decided that I would just be better off moving out with my son (because I don't want bugs crawling on him or it raining on him while he is asleep) but here's the catch.. when I got pregnant I had to switch jobs (I still work for the same company) because the job I had was very physically hands on (lifting/moving 150-300 pounds every single day). I was working about 60 hours a week so financially, I was doing very well. Since I switched positions, I now only work 40 hours a week, which was a huge pay cut. I could still afford to get a place but money would be very tight, which is fine. Within the past few days, my hours have gotten cut even more (to 30 a week). They told me it was due to covid-19, but the industry I work in has not been affected at all. They're really just trying to save money anywhere they can. Due to my hours getting cut again, I cannot afford to live anywhere else. I really can only afford to pay my monthly bills with maybe $60 left over every month. I don't know what to do. I'm freaking out because I'm about to have a baby in two months and everything is falling apart. I can't take my old position back even after I have my baby because it was given to someone else (technically not illegal because I didn't go on leave, I just switched positions). I have applied for food stamps, WIC, partial unemployment, everything I can find that would help and they're all getting denied for various reasons. I've applied for other jobs so I can work nights and weekends, but no one is going to hire a girl that is seven months pregnant (and I don't blame them). I have applied to drive for Uber, but my background check has been pending for over a month. I contacted them to see what the hold up is and they keep telling me it's in the final stages of getting approved. I need advice on how to make money to support myself and my child until at least September, when I can go back to work and get a full time job again. I have no idea what to do and I'm panicking.

A little about me- I’m a 31 year old female with a long background in the service industry. Mostly serving, barista, casual bartending. I also have a few years experience as a cake decorator. I went to  culinary school for a year, but left before I obtained a degree. 

I need to find a different path. I can’t do this forever, and COVID has left me without a job and with plenty of spare time to study something else. I’m worried about what industries will be seeking employees after this though, but with that said is there anything you guys would suggest? Maybe something I can study online shorter than 2 years and that won’t put me in loads of student debt? 

Everything else I have experience in seems kind of disposable now- running and operating Airbnb’s, some photography (no professional equipment), dog training, interior design, restoring old furniture. But these are all side gigs. I need something with financial stability.

656,"As said in the title, my relationship with my dad isn't the greatest. I wouldn't say it's terrible, we love each other a lot I can feel that, but it's not perfect.

I drove home and about 30 minutes later I get a text message from him saying that “since u destroyed my property in the front yard and left the bags of weeds where i could trip and fall my Medicare advisor recommended me to call the police on you and let you know you are no longer welcome back on my property.”

What’s confusing is, I did exactly what he told me to do. I was to dig up the weeds In the front yard and bag them because his green bin was full. 

Now I can’t finish the job nor get paid. I don’t know what I should do. I did call the police but they said there’s nothing they can do about it.

663,"Long story short, I grew up in a horrible place. I made really amazing friends though. When I finished my associates I decided to join the military. When I got out my friends expected me to move back home. I decided not to move back. I had had enough of that place and would much rather visit it often than to live in it daily. I do miss my friends. We have a group chat, we FaceTime, and we even play online games. We keep in touch. But lately I can feel the vibe changing. Recent events being as they are that stuff has slowed down because some of my friends have lost loved ones. I want to be there for them. I wish I could go back but being on lockdown obviously doesn't permit and it is obviously not the time for grown ass adults to be asking ""Do you still wanna be my friend or...?"" I know all I can do is be there for them and keep in touch. But I also know I haven't done a good job at it. I lost a parent when I was a kid. No one really checked up on me when it happened, family or otherwise. I kind of just learned to live with it. Every now and then I think I get a little too choked up over someone I don't even remember anymore, but I think that is the extent of my scars. Point being, I don't know how to be there, especially not long distance. It feels artificial when I try to check up on people. Am I just an asshole?

664,"There's this guy (let's call him M) and he has a crush on me ever since 9th grade. That's when he first confessed to me. I made it clear to him that I'm bisexual, that I like girls more, and that I'm not interested. But he still persisted and tried to court me. On Valentine's Day at 9th grade, he got me a whole bouquet of flowers and did that in front of our whole batch. Everyone was watching and cheering him on, but I only felt embarrassed. I talked to him later that day and told him that I really don't see him more than a friend and that he should just move on because I'm more interested in girls. He said that it was okay because he said that I'll eventually like him in the future and that he still has a chance because I'm bisexual, not a lesbian. I couldn't control my anger anymore so I shouted at him and told him that it's not his choice to make if I'll like him or not. I was relieved because for the remaining two months of 9th grade, he didn't bother me anymore.

10th grade came and I was shocked to see him in my class. Turns out, he was my classmate again. I desperately tried to avoid him in class, but his friends kept teasing him and forcing me to like him back. Honestly it was such a nightmare. Everyday they'd send me messages and ask me why I don't like him back, and they're telling me to just agree to be his girlfriend. Even our teachers often teased us and it was infuriating but I couldn't do much about it.

He even asked our adviser to switch seats just to sit beside me, and our teacher agreed right away. And when I asked my teacher if I could switch to another seat, she didn't allow me to. Like wtf? Everyone already knew that I'm not interested in guys that much but they kept forcing me to be with him.

He'd message me everyday and tell me that he won't give up on me and I'd always tell him that he should just stop, but he just kept forcing himself on me. He told me that as long as I was bisexual then he would have a chance with me. Like who the hell are you to decide that for me? It was so stupid.

This has gotten to the point where I dread entering our classroom and seeing him. He always finds a way to make a move and it's disgusting. His friends are even worse, because they all try to flirt with me when they can see that I'm uncomfortable. They just hug me out of nowhere, sit beside me and touch my hair, and they try to hold my hand and call me pet names. I couldn't tell our adviser though because she's much closer to the boys and they're basically disrespectful as fuck. They're not afraid of our adviser just because she's young and they sometimes talk back to her. I couldn't tell our school's guidance counselor too because I don't want to create a big problem.

I just can't get him and his friends off my back and up until now, even with the lockdown, he's persistent and if I warn him that I'll block him if he doesn't stop, he'll tell me all the things he's done for me (that I didn't ask for) and he'll make me feel bad for it. He'll also tell his friends that I'm only using him for my personal gain and he'll play victim and I'll always be the fucking villain.

I wanted to print something, but then it didn't recognize my printer. I went over to start up the app to see if anything was wrong and I noticed that the application was pretty much reset.

However, the app thought there was no device connected.

I tried reinstalling the application and it worked... for a while. Then it happened again.

666,"I'm almost 19. I got braces shortly after my 17th birthday, after fighting to get state insurance to cover them for years. To put it short, though, my home situation was a nightmare and had been for years. 
That summer I made plans to leave my home without a word to anyone the minute I turned 18. I organized as much as I could with the time I had, but was unable to find an orthodontist in the state I was moving to that would take a transfer with my insurance. At the time it was very low on my priority list behind housing and employment. I thought I'd find some way eventually to get a tune-up, at the very least sneak back to my old orthodontist, but unfortunately that never happened. 
It's been nearly a year since then, and as you can imagine my braces are pretty beaten up. Two brackets gone, one loose, some teeth are starting to shift back. I'm worried there is going to be irreparable damage (if there isn't already) if I don't address this ASAP. 
At this point I just want them off. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would an orthodontist take my braces off for a one-time out of pocket fee? How do I go about finding an orthodontist and explaining my situation?",06May2020,1

668,"Warning: will be kind of a long rant

I am overly sensitive. I need to know if I am overthinking this, and I want advice to change it.

First off, I am a virgin [F], but not really ""involuntary"" celibate. I am more of a demisexual - I don't want to do it with anyone I'm not close with. Even though I have zero charisma, I can move in a club and am moderately fit, so it wouldn't be difficult if I wanted to find someone to sleep with. However, I am still quite sexual, and I do take matters into my own hands.

The reason I say I am becoming like an incel is due to my increasing frustration towards my playful and sexually active friend group. One girl in particular made it a life challenge to sleep with different kinds of men. In the beginning, I would always be excited for their stories. However, I gradually found myself harboring a distaste over them. 

Once, the group made a rank of ""Amount of people slept with"", and right under my name, they wrote ""Needs a lot more work 💪🏻"". Obviously just a harmless tease, but every time they whip the list and I see that... my heart just sours.

In addition, they are eager to share... but never seem to want to listen to me. One of the girls used the term ""so you popped your own cherry?"" when I described to her what I do, and I hated the phrase instantly because it just sounds *so condescending*. And yeah, that's it... because I don't have sex, I have no stories to share. She also thinks it's icky to put your own fingers inside of your vagina, but has no problem with other people doing it for her. (..am I icky then?)

I experiment with sex toys, and since it was a recurring topic of interest (no one in the group uses them), I suggested to buy one as a xmas present for a single girl friend. She was amused, but later on she suddenly said that ""well u know maybe when December comes I might not need it after all (if she succeed in having a relationship with this guy)"". 

AND MY STUPID INSECURE HEART GOT SAD AGAIN. I felt like she was indirectly saying that the reason I need all these sex toys is because I have no one. Oh my gosh. I don't know where are all these negative emotions coming from. When I listen to myself, it just sounds like I am getting angry and frustrated that my friends are getting laid, while being insecure. That's exactly what an incel would be like. I need advice. I hate myself for being like this!",06May2020,1

At that moment site was only on http(unsafe) and without SSL
So those three moments(free hosting, unsafe connection, no SSL) are the possible reasons for block, I think
Facebook link debugger says that web site is violating community guidelines, also same message appears when you share link on FB(messages, posts, etc.) or Instagram(direct, profile web site)
After block I transferred web site to other, paid hosting, and parked domain to new one, get the SSL, and enabled https.

Now I am struggling with the decision, because on one side I really would like to stay in the company. The work is great and I feel accepted. Also I would get paid 80% which is nice. (By the way I live with my parents, so money doesn't matter)

692," I have no idea where to even begin, so i'll start off with a little backstory i suppose.   One of my best friends (We'll call him Chris) and I bought a house together last year.  Closed in February.     A few months later he had his girlfriend (Lets call her Cara)  and her 2 year old child move in with us even though he told the realtor and i that he wouldn't.  We've all been living together for a little over a year now, and the two of them have recently(ish) had a child together.  Cara is home all day to ""watch"" the children and she did not have a job until early this year.   Now she works nights so Chris can watch the kids while she's at work.   I have very little experience with kids, so i don't know what they should be doing at what ages.   I have little experience with taking care of kids as well, but some of the things i see absolutely eat away at me and i have though about calling CPS on several occasions.  There were times i thought about calling CPS just because of how nasty she was leaving the house.  Rotting food and drinks all over tables, couches, even the floor.  Trash just literally everywhere.  I thought the child could get sick or choke, but i'm sure nothing much would have came out of calling.

  
Here is where the issues start and they get worse as it goes on:  Cara was letting her child run around in poopy diapers for hours on end.  Sometimes she would have family over, and they would have to tell her to change her kids diaper.  But she would just pretend she didn't hear anybody say anything.   She'll be told 4 or 5 times before actually changing his diaper.  This would go on for months and months.  I thought she was getting better, but the other day i found out that the child is actually changing his own diapers.  


This child is just past 3 years old now, and he only says 3 words.   Hi, bye, and no.  I'm pretty sure he said more words than this when they first moved in, but i can't remember all that much.  There was no attempt to even find out what is wrong with him, until recently when she contacted the school system about him starting.  After contacting the school system, they sent people do do an evaluation but it doesn't seem like they got to any conclusions aside from the fact that he will need special attention.  


If he walks into a room that they're not in, they grab the kid and pull him out.  Even the bathroom.  It's almost like they're not letting him become potty trained.   When he walks up to Cara with an empty cup because hes thirsty, she only grabs him a drink maybe 30% of the time.  They won't let him grab his own drinks.   He'll walk over to the bathroom, 1 door away from their bedroom and Cara will start screaming at the top of her lungs for him to ""get back here"".   They have a hook on the door that they latch 90% of the time so the kid can't leave the room.  If they leave the room, they have elastics that they attach to the hook so they can latch it from the outside.   If he manages to undo it, Cara will put him back in the room and latch it again instead of just watching the child for 10 minutes while she goes downstairs.    

&amp;#x200B;

When they are all downstairs (upstairs is bedrooms and 1/2 bath), it's still constant screaming.  If he tries to get food, he's screamed at.   If his toys are making too much noise, he's screamed at.  Tries to go into the bathroom, screamed at.   There are times where he just wants his mama to pay attention to him and she repeatedly screams ""go away"".  

&amp;#x200B;

During this COVID situation, i've been home from work for over a month now.  This child is locked in the bedroom for 22+ hours a day almost every single day.   He's lucky if he gets fed more than once, maybe twice throughout an entire day.  I cannot keep seeing this go on.   My friend Chris is not nearly as bad, but he usually follows her lead when it comes to keeping him locked in/out of rooms.  I don't think he realizes how bad Cara actually is.   He doesn't yell unless the child does something reasonably bad.  He makes the kid food all the time, and usually fills up drinks.       Chris is the happiest i have seen him in the 15 years i've known him.   I really don't want to ruin that for him.    But i want things to get better for the children, and i just don't know what to do.   I'm afraid of calling somewhere because  they'll know it was me.  I'm the only one who sees what's going on here and its killing me inside.   Sometimes i think i'm overreacting because i'm upset Chris lied about having them move in, but i don't know anymore.   Please help =/

I go to a small school and mostly everyone there is really preppy while my brother looks like a complete metalhead. Eric and his friends make fun of my brother for his hair, piercings, clothing, music, etc. I knew my brother hated Eric, but he added me on Snapchat and it seemed rude to not ads back so I did. We started talking and I thought he was cute. My brother knew about this and warned me that Eric was a bad guy. Eventually I decided to go to Eric’s house to hang out and we ended up having sex.

I'm 16F and I'm overweight. My endocrinologist told me I have pre diabetes almost a year ago. I have been taking metformine since then, and I've started going to a dietician 4 months ago and I've officially lost 10 kilos since then!

But lately I've been feeling really bad. Like, I had hypoglycemia a couple of times so maybe it's that but sometimes I'll start feeling dizzy and not like I'm there. Like I don't feel like I'm in my own head, I can't concentrate bc that feels weird and wrong and when I try to it become even more obvious that I don't feel like I'm in my own head. 

It feels like I'm just kinda not inside my own body, like my soul is just a bit above my body and not wholly in it. 

The reason why I think it might be hypoglycemia is that it happens whenever I haven't eaten in a while. I feel faint and incredibly weak. I'm not hungry whenever this happens but I still feel shaky and dizzy so it could be. When I tried to ask my mom since my grandma has diabetes so maybe she would know she didn't understand what I was talking about and said it's probably just me feeling hungry",06May2020,1

I can't carry a conversation, I'm too scared to stick up for myself, and overall I just constantly feel like everyone around me is in on a big secret that I'm not. I've also been single for five years now, because I spent a long time being confused about my sexuality before eventually realizing I'm bi. But now I don't know how to flirt, nobody flirts with me, when I message people on Tinder I don't get an answer, when I go out to bars and parties with my friends they always leave with somebody and I stand in the corner until it's time to go home and cry myself to sleep because I don't know how to approach someone. It's getting to the point where I feel like nobody is ever going to give me a chance or date me. Maybe I'm ugly, maybe my personality sucks, maybe it's because I'm short, but I just KNOW that something is wrong with me and that's why nobody wants me. I'm just tired of feeling like a loser and an outsider and like someone nobody wants to be around. I don't even know what to do anymore. Will life ever get better for me?

I have some slight military experience, which put some emphasis on discipline, respect and hierarchy, which obviously are not core goal in the civilian world, but they're still valuable. Of course the military style can be too strict, cold and not well perceived.

Since I'm not so great with social skills (but I'm not anti-social either, I can make people laugh with a joke or two (is that a social skill?)), I was wondering is there are some quick advices about being a good-enough manager.

Some ideas:

* communicate with your team, either by a quick, maximum 1 or 2 hour meeting, once per week or every 4 days, to talk about issues, progress, etc. Of course it doesn't have to be entirely professional and focused, it can be social too.

* individual, face to face meeting, once every 1 or 2 weeks, 30min max, since face to face can be better sometimes for more in-depth talk.

* those meetings can be made at distance too

* highly encourage dinner/bar/lunch/sports together if possible, at least once a month or every two week

Of course there are important qualities, like non-violent communication https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication

701,"Hi pals.

I've been ambivalent and anxious about making the decision to start over. There are a lot of variables. I'll try to keep this simple. For reference, I am 26/f.

Prior to the social distancing, economic despair and social ruin that COVID-19 has brought, I was feeling restless and unfulfilled in my job. I absolutely love the company and the people but felt I'd hit my limit there. I work in the specialty coffee industry in a management role and felt confident in my ability to get a job elsewhere based on my experience. Of course, my industry is hit hard by the current crisis and I'm expecting the job hunt to be less fruitful. I am furloughed at my current company but have no intention of returning full-time nor do I expect they would be able to afford me on the other side of this. I am under the impression that my department will essentially cease to exist due to financial constraints put on the company right now.

I'm in a long distance relationship with a partner in southern CA though we met and began dating in New England (where I am now). The distance has put a strain on our relationship in the usual ways and I want to close the gap. This falls into line with my current career issues in that moving to a larger city will open up the job market, even during COVID-19, a lot. I live in a small economy currently. However, my current financial and living situation is very comfortable. I've lived in my small (500sqft) apartment for three years and my expenses are beyond reasonable. Anywhere I move, I will be paying $300-500 more monthly though I've managed to save and have no debt. I will likely have \~16k after moving expenses for whenever I get to a new location for my safety net.

I love my house. I love my back yard. I love my landlord. My family is close by and I have great friends. However, I still feel like part of me is missing. I'm dissatisfied in a lot of ways, I am clinically depressed and have general anxiety disorder. I live alone and my partner is elsewhere so during social distancing I am completely alone. I haven't touched another human in two months (I'm a very touchy-feely person with my friends, family and partner). It's driving me nuts and the thought of closing that gap is getting more and more hard to resist. Then again, I'm terrified to lose the comfort of my home and the safety of my current situation despite not having a job and being totally isolated.

How do I move past this crippling ambivalence? I keep doubting myself, my ability to create a safe and comfortable place elsewhere, the strength of my relationship and my own willpower. I bounce between positivity and being so torn up about this. I don't know if I'm overthinking or if my fears are telling. Either way, my future feels very uncertain and I can't stand not having some sort of control or understanding of the track and timeline I'm on.

702," TLDR at bottom. So, I'm 22f, and my two brothers I'll call ""E"", 25 and ""A"", 24 have had kind of a rough go of it relationship wise our whole lives. We just never really got along.  That being said, in our adult lives, it has improved somewhat. Especially since A got a girlfriend who I'll call ""C."" They all live with my mother, and I live with my husband.

She's really very nice and we have hung out personally a bunch of times. However, ""E"" has been out of state for months for work. He's back in town for a while, and while it's nice to have him back, he's been keeping me at an arms length, as he always does. That doesn't bother me as much as the following. 

Whenever I try to make plans with these guys, they're either busy, simply say no unless I offer to pay, or they cancel. It's fine if people cancel, don't get me wrong, but it's every time. Then, when they reach out to me every once in a blue moon, if I'm busy, I get a phone call from my mom saying I don't try hard enough. When we do all hang out, it's like they disregard everything I say. 

Because of our checkered past, I've tried so hard for the last few years to Spackle together a relationship with them. I always feel like I have to liquefy who I am, or they'll go back to hating me. Meanwhile, while I'm trying to be the perfect daughter and sister, they go ahead and go everywhere without me, posting pictures on facebook, and not even considering me. It's super hurtful, like C is the sister E always wanted.  

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. Maybe they just honestly don't like me. Any insight? 

TLDR- My family refuses to hang out with me when I try to make plans, when they make plans if I don't drop everything and do what they're asking, I'm the bad guy. Or, they completely leave me out and flaunt their adventures online.",06May2020,1

TLDR at bottom

So a little background on me and then my situation. My defining characteristic is my social anxiety, which is not super relevant to this post except to make the point that it has been very hard for me to make friends or any real connections with people. So I have tried to be very close with and good to the few friends that I do have in my life. There’s a group of maybe ten people who have effectively been my only real friends since high school. And like four people in that group have been my go-to circle, I was at their houses or vice versa most nights. One person from that circle is heavily involved in this story, i will call him “Rich” for the sake of this post. Rich and I have been very close for going on 12 years now, no one has been there for me like him and vice versa. I’ve given my heart and soul to all these people but especially him. Platonic but still a strong bond (so I thought) 

So about two years ago I met this girl, I’ll call her Kriss, through my roommate who is not part of the aforementioned group. She was cute but I very quickly found out she A. had a man B. Had a cocaine problem and C. Was a well known pathological liar to the point where she (a 95 lb sceenie weenie) tried to convince me she was a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and Jiujitsu the first night I met her. And as if that hadn’t turned me off her enough I soon heard that just a few months earlier she had finally been caught by her man for running around on him, and through sheer force of will, a web of lies and high psi mouth suction, managed to keep him. 

Fast forward a year, camping trip with the pals, my roommate comes too and brings a newly single Kriss, where she meets Rich. They talk a bunch. I didn’t bother it because I always support my friends getting nookie. Maybe a week after that meeting he mentioned they had hooked up. Quick high five and a “careful tho she crazy” and that was the end of the conversation. There were maybe four times over the next six months that I saw her and him in the same room, and I think one time he mentioned that they still hook up. Compare that to the 3-4 times a week she was hanging at my house with my roommate, bragging about the rainbow of dicks she’s been gobbling and occasionally even talking pretty heavy shit about Rich. I assumed they had hooked up a bunch, maybe even still have each other filed as a recurring booty call, but it was very clearly no more than that. According to her. 

About 6 months after they met, and about 6 months ago as I’m writing this, I was drunk at a family gathering, setting a speed record for swiping right on tinder (lame boys can’t be picky) and saw that I had matched with Kriss. EVEN AT THIS POINT I was not thinking about getting up on that pony, just had a little small talk about my roommates dog to not be rude, but she steered the conversation in a way that made her intentions clear. I knew it would be weird and regrettable but I was on a dry spell and as I said, lightly sautéed. So I fucked her. Weird. Regrettable. And possibly a code yellow breach of the Bro Code Accords, but as I said, she had made it unnecessarily, painfully clear how NOT in a relationship with ANYONE she was, and how little she cared for Rich. Of course it was my mistake to assume it was mutual and not first check how HE felt about HER, and I totally accept that it was fucking skeevy for me to fuck her, even with the limited info I did have. 

So days pass, she keeps hitting me up trying to get back up on it, I consistently passed on that. Everything seemed fine until one night maybe a week later I go to Rich’s house for a party, and she’s there, under his arm, on his lap, just very openly intimate body language between them, and my heart was just hanging out of my asshole the whole night. This was clearly more than what she made it out to be, and it’s possible that I just fucked over my best friend in the world. I didn’t say anything that night but the next day I hit her up like “hey I didn’t realize what was up with you and Rich, why didn’t you tell me, why would you do that, etc.” and she basically said “k” or something equally dismissive. This shit was literally driving me insane and I already have heavy anxiety as I mentioned, so the NEXT day I told her I needed to tell him what happened, I couldn’t sit with the guilt and I’d rather he not hear it from someone else down the road. She says “okay If you feel like that’s what you have to do” 
So I told him. He was furious. Made me leave immediately. And from that point on, literally from that moment, every single one of my friends just straight up ghosted me. Every person I cared about in the world, just completely ceased communication all at once. Cancelled from my own life. 

This is a big deal for me. Like I said, I don’t have a lot of friends and it’s very hard for me to make new ones, let alone friends on the level that I was on with these people. I gave them 12 years of my life, ALL of my good years, and they all just so easily cast me aside. It has left me feeling unbelievably insecure and worthless and angry and sad. Especially since none of them know what really happened and no one even bothered to ask me. 

So now it’s been six months, I tried to explain myself to him back when it happened, I’ve reached out to him several times since then asking if we can talk about it and he says things like “I won’t be mad forever” but it’s been SIX MONTHS and I am still currently excommunicated. Kriss on the other hand, is fully back in his life like nothing happened. She pulled the same shit she did with her ex, “I’m so sorry, I felt like shit after, I’m just insecure, etc.” Which is horse shit. She didn’t feel bad AT ALL, she was aggressively trying to get back up on me for like a week. I’m the one who felt bad, I’m the one who came to him and told him, she didn’t even want to tell him EVER. 
To clarify, they were NOT in a relationship, that is a fact, it’s just that he was very into her. She fully was fully aware of that. And he thought I knew that. Not sure how I was supposed to have known that since he didn’t told me, but that’s not the point. The point is she intentionally deceived me. 

So my questions are; Do I deserve this for what I did? Or even if their reaction was extreme, was it my fault? Is he justified in cutting me off, while allowing her back into his life? Do I have a right to be upset with all my other friends for cancelling me? Should I even be trying to rekindle those friendships with them at this point? And hey if anyone has suggestions on how to make new friends I’m all ears, I’m about 1 panic attack away from being a full on incel introvert here. 



TLDR: I was deceived by the undercover unofficial boo thang of my best friend into thinking she wasn’t ever involved with him. I had sex with her, but after realizing that she had lied to me, I had to tell my friend what I did. Now every single one of my friends have completely cancelled me from their lives over it.

705,"Lately he’s been feeling like the villain in his own story. He feels like everyone hates him, like we are able to be petty and mean and get away with it while he can’t, and he feels like we all resent him. 

If someone teases him in the morning, or if he upsets someone, while the other person will completely forget the incident he’ll spend the rest of the day thinking about it, and every little thing the other person does he’ll think is done to annoy him. 

Just a few minute ago I came into the kitchen. He’s always wearing his big noise-cancelling headphones, so (though I wasn’t trying to) I ended up startling him. 

I guess I shouldn’t have, but I’m his older sister and I’m stupid and immature and I teased him. I pretended to touch the pot of pasta he was boiling (I mean, obviously I wasn’t going to touch it, because it was hot) and I got the reaction I wanted... more or less. 

He whined my name and I stopped and proceeded to make some instant ramen because I hadn’t eaten all day. However, as he finished making his pasta, he was grunting and hitting and slamming things, and I realized I’d pushed him too far. 

When I asked him what was wrong (albeit not kindly, kind of in a frustrated tone because I felt like he was overreacting), he said “You’re just doing this to bother me!” I said, “No, I’m just making food! This is the kitchen, I need to eat!” And he just growled and went “whatever,” but he continued to slam things and grunt. 

I then asked him if he wanted to talk about it, and he did. Sometimes I listen to him and give advice about things. He says some pretty messed up stuff sometimes. 

Anyway, he went on to tell me about how we can be petty and how he’s not allowed to be, how I do things throughout the day to purposefully annoy him. 

So I told him that it seemed that it was he who was constantly comparing himself to other people, that we all cared about him and didn’t see him in the light he thought we did, and that he needed to start looking at himself more highly. At that point he had finished his pasta and left. 

The thing is, this whole “crisis” as he described it has been going on for some months now, though I know that this way he sees himself has probably been going on longer. He slams things, he yells, he beats things (objects, not animals or people, though the way he hits his bed with his cane makes me hope he never has children) and he sees himself as the black sheep of the family. 

I know I should never tease him, even if they’re little things. Sometimes he’s fine with it, but the times he’s not (and there’s no specific pattern in the things he’s sensitive to) he overreacts in big ways. I know I should treat him like I would one of my little cousins, but as his older sister it’s very difficult, because he’s *not* a kindergartener and I just always forgot that he’s as irrational as one. I have toned down the teasing, but the little things set him off. I’ll keep working towards seeing him in the light I know he needs to be treated in, but for now:

Is there anything I can suggest he do to help himself? Like any exercise to help his gain some self worth, or to see himself as the hero and not the villain? I know there’s nothing I can say to change his mind, and I know some part of him wants to be the black sheep, or else he wouldn’t be so insistent that we all hate him. Even so, I feel like I need to do something to help him.

714,"I recently started working for a tiny company that sources and ships medication to people all over the globe where their medication is not available.

I work with such patients and doctors, I ask them to take 45min to test a website so I can find faults in it and improve it - no personal medical data needed. I'm a UX designer.

I pretty much exhausted my network and now have to contact externally - and I don't know how to approach it so I don't scare people off. I truly believe in what we do, but approaching people raving about how we help patients sounds disingenuous, even if true.

How can I approach people in a kind way, taking into account their challenges as patients or doctors with patients who need extra help?

And of course if you are someone who can't find medication or a doctor with patients who can't, you are more than welcome to contact me.",06May2020,1
715,"*TL;DR included.*

I'm in a long distance relationship with my BF (we live in different countries, so we don't get to meet each other that often), and the first time we met face to face, I just couldn't get rid of the thought of his ex girlfriend when we were getting intimate. He had told me about this girl he has a child with: they're not in good terms, he never gets to see the kid and they don't see each other. Nothing bad, he just told me about his history and his manipulative and toxic ex, not like he was bragging or trying to make me feel insecure by telling about her. Just informing.

But sometimes the way he grabs me like he'd done it a thousand time before or the way he does certain things, the things he told me he'd like to do to me, it all just makes me think of his ex, and just them together doing the exact same stuff makes me just feel *very* uncomfortable. I'm not insecure, but these thoughts just bother me. The thought of someone using some kind of a technique on me that they've used on someone else just makes me feel uncomfortable. Makes me feel like I'm just one of many.

Like, I don't do shit that I used to do with my exes. Like if I used to give my ex some kind of special kisses or grab/hug them in a certain way, I wouldn't bring that to a new relationship. I come up with new special stuff. I just feel like my boyfriend has done those things before and for some reason, it bothers me.

I don't enjoy giving oral, I don't enjoy letting him do stuff that he wants to do because I don't feel special. I'm pretty sure it's just all in my head, but I can't help it. I just want us to have something special, I don't want him to do things to me that he used to do to his ex, I don't want to do stuff to him that his ex used to do. You know what I mean? I'm scared of being a substitute.

Am I crazy? *Do I care too much?* What's wrong with me? **Just what the fuck.**

**TL;DR: The way my boyfriend grabs me or the things he wants to do in bed with me makes me almost automatically think of him doing those things to his ex and it's bothering me. Sometimes I just don't feel special.**",06May2020,1

717,"I had been doing a bit of tech support and language translation during March and early April for a big project. The employer recently asked me to help them move. Initially I agreed because we had discussed a fair wage, but was told later that I’d only be paid for hours spent working on the project (not any time spent moving all of their belongings). I ended up going home rather than helping them move - why work for free during a pandemic?

Now this person is coming home from being in the city, and wants me to start up work again as soon as they arrive. No 2 week waiting period and no social distancing in the home where we worked.

WIBTA if I said I don’t want to do it anymore? This person honestly scares me a bit. From road rage and running red lights, heavy discussion of mental health issues and past trauma and a clear need for control (they tried to tell me what I could order for dinner and decided which university I was going to for which degree and planning my whole life???

My ex-boyfriend cheated on me and before he told me the truth, he encouraged me to buy him a flight to come see me again (he was broke at the time).

I haven't spoken to him in about two months (since we've broken up), and I emailed him last night (I chose to not use any social media platforms to communicate with him to make it as formal as possible) and I asked for the money because I gave him two months to get the money together, but he never got back to me.

722,"Last night my girlfriends cat came back to her home badly injured. She was in so much pain she couldn't even make a sound and looked in a really bad way. They took her to the vet who originally said it was a collapsed lung and could be treated but when they got some more tests back it appeared things were much worse than originally thought. I don't know the exact details but there were many broken bones and her kidneys were unresponsive as well as the collapsed lung. They said that they could undergo about 5 days worth of procedures but she was unlikely to make it through the night and it would cost about $3000. She really didn't want the cat to suffer anymore than she already had and they didn't have a spare $3000 to spend on a procedure that likely wouldn't work so she made the hard decision to say goodbye and have her cat put down.

 It was about then when she had an unrelated allergic reaction to some medication she started earlier that day and had to go to the hospital. Here is where I'd appreciate someone elses opinion, when everything was sorted she assumed that they'd already put her cat down but apparently another vet at the clinic had heard about what happened and said that she was looking to adopt a cat and that she would adopt my girlfriends cat and take on the financial responsibility of the procedures. She would perform the treatments that she could and, after everything, if the cat made it through she would go home with the vet. 

I'm not really sure how I feel about this and am very conflicted. I feel like the vet is putting a very harsh decision on my girlfriend during a stressful time. Is this a normal thing for a vet to do? It seems very strange but I've only ever owned guinea pigs and that was a long time ago so I have little experience with vets. On one hand it gives the cat a chance at survival, she celebrated her 1st birthday last week and is a beautiful, somewhat spoilt, kitty. On the other hand this cat was an emotional support animal for my girlfriend throughout college and I feel like it's a little weird for the vet to propose this. I think I'm a little too close to the situation because of how much I've bonded with the cat. My girlfriend wanted to give her a chance at life but hasn't said a whole lot about it to me since because she is really wacked out on medication from the hospital following her reaction. I'd appreciate someone elses opinion on this, thanks.",06May2020,1
723,"I will try and keep this succinct but it requires a little backstory:

I currently live in my aunt and uncles vacation home, and have done so since graduating college and getting a job in the area three years ago. I pay very little in rent and saved up for a decent down payment, and started house hunting last September. I found a house at the end of November that I liked, but the deal I put in fell through in mid-January. I decided to take a break looking for houses until mid-March, after I got back from a long planned work trip. 

I am a first time home buyer and found the process very confusing as my realtor was lazy and didn’t give me a lot of help. My parents bought the only home they/I lived in together from my grandparents, and so have never been through the house hunting process before. I was very stressed (to the point of tears and a couple anxiety attacks, which I usually called my mom during to help calm down) during my first attempt at home buying. 

Present: I live in a state that was hit hard by covid-19. I got back from my March trip and was immediately thrown into a full stay at home order. We are still under that order and it does not appear that it will be lifted any time soon. However, realtors are considered essential and are still able to show houses one-on-one. 

Issue: my mom has been trolling real estate websites pretty much since my original offer fell through, despite me asking her not to. Every time she sends me a house to look at, it ratchets my anxiety up and I get very upset with her. It’s especially frustrating now, because I’m trying very hard to stay at home and I am lucky that my current housing situation is stable enough that I don’t NEED to look for housing immediately. 

My mom’s side is that she is frustrated with ME, because I complain about living at my aunt and uncle’s (true, they are not the easiest to live with) and that I could be letting a really good deal pass by because I’m being too cautious with disease prevention. She says she’s only trying to help. 

How can we solve this? I just don’t feel comfortable going into other peoples’ houses right now (even the empty ones) but my mom thinks I’m being ridiculous and keeps nagging me. Should I follow her advice or stick to my guns?

TL;DR I feel my mom is unnecessarily pushing me to take a risk by going house hunting in a state that’s hard hit by covid-19, she feels I’m being overly cautious and I’ll miss out on a good deal. Who is right?",06May2020,1

725,"(25 F)  Hi I'm a nurse with a bachelor's degree.  Boss tells me that I'm eligible to go back to school and get my nurse practitioner's (NP) degree and the university hospital I work at will cover 90% of the costs.  My choice, no pressure.  It would take me 7 years to finish. But it doesn't appeal to me.  Right now, I work full-time three 12hr shifts a week, and fix computers with my BF.  Before the quarantine, we'd just go to concerts and the gym and have fun.  He's a computer engineer and plays drums in a band w/ his friends at bars sometimes.  I love art, he loves live music.  He gets it, that I want a space to do what I want. Its been a long time since I've been this happy.

My dad had a screaming match with me, and called me a ""stupid ass-wiping nurse.""  I don't know why I was so stupid, but I mentioned the chance to go back to school with my mom.  He told me if I didn't grab this chance I was stupid.

The thing is I want to stay as a bedside nurse.  I like answering emergencies.  I like where I am.  My dad has a point that as a nurse with a 4-year degree I'm easy to replace.  Also, even though I like where I am, things can change.  But, NP is not all rainbows and butterflies either--I see so many good NP's miserable because all the politics and paperwork pull them away from patient care.

My dad apologized later.  He realizes I'm an adult and my own person.  He's actually one of the nicest people.  Its just he loves a little too hard, and then blew up.  But, I thought about what he said.  I am afraid of being replaced.  Or that the job I work for will change for the worst.  Or I could get injured while working, and lose everything--like so many other nurses.  As an NP I would no longer be working at the bedside as much and my chances of getting back/neck/shoulder injuries would drop to nil.  I would be more futureproof.

729,"tl;dr I don't have anything more than circumstantial evidence and I can't tell if I am actually in danger. 

I moved to this town in January, pretty nice neighborhood. People take care of their yards close to shops and restaurants. Kids play. People walk their dogs. My downstairs neighbor seemed ok when I first met her. She has Deadhead tattoos and is around late 40's early 50's. Has a job but drinks and smokes cigs and weed. (not that that qualifies anything) Since I moved in here I have heard her talking shit about me because I have a little bit of money.

 ""I have heard her (jokingly?) saying let's kill him I don't want to not have to make car payments!"" but she also thought I was some kind of cop. I heard her once responding to the question ""Do you see any cameras up there?' (along our shared exterior wall, my bathroom window is directly above where they hang out.) 

When I started to get suspicious of her intent I started audio recording whenever I left the apt. I could here her once clearly open my door (she had keys for landlord in case of emergency (?) Anyway, I could here her drunkenly and clearly say ""There's probably bugs all over this place"" to which a man answered over her speaker phone ""Do you feel as though you are in danger?"" 

Then she said ""No. did you see that tv in the BR? You think it's bugged?"" The guy on the phone said ""yeah, I saw it"" She continues, ""Do you think I'm losing it?"" He replies, ""You could be. Anything's possible"" But, while going through the dozen or so recordings (this was the only one with anything meaningful) I accidentally deleted it. But shenanigans continue.

Turns out the guy with the deep voice lives two doors down. I tried to get close to him to see where his head's at last week. Much of his conversation was about how he grew up in the neighborhood and knows everyone personally, and also all about his violent tenancies. Who's asses he's kicked and how. How his mother said she's afraid of what he might do someday. Shit like that. He also kept invading my personal space. Every time I stepped back he move closer. Eventually I literally had walked across the street and he was right fucking there like he was following me.

Last month (on a Wednesday )someone was trowing pebbles at my BR window around 10pm. I have an emergency ladder there and figured someone might be casing the place to see if I'm home so I grabbed my camping knife (looks like a hunting knife) and rapidly opened the blinds. Because it was dark I could't see anything but when I lowered the blinds I could hear a female voice say ""He looks serious"". Sounded young, maybe early twenties.

The following Wednesday our cars were egged over night and the hood emblem on my old, well maintained BMW was smashed which I didn't notice till the next day when my neighbor notified me of the egging. I called the police to see if I cold come down and file a report. She said ""we're closed. just like every other government office"" (real snotty like) and I should find a cop. I didn't put 2 and 2 together just figured 'damn kids'. But then the following Wednesday someone left a pot of Lillies (the kind you bring to funerals) down below my window. That's three offences, one week apart. I'm seeing a pattern here.

Nothing happened for a week then that Saturday a ghetto looking Cadillac with blacked out windows half way down slowed almost to a stop as they turned the corner my house is on and I thought I heard someone say ""That our guy?"" I was sitting on the stoop.

This week on Monday there was a Chevy Lumina with blacked out windows idling at my corner facing my house when I came home from my morning walk. And then a truck with blacked out windows doing the same when I came home from my evening walk. 

Today a different Chevy Lumina with blacked out windows was idling, parked behind my other car. I took a picture of their plate.

Meanwhile, my other neighbor has been befriending me by building the back yard garden with me. The thing is, the same night I heard downstairs neighbor saying maybe we should kill him, I don't want a car payment anymore, other neighbor was coming up the back stairs saying (sarcastically, jubilantly ?) ""I'm going to be a millionaire!""

I don't have a million dollars. And I can't tell if I'm in danger. It's like if my house were getting broken into and I'm pointing a gun at them but they have their hands in the air, smiling in a non-threatening way as they slowly walk towards me and calmly say ""I'm not going to hurt you.""",06May2020,1

Another is a light one, like when a friend keeps giving me spoiler of a movie or game he knew I've been waiting for. So I replied something like ""thanks, you really had to."" And somehow I just felt bad about it, but not as bad.

733,"I’ve been friends with her for four years after meeting her at an internship. Every time we’re talking about relationships, she always tell me that “ohh maybe you are a lesbian that’s why you never had a boyfriend.” in an insuating tone. I have no doubts about my sexuality and I don’t have any clue how she came up with that.

Recently, we were chatting about her lovelife and for some reasons, she once again managed to say that despite the topic being about her. I never reacted before because I do not want to sound defensive, but I have a resolution to be more open about my feelings. I told her that I always feel hurt whenever she comments that and deep inside I’m overthinking if I’m giving people the wrong vibe about myself. She did apologize. However she explained that it was the first time she said that to me, there’s nothing wrong with being a lesbian, and told me that “I know you are smart, I hope you are not homophobic.” 

I was hurt even more. First, she’s an openly gay man and I’ve always been her supporter. I never discriminated against them, stands by and defends my other friends who are LGBTQ+, and supports their fight towards a more accepting society. Being told that they hope I’m not homophobic is something I never thought I would have to deal with.

After that, she casually brushed it off and proceeded to ask me about a different topic. I did not reply.

I honestly don’t know how to move forward from this. I am not sure what to tell her that won’t bring in any more issues that’ll just pile up. I’ve been asking some friends if I was the one in the wrong, but a more unbiased advice from you guys will be more helpful. Thank you so much!",06May2020,1

743,"I’m currently 20 weeks pregnant and have a 3 year old son. 

Before the world came to a halt I was a prep cook at a breakfast place working 5:30am to 3pm. 
I loved my job, but when the restaurant hit a slow period my hours were the first to be cut. I went from 5-6 days to 3-4 So I had already started applying for other jobs. I finally got hired on for part time nights at another restaurant and planned to work both until I decided which place worked better in the long run. 
The day I was supposed to start my second job is the same day restaurants were ordered to shut down. So I went from 2 to 0 jobs. 

My grandmother and MIL watched my son while I worked before, but they are both older with health issues and my MIL hasn’t been taking things seriously. 

My husband is a corrections officer working 6am to 2pm. 

I got a temp job babysitting my friends 2 year old while she works from home and I filed for unemployment. With the recent increase in unemployment, plus the baby sitting money, Im making more now than I was while working. 

Well the breakfast place wants to open back up on the 18th with limitations. I don’t think I should go back. If my hours were cut before I have a feeling they’ll be even lower now. 
So I’ll be making less money, won’t have a sitter, and leave my friend scrambling for a sitter. 

My husband thinks I should go back, but said it’s ultimately my choice. 
He doesn’t want us to survive off government assistance and worries the gap in my resume will hurt my chances for future jobs. 

His mom hasn’t worked since he was in middle school even though she is able, survives off the government, and keeps taking in stray kids. He’s worried if I take the time off we are no better than her. 

But I’m not refusing to work because I don’t want to. We have a good thing going right now and I’m pregnant. Job hunting in the first trimester was one thing, but I am very visibly pregnant, plus THERE IS A PANDEMIC. 
Taking time to for the pregnancy is completely different than giving up on working. If I wasn’t pregnant I would have gotten a new full time job the second my restaurant shut down. 

Is there a downside to staying on unemployment I’m missing or should I ride this out as long as I can?",06May2020,1
744,"I have a friend, let's call her Becky. Becky has been in an on-again, off-again relationship for several years now. They've broken up multiple times but they somehow always find their way back into the relationship. This boyfriend of hers, let's call him Bob, has never treated her right in my opinion. From an outsider's perspective, it seemed that he knows exactly when to be nice but otherwise took Becky for granted. A couple years ago, I noticed Becky would get excited when Bob did simple, mundane tasks for her. I also noticed that he would act differently when guests were over. When I was over, he would offer to do so many things for her, but when he left, she would complain to me that he changed his mind. 

Becky has been telling me how unhappy she is for ***years*** now. She is hesitant to end it simply because it is easier to stay with Bob. After all the time they've invested into the relationship, I get that it's hard to end it. Like all relationships, they probably have their ups and downs, and that's what she thinks these bad times are. I also don't think quarantine has helped their relationship, as they've barely spent any time together despite the fact that they are the only two in the apartment together. I'm typically one to never suggest someone end a relationship because I believe that idea/decision should be made by the people in the relationship. However I also believe that once someone has thought about the logistics of what will happen next and where they are going to live once the relationship is over, they already have one foot out the door.

748,"Ok the actual thing happened 3 months ago in feb

(3 months ago)

Basically I was doing really poorly but I am also the type that can be miserable and still function until I have a epic mental health moment lol.. So leading up to the big day I was really depressed and just did not take care of myself. This is weird but my bf found razors that I keep not bc I wanted to do anything but just bc its comforting lawl. He would be so worried that he wouldn’t sleep when he was away from me and he’d bite his nails until they bled. I felt pretty ok even tho I wasn’t idk I wasn’t going to do anything to myself. I just can’t really tell when I am bad but then in hindsight its like yeaaaa that was bad

Then I had my epic meltdown Feb 17 and thought it was hospital time for sure but I calmed down enough by 5am to uber back to my parents house 30 min away from campus. To let bf breath I stayed with my parents for 3 days and got into therapy asap and back on meds to keep it together. I felt better almost instantly after my meltdown and wanted to come back to my apartment. I was fine to come back bc I was not a threat lol and I was in therapy + meds + parents. I was set on doing better bc I wanted to come back to campus so bad

Boyfriend did not say anything and on Wednesday he picked me back up from my house (car was on campus he had to come get me to give me my car) When we got back he moved out all of his stuff from my place. I was super confused bc they’d been there since I moved in. It was just such a weird time to do it bc I kinda lost my mind a few days ago. Then he made me sit in his dorm and I watched him rearrange his stuff for almost 2 hours. It just felt like I was being punished

I thought ok either he is leaving me and wants to get all his stuff b4 he does bc I'm cray or he is punishing me. He said it was bc I never use the stuff and he just wanted it back.

When I moved back in after my classes I saw he literally left nothing of his, even stuff I thought he’d gifted to me. He even took a little key that was hanging near my bed. The only thing he left of his was a dirty cooler he brought in my house to dispose of. Only things left in my house were a mattress, dirty cooler and lamp lol which is ok for me if it wasn’t done in this timeline 

(Yesterday)

I mentioned the lamp made me anxious bc of when he moved all his things out as kinda a joke and he said “I was trying everything to force you out of that apartment”

So he did that to make it as uncomfortable as possible for me to move back in even though I expressed to him how hard I was working to come back to ease his nerves lol and I was actually working real hard. He just wanted me to stay home with my parents so he knew I was safe even tho I told him I would feel much better being back. He did not protest me coming back when I said I would, just took his stuff.

That part of him moving out and me watching him move around his stuff still makes me uneasy to think about and was probably worse if not as bad as how the meltdown made me feel 

Even tho he was super worried and panicked he did this with no ultimatum for me. Like id rather he say please stay with your parents or we break up bc this is too much for me. Like that, I would understand 

Idk if I am drama and should let it go but it is really making me upset",06May2020,1

751,"Hello.

I feel like I am repeating myself on these posts, but I am tired of being in a entropic limbo. I just want an end.

I have multiple health and mental issues: depression, dyscalculia, ADD,dyspraxia, hand tremors, insomnia (I think hand tremors are connected to this), kyphoscoliosis (being 6'8"" does not help), neck lordosis, cystic acne, skin allergy (I don't know to what) and chronic pain.

I know you would say that I need to go to a psychologist, but I have researched what kind of methods they use and spend days online seeing how the most popular one, antidepressants are effective. Well it seems not so much, they increase the serotonin, but the body stops producing its own to balance things out. The general healthcare in my country is bad, so I doubt anything positive would come from going to the psychologist. 

I have mental problem, I have rage issues, probably stemming from the bullying I had as a child. I was always tall and skinny, plus quiet. If I was in the US it would be the perfect recipe for a school shooter. I one brought actually a knife when I was 12-13 to knife all of other kids that wronged me. Other days I would be mad at myself so being so weak and I deserve it, it's kill or be killed. (Man the emotions this evokes, rage and sadness that brings tears to my eyes why can't I go back in time and stop me from being born.)

As I finished high school I was out of a job in a bad economy and had to live with my folks, I still do. I was angry at everything and I started to go to the gym and got injured, that is when my chronic pain begins. I started to hate myself more than ever before, I had suicidal thoughts before, but from that point it started to become a daily thing. 

I am a genetic failure, I need to die to rid myself of suffering and the only permanent way is death and becoming plant food. 

As Rust from the show True Detective put it:

 ***""I think human consciousness, is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware, nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself, we are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self; an accretion of sensory, experience and feeling, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody is nobody. Maybe the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our programming, stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last midnight - brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.""***",06May2020,1

755,"It's kind of a complicated situation and I'm unsure if it fits this sub so if doesn't I'll remove it but for the time being I need some help.

So around October last year I met this girl at my highschool (I'm a sophomore she's a junior) through basketball. We do this training program with the youth for basketball skills. Well she got into my group and by the time the program was over we got to talk a decent bit. She seemed pretty sarcastic and liked to mess with people but I made her laugh a lot while we were there. She'd say stuff like how she thought I was ""sexy"" and how I'm gonna ""marry her"" again I took this with heaping grain of salt considering her personality and that she was gorgeous and I am meh. So after that she gave me her snap and we snapped until December, mainly just pics of whatever but also how our day went and sometimes something that could vaguely be considered flirting. Anyways mid December she left me on read and since I felt like it wasn't going anywhere I stopped too. Anyways fast forward to now and like most girls that I have been interested in it fades away after 2-3 weeks but I haven't been able to shake her off. So 5 months later I gathered the courage to snap her again saying ""heyy"" and she responded immediately with ""yo"" excited I immediately responded back with ""what's up"" and I got left on read. This happened at 12 am today so it hasn't been too long but Im at a crossroads. I really want to start talking to her again and feel like I might even want to date her but I don't know if she's still interested or if she ever was.

757,"Howdy, folks. I'm a 20-year-old with ADHD (among other *really fun* brain problems), and it's becoming increasingly clear to me that I'm not cut out for college. I miss deadlines, I avoid obligations out of anxiety, I have zero motivation to make friends because I'm an anxious bitch (also I have a few friends who go to a different school, states away from me). I'm just really bad at doing schoolwork--not because I'm a lazy piece of shit, but because I can't do deadlines and long-form assignments, and avoidance behaviors exacerbate that. For example, I had the rough draft of a paper due yesterday. I haven't even started the damn thing. The final draft is due Friday. I'm becoming less and less motivated to even start on it. I'm afraid to contact my professor about it, because she's a bit of a hardass about these things, and I have a feeling she'd (understandably) just tell me to finish it for late credit, which is already my only option.

Distance learning is also making all the issues I'm already having something like 10x worse than they were to begin with. The reason I haven't even started on the paper is that this particular professor doesn't do real-time Zoom classes. I'm not obligated to look at her or be present in the same physical or virtual space with her really at all, so it was very easy for ADHD brain to just put the thing off with a laundry list of shitty justifications. I've also been missing assignments because my professors and I are all kinda shit at using technology in any intelligent way, so their online assignments are incredibly disorganized (sometimes under one tab, sometimes under another, sometimes not under any tab, but on the syllabus which is under a tab, but then the submission box is under a *different* tab and doesn't give any assignment instructions beyond just listing the name of the assignment, one of my professors doesn't even use his web page except as a hub for the Zoom schedule, and he has us email assignments to him). I'm also a dunce, so I'm not very good at correcting for my professors' bad online organizational skills and looking in the right places. It's a mess, and I'm not equipped to clean it up.

I don't mean to be too self-congratulatory, but I'd consider myself to be relatively intelligent. I say that only to mean that I don't think I necessarily *need* college, if that makes sense. While learning is always valuable and you can never know enough stuff, I'm just not really compatible with the framework of college. I know enough stuff right now to get by and to exist as an adult. I'm well-read, I know the necessary math to manage day to day, I know how to use technology well enough to manage email, social media, and that sort of thing.

I have trouble staying motivated, is the biggest issue. I'm tired of college because there's nothing there to interest me right now, and the stress of it *far* outweighs the interest I have in what I'm learning. I can and will learn things on my own time if I'm interested in them--this is actually how I operate most of the time. Educational content on the internet has actually been really engaging and useful to me, and I've been able to learn some pretty cool shit that's actually very interesting to me.

But I don't have a ""plan"", as my parents continue to say. I live with them, don't have much money, don't have a job (and didn't before the pandemic), and I don't have any sort of drawn-out path to get me where I want to be. I want to be a musician, but I'm fine doing something else to support myself financially until my music can carry me, if that ever happens. I'm *very* willing to work simple jobs wherever I can get them. But my parents want me to have some sort of career-based path to follow.

The issue there is that I'm not consistent in my motivations or interests. There are loads of things I want to do, and what I'm most focused on at any given time varies. Music has been a consistent interest of mine. Beyond that, I've wanted to do search-and-rescue, I've wanted to be a music supervisor for film and TV, I've wanted to be a small-scale crop farmer--the list goes on. Obviously, none of this is entry-level shit, but it's all stuff I've been interested in doing, most of which is a lot more financially stable than a career as a recording and touring folk musician. I don't want to make a set plan for my life, because I don't want to trap myself in some sort of framework that I'll need to dismantle and rebuild whenever my interests change.

My main goal right now (or, rather, when this pandemic ends) is to make some money and get my driver's license (I know, I'm slow--driving scares the shit out of me, in no small part because I live in New Jersey). All I want is some amount of financial stability, and a way to get around and do things.

But my parents *need* me to have a ""plan"". Otherwise, they're going to continue to pay a college tuition, and they're going to continue to hound me about being on top of college shit. They want me to know *exactly* how I'm going to get myself out of the house. And I don't. I don't *want* to. I want to be open to whatever opportunities exist, and I want to be free to decide on the fly what I want to do.

How do I reconcile this? How do I maintain some sense of freedom and openness while also meeting my parents' expectations enough to be able to drop out of college and get the fuck out of this house?",06May2020,1
758,"Hello all, I hope everyone is keeping well under Covid - 19 times. 

I'm a 22 year old, recently dropped out of university because I felt spending £23,000 a year for a course I didn't like wasn't worth it. I've always felt like I've had a business mentality and now have been approached by an individual with a small business proposition. The business idea is from a guy selling vintage and branded clothes from Korea online to people all over the world. He said most of his customers are in the UK but his English isn't that great so he approached me because I'm also Korean but born and raised in England. I'm confident this would work well as I've been selling clothes to the younger population on social media for years. 

I'll cut to the point: He said he would offer me a 5-10% commission on each item sold as I'm basically advertising for him to a wider population that he struggles to contact. There's not much risk for me because I don't even come in contact with his clothes. Just help create more revenue from his sales. 

1) What sort of % should I be looking to charge him? 

2) How can I assure that I receive the 5-10% on each item? I don't know him so I was thinking of writing up a contract of some sort. I want to make sure he sticks to his word in paying me for helping his business thrive. 

Worth mentioning, I want to go into this with a fixed and want to seem confident with what I want on my end.

761,"Hey, thanks for reading! So as the title says, I  \[25F\] talk too much and am not a good listener. I don't think I'm the most extreme this personality can be. I don't know if most people would say this about me as the first thing that comes to mind, and I've only rarely been told I talk too much, maybe 3 times in my life, and never been told I'm not a good listener. But that doesn't mean people don't think it. I can just feel it in myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm talking too much it comes from over enthusiasm, I will feel like I have so much to say, and what I'm saying and thinking about is so entertaining to myself that I just can't wait to say it. I love talking and thinking and am usually fascinated. In these cases I'll listen to what other people say but usually immediately have something I want to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm a bad listener, it's because I don't really know why people are telling me things. Which is funny, coming from a person who talks a lot. But when I am talking too much, it's a lot of jokes and anecdotes that I find really interesting. Whereas someone who is just telling a kind of long, neutral story, or stating a plain fact, (""we have fewer green beans this time than we had last time"" sort of thing), or just slowly thinking aloud, I lose patience. I get antsy and I feel like you can tell on my face I'm kind of tortured. Partially the discomfort comes from the fact that I feel awkward, and I don't want to hurt their feelings. But partially it comes from the fact that I am almost annoyed that they don't know how to be entertaining. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that, in my childhood, my parents didn't really ask me questions, and so I learned different ways of getting their attention and sharing things with them. My sense of humor, my speed of talking, and my amount of talking all probably come from not having anyone around me who had the patience or interest to listen to me just say plain, normal things. 

&amp;#x200B;

But now, I'm the same as them, I don't really listen to other people. I am too fast-paced conversationally and while I think I'm generally a little different (more of a comedian ""life of the party"" personality than a bored/closed off personality), I don't want to be this way. I think I need to relax and learn that it's okay to just listen, people don't expect to be entertained all the time, and I shouldn't expect people to be entertaining all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

So really, I'm looking for advice from anyone who has been through this or understands on how to make that switch and slow down in conversations and become a better, calmer listener and not feel like if I have a little attention I need to talk for hours.",06May2020,1
762,"There's a specific task being assigned to our team of 5 people, 1 manager and 4 workers (Mindy, Sally, Anne) including myself. I emailed the team last week that I don't feel comfortable coming in the office for this specific assignment until Covid is over because I live with my older parents and share all the living spaces. We all have been WFH since mid March. 

Today we had a team meeting where the manager announced the assignment and started assigning days for each of us to come into the office. This specific assignment only requires each of us to be in the office 2-3x/week on a rotation for up to 6 weeks. Say Mindy takes MWF next week; Sally takes MWF the week after; Anne takes the week after that then back to Mindy until the assignment is completed. Anne and Sally started out with asking if only them working then when the manager said yes and told the team that I did request to sit out on this assignment due to personal reasons, Anne and Sally flipped and said ""this isn't fair, what's her personal reasons? I have my parents too, etc."" I don't know if they all live with their parents like I do. Anne is engaged to be married this year; Sally is married and from one brief mentioned of her dad in previous months he lives on the same property but not sharing the living spaces. Mindy is married and lives with her husband and two sons aged between 9-12. Mindy didn't say anything. The manager said if they have grievances then talk offline after the meeting. The manager said she would give me more work to do while I remain WFH, which requires me to analyze and write reports. The assignment requires us to sit and: count, sort, mark on papers, read numbers for triple checking. Simple physical work for 3-4 hrs a day. I'd take mindless work over extra reports that have many moving pieces and require me to attend meetings and collab with other managers. 

Now I feel uncomfortable because I am now seen in a bad light. I don't know how to appease to my coworkers without putting my parents at risk. If I made equally the same like Mindy, Sally and Anne then I would move in with my bf, split the bills with him and go to the office 2-3x/weeks for up to 6 weeks like they do, but I don't; I make the least. 

What should I say to my coworkers to address this tactfully? Please help because I don't want to be blacklisted on a small team where I don't feel welcomed socially and professionally. 

Thanks a lot. 

Tl;Dr: two co-workers voiced their opinion and disagreement and said it's unfair when they found out today that our manager does not send me to the office for 2-3x/week for 6 weeks on rotation basis to do easy mindless work when I already disclosed to the team last week uncomfortably that I live with my parents and don't want to put them at risk.

I start thinking of my future and all the negative things that could happen, my chest feels tight and I just feel so helpless. It’s genuinely terrifying and I don’t know how to snap myself out of it. I don’t really feel anxious, I just feel like I’m hopeless and lonely and lost. A few nights back, I began spiralling like this again and when I was finally able to stop myself from thinking in that way, 3 hours had gone by. I haven’t told anyone about it yet. 
I’ve also been getting into random arguments with my family members these past few weeks, where I have these bursts of anger and I get so angry over things that never seemed to bother me before. Again, I don’t know if I’m over reacting but this is really started to scare me, and I don’t know how to stop these feelings. Any ideas on what’s going on? It might be the isolation from quarantine, but I live in a joint family household so I do see other people daily. I also have not suffered any trauma and am very thankful for my family and my life in general, so I don’t know where these emotions are coming from. Any help on what to do and how to stop it would really be appreciated.",06May2020,1
765,"I don't really know where to post this. So this just happened. My mother was trying to log in gmail with her account, but gmail could not recognize the device she was using. She actually always used that one, but whatever. The fact is, as a way to verify she owned the account she was trying to log in, gmail asked for her to type in her number: she would then receive an SMS with a code to access. Note that her gmail account has not an associated phone number. In fact, because she refused to do that, we actually used my phone number, and it just worked. We could have used literally ANY number of a phone that was in the room. How exactly is this helpful in any way to verify the property of an account, if someone who tries to break in could just use his number? Is this just some sneaky mean that google uses to lowkey associate phone numbers to google accounts?",06May2020,1
766,"Here is the story of why I ended the friendship:

A month ago I cut off a friendship. It ended because I said I wasnt comfortable going to her house during COVID-19.. she lives with 6 other people and an elderly  grandmother with alzheimers. My mom has a heart condition so I also have to be super careful with social distracting cause if she got COVID-19  it could be life threatening. Anyways she called me a ""bad friend"" for not going to her house and said I should have went to go see her even if she had the virus..  needless to say that was the last straw. 

BUT it goes so much deeper than that. We have been ""friends"" since childhood but she is so toxic and I have been dreading everytime we hungout for the past four years. People like to throw around the word ""toxic"" but when I call her toxic I really mean it. 

I did so much for her and it went unrecognized. She doesnt have her lisence and lives 45 minutes away from me. Being a broke university student who works their ass off to pay bills, the gas money alone wasnt worth it. But driving there wasnt enough. No.. she would force me to buy her food and alcohol and would never ever pay me back or pitch in with gas money. AND I WOULD NOT EVER HEAR THE WORDS THANK YOU. I'm broke as hell and I bought her and her bf breakfast a few weeks ago and I didn't get thanked at all. So annoying right? But that's not all. 

We'd go to parties and she'd purposely embarrass me in front of people I was talking to, especially when guys/girls would flirt with me. She'd bring up embarrassing story on purpose, show them an embarrassing photo of me ect. There has been points where I'd introduce her to people I was dating and she would do the exact same thing. When I look back at it, it probably stemmed from jealously but that's not cool or friend like at all.

A few months ago my ex reached out to me to try and hangout and I turned him down because he was an asshole and I have a bf already. So he was petty and tried to get back at me by flirting with her over text. She should have been a good friend and ignored him but instead she rubbed it in my face and bragged about it and made me feel absolutely awful. 

Every romantic relationship I've been in, she is always a factor that makes or breaks it. All of my exes and my current bf have expressed confusion and uncertainty around her. One of my exes literally thought she was trying to take me from him. And honestly, maybe she was. I was in a relationship few years back and she knew it , yet whenever we had a sleepover she would always intrude when I had a shower. Shed dead ass get naked and join me in the shower uninvited. Whenever she had a shower she would always invite me and I always said no cause that's fucking weird. When I told my ex he was horrified and told me that is kind of ""rapey"" and honestly yeah it was. Also whenever I talked about dating someone new she would immediately find a reason to hate them or diss them or make them seem bad when really they weren't at all. And in her new relationship (her first real relationship) she says he is the only person she has a similar bond to with me. Kinda fucking weird but okay. 

Also I was a virgin all through high school and most of my first year of university and she would always shame me and pressure me to be sexual with men when I wasnt ready. She has had sex with 11 I think..  It's hard to count honestly, one week she was dog/house sitting for her cousin and invited four different guys over. She had claymida (she didn't know) when she had sex with those guys (some without pretection) and when she found out she didn't even tell half of them... I literally supported her so much through that even tho that was so beyond fucked up. And it's fine to have sex with as many people as you want, but she would always find a way to make me feel inferior about my sexual experience and like I needed that to be fulfilled as a person. When I finally did have sex we got into a huge fight and she told me I would regret it and stuff when she was the one who shamed me every time we hung out. It was so weird. (Btw I dont regret it at all 😘)

Another thing she has been doing recently is talking bad about her ""friends"" and family to me. One of her ""bestfriends"" is super smart and amazing and she's in university trying to become a vet. She gets mad when this friend of hers wont come out to clubs with us even though this friend of hers has huge issues with chronic pain and she also gets dizzy and has seizures when in environments like that. She always talks about how dumb her friend is for not hanging out with her cause she has homework and a boyfriend. She's says ""all she has is school"" as if that is a bad thing. Girl, I'm spending my life savings on school! My entire life, all my time and energy is spent on school pressuring what I am passionate about. This is rich coming from her, she hasn't even graduated high school after trying over and over again at almost 20 years old and works as a house keeper at a hotel. But keep talking crap about your friend who is doing amazing in school and is making an incredible future for herself. It just bothers me so much, she probably does the same thing to me behind my back. 

Here is where I need advice:

Yesterday I found out this ex-friend of mine is having mental health issues. I knew she had some hard things going on in her life when I ended the friendship, but knowing that I still ended it because she has hurt me so bad and taken out her anger on me throughout our entire friendship. She is now taking her anger out on her boyfriend (he even broke up with her for two weeks) and her family. 

I have been happier without her in my life and I didnt regret leaving her at all. But now hearing that she is having a hard time I'm not sure if I should reach out and help her through this hard time. I do still care about her and love her. But she has really hurt me and I'm scared to go back to this friendship that was so hard for me to end. 

What should I do? I feel so lost.",06May2020,1

768,"I guess just with the whole quarantine has me down. I (18M) always been a very self conscious, as I am very skinny (5'11"" \~145 lbs). I've tried working out at a gym before, but I just hate going because I am so self conscious and want to cry from anxiety (I have not been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and I don't think anything is wrong with me, just your typical teenage/hormone anxiety). Anyway, I just started watching these shows on Netflix that that always have all these strong and masculine men with muscles, authoritative and smooth voices, beautiful hair, etc. I just get on the verge of tears wanting to cry now every time I look in the mirror because I know I will never amount to this amount of ""manliness"". I have begun to obsess over this one actor, where I spend all this time looking at pictures of him and try to imitate his style. I honestly just feel so dumb just posting this. At school, I was always the funny and carefree kid that no one would've guessed how I feel about myself, so I really feel like I don't have anyone to talk with-- not even my close friends. Like I stated before, I've struggled with my self image before, but never to this extent.

If I could just describe how I felt in one sentence... its that I know the person I want to be, but I'm just not that person, and I don't know how (or if its even possible) to become the person I want to be. I think this is a problem that I have always struggled with, but its just now being brought into the light with all this extra time I have to think. Right now I am so tired of being myself that I want to cry, and then I get angry at myself for wanting to cry, which makes me want to cry more. Before, I used to like.. never cry, but now I cry at least once a day. I have been researching a lot into bulking up and lifting, and I decided that I'm going to have to push through the gym anxiety once the shelter in place order is over. Regardless, I just feel hopeless and like I'll never be the person I want to be.

And he would take me back unit his life it’s a repeating cycle. I know he still has something deep down for me which is probably why he can’t let go yet. Even when he left for good I came back and he said we can be friends again. So here we are. I told him that he was the first person I fell into love with so hard and I love him. He didn’t say it back which is understandable but he did confess a lot of things I never knew he thought of. He was jealous of me which is why why he acted the way he did. I took up the trumpet becase seeing him play it was the coolest thing to me and apparently he didn’t like that. I told him I didn’t mean to make him jealous. And he said he’s not the jealous type either. He did start to show that he isn’t a good person yet I still like him. This crush won’t be going away any time soon.

Hi,

Basically ive figured out one of my 'friends' has been trying to get me to tell him my wifi password for a social experiment. I thought it was all a joke (but still did not give it) however I figured out he really likes a girl who lives next door to me and he wants the password to give to her so she can access my wifi as hers is shit apparently. So ive been replying to him like once a day trying to waste his time as much as possible and eventually I want to send him a photo of a really long wifi password that they have to type out multiple times thinking that they got it wrong. Also he cant come back to me saying its not my actual password because why would he know??

So this is where you guys come in! I need help getting a long wifi password (or just a jumble of lower and uppercase letters). It cant be stupidly wrong as I do want him to actually try it and believe its real. And I want a realistic picture of it too, so if anyone has a long password could you take a photo of it and send it to me? I would really appreciate this, as you can understand this is deserving for these people lol. And its pretty harmless.

To reinstate, I just need a photo on the back of your router showing the password, or something like this photo I found online:

783,"I (35/f) have a roommate (18/f) who is considerably younger than I am. So maybe this is because I am so much older but I need advice on how to deal with her. 

I am currently working from home due to the whole COVID thing. She's been super irritable all day making phone call after phone call. I've tried super hard not to listen to them and turned on music to tune them out but I've still caught enough to know what's going on. Unfortunately I overheard her convo with her mom about my cat. Apparently she's chewed on some electrical cords of hers. Which I'm wasn't aware of until today because she hasn't told me anything. (Mind you...if I knew about this I would have already replaced said cords.) Anyway...she's also upset because my cat is a female cat and she hates female animals. I also have a female dog that I share custody of with the ex-husband that stays on occasion too. So now, I find out she can't stand my pets. Which angers me because she's obviously not honest with me about that either.

I will be the first to admit that the cat is not a wonderful, well behaved animal. But she's also only 4 months old. I'm aware of her issues and I'm working with her to correct and stop the behaviors and she'll get there. Just not overnight. Because let's be real...she's an animal and will require training. 

My conundrum? How do I confront her about this? I didn't listen into the convo purposefully. I'm literally sitting in my workspace which is less than 10 feet from her door and on the other side of her bedroom wall and heard every word of the conversation because she was so loud. 

I sent her a message about talking about things this am before I knew what was going on because she seemed upset already and she's ignored my message. 

What's my next step? I've made it very clear in the past before she moved in as well as with our last conversation about housework last month that if there are issues that open communication is important and I'd like her to talk with me about things. She's not doing this.

Hi 

I'm 25 Male, and since i was a kid, but especially as a teenager i was heavily bullied by boys and girls. In high school i was bullied for being gay but before high school random people would pick on me i think the main reasons were 
1 - cause i had a very serious / uncomfortable social face 
2 - because i was super quiet and a loner
3 - not acting male/being very girly.

Even before moving country, i was bullied in primary school by boys and girls. I've gone through it all, and been suicidal on/off, antidepressants had tones of therapy etc, but im now just left with really disliking life BECAUSE OF OTHERS, there always seems to be at least 1 person that picks on me, no matter how nice i am, and i dont wanna change the way i am like pretend to be super macho, also my own father humiliated and violently hurt me (that didnt influence my sensitive way of being) but now im very held back, sometimes people think i am weird, others perhaps antisocial but, i was bullied by over 30 different people, in different forms.. especially by malicious girls

I remember all of it, even this one guy who probably doesnt even remember me but when i was 14 he used to throw a ball at me or bump into me if we were leaving the school gate at the same time, and his friends if they were around would be like 'yeah i heard him say something'..long story short i am 25 not in school anymore but all the way from birth literally ive been bullied, when all i wanted was to either happily play or be left alone which is quite sad to want to be alone but i didnt feel comfortable near others..

In university this girl started laughing and staring at me maliciously as soon as she found out i was gay and then started telling others ..what gives people this right?

I feel as though outside of my house im in danger, yes i can leave my house to go shopping, take the trash out, but whenever i see teens or pass by any that are loud or giggling girls i hate it, my mind sometimes just wants it all to end without wanting to, just so i dont have to ever cross one of these again.

And in jobs theres always been at least 1 adult thats been mean, there have been nice ones but with me it just seems like as long as 1 antagonises me, my joy is spoilt.. why are humans like this? I've never seen it happen to others, only to me and i dont know if in school others have gone through it, it seems to me like everyone else was fine just me..

I hate having a target on me, how can i go on like this in life? Knowing especially if i do answer back i may be ridiculed or seen as mad/having issues like once in the past , and if i am super nice as a guy they'll find out i am gay (like others did in the past) and act weird around me and homophobic.

In the street i usually get approached a lot by dangerous people asking for money or to use my phone (i usually ignore them and walk on or say i dont have any..whats a normal reaction?? To scream?). Literally a badass 13 year old if they decided to pick a fight with me on the street could most definately beat me up.. i was robbed once in the street in broad daylight once",06May2020,1
796,"Hello everyone, 8 months ago I landed a job as a jr. Developer in a company. This is not my first developer job, so I was confident enough with my programming skills.

Eight months have passed and I am beginning to doubt myself, nothing I do is correct. Every day something wrong happens with something I developed and it's beginning to make me I secure.

I come to you, my internet friends, for advice. Is this a sign I should change careers? I've been considering it for a while, but I've stopped myself because I don't want to give up easily... But I don't know what to do.",06May2020,1
797,So yes I broke up few days back. Ended my 2 years relationship. I ghosted my ex once because we ahd a small argument. I didn't talk for three days. And the third day he texted me that if I didn't talk he would leak my pictures. He had never said that before. I believe he won't say that again too. But uk I am kinda scared sometimes. It's like I regret sending him those pictures. But then I tell myself he is a nice man. But then somedays it feels like he may do that. I don't want to live in fear of somebody. My friends suggested me that we can go to his place and delete those pictures from everywhere. That's a fairly good idea if he agrees to. I am just worried. Uk I don't want him to have my pictures. Idk should I wait for him to say that again or should I go back to him because I am scared. Ik I can not go back again. I want to avoid telling my parents about this. Am I overthinking? He apologized a lot after saying that. Um but I am just worried. Also I regret it a lot.,06May2020,1

Mine include: Video games (Minecraft, Warzone, R6, For Honor, etc.), baseball (sort of), picking flowers, going on walks, music, playing piano and uke, anime, looking at memes/cursed videos, mustangs, eating Pringle’s, supernatural, the office, rock and folk music,  cats.

799,"As stated in the title, one of my best friends (E) has been in a toxic relationship for some time now. Her boyfriend (L), her and i all met online at the same time and we are all teenagers, L being the eldest. While L and i didn't really talk to each other, E got closer with both of us and ended up with me as her best friend and him as her boyfriend.

A few months later i found out she is diagnosed with depression and wants to take her own life because of what L did at the time. He didn't even care about her s*icide attempt. After a while they broke up and L got back with his ex, let's call him K. K has tried ""fliring"" with L even while he was together with E, but he told her it's nothing. Then L and K broke up and he was with E again.

About over a month ago, E found out L has been catfishing for almost a year now. He promised her it was a one time thing but still acted like she was in the wrong. Then she left him again and 2 days later he texts her. They're friends again.

Today E told me she's back together with L, and she said it in a way that makes me hate the fact even more. ""L and i are together again (: "" She knows i hate him and he knows i hate him too. She could've been dead by now because of him and she still keeps on forgiving him for all the shit he's done.

This all might seem not that big of a deal but i really don't know what to do at this point. I don't know if i should keep on trying or just give up at this point. I've cried so many times because i thought she died and i had no way of being able to contact her family. He has hurt her a lot and i just want all this to stop.

If you think this isn't a big deal, please consider that we are still teenagers. This is really hard for us and i don't know how to handle it anymore. I would never leave a friend and i've never did, no matter the circumstances. She doesn't appreciate anything i've done for her, all the sleepless nights i've had just because she felt sad because of him. Should i just try to distance myself from her or should i be there for her when he starts treating her badly again?",06May2020,1

I'm 29 years old and still in college, I was originally majoring in marketing but during my fall semester I basically was dealing with severe depression and ended up passing my classes with C's and D's and was dismissed from my major, Im still in business school but I had to change my major to the general business degree that has a lower GPA requirement.

I will have to stay in school a year longer now (I was supposed to graduate this semester) I’ve already come to terms with this and I’m moving forward. all my work experience is in retail, I've worked a few management positions as well. I also run the skateboarding club in my college and I've grown it so much that we actually have journalists wanting to cover our club. I designed merch for my club and I've done countless volunteer work like hosting skate meets and growing our social media presence.

I’ve never been that academically gifted, I have a learning disability and was in special ed my whole public school career but what I lack in grades I make up for in my determination to learn and not give up. I’ll be 30 in august and I’m trying so hard not to be stuck in retail the rest of my life. I’ve been in and out of college for 10 years and finishing my undergrad has been extremely difficult for me, but I'm almost there. My family is helping me pay my rent while I’m in school and I feel very ashamed of that since I’m almost 30 but its only because I’m in school otherwise I’d never accept that help.

basically, I need some brutally honest advice, specifically how to I get out of retail and into the field I want to be in (I want a career in marketing or would like to work for a start-up and do digital media marketing) how can I better myself and not end up stocking shelves and asking my mommy for rent money when I’m in my 30s? Please be brutally honest I want to better myself and have a legitimate career so I can help my family.

 So we believed him things were going good for a year. Until he started drinking it was OK until recently when he would get really loud yelling blasting music he would do nothing physical ,but its something my mom and i knew how to deal with. Cut to last Sunday this is when a other fallout happend my dad friend came over lets call him billy he stayed at our house to hang out he is a nice guy, i think he knows about my dads problem but he can calm him down. I go to sleep around 11:00 and get woken up at like 3:30 in the morning to blasting music i know hes drunk so i just lay in bed theirs nothing i can do i would just piss him off. from this part on his what my mom told me happend as i did not see any of it but i know it went down.

So my mom goes into the living room to try to tell him to turn it down me and my brother was trying to sleep, he does not listen she turns it down and leaves the room. He turns it back up my mom goes back out and sees billy talking to my dad about having respect for your family my dad responds ''what are you going to do about it'' then they start fighting stuff is breaking im inside my room shaking horribly. billy gets my dad on the floor to try to calm him down , billy thinks that he calmed him down after like 10 mins so he gets up and my dad goes into the kitchen and grabs a knife trys to stab billy with it billy stops my dad , gets him on the ground my mom grabs the knife and my dad says to stab billy in the neck , billy says to cal the fucking cops my mom is afraid too she thinks my dad will do something bad to her so billy gets my dad outside in a headlock my mom comes into me and my brothers room crying saying that she needs to go.

We grab our dogs and go to our grandparents house, This is where i am now i think this will be the end of my parents relationship and I understand i still love my dad when he is not a drunkard  so i feel conflicted i feel like their is a hole inside me and I don't know what to do im about to finish high-school and have no idea what i want to do after.

808,"Bare with me, this subject is tedious and there are a lot of factors going into it.


So, I truthfully have not been properly keeping up with my credits and haven’t really been in any hurry to transfer from community college because I just got here it feels like. But reviewing my transcript and looking at the transfer guides, it’s come to my attention that I don’t really have a full semester left at community college and logically it’d make more sense to transfer to the 4-year university whilst finishing up my last few community college course.


Now, this wouldn’t be an issue if I didn’t live like 45 minutes from the first school I was planning on going to. We will call it school A.

About School A:
-30 miles away from home
-bigger school
-30 miles away from job
-less apartment options

Now at this point, I started looking at the second school I could attend, we will call it school B.

About School B:
-20 miles away from home
-30 minutes away
-20 miles away from job
-A LOT of living options

Clearly, School B is the better option. Problem is I need to take two more Bio classes than School A for my degree. On top of that, my car is a lease and I will definitely go over my mile limit + I know this sounds dramatic but I have driving PTSD from a wreck I had when I was 17 (I mean, I’d love to say “boohoo get over it” to myself but it’s not that easy). I ALSO cannot afford to support myself alone as my car is stupid expensive. A 2 bedroom with a roommate will cost around 600 on my half + utilities. I’ve talked about moving in with my boyfriend [21] into a 1 bed for like 800 + utilities, but he’s wary to even bring it up to his father as he helps with taking his brothers to their functions and to school AND he helps financially with them. Since everything is pretty sudden (I have like a month to figure it out) I would feel like a dick if I made life harder on him and his family.

I have a huge fanpage on Instagram for this famous singer. Recently, there was a website posted by his mother with all of his used clothing from the 90s/early 00s. Shoes, pants, boxers, shirts, hoodies, jerseys, shorts, beanies, baseball caps etc. all from when he was in his late teens/early 20s. 

I have $400 set aside just for merch but I would like to  not spend all of it. 

I haven’t bought anything yet and I’m getting shit for it from other fans. One girl bought one of his abercrombie hoodies he wore all the time for $120. And she also bought two of his beanies $40 each and a $300 coat. The pictures of him wearing these items are paparazzi pictures. 

I found 3 of his beanies that I have pictures of him wearing but they are $40 each plus $7 shipping. I also found two shirts that he wore on stage at his concerts, one is $175 and one is $200.  The thing is I don’t wear hats and the shirts are ugly.

I haven’t bought anything yet. I don’t know if it’s worth it. Yeah he wore them but am I ever going to wear them. I think of it like he wore them years ago and doesn’t anymore. Yeah you can’t find them anywhere else but is it really worth it to buy them if I’m not going to wear them. I’m really only looking for things of his to buy that id actually wear. 

I said that and one girl messaged me saying  “girl please he freaking wore these things before who cares if you don’t wear them you aren’t going to find it anywhere else I’d wear it once and never wash it”. And someone else said “the longer you keep waiting to buy anything the chances are you aren’t going to have anything that was once owned by him”. Someone else said “tell me what you are hesitant to buy so I can look at myself and tell you what I think”. 
Yeah, no lmao. 
And another girl told me “ you’re not a real fan, because any of his real fans would buy anything he previously wore regardless if they would actually wear it or not”. 

I don’t think I’m being unreasonable waiting for something reasonably priced to pop up that he wore and to make sure it’s something I would actually wear but everybody else seems to think I’m crazy for doing that. I’m not going to buy something for the sheer fact that he wore it before and it can sit around and collect dust. But I’m the crazy one.",06May2020,1

Its very much just enjoying each other's company and surface level talks and jokes and thats just fine. But within the past year all we do is hang out at home and smoke (marijuana) when we get together. Often just on the couch together and on our phones or watching a movie (we used to have conversations but since he is always high now we never do, there's nothing to talk about because he can't remember anything.) This is fine too, except for when I dont want to get high. I am an occasional smoker, the most I tend to do is a few days a week in quarantine and a day or two every other week if the world is functioning normally. But he is high 100% of the time. It is the first thing he does when he wakes up and the last thing he does when he goes to bed. This is so annoying to me when I am sober and I don't like being around him when he is just high off his ass, talking about how much he spends on weed (I could never imagine), not talking to me but in the same room, etc. Does anyone else relate to this experience?

Most of my stress/ depression has gotten a bit better, some days I would be absolutely fine, other days I would just be depressed. It all started in the beginning of 8th grade (august 2019), when I stated off the year happy, glad to be alive, and etc. However at the end of the year/ beginning of 2020 that is where this depression/stress begins. My dad saw my report card from last year where I had 2 A's, 4 B's, and 2 C's. I will admit I didn't really try that hard and the school I go to is more advanced then others since its a private school. Anyways when my dad saw this he got really pissed. He added this screen limit on my phone which made me kind of sad since I barely even used my phone in the first place and when I did I would just be talking to friends, but it wasn't the end of the world since I still had computer which had more stuff on their then my phone did. Fast forward a month later, My grades are somewhat improving, but I get an ISS because I beat up a kid (that is a different story which to me wasn't a big deal) but of course my dad was pissed. He didn't take away anything to huge because I showed remorse by emailing my Principle, dean, and kid that I beat up saying sorry, but while I got the ISS I was just beyond depressed but I eventually got over it since it wasn't a big deal considering that collages wouldn't see it. fast forward a month later, I had been using my computer after lights out and occasionally I have been caught by my dad and he goes on to say I can't trust you, but one night he caught me doing school work and he got really pissed, he pulled the computer out of my hands and screamed I can't even trust you anymore!, that is when I was at my all time low so I wrote him a letter explaining how I felt since the beginning of the year talking about the stress and depression I was going through and he surprisingly understood me. He didn't take anything away but he told me that I need to earn his trust to get certain things and have good grades which made me happy. as far as grades go now, they are we better then before. The one thing is that I came to this subreddit to ask about stress I am going through now. My grades are kind of not really slipping again and I don't want this to happen. I think the main reason why I am going through this is because I have been staying up later using my vr and occasionally getting distracted and losing focus.

The company official statement, in tune with one of our core values, is that those donations were made ""expecting nothing in return"".

Well today I was in a web meeting with some 200 other people and a VP said the company made those donations ""only so it didn't look bad to society"", so expecting forgiveness for the environmental damage and lost lives.

This statement from the VP is extremely hurtful to all those people that went out of their way to help the tests get faster where it should, to the people that lost family members in the accident, and that line of thinking is also damaging to the long term sustainability of our company.

I have it recorded. Who should know about this? Should it leave the company and get to newspapers? Is his statement really that relevant or am I exaggerating?

They will always respond with ""don't talk back to me"" even if it is my 70+ year old grandfather.
They will almost always be against a lot of things (thank God that it is not everything).
They will always use an Ultimatum.
They will always complain and whine about different things, especially quarantine and how they didn't go on their vacation to some exotic place.
Whenever they call me by shouting my name it will always be to complete yet another favour or one of their commands.
My mother who is also divorced from my shit ass father, will always stay on her phone and never want to speak to either me or her sister. She will always either be on Facebook reading some shit ass articles and conspiracy theories or be chatting with her boyfriend whom I don't like, because he is like a door mat for her.

I am suicidal and don't see any hope for my future or the future of humanity in general.

I have been a recluse for over 2 years and have never spoken to a girl in more than 10 years. I have reached the point where I will question my sexuality and if I am truly straight. I have also been friendless for more than 3 years and have never experienced friendship in my entire life. I was also bullied throughout my entire life whenever I am outside my room. I have a lot of despair and hatred inside of me which makes me listen to edgy music such as xxxtentacion, disturbed etc. and every time I create sensational simulations inside of my mind controlling an imaginative body with superpowers and then I beat up, kill and destroy. I am talentless and have always been giving up easily because of my extremely low qualities and energy levels, especially when it comes to my slow comprehension~processing speed.

I don’t like to make posts like this.   
 

I would rather spend my time giving advice to other people or, sadly, white knighting for others… different story;

But I feel like giving up on life more and more.. I know a lot of people feel like that. Maybe I am hoping this thread will have some responses that might help people other than me… Every day it feels like I am lacking the ability to care for my life.  I feel like I don’t want to go to work anymore… I feel like there is no point, I feel like my motivations or what few of them I had are gone. I feel very nihilistic about everything and that I would prefer to withdraw into my apartment and say goodbye to everyone and everything. 

I know I should speak to a counselor… I probably will, but I can’t help but feel… void. More and more void every day. I want to sit and listen to the trees and birds, I want to watch the clouds and feel the wind. I don’t want to hear or see people. I don’t want to know about mankind. I don’t want to be in a society anymore. I don’t feel like I have the emotional ability to be a useful component to it or to facilitate other people’s usefulness.   
 

It’s a scary thought because for as much as I want to be a woodsman I know I would end up missing components of society. I could forgo most of them, I think and learn to acclimate… but this can’t be a real option, could it?   
 

I know I need to talk to someone. I know this is depression, and depression is something I think I’ve lived with for almost 20 years without speaking to someone, with only taking clonazepam 2x in my life… I must take extra steps…

But I also almost don’t want to. I don’t think I have faith in it. My words aren’t doing my emotions justice here but I imagine it’s the same for most people who write posts like this.  
 

I want to fade away.

823,"This is my first time posting on Reddit and I’m hoping this is the right place for this. 
I desperately need others opinions/advice on how to deal with my roommate and make it through the remainder of my lease happily. 
We (me, F, 23) (her, F, 21) found each other on Facebook in a roommate group, met up once or twice prior to signing a lease. We hit it off and moved in end of January this year (2020) and signed on for 12 months. 
We’ve had one talk since then where I mentioned how much I disliked her leaving the kitchen and living room a mess to which she replied that I “don’t do a good job of making the house my home” - which I thought was very rude. Regardless, she did fix it and the house has been relatively clean since then. I’m very grateful for her receptiveness to that! 
BUT something I’m still struggling with is how she doesn’t think I’m making the house my home and she “overpowers” for lack of a better word. She rearranged EVERYTHING - furniture and all the kitchen stuff - without discussing it with me first. She is constantly using the living room, the tv, the kitchen, blasting her music, etc. I NEVER, and I mean NEVER, get any space to myself except for my bedroom and I just don’t even feel like this is my apartment. My best friend put it perfectly - it feels like her space and we’re invading it. But it’s mine too! She’s constantly nitpicking me and acting like my mother - telling me I can’t be having my boyfriend over too much, TELLING me when she’s having friends over and yet making me ASK first, etc. 
I hope that wasn’t too confusing. Thanks for reading and TIA for any advice!",06May2020,1

Honestly, before this pandemic even started there were still people (specifically ignorant teens in my school) who showed some signs of being racist but were more passive about it. My town is actually very diverse, and my school is predominantly black and Asians, but Asians and the few amount of white people get made fun of. I’ve always gotten rude comments in the halls sometimes. Now with the pandemic, not just in school (we don’t have school anymore but when we did people around the halls would say things) but also people in general public are just very vocal and giving me rude stares and staying away from me but seem more friendly towards other races of people, and I’m honestly starting to feel unsafe seeing all the attacks online about innocent Asian Americans being attacked.",06May2020,1
828,"Okay, so I (24F) have been looking for a roommate for this upcoming school year, and after tirelessly sifting through catfishes and nudists(?) I finally found someone! We actually hit it off really well. During our conversations, she even began speaking in tenses already assuming I was her roommate (ie. I'll introduce you to my friend group, *when* you move in there won't be a couch, etc.)

Then at the end of the conversation, she told me she'd had one other person who was interested in the apartment and that she'd get back to me by the end of May to let me know what the situation was. This was on May 1 or 2 (quarantine days are a blur). 

Basically, after talking to family and friends, I'm now wondering if her asking me to wait a month is weird? I personally think it's probably for some rational reason (she or the other potential girl shes gonna interview probably has finals until mid-May and doesn't want to be distracted), but I've been told by family that it seems like a red flag on her part. 

TL;DR Had a convo with a potential roommate at the start of May, we really hit it off but she told me she was talking to another girl and she'd let me know her choice by the end of May. Is it weird/a red flag for her to ask me to wait a month?


Edit: Also I haven't been talking to any other potential roommates bc we really seemed to click and I don't want to lead anyone on if she responds with a yes. Also the apartment location is primo, so I totally get why she's being a little selective.",06May2020,1

Im going to keep this short because i just told my friend everything and I’m so tired now. 

My sisters the golden child (thats how I’ve always seen it) she can get drunk and drive off with strangers and leave her phone behind and my mom will be angry with her for a day but when I don’t want to go out with my mom or her friends which by the way are about 30 years older than me and then sit there and do nothing then get shouted at for wanting to go home when i can just walk home its 2 min and my mom will hold that against me forever. My mom and sister still bring up scenarios from when i was younger and i mean 6/7 and crap me out for it. When my moms away for work my sister (20) decided that me (16) now has to be the mom she shouted at me when i didn’t wake her up and get her dressed and made her breakfast the one morning when she had to drive me to school . She blames me for everything she does wrong because she knows my mom wont believe me. She knows ill get blamed for everything that goes wrong. My mom and sister always call me to fix something when its broken i always have to do the dished take out the trash and watch the food. They always complain to me about their issues like I’m supposed to know what to do and then pull up some event from a month or year back when I didn’t do something they wanted me to or what my mom likes to do is compare me to her ex boyfriend which i hated with such a passion i wanted to run away just so that i didn’t have to be under the same roof as them. Its like everything i do is wrong but at the same time am the only one that knows how to do anything. When their lazy they’ll say they don’t know how to do it but can do it just fin when I’m not around like start the dishwasher for example which my mom told me she didn’t know how to work yesterday. 

They tell me that everything i enjoy is pathetic and a waist of time because they don’t see the point in liking my friends instagram picture or laughing at a meme. So they assume I’ve got nothing better to do and start making me do things for them so that they can do nothing. My sister shouted at me earlier on because i wanted to study for my maths test tomorrow instead of go make pizza with her because she didn’t want to do it so was hoping i would. I don’t have a dad anymore (his still alive just don’t know where he is) so i often have to do things he would have and then get teased for it and get called a man.(I’m a girl) and get crapped out about failing a year because i struggle with maths.

831,"I have an extreme need for attention. It's funny and weird at the same time, because I'm also a shy and socially anxious introvert. 

My unhealthy habits include imaging people watching me. I have these elaborate fantasies about having a camera system in my house and people watching and analyzing me. I know there's no such thing, I know nobody's really watching, but the idea of it seems so amazing to me, that I just love to imagine it. I tell myself it's to help me put things into perspective and see myself using the eyes of someone else , but no. Honestly it's just the fact that I desire to be seen, watched and judged by other people. 

Sometimes I imagine that Tesla invented the time machine that can also make people invisible. So I fantasy about my history heroes coming into my house, being invisible and watching me and learning about this decade throughout my experiences. 

I honestly want to stop doing it. Even though, I know none of it is real, it's become such a huge part of my life that I cannot imagine living without it. Often, I find myself acting out or doing unnatural things to impress my non-existing ""stalkers"". I fear that in future, this might further and further influence my behavior. My biggest fear is that, once I could lose track of what is real and what isn't and become paranoid or schizophrenic.

Using forums, such as this one, is a part of it too. I have friends irl, I have a partner, caring family, tons of people who care about me, but I choose to share my problems publicly, 'cause it gives me the thrill... 

I've alway wanted to be famous. I've always imagined myself as famous and I work in media. About 100 thousand people can see and hear my work each day. Still, it doesn't feed my attention hungry self.

837,"My parents started fostering children several years ago (I was and am still not totally fond of it), and it always seemed to be at my expense. Most of the problems I've always had seemed to do with privacy issues. Just when I thought things were going good, and I was finally happy and comfortable in my own home for the first time in three years, my parents dropped a bomb on me.

They told me they were going to start caring for a medical child in the bedroom next to mine. With a medical child comes noisy ventilators, strange nurses coming in and out of my house, sitting right next to the thin walls so they can hear most of the things I say, and that my parents would be right next to me most of the time. If I was younger, I would be thrilled, but now things are different. One of the worst things about it is that there is a joint bathroom connecting the two rooms. It only locks from the inside of the bathroom, and knowing my parents, they can and just might come in at any moment. There are two foster children downstairs, while my room is upstairs, and I was just okay with that. We also recently got rid of three foster children (4 to 6 years old) with rampant ADHD and extremely reckless behaviors. They were also right next to me, which made me as unhappy to live in my house as I'll ever be. They constantly ran it by me, and I tried to tell them I wasn't comfortable with the idea, but they always think I am being dramatic, which makes things really hard.

So, it happened. They brought the kid upstairs to the room, and the first night was okay with my mom there, but every night after that has been hell. I have trouble sleeping because of the noisy ventilator, and the three alarms that constantly go off every single night. Needless to say, it sucks. I was especially uncomfortable with the sound of the strange older women urinating right next to my bedroom. And during the day, they constantly play nursery rhymes on repeat for the \[hearing-impaired\] child, which I've asked my mother to at least mute, since he likes to look at them. She did. Once. *When I asked her.* I have already expressed these griefs to my parents, and my father has told me straight up, ""Stop whining.""

Now, once again, I am a fourteen-year-old kid, who needs to do his business, if you catch my drift, and all of this makes that really difficult. I know it seems silly, but I don't do it that often, and I go kinda mad if I go without for too long. But there is ***always*** somebody there. 24/7. And I cannot shake the fear that they can hear me or that my parents will come in through the bathroom door. They already don't even like that I lock my own bedroom door sometimes, which I can't even begin to understand, because it's hardly ever locked, but whenever it is, I'm scrutinized for it. There is not a single other place in the entire house that I can get this kind of privacy, and it makes me really upset, because I am not comfortable with any of this that is happening, and I've made that very clear since before they even made the final decision.

Now hear I am, can't sleep, can't relieve myself, and all I hear are my parents, nurses, a ventilator, and constant alarms that go off for an ungodly amount of time. Please help me. I want to feel comfortable in my home.",06May2020,1
839,"TL;DR - My close friend turned out to be an incredibly selfish and messy roommate, and is more emotionally unstable that I thought. The apartment we share is legally mine, how do I tell her to leave without totally burning the bridge? 


I’ve been living in an apartment with a close friend for about a year, and the situation is simply unhealthy. I’m not here to detail all of the reasons why but the tl;dr versions are her mood swings, being selfish / inconsiderable, refusing to equally split chores, often being late on rent and bill payments and just generally throwing irrational temper tantrums. It’s like living with a big angry toddler who can’t think rationally and never accepts any fault. Let’s just say I’ve been more than patient and accommodating (emotionally and financially) but it’s become so unhealthy that I can’t anymore - I experience constant anxiety and tension, and feel like a slave in my own home.

The apartment is legally mine - only my name is on the lease and 95% of the furnishing etc. were purchased by me. I do not plan leaving, I’ve invested a lot here.

How do I tell my roommate she has to move out? She is prone to fits of rage and has trouble thinking rationally or outside of herself... but in reality she doesn’t seem very happy here (seems like she actually wants to live alone) and it’s clear she’s struggling to afford the place. Despite some of her flaws I still really care about her and don’t want to completely burn the bridge, even if the friendship won’t be the same.

I’d been planning to do this just before COVID started. Now with the COVID situation I’m planning to wait a few months, it’s a difficult to time to think about moving and I don’t want to be unnecessarily a dick... but as you can imagine the situation has grown even worse since quarantine. I barely even leave my room because of her and I don’t know if I can hold out all summer...

840,"I've been thinking (I don't know why) about this a lot recently. We all deal with some truly difficult people in our lives and that includes at work. I used to work with two different people, one of whom was a supervisor, and I can't figure out how to work with these types of people moving forward. I'm not the type of guy who likes confrontations and tries to smooth things over. Unfortunately this has been to my detriment. 

A long time ago, I was working in college with a supervisor that played favorites and would openly insult me during meetings with other members of the staff. It was a VERY toxic work environment and for some reason he got a lot of praise from other people. For example, we had to create advertisements for a St Patrick's Day event and I drew something very roughly (and even acknowledged that I can't draw) and he looked at me and said ""that's the crappiest four leaf clover I've ever seen"". The two other staff members laughed at this and it really hurt that someone would do that. There was also another time he said I could talk to him about something in his office and when I tried to walk in to talk to him, he shut the door behind him and practically slammed it in my face. Another time, I went in to ask him a question about a student who needed help moving out on a later date than allowed and he lost his patience and yelled at me saying ""she needs to do (this thing) and then I'LL DECIDE IF SHE CAN STAY! Thank you!"". 

I've also worked with people who brownnose and will complain about something you're doing (nothing WRONG, just if you're still learning and not doing it right) to your boss. For example, listening into a phone call with a customer or client and because you did something slightly wrong will get mad and (this was when I first started this particular position) storm into our boss' office to complain. Or in the case of that same job as the supervisor, will say to them that they don't think you're capable of doing the job or are a good fit. 

What do you do when you work with these types of people?",06May2020,1
841,"Hello.

Like many others I have been off for the past month. I applied for unemployment for the time being just so I can cover bills and groceries. I had every intention of coming back in once I was called back into work- I felt guilty signing up but I was burning through my savings and groceries were getting bleak- but the way I was called back in was odd.

We are still technically on quarantine, so the shop is closed to the public but we are still doing some online orders. Last week, my boss called me to say that he would prefer I stay at home for the time being since I am collecting unemployment it is safer.

My boss text me early in the morning Monday saying “Call me.” Followed by “Please.”
 
I called him and he went through a somewhat rambly breakdown of a personal business loan that he was approved for. That he needs to have a certain percentage spent on staff (I found out later that he needs 75% of staff in as well). I wasn’t really able to say much before he said “if you don’t come in, I’ll have to file it with unemployment and they’ll kick you off it. I’m sorry to do this.” I thought that sounded off but I wanted to come back into work anyways so I said “it’s ok.” and offered to come back in on Wednesday (I was scheduled to get my car fixed Tuesday). He agreed and here I am. 

It didn’t sound correct at the time, but I didn’t really think to question it much because I was just happy to be back at work (to feel productive and get out of the apartment). I didn’t and still don’t know much about unemployment regardless.

But one of my coworkers mentioned my other coworker decided she felt safer at home. No mention of cut off benefits. 

I’m not at all angry about being called in, I was thrilled. I don’t do well stagnant. I’ve been dreaming of work. But if he lied, it means he manipulated me by threatening my income to get me to come in. 

Should I confront him about this? I wanted to confirm if that was true beforehand.",06May2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend (who I will refer to as M) that is in a less than great situation. M is in a relationship, one that, even in the most charitable of times, could only be described as bad. Both members of this relationship are unhappy with it, yet even after many attempts at getting M to realize (and M's own confirmation that it is a fucked scenario), they simply wont split up. To preface, I have no interest in either sides of that relationship romantically, so this isn't some petty ""Break up with them so I can be with them"" style BS. However, I care about M quite a bit as a friend, yet as they fail to break free of this relationship, M is also speaking to me less, spending less time with me, and just overall interacting with me a shit ton less than usual. 

&amp;#x200B;

That said, this is kind of a two part question, question one, is there any way to get M to not just listen, but to understand how bad things are? And two, if not, should I leave the scenario entirely, because it hurts to watch the both of them make each others lives a living hell but refuse to do anything to fix or end it.

845,"I'm now safe, happy and in a healthy, fun relationship - but I had what is in hindsight a very bad romantic history. I won't go into detail, but it involved a lot of sexual abuse from childhood, emotional abuse, manipulation, verbal abuse and physical violence towards the end, going back about 7 years. I went to a therapist briefly for it, and was diagnosed with C-PTSD. I expressed myself in creative forms, but never really sat down and talked to anyone about it for a number of reasons (Greatly upsetting to my loved ones, not sure how to start, feels weird, etc).

Once I started expressing my experiences, I began having random little moments where the floodgates would open for just a second, and I'd drop a mention of some abuse I'd experienced at the hands of an ex or some nasty detail, when relevant to the conversation, often in a joke. This habit seems to linger, and it isn't one I want around. It's embarrassing. Very, very embarrassing. I always regret it afterwards.

I don't feel upset when this happens. I like dark humour, and make a lot of very dark jokes. Like front-row-ticket-to-Hell kind of dark. But this is a boring theme that nobody needs to hear about. I've had all the time in the world to think about all of my experiences, and internalise them - but the people who are subject to me dropping a horribly dark joke about myself have not. 

I feel especially bad for my boyfriend. He's such a sweet person, and even the slightest hint of a threat to me makes him upset. He's a great support, but I don't want to lean on him for something that a) I don't think I need support for, and b) would make him so upset to hear about.

How do I stop bringing up my abusive exes in conversation? I never seem to see it coming. I have no residual feelings, but I'm morbidly fascinated by the abuse I went through, I guess? I keep coming back to it and it makes me angry with myself when I have one of these embarrassing moments.",06May2020,1

I was about to move in, when I was talking to my sister about these jokes, saying I found them annoying and wanted them to stop. She convinced me to break up with him, but when I spoke to him, we had a really good conversation.

I need to add this is the second time we’ve broken up on this, the first time being a month into the relationship, it’s now been two and a half years. 

My sister came up to his apartment and said she’d never forgive him, and that I had to break up with him. 

My parents are quarantined in another country but I know they would kill him given half the chance. My sister broke up with her boyfriend six days before. I’m an utter mess and still talking to him, convinced we can make this work.

848,"My best friend was recently dumped. Usually, he's able to shake it off, but this one really seemed to hit hard. We live in different states, but I want to help him any way I can. Offered to watch and riff on a movie, spend time to let him just temporarily forget what happened, and send him a game he's wanted. I'm not really good at these situations and genuinely care for him what advice can you give me to try to help him?",06May2020,1
849,He literally cheated on me three days into us being official. I’m really angry and he said he’s sorry and wants another chance. There’s no way in hell im dating him again but do you think there’s a chance that we could stay friends? What should I do? I really wish I could just go back to him but I logically know it’s a stupid idea I’m 18 and he was 22. He was crying yesterday and really misses me. Is there any point of staying friends?,06May2020,1
850,"Just wanted to say THANK YOU to the people in this sub who weighed in on my ABS issue.  I took it into the shop and one of the wheel bearings and it's hub is broken. Its incredibly dangerous because the wheel could come off while operating the vehicle.

Something my ex either didn't know or didn't check, and also was somehow missed during my state inspection.

There were no classic signs of a bad bearing, and after being told I was ""overreacting"" plus it passing state inspection I would have never thought something was seriously wrong. If I hadn't received the advice I probably would have just disconnected the ABS and had gone on not knowing this indefinitely.

So one again, THANK YOU! This advice may have saved my life.

851,"I am a guy for context, so there's this guy who was good person atleast junior college. We didn't talk at all unless it was related to studies. 

So today he sends me a hi msg and I respond hello, first he asks me some casual questions like what do I do during lockdown and else, but then he asks If I watch porn. I said not currently, I barely watch porn I don't want to be addicted to it. 

Then out of fucking nowhere he asks me If I ever had given someone a oral. This creeped me the fuck out and I immediately responded I am not gay and then blocked him.

I don't have any problems with gay people but the way this guy asked me seemed creepy. I deleted all the chats and blocked him on all social media because I was angry.

The reason it creeped me out even more is because all the last 3 years I have known, he never did anything creepy and always seemed a normal person, that msg caught me off guard.

What should I do ? I am genuinely worried.",06May2020,1

I know because I have stumbled across porn on his phone and talked to him about dating and he is interested but doesn’t know where to meet girls. So how the heck does someone with autism navigate the dating world?  Online dating would be great because I could help him look and create a profile but I’m really open to any suggestions. He is high functioning if that makes a difference- full time job and would be able to live alone with weekly check-ins. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",06May2020,1

858,"So both of my parents died when I was around 16-17 and then I had to live with my (much older than me) siblings. Being honest, I had an emotionally and mentally fucked adolescence, my leftover family was incredibly strict with me, and I surrounded myself with dramatic and toxic people... but somehow I managed to shut out all of my demons by myself without the help of an expert. But surprise! the demos are backlashing now that I have spent over a month on lockdown with no one by myself, on a foreign country and being honest sometimes I find it hard to deal with these feelings, but I don't want to shut them down again, so I was writing about how I feel and what happened back then, looking at it on a much more mature perspective, but you know it still hurts... I was wondering if there was a way you would recommend me, to deal with these dark feelings? I thought of writing a book, a song, poetry, or even art perhaps?

862,"I've created a throw-away to keep my privacy for both myself and my friend.  For  this purpose, I will refer to my friend as Rick. Let's give some background on Rick's death. Rick had some medical issues. Coming in the prior month: he would lose his  job,  progressively get more pain, and be trapped in his parent's house. Rick never talked about his medical issues, even though they grew worse. He was so secretive that I didn't even figure out until it slipped in a conversation. He had to take pain meds and had difficulty walking. Two days after hear about this, I get a message from one of his parents. Rick had gone into a comma and was  found seizing. This unfortunately continue unto he had finally passed almost two weeks later.  The death was rough and I was close to the family. So when it happened, I felt obligated to ask if they needed help. Having a background in computer science /  information security,  I asked permission to  help recover accounts and passwords. But when mentioning this, his parent, had ask if I could examine for any information left, like note. Rick's parents told me that comma seemed to be the result of taking too many painkillers. This had surprised me.  So  I took his hard-drive and began to recover information.  I would scrape the browser and try to break his master password. While looking through some folders in cache section of the browser, something caught my eye. My friend had visited a suicide assistance website. It's not one of those help-lines or anything of that nature. It was a discussion on structuring suicide notes, attempt methods, etc... My next step was to find if a post's date had matched the metadata. In-front of my eyes, I believe I found the discussion. The day right before the over-dose. I don't want to believe this. I couldn't find a note, but I'm still examining.  Rick had a very mixed relationship with his parents. His mother is a drunkard and was intoxicated the entire funeral. And his father has recently filed for a divorce. Do I let his parents know and ruin their perspective on their son? What do I do with the evidence that my friend had likely commit suicide? I feel like I'm ""stuck in between a rock and a hard place"".",06May2020,1
863,"It's a long story and I'll try to shorten it down as much as I can. If you want any clarifications just ask.

So growing up I went to a pretty small school (we were like 6 people in my grade). We all got to know eachother pretty well. I went to that school until the age of 12/13 and then we switched to a bigger school. Two of my best friends (I'll call them A and B) moved were placed in my grade which was really nice. I didn't really have a problem making new friends but we always stayed pretty close. 

During the summer when I turned 15 A passed away (pretty much out of nowhere). It was for obvious reasons really hard on me and B. We did however still have eachother and I think it helped both of us a lot. We hung out a lot and talked a lot about it.

Since then it's been a bit over two years and we've switched schools again. We were once again weirdly enough placed in the same grade. Since then we've both changed a lot. We still hang out because we have a group of friends in common but not like we used to. Essentially I feel like we're growing apart.

I know it's a natural part of growing up. What bothers me is that it kind of feels like losing this friendship feels like letting go of A as we went through that together.

I don't know what kind of answer I'm looking for here but any advice would be appreciated",06May2020,1

I would like to try to make some stickers as a gift that might bring her and or her family some kind of comfort... or just enjoyment. In considering what to make I think of teddy bears, butterflies and flowers and things, but these ideas are very broad, and I just don't feel like I have much insite (I'm an older male) where a 16 year old female is concerned.

865,"So prior I all this pandemic stuff I had been offered a job at a bank. Great position, a salary, great benefits; just all round a great opportunity for me. I graduated university September 2019, and have been hunting for a job since then. My start date was pushed back mainly because getting the required information for the screening process was difficult with everything suddenly being on stand by. However I was excited. I’ve been in the process of signing a lease for a flat with my boyfriend and we were going to move in and I was meant to start my new job this month.
Yesterday I got an email saying my job offer had been rescinded due to me failing the screening process. I have been in contact with them and they said they will send me the information as to why tomorrow and we can discuss the issues. But this obviously means we can’t move into the flat yet because I won’t have any money? Also I stupidly took out an overdraft during university so I currently have a -£1500 which is building up interest. I’m just completely overwhelmed. My mental health is really bad right now and I’m high risk so I can’t do the ad-hock work that’s available right now. I really just do not know what to do I can’t continue to live where I am because I have no money to contribute and it’s putting a financial strain on my family members. I really don’t know what to do.

867,"Hello, I (Female, 15 yo) wanna keep this as short as possible.

 Me and my best friends arranged to hang out tonight after many days. With quarantine being lifted, I wanna reunite my friends again. But yesterday night she sent a message telling me to cancel tomorrow's plans. I hate it so much when my friends cancel our plans... So as a nervous person, I was annoyed and i let off steam to her and I complained that it was such a pity because I have been waiting for 1 week to go out. She took it as a blame, so she started telling me that it's not her fault and I should stop whining to her. I explained to her that I dont blame her but she still insisted that I stop ""blaming others"" and escalate the situtation. After 5 mins, I realised that letting off steam to her was wrong and I should have controlled my anger. So I apologized, telling her that I miss her and this is why I might overreacted. But she restricted me on instagram, she doesn't respond to any message and she hangs up when I call her. This has been going on for 1 day. She is my best friend so we are extremely close and this is very weird. 

So I started thinking... After my apologize, why is she still ingoring me? Maybe she is the one who escalates the situation by just ignoring me?  It seems to me that I didn't tell her something very bad to make her that angry. One day has passed, and she has yet to answer me or unrestrict me from instagram..

Maybe she is the one who overreacts by just ignoring me? Should I text her again or should I just wait more for her to reach out to me? If she still ignores me, how many days must pass till I text her again?

Thanks!",06May2020,1

There this guy that works here, let’s name him Bob, and he’s constantly making sexual remarks to me and only does this to me but he excuses it by “I harass everyone” but everyone else it’s joking like normal friends. He talks about how “if he wasn’t married”, looks at my boobs in a not so secretive way, calls me “hot”, I talked to another person about getting a third job and I had an interview and he asked for what and I answered back and his response was “damn it, I was hoping as a phone sex operator.” And today he walks into my part of the store and says “what’s up bitch!” And it’s crossing the line. He’s 47 (looks 55+) and I’m 23, pregnant and have a boyfriend. He knows this but clearly he has no boundaries. The problem with reporting it is that he’s also the favorite of the manager (assholes make friends with each other very easily) and I know she will brush it off like he’s joking, or say “oh well that’s just Bob!” Is this enough to go to corporate and send an email?

874,"Ok the actual thing happened 3 months ago in Feb.

**TW (I think) no mention of SH just mention of possible tools for SH.**

(3 months ago)

Both of us were living on campus, he was in the dorms, I was in an apartment

Basically I was doing really poorly but I am also the type that can be miserable and still function until I have a epic mental health moment lol.. So leading up to the big day I was really depressed and just did not take care of myself. This is weird but my bf found razors that I keep not bc I wanted to do anything but just bc its comforting lawl. He would be so worried that he wouldn’t sleep when he was away from me and he’d bite his nails until they bled. I felt pretty ok even tho I wasn’t idk I wasn’t going to do anything to myself. I just can’t really tell when I am bad but then in hindsight its like yeaaaa that was bad

Then I had my epic meltdown Feb and thought it was hospital time for sure but I calmed down enough by 5am to uber back to my parents house away from campus. To let my bf breath I stayed with my parents for 3 days and got into therapy asap and back on meds to keep it together. I felt better almost instantly after my meltdown and wanted to come back to campus. I was fine to come back bc I was not a threat lol and I was in therapy + meds + parents. I was set on doing better bc I wanted to come back to campus so bad

my bf did not say anything and on Wednesday he picked me back up from my house (car was in campus, he had to come get me to give me my car) When we got back he moved out all of his stuff from my place. I was super confused bc they’d been there since I moved in. It was just such a weird time to do it bc I kinda lost my mind a few days ago. Then he made me sit in his dorm and I watched him rearrange his stuff for almost 2 hours. It just felt like I was being punished

I thought ok either he is leaving me and wants to get all his stuff b4 he does bc im cray or he is punishing me. He said it was bc I never use the stuff and he just wanted it back.

When I moved back in after my classes I saw he literally left nothing of his, even stuff I thought he’d gifted to me. He even took a little key that was hanging near my bed. The only thing he left of his was a dirty cooler he brought in my house to dispose of. Only things left in my house were a mattress, dirty cooler and lamp. It was a really sad place.

I got over this and integrated back onto campus successfully.

(Yesterday)

I mentioned the lamp made me anxious bc of when he moved all his things out as kinda a joke and he said “I was trying everything to force you out of that apartment”

So he did that to make it as uncomfortable as possible for me to move back in even though I expressed to him how hard I was working to come back to ease his nerves lol and I was actually working really hard. He just wanted me to stay home with my parents so he knew I was safe even tho I told him I would feel much better being back

That part of him moving out and me watching him move around his stuff still makes me uneasy to think about and was probably worse if not as bad as how the meltdown made me feel

Even tho he was super worried and panicked he did this with no ultimatum for me. Like id rather he say please stay with your parents or we break up bc this is too much for me. Like that, I would understand.

Idk if I am drama and should let it go but it is really making me upset. Posted this earlier, but wanted to clear up some details to make the story less confusing.",06May2020,1
875,"I have been thinking about my life extensively for the past few weeks.

I am feeling irritated about who I actually am. Since I don't know. On paper I am a student with my name and everything and my ethnicity being German. So there is that. But everything about it feels strange. My names (both of my first and my last name) sound strange to me while as most people I grew up getting accustomed to them. I don't feel like these have a meaning or any association to me. That's just me who I am on paper. And to make matters worse I feel like the odd one out because I don't resonate with my ethnicity either. It just feels like I have been forced into this - which is kinda true since I have been born here duh - and I just feel rather distant to everything regarding that ethnicity.

Regarding my career I am left with no plan either. I am gonna finish my current education so I can go study whatever I'd like but it just feels pointless as well.

I have tried having hobbies and I do have some and I'd say they are part of my identity yet it feels like they are missing the outer shell as I described in the beginning.

Anyway I'm sorry for you having to read this but it helped me already to get that stuff off of my heart because I had no outlet for it so even without a responds I am already feeling better.

At 23 years old, in 2007, i move to spain (Barcelona) to live with my girlfriend at time. I work with all that type of illegal immigrant jobs..

In 2014 I wasn't happy with the quality of the university I was studying so.. and by the end of my 3rd year of university I went to Argentina, in 2014, and finished my career there, in 2018.

Now I'm still here. Doing residence (specializing), living in a good city (Bariloche) but I had no much money and I'm not happy.
Thinking about to leave it all behind and immigrate again to some 1st world country like Spain again or Portugal but honestly I could go anywhere that's clean y safe, and where ppl can work in any job and wouldn't suffer by not having money.

I don't know what to do, where to go.
I don't have any European passport o Greencard in any country.
I'm a physician and I think I'm a good at taking care of people, but can't take care of my self or know what do I want .

883,"This is going to be a bit long, but I need to rant somewhere, if any of you is willing to read everything and give advice I would appreciate it!

TLDR: I had a wonderful life then my long term gf left me and now I feel miserable, lonely and lost in life.

My gf (28) left me (34) after 9 years together. It took me by surprise, and only now I see maybe our relationship wasn't the best for the last 5 months. She left a month before the quarantine started in our country.

We had wonderful 6 years together, we shared the same values, have grown together, and planned our whole lives together, always with respect for the other, always with very open and honest communication. We spent all the time we could together.

Then this last year was a bit more bland, we made a couple of trips that were cool but apart from that life looked like a routine. Which is somehow what we wanted. But bit by bit we talked less and less, we shared less time, and even sex life became boring and repetitive. We had no details with each other and I was so obssed with work and my hobbies and her being alone at home doing nothing.

I work a normal office job and she wanted to pursue a freelance career that never started, she has worked partime a year in the last 4, but she took care of the house (we have no kids) We agreed this was temporary and that I wasn't in a hurry to change it. She took her time to work on it, but lately I was a bit worried she wasn't really investing the time in really pursuing her career. It was a bit of a taboo. Yes I know, lack of communication and honesty on both parts killed the relationship.

Suddenly in January she told me she has changed, and now she feels lost, doesn't like her life, that she has no friends, no career, and that she needed time to think.

I tried to talk things, she felt pressured, so I backed off and gave her some space. I left home for a week, with almost no communication.

I came back to talk things. She told me she feels depressed, that the relationship doesn't work and also that she has been talking to a guy on the internet, who lives at 600km. Apparently she is falling in love with him. She doesn't feel the spark with me anymore, that we look like roommates.

She was very sad and feels sorry for me, also she likes our live in our house and that's why she wants to have ""time"" to think.

She was scared of how I would react, first she though I would get angry (I was negating reality) and then when she told me she doesn't love me that much anymore (but still loves me) I got so desperate I told her life didn't have meaning without her, and yes, I had suicidal thoughts.

In the end I proposed every solution I could think off, she rejected them all. In the end she said the only soltion she saw was leaving home, not breaking things off, going to live in a shared apartment in the same city, and have time, months, to see if she misses me, maybe try things with other people, even with other guys, maybe she will see that she wants to be with me.

At that moment I flipped, I was speechless, and changed completely my approach. She didn't even had the maturity to say the words, she forced me to finish it off.

I couldn't let her go completely, so I proposed to meet in June to discuss things again. We didn't know about the lockdown, so that was real hard for both, we didn't talked at all since then, but I know she left the apartment to go live with her father since she was ""really sad"".

Right now I'm waiting until June, knowing she is not coming back, that even if she wants maybe I don't want back since now I see she has been very inmature, and disrespectful, that I can trust her. Anyway I still want her back and sometimes I hope she will want back, then the next day I feel like she is not coming back and I have to start over again. Until June I won't know, and it's killing me.

On the other hand I see myself at 34, I've only been with her, and I'm not a guy who likes to go to parties or discos, I'm a bit asocial, have lost most of my hair and I'm skinny and pale. I feel I won't be able to find someone whom I share a bond so strong, and even if I do, it will take years and I will find myself at almost 40 without the joy I had until now.

I feel like I was living like a 20's guy. I have a lot of pressure now, and with the quarantine being alone at home it's being really hard. Those have been the hardest days in my life, and I lost my mom when I was 12.

I'm not sure how to start to build my life, I don't even know if I will be able, and I have no motivation to do it. I'm thinking on leaving my job, my country, and leave everything behind, but I don't really have the strenght either to do it.

I feel lost and desperate, and even if I have family and friends who support me, it's only a few minutes on facetime then I'm on my own again.

What can I do to ease the pain? I need some advice.

885,"Hi,

My sibling, once in a while, feels pain in their belly, or chest, or head, and starts freaking out. What I mean is, sometimes a pain or another symptom is reocurring, like once in a week, or every other day, for a week or two, (sometimes more) and then after a while it doesn't come again.

One example in question was a belly pain that they had for a day, got worse until he went to the hospital sure they had an appendicitis. But there was no sign of it, they gave them painkillers and stuff and sure enough, soon they were better.

I'm pretty sure (and they're pretty sure as well) that they are hypochondriac but the problem is, I think they take it out of proportion and then get so, so anxious, rocking back and forth and breathing heavily. (they read about it and it gets worse)

I've suggested therapy, but he opposes strongly to it. My parents hate therapy too (mentioning it in front of them would make my mom yell at me, i'm pretty sure, because to her therapy, I'm guessing, shouldn't be for normal people like... us? idk she takes that as an insult.)

I want to help my sibling but I don't know how. I think suggesting therapy again isn't helpful; reading about symptoms for him should be counterproductive too (I don't know how to describe how he feels as well as he should be able to). Like, if I have a reocurring pain I will google it, but most always will think it should pass and shouldn't be that bad. He'll think it's a terrible illness maybe even life-threatening.

Doctors aren't helpful either, they never find what he has and to be honest, it starts becoming a pattern and I tend to take it less seriously the more seriously he does, (unless he's crying, or reacting to the pain) (I wonder if these pains are also partly psychosomatic)

We're both in our twenties and living with our parents. He has a new pain. Also, he'll probably not listen to my advices, but any ideas?",06May2020,1
887,"To clarify, this is not me but a close family member (doesn't really matter since this is a throwaway account). 

A little backstory, this family member, who works at a restaurant, was laid off due to the pandemic on March 20, 2020. As recommended by the employer, the family member applied for unemployment benefits right away.  As of today, the family member has received about 1/6 of the total claim balance. The total claim balance I will not disclose but it is a significant amount especially in regard to his/her annual salary. I would also like to point out that this family member is very close to the age of retiring. As of today, the family member has been requested to return to work this Friday 5/8/2020. 

The question is: how should my family member approach this situation? Should he/she return to work immediately? What happens to the remaining claim balance? In relation to the family member, I am very young and do not understand how most of this stuff works but I wanted to get more information as my family member seems very conflicted on what to do. 

Any information is helpful and I would gladly appreciate it. If there is any more information that is needed please let me know. Didn't know where else to post this, but if there's a more specific subreddit or place i could ask for information, I would gladly ask that you tell me.

888,"I’m gonna try to keep this short and simple but earlier, I was told he has the virus. He’s in his late 40s, I’ve never met him in person but he reached out to me when I was 14-15 — I’m in my 20s now. He’s sent me gifts on my birthdays and texts and greets me on holidays like christmas/thanksgiving/etc since then. Never spoke to him on the phone cause I’m scared and anxious. 

I’m confused on how I should feel. Ever since I discovered, I can’t stop thinking about his situation right now — I’m just worrying, thinking what if he doesn’t make it? I don’t even know if his symptoms are severe, if he’s in a hospital or just treating himself at home. From what I know, he eats healthy and works out.

I can’t process my feelings right, I’m concerned but at the same time, I feel like I shouldn’t be. He was never present in my life, I only knew his name. I never yearned for a father figure and accepted at a young age that he left.

890,"My boyfriend (27M, underlying condition) and I (26F) currently live together in the heart of downtown Chicago. We've been able to self-quarantine in our apartment for the past 2 months, only going out once every two weeks for groceries. The city is completely shut down minus essential business, as is the building we live in. Residents are discouraged from leaving or using the elevators and every amenity is off limits (gym, pool, etc.). 

We love living in the city but are feeling very trapped because of the situation. Our lease is up in August so we need to decide if we should stay put or leave. The decision is difficult because no one knows when this will end. We would only move to be safer and have a little more freedom (like being able to move around a bit more), but this whole thing could end as soon as we do. Or if we stay it could continue on for months, or more.

Our ""life plan"" before Coronavirus was two more summers in Chicago and then a move to Arizona. The city we want to move to is way less populated and affected by Coronavirus than here. It would definitely be a bummer to leave the city so much earlier than planned, but I guess what I'm wanting advice on is this: Based on what we know about Coronavirus now, does it make more sense to stay in a big city like this or to move away? Or is it too soon to tell?",06May2020,1
891,"My ex (who I ended on good terms with, very nice person) has been on/off seeing an emotionally abusive girl for a few years (as far as I know they are off now) who apparently is a drug dealer and getting people hooked on heavy drugs. My friend found out about this and has a bad gut feeling (so do I because he had/has(?) a drug problem) so she asked me to contact him to just say I'm here for him if he ever needs anything/wants to talk. I have also been thinking about doing this for a while because I miss his friendship.

I currently have a boyfriend of 6 months but we're on the rocks, because he said he loved me and then took it back. We recently broke up but got back together because of it but I'm feeling like 95% out of this relationship right now and told him that I've taken a lot of emotional steps back. I am talking to him about making this a casual thing after quarantine because he isn't fully meeting my needs other than physically and having casual fun together but I've been too hurt by him I think to continue seriously. He claims to be ""committed"" and sees this as ""serious"" but doesn't act like it. We also don't connect as well intellectually as I did with this ex. Admittedly I think that I miss my ex's love a bit but I would never cheat, primarily I want to see that he's okay and not going to overdose or something (as happened to a past ex and friend, respectively). 

Is this wrong? I am not going in with intentions of getting back together.

TLDR; ex-boyfriend is involved with an emotionally abusive person who might have him hooked on drugs; my current boyfriend is not a great boyfriend and recently said he loved me and took it back, and I am going to reach out to ex/friend to make sure he's okay/let him know if he needs anything he can come to me.",06May2020,1

901,"Two days ago I stopped by at my 80-year-old veteran grandfather’s house to see if he needed anything at the grocery store while I was out. He has an amputated leg and doesn’t get out of the house much so my family works together to make sure he has everything he needs.
I came into the house to find him hyperventilating in his wheelchair, unable to reach his phone. I called an ambulance and they were there within 5 minutes. I called my dad to tel him what was happening. Then I just kind of went through the rest of the day feeling dazed and surreal. 
The next morning, I woke to an early phone call from my dad telling me I should go to the hospital because grandpa’s time is almost up.
I went, he was unconscious but I said what I could. Not an hour later he was gone. And even as I write this, I have yet to cry. I can feel it and I want to cry but it just won’t come out.
After we stopped at his house to remove the dozens of firearms he had stashed all over the place (it’s a rough neighborhood and we didn’t want them to be stolen), spent the day with my dad, that night I went to my girlfriends house. I’d been doing what I can to comfort my dad, but I still wanted comfort myself. It still really hurts. 
My girlfriend initially gave me a hug and cuddle with me on the couch while something ran on TV. I didn’t want to talk. I don’t talk much, and this sea of strangers is about as comfortable as it gets for me being anonymous. 
Anyways, after about 5 minutes of being on the couch, she pulls away and gets on her phone because I guess she had ordered pizza and it was late. It ended up being over an hour late and was missing parts of the order. And in that entire time, she just sat on the other side of the couch and fumed and complained and wouldn’t move her legs to let me get close to her. 
After pizza arrived and she ate (I was not hungry) she was in this annoyed mood and said she felt nauseous and just zoned out on the TV. After this went in for about an hour I got up and told her good night that I was going to bed. She says “night” and that was it. I went to bed. She did not come to bed until long after I had fallen asleep. I woke up with her but when I tried to get close to her she pushed me back and said she was trying to sleep. 
I had to leave and she was still sleeping. I let her know I was going and tried to give her a kiss and she swatted at me.
To make a few things clear, I was not trying to have sex and she knows that. I just wanted to hold her, be held and share a kiss from time to time. I did not get any of that save a 5 minute cuddle on the couch. We sleep embracing each other and she wouldn’t even let me touch her last night. Oh yeah, let’s give her some reason for this behavior; she’s 3 months pregnant with her first child. 
So I left back to my area, both of us knowing it would be almost a week before I could come back to her place.
It’s been about 6 hours and we would normally have said a million things to each other via text. After a few hours of silence she texted me knowing I was upset with her. Telling me she messed up and was fearing I am going to leave her for being so insensitive. And to be honest, yeah I’m thinking about it. That fucking hurt. I came to her for comfort and out of grief after finding my grandfather in the state that led to his death 16 hours later and staying strong for my dad all day because he was a fucking train wreck and she rejected me with annoyance and anger due to pregnancy hormones and late pizza.

I get that she’s going to be irrational and crazy sometimes, but how am I supposed to feel? I still haven’t got this out yet. I love her but wow, that really fucking hurt.

Throw away as I don't know if the other person reads reddit. 

I work with someone (not the same company but close), and I'm confused as to if our texts are flirty or friendly. 

A few weeks ago the guy I work with needed information from me. I told him I could get it to him via his workplaces phone, but it would be late when he was asleep (not uncommon in my work). He asked if he could give me his number, so I could text him the info when I got it. 

I texted him, and it lead to a series of lukewarm texts. He seems playful and uses emojis, but I kept trying to stop the conversation with things like, ""enjoy your day"" or ""enjoy your time off"" to see if he would keep going and he did. I think he is really nice and attractive, but I felt unsure of the texts so tried to keep it friendly and more professional. 

Today, randomly, I get a text ""appreciating"" me on something very trivial at work from this guy. I would have expected he lost my number after our initial exchange was over. We chatted a bit similarly to the first time. We chatted and found something in common. He sent me a photo of the thing in common, but he was in the photo. When I returned the exchange, things kind of fizzled. Did I misinterpret his niceness for flirting? I see this person probably once a week or so if not more. I'm confused.

Honestly, im a decent person but I was diagnosed with depression since I was kid but my dad wasn't aware I had this until around last year I told him about it. When he gets pissed he mocks me about it, and how when he was on drugs he was so much better than I am right now. 

Im a confident person but I still oversleep too much and I feel hopeless about my futute. I stay in my room all day and try to avoid him as much as possible cause he makes me feel like shit alot.

I know that Reddit isn't the best place for advice but even if some of you can relate to what I'm going through it will make this post worth it.

I've been freaking out about a few things the last few days and it feels like I can't think straight. I've been getting restless and experiencing some stomach pain from the worse than normal anxiety. I'll break down each of the things that are bothering me in hopes that someone may relate.

The thing bothering me the most is the need to do something with my life in regards to a job/career. I'm 21 and I haven't done much with my life since graduating High School besides working in retail a bit and doing some volunteering. I've put a lot of thought into what kind of work I could put up with and which major would be a good choice. At this point thinking about it just fills me with dread because nothing interests me and I can't imagine working for most of my life, especially if it's something I don't love. My parents and family are all putting pressure on me to do something and I feel like I'm going to have a breakdown soon.

I'm also freaking out about how fast everything is going. The days, months, and years seem to just fly by at this point and I'm terrified of how quickly I'm growing older. I'm years behind my peers in most ways and it's overwhelming to think of the things I need to do to catch up. All I want to do is distract myself with video games and other forms of entertainment but at the same I really want to get out and experience life.

My irrational fear of death pops up once in a while but it's been worse lately, I think partly due to Covid19. Sometimes everything will be going fine and then I'll just have this moment where I think about how I and everyone I know will die so what's the point of doing anything or even getting out of bed? I know it doesn't make sense because I only have one life and I'm alive right now but the idea still freaks me out.

I've also been struggling with severe overthinking and indecisiveness since High School and sometimes I get frustrated that I can't just live in the moment like normal people seem to do.

A couple days later we were talking and she snapped me that she was a little drunk and having inappropriate thoughts. I was inexperienced and confused why she sent me that because she said she wasnt interested basically so I didnt really flirt back. I was dumb and she ended up just saying flat out she was horny. She asked me If I did this often because she said I wasnt picking up the cues.

My sister and I had just a grade between us in high school and our friend group was pretty intertwined her sophomore/my senior year. 

Here’s the problem: I continued to make new friends (male and female, and a wild variety of interests), and was fortunate to get to keep my high school BFF all this time. She kept her same friends, almost all of who went on to have multiple kids with multiple men, my sister stayed out of serious relationships until two years ago when she met her fiancé who she lives with. She went to massage therapy school (where  she never passed her boards), and completed nursing school, but she had to take three years to do it, so according to her she’s not certified (I know NOTHING on this subject/the requirements).  

A year and a half ago, after too many years of not feeling “quite right”, my sister was diagnosed with MS. She didn’t take it well, and who could blame her?  She went from full time student working two jobs, the epitome of independent in her mind, and she was looking at quitting her job/s, and moving in with her boyfriend of all of six months old.  She was finally starting to get back to work in the medical field, though not nursing, and she was on a routine and feeling better when all of this hit. I know it’s been hard.

Now here’s the part that makes me sound like the worst big sister in the world. Today, all I wanted to do was put on my favorite yoga pants/hoodie combo, smoke a joint,  and watch an animal series on Disney Plus. I’m in a crossroads in my life that (like so many people) the pandemic uprooted some plans, and I just wanted to chill.  I had even sent her a text in a morning conversation saying that I was just hanging on the couch today. 

My sister called me three time in less than two hours for the following reasons:

1.  To tell me she was running dad’s prescription he forgot at his houses d asked if I wanted to come to get out of the house.  I politely declined and reminded her of my mood and plan. 

2. To tell me my dad was upset that I was sending my gramma separate bouquets for Mother’s Day and her birthday (just a day in between the two) because that’s what he was “thinking” of doing and now he can’t. What’s the worst that happens?  She gets too many and she shares them with other residents in memory care? How terrible. 

3. To tell me she was calling me because she almost had to call me because she almost got locked out of the house. 

Her not having any friends is weighing not only on our relationship, but her relationship with her fiancé because we feel a lot of guilt for wanting to do anything with anyone else or alone. My sister is such a hardworking, funny, smart, caring, loving person. I know there are people who would live to be friends, but how do I find them?  

I also know that I need to watch that she doesn’t go into a depression. We’ve basically have quarantined separate but together, so we’ve been walking, trading recipes, and her and her fiancé have been doing yard work. He fiancé is great, but he’s terribly awkward. I’m on my own with this one.",06May2020,1

917,"Im a 17F and I've had depression since I was 13. I tried killing myself when i was 14 and 15 about 3-4 times. I begged my mom to take me to a mental hospital at the time but she told me ""it's not cool to be there, that place is for people with real problems"", after that point i stopped telling my mom anything and just held everything in, but i t only got worse. I never tired suicide again cause i felt like my mom would use my death for sympathy points and I felt selfish for wanting to be dead, so now i just want to disappear but that doesn't stop my brain from saying ""you could just off yourself right now"". I did have s therapist at one point in time, but i said some things about my mom and CPS got involved, so she sent me to live with my alcoholic dad so they didn't take my younger brothers(she like to get rid of problem children before it gets too bad and we all get taken away), she sent me on my birthday and i wasn't allowed back till the end of the school year . I can't do anything for myself, I lay in my boyfriends bed all day wondering what did i do to deserve this. My mom says she cares about me, but all of her actions say otherwise. Last time i had a breakdown(because of my mom)i didn't go to school, when i went home the next day, she asked me why i didnt go. I told her i didnt  go bevause i had a really bad breakdown. I shit you not, her very next sentence was ""oh...Do you think i look good in these sunglasses?"" I almost started crying right there in frount of her, i just left the house after that and went to my BF house. The last time i told her i felt like she didn't care about me unless i needed to watch my brothers while she goes out with guys or when she wants me to clean the house, i was just trying to tell her how i felt. She started screaming ""STOP. STOP. You're fucked up and delusional for thinking that, i care, BF has put things in you're head to make you think i dont care, you're fucked up"" i had a bad breakdown that night. Whenever i try to get help she tells me im fine and don't need it, that there are people out there that have it worse, she could be treating me like she did my sister, and how lucky i am. I don't feel lucky. I want help so bad, i want to get better, i want to be normal, i wanna do normal teenage things, but i can't even find the motivation to do what i love anymore. And im starting to affect my relationship, BF is always trying to keep me happy but i can tell its taking a toll on him.
Im just at a loss...at this point i just want to really give up on everything. I have to depend on my mom to take me to the doctor but she always ends up making things worse. Am i just stuck? Am i just doomed to be like my sister and suffer in silence for years to come? I do have it better than her when she was my ag, so maybe I'm just over reacting, i dont know anymore.",06May2020,1
918,"a little backstory: I (M/14) had a little problem with police 6 months ago. I got my punishment (""Sozialstunden"" That basically means i have to work a specific amount of hours for some help organisations for example as punishment). 

Ever since then my parents just told me anything I am interested in is bs and i should stop showing interest for anything. 

They also screamed at me because i loged into my Youtube Account on my PC and then got a saftey warning in my emails. They told me that i need to stop logging into my stuff because the police is watching my smartphone, pc, etc. and i would get in trouble with police again if i keep logging in my accounts

I feel lost, I am having trouble focusing on school work, and social distancing makes it almost impossible to meet people.

My sister lives in a big east coast US city and moved in with her boyfriend during the pandemic. She still has the contract on her old apartment for almost another year.

My concerns are that I will be stuck in a crappy job, have a difficult transition back into college and delay my degree further, but I could support myself and be closer to my family in this tough time. 

I heard from some advice of people who graduated during the 2008 class that they were glad they kept going to school and were not looking for a job at the peak.

928,"This is my first post and I'm honestly a bit hesitant to post this, I'm using my phone and copied and pasted so I hope the formatting and everything is fine.

Background info:  
I'm early 20s
Relationship/Dating/Flirting experience is severely low, it's never been a thing I've thought about or actively pursued and it's never really happened.

So I've known this person for about a year maybe 2, mostly was just random casual conversations when I saw them, end of last year she started messaging me, which I didn't mind, and it got very flirtatious very quickly, I at first wasn't sure if I was overthinking it but I wasn't and she was actually into me, which still baffles me but anyway. 
Everything was going really well for a few weeks and then she got really insecure about her being older than me, about 15 years, and the fact that she has kids. I honestly hadn't thought about any of it before because we were only flirting and it didn't seem like anything serious. She was worried I would stop talking to her and abandon her because of it like previous people had, I told her I wasn't going to do that and that I liked talking to her and would keep talking to her. And then all of a sudden it was like nothing in the previous weeks had happened and she was acting odd when I would say certain things like she had no idea she was into me (or acting like it) a few hours before and we jumped to super friend status and she kept calling me ""friend"" in every second sentance, but still saying somewhat flirty things to me every now and then which honestly confused the hell out of me, I kinda just went with it for about a week, after that decided this wasn't working for me so I just stayed purely ""friend"" about it. We didn't speak regularly for a about 2/3 weeks and then she started speaking to me again and was acting like we were best friends and she started sharing alot more with me, we even spoke about how she was determined to be with her soulmate now, and that they had known they were eachothers soulmates for a long time now but can't be together because of unfortunate circumstances, and I tried to help with that how I could. And I've been perfectly fine with how everything's been.

We don't normal see eachother often, mostly messaging, but every other time we do see eachother, afterward she gets flirty again. Yesterday I saw her, we spoke for a bit went our separate ways, then we were speaking to eachother night timeish, and she went heavy flirty again. 
We also seem to have either really great conversations or conversations where it's like pulling teeth getting her to talk/say anything, there's never really a middle ground.

I spoke to my two friends in the begining of the year when we weren't talking for a while because I'll admit I was kinda missing the flirting and wasn't sure what to do with the situation, the one basically said I should do whatever as long as I'm careful and don't put myself in a situation where I'll get hurt and the other basically said, 'you finally have feelings, you'll get used to it'. 

The advice I'm asking for here is, I guess, is it this normal? Should I just leave things as they are? I'm not really sure how I feel about it all, If I did, it would be alot easier to figure out what to do, or if I should do anything at all.

Any help/advice would be appreciated.",06May2020,1
930,"Ok I’ll try to make it short. Please note I tried to post in relationship advice and it won’t let me. Story:
We were dating for a few months and starting to get serious when it became clear we were all going to have to quarantine somewhere. I told her to stay in my apartment while I went out of state to help family.
What we thought would be two weeks turned into her moving in... we agreed until June. 
She’s a bit off the deep end after two months in isolation... plus she’s never lived alone. Now she is saying she wants to make her cost of living lower, and maybe move to Colorado. The only problem is obv I’m not involved in any future plans so I’m losing her, but also that I don’t quite understand her logic. What she pays me is less than you could get in any city. She also didn’t have to pay security or anything like that. To top everything off, she doesn’t drive.
So she would be moving because she wants to stop quarantining... the thing is that she does leave the apartment every two weeks but doesn’t leave for walks... so she’s just been alone in an apartment for two months. I am trying to be understanding but every conversation circles back to her not having faith in humanity and that people can’t stay at home. In her mind she thinks moving out of a major city would help that, but if she can’t drive, really, she’s going to be stuck wherever she goes. I asked to visit only after being tested and her response was “I can’t quarantine with you.” So I’m very very confused. At this point... do I give her a date to move out? How is that supposed to happen without seeing me? I don’t want to force her hand but obv I need to make plans for my future. She’s also in finals week, but I don’t want to wait too long and then get screwed over myself. Help me Reddit strangers! I think she’s just going overboard.... walking outside with a mask is ok to my understanding of air flow.... but she doesn’t seem to be down with that.

My girlfriend is bipolar, and in the past struggled with alcohol, after a bad night her problem with it became clear, and we both agreed to not indulge in it anymore.
The other day a coworker had a small a baby shower and me a my girlfriend attended it.
One of our other co workers, a woman who I’ve know for years and doesn’t care for me, has started taking a liking to my girlfriend, and has a reputation of befriending people then ending friendships in the most dramatic fashion, I warned my gf of this, but she has a big heart and wants to give people a chance. 
At this baby shower she persuaded my girlfriend to drink, pretty heavily, the coworker lost control and made a fool of herself but later in the night was discovered that her intent was to get my girlfriend drunk so she can send her home with me and we can fight.

I told my gf that I can’t choose her friends but I really think that she doesn’t deserve a friend that would disrespect her or her relationship like this. My gf said she is going to cut her off, but it all honesty she doesn’t have the spine to do it. 

Today my gf text me, and said this woman is telling her that I have no real desire to be with her and that I’m just with her because I was looking for someone and she just happened to be there. And when my girlfriend asked her to stop, she replied with I won’t be silenced. When I said I’ll text the coworker and put a stop to it, my gf asked me not to, that it’ll only make this worse and she just wants to move on from it. But I want to defend my relationship and more importantly I want my gf to defend our relationship. 

We live together, she trains my nephew, she knows my family and I know hers. We’ve invested in furnishings together and have gone on multiple vacations together, so what this woman is saying is nowhere near the truth. But I don’t want her to get in my girlfriends head and I want my girlfriend to have friends that care about her wellbeing and respect what she’s doing. 

So basically I’m asking what I should do, a huge part of me wants to message this woman and tell her to stop interfering in something she’s not relevant to, but I don’t want to cause even more problems and push my girlfriend away by showing this is bothering me, and letting the coworker win.",06May2020,1

940,"Before you delete this or tell me to look for help, just here me out.

I've been having some existential crises lately. I see arrogance from all sides of humanity regarding worldview. Theists are so convinced of there absolutely being a God, and atheists are so convinced of their absolutely not being a God. As a Christian, I believe in Jesus. I believe He is God. Yet, I understand that God Himself, at least, the idea of a god/God cannot be proven or disproven by use of natural means. Yes, science may disprove claims made by theologians, but God Himself, being supernatural, can't be proven or disproven by the scientific method that we use to determine all other natural truths. This is because God is not natural. What determines ones belief in Him is made purely of their own philosophical and/or faith based convictions.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, due to there not being a way to absolutely determine any of this, should I end my own life to see first hand whether there is or is not a god/God or gods on the other side, or at the very least another type of supernatural conscious state the dead go to?

My logic behind even thinking of this is that 1. If there is something else, I will know for certain when I cross over that I was right, and all the arrogant pricks that said otherwise will just be a memory, and will have a surprise waiting for them. 2. If there is nothing over there, then I will have at least not wasted my time living in a godless, purely natural, and thus meaningless existence in which I would be forgotten 3 generations later anyways. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hold the belief that without some sort of higher consciousness(es)/Creator(s) to ascribe meaning to existence, continuing to live purely for the sensual pleaure/artificial emotional satisfaction (like pleasing and being with your loved ones who have no meaning apart from potential meaning ascribed to them by something or someone that created them or caused them to be (if something did cause them to be)), is both an exercise in futility and a gateway to unnecessary pain.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sad or depressed. Just wanting to know first hand if there is more to it all, without having to guess or believe or have futile debates and arguments with those of differing views,  even if that means sacrificing my natural existence to join in a supernatural existence or lack thereof. If there is no consciousness beyond death at least I will know the truth in those last moments of my existence, and I'll be satisfied I jumped the boat before continuing a meaningless, purposeless existence.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't even attempt to convince me of meaning apart from someone or something causing everything we see around us and giving purpose to it all. As I explained, a purely natural existence is completely worthless to me. If that is the reality of existence, I want no part in it, because higher calling and purpose is the only reason for existing that I will bring myself to settle for. If that doesn't exist, I'm under no obligation to continue.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this isn't going to be taken down due to the seemingly dark nature of the content. I actually want to know what I should do. Is it worth finding out? If not, what makes it not worth it?",06May2020,1
941,"So we are 6 people from the same course in my uni who are close to each other and since our studies are exclusively online at the moment we created a Discord channel so that we could communicate to each other more easily and discuss everything related to our subjects. In one of the subjects we also get assignments which are pretty hard so when we work together on them we also complete them without so much of a struggle. There is one more person though, who is also close to me and the others in our group, but maybe just a little bit less closer. So during two of our assignments, this person asked me if I managed to do it. The first time I said no. The second I told him that I’ve made some progress, but didn’t complete it so I sent him just a part of it. I lied though since both times I had the complete answer. I know that it was maybe stupid of me, but if I had given him everything, I would have been feeling somewhat “unloyal” to my group, but the main reason I didn’t do it was because these two times the solution of the assignment was not my merit at all, but almost entirely two other guys from us. Otherwise I wouldn’t have had nothing against it. I’ve helped him many times before and he has helped me as well. And actually the last time I gave him the assignment because I made it almost completely by myself (he has made it too, just needed a little bit of help).

But now another one of us added this person. As some of you probably know, new members in Discord channels can read the messages in the chat before they joined and can also see when each member has joined. So now this person can see that I was in the channel earlier and I had the solutions. And he probably knows that I lied to him already.

That’s the reason I’m turning for advice to you. What do you think would be the best thing to do in this situation? Should I explain him everything and apologize or just leave it this way and don’t say anything? And if I talk to him about it what would be the best for me to say? I feel guilty, but I also had reasons to act this way. What could you suggest me to? Sorry if I got too long and thank you for time reading this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",06May2020,1
942,I went on a date with this girl and she said she didnt feel anything romantic towards me after but I kept going after her and I would text her once a week asking her what shes up to. I would be the one to always text first about a week in a half ago we talked for like 2 hours ever since then weve been talking alot more almost everyday and even one day she text me first and then asking what I was up to. She added me on snap chat first too I thought I wouldve had to ask for hers. One night we were talking and she snapped me saying she was a little drunk and having inappropriate thoughts . Im dumb and inexperienced and I was confused too because she said she didnt feel anything towards me then she flat out said she was horny. She could tell I didnt do this often because she asked me. She said I wasnt good at picking up the cues or flirting and told me when a girls says that shes horny you should jump on it. This was all in a good manner btw she wasn't being mean. At one point she said she was turned off but having fun because I was being funny with what I was saying. She said she guesses shes just used to talking to douche bags and not good guys. I still got her tit pics though and I sent her a pic of my thing. I really think I fucked it up when I couldnt get hard and took 5 mins to send one back because after I did she said the momentum was gone but I tried to keep it going and asked her to send a pic of her thing but she asked me if Id be mad if she went to bed she was tired. I said no i think I ruined it and she said haha no I had fun. We talked for like an hour the day after but ever since then we havent talked very much like we were. We talk for maybe 10 mins and I try to keep a conversation going but she ends up not texting back. She did tell me at one point shes horrible at replying and isnt ignoring me. I get she could be busy or have nothing else to say. Its got me worried because Ive started to like her alot more over all of this. She text me first the other day and we exchanged like 2 text each before she stopped replying and shes been doing that alot more than usual and the other day she opened my snap when I asked her a question but didnt reply.  Im just going crazy thinking about what if she was becoming interested and I ruined it. Btw I dont text her again if she doesnt reply I wait till she does.

He pays me when I do it so that’s not the problem, I just hate doing it. If it was our house, I’d understand but I hate doing it otherwise. 

The problem is that he always guilts me into doing it. He will ask me like a week before or something, so I usually don’t have plans with friends already made, and say something like “I really need your help for 4 hours”. If I show any sign of hesitation because I never want to go, he just goes off on me saying how he never says no to me and how I’m never grateful. Then the argument spirals out of control and the whole family dynamic is messed up for a week. Then the cycle just repeats. 

I’ve told him that he needs to use other people because I’m in university, living at home, and I have a lot more work and less free time. Without fail he responds, “I’d rather give the money to you instead”. When I told him I’d rather pay whoever you take out of my own pocket instead of going, he yelled. 

In my opinion, the fact that he constantly does this makes me associate something I hate with him and in turn I start to resent him a little bit. I wish I could tell him this but I already know the outcome from him cause he never wants to hear me “talk back” to him. 

Even when I got my own job in high school and over the summers, he would ask me to skip shifts to work with him and got angry when I told him I literally cannot do that and then be accused me of not caring about him. 

All this is making me consider going as far as moving out the state when I graduate just to avoid him. 

If anybody has any suggestions about how I could essentially tell him to piss off and stop asking me for this without ruining family relationships, because my mom sides with me, it would be much appreciated.",06May2020,1
944,"For the longest part of my life, starting in primary school and up until just about a year back I was very much obsessed with finding a girlfriend, I think a lot of it stemmed from thinking that it would cure a lot of internal problems I had at the time. 

A few months back I met a girl on tinder and we really hit it off. She's funny, charming, intelligent, knows her rights from her wrongs, is a viciously hard worker, basically everything I'm not, but what I try to say is she's basically everything I could quite selfishly ask of in someone, we even shared a lot of the same hobbies and interests, and to top it off she was very much into me. I didn't have to put up a false front, I didn't have to pretend like I had any clue about dating, or anything else for that matter, and she fell for me. But she started calling me pet names, starting talking to me more and more and this of course all came to a head when she asked me one day what I think the two of us could be. 

The next few days I replied quite half heartedly and she was very keenly aware, until I finally told her out of the blue that I think we should stop talking all together. Now any ordinary person, I think at least, would try and salavage what remains of that relationship and try to even things out, but the idea of talking to a person who knows me so intimately, my secrets, and going back to a regular friendship scared me. She managed to talk me out of it and, eventually, we became friends and talk quite regularly. 

Since then I've experimented sexually, even with a dude, but nothing. 

I feel like I'm not aromantic by choice, but whenever I get called pet names I feel a hollowness in the pit of my stomach, whenever someone gets close to me I feel as though I'm being invaded and what's more I feel like any relationships I do have are false, like if they don't know literally everything about me then I'm lying to them and they only like a false version of myself I put across, and for obvious reasons I don't want to tell them my deepest, darkest secrets. 

This, overall, has led to a sort of distancing between me and the rest of humanity, I've fallen into a lot of misanthropy and cynicism and right now I feel like I'm just so out of touch with other people, obviously not helped by the lockdown. 

So, honestly after typing that all out I'm not exactly ehatnsort of advice I really want. I suppose if anyone knows more about aromanticism and can help me understand whether I really am aromantic or not would be appreciated, or just any ideas on how to better socialise with other people.

For starters, I desperately miss my family. I live with my boyfriend two hours away, I moved down here to go to school and unfortunately I had to drop out because I could no longer afford it. Since where I am from really lacks opportunity/is overall pretty shitty, my boyfriend let me me move in with him and his family. I’m grateful to have a place to stay but this doesn’t feel like home to me. I get along with his family, but I feel like I can’t do anything I really want to do. My room is in the basement and there’s no windows, no sunlight, it’s very dark and I’ve tried to liven up the place the best I can but it’s still not my home. Like I mentioned before, all of my family lives 2 hours away so I don’t really have anyone but my boyfriend down here. It’s really lonely. I particularly miss my mom and I miss feeling like I have family.  I often talk to them on the phone but it’s still very isolating. 

I feel like I have some sort of PTSD/anxiety because my dad died tragically has a kid and I now fear the same thing is going to happen to my mom. I’m 23 years old and I often feel like I have some separation anxiety from her which is embarrassing. I’ve had a lot more time to think recently therefore I have a lot more time to dwell in unresolved issues. I know I need therapy, but obviously that’s not possible right now.  

I work for a doctor’s office, but for the most part I’ve been working from home. My job has gotten three million times more stressful since all of this has happened and I feel like I’m hitting a breaking point. I could vomit at the thought of waking up for work tomorrow. Everything seems like too much, way much more than I am able to handle. I used to be able to handle things so well... now I’m not so sure.

I have good things. I’m financially stable. I am going back to school soon, for something different, but still. I know my family loves me but I can’t help but feel so alone and I’m really scaring myself. I’ve tried being productive— reading, yoga, going for walks, etc. but I can only stay distracted for so long. I don’t know what to do and I will accept any advice.

949,"My sister was adopted in 2004 as a newborn, by adopted I mean her biological mother was going to give her up and my parents stepped in to take care of her. They paid for her biological mothers doctors appointments and her rent while she was pregnant. Once she was born my dad was put on the birth certificate as the father but her biological mother is on the birth certificate as the mother. I have repeatedly told my parents that they need to tell her that she’s “adopted” but they don’t because they’re scared of how she’s going to react. Now she’s a freshman in high school about to go to her sophomore year (I’m going to brag about her because I love her and she’s the best) and she’s the social captain of the schools dance team and is all around amazing (obviously because she’s my sister). Her biological mother lives in the same town we she lives in and has a son that is a junior at the same high school. Her biological mother recently reached out to me because her biological brother knows about her and wants to meet her and make himself known in her life. I completely understand where he is coming from, my little sister is so amazing and I would definitely want to be a park of her life if I wasn’t as well but my parents still don’t want to/are to scared to tell her. I don’t feel like it’s my place to go over my parents and tell her the truth but it doesn’t bother me that this poor kid wants to meet his biological sister. I feel like it’s unfair to keep this from her and to keep this young man from her as well. I may be naive but I think the more family the better and I’m more than willing to let them be a part of her life but I do not want to overstep my boundaries with my parents.

It caused dysphoria at first because all features were on full show but then my family told me that I look like a rambunctious boy. This is helped with dysphoria but:

Everyone so far hates it and I don't feel attractive with a shaved head. They hate it because I lost a feminine part and now pass ever better (hell yeah) and I hate it because it doesn't work with my face (especially my still soft jawline and odd nose, my normal hair just looks better with my face). If they hadn't all said how much better I looked with my normal hair I probably wouldn't mind looking like a hairy egg for a few months, but now I feel like insecure. I haven't heard most peoples' reactions yet and this is making me dread it, even though I know it doesn't matter that much at the end of the day.

How do I go about accepting my lowering of attractiveness and the negative comments? I went from a handsome young chap to odd looking criminal and it's not great. (Also yes, vanity isn't that important but it's just a bother right now)

Other information: It's buzzed at a 21, so short but not to the skin short and my normal hair is the very common  shaved at the sides and longer at the top (usually just hitting the tops of my ears), meaning that it will take a long-ish time for it to grow back. I ofter let it fall on my forehead so no matter what, it doesn't look the same. 

The reactions weren't neutral negative. They were 'You shaved your head?! Oh, I liked the longer hair way more"" while mad from my dad and lots of 'oh, you looked so much better before', 'it's pretty awful', 'Oh, son, it's so short, it's so so short.

I'm 29 years old and still in college, I was originally majoring in marketing but during my fall semester I basically was dealing with severe depression and ended up passing my classes with C's and D's and was dismissed from my major, Im still in business school but I had to change my major to the general business degree that has a lower GPA requirement.

I will have to stay in school a year longer now (I was supposed to graduate this semester) I’ve already come to terms with this and I’m moving forward. all my work experience is in retail, I've worked a few management positions as well. I also run the skateboarding club in my college and I've grown it so much that we actually have journalists wanting to cover our club. I designed merch for my club and I've done countless volunteer work like hosting skate meets and growing our social media presence.

I’ve never been that academically gifted, I have a learning disability and was in special ed my whole public school career but what I lack in grades I make up for in my determination to learn and not give up. I’ll be 30 in august and I’m trying so hard not to be stuck in retail the rest of my life. I’ve been in and out of college for 10 years and finishing my undergrad has been extremely difficult for me, but I'm almost there. My family is helping me pay my rent while I’m in school and I feel very ashamed of that since I’m almost 30 but its only because I’m in school otherwise I’d never accept that help.

basically, I need some brutally honest advice, specifically how to I get out of retail and into the field I want to be in (I want a career in marketing or would like to work for a start-up and do digital media marketing) how can I better myself and not end up stocking shelves and asking my mommy for rent money when I’m in my 30s?

964,"I think this stems from middle/high school when I had a really bad sense of what was appropriate to say and what wasn't. I wasn't really funny when I said something inappropriate, just weird, mean, or both.

EX: ""Alyssa"" in my ninth grade English class had (probably still has) a dad who fixed computers for a living. She told us that at one of those beginning-of-the-year ""get to know each other"" events. One day, the teacher was trying to play a movie and the computer kept showing some kind of error message. So I said ""go have Alyssa's dad take a look at it."" At this point, no one even remembered that's what her dad did for a living so what I said just felt really awkward and bizarre. And I didn't think to explain myself by saying ""remember at the beginning of the year how she said her dad fixes this stuff for a living?""

I think I'm now on the opposite end of this spectrum. I am too careful about everything I say, to a point that I have a certain amount of social anxiety. A handful of people out there have the ""say whatever you want to me and I guarantee I won't judge"" face, and I feel comfortable around them, but that's not the majority of people.

Today, I texted a girl I knew a year ago, who was a bio major, asking about a class I have to take for the bio series since I'm a bio minor. When I asked her if she took ""Bio 19C,"" she said ""yea! I did. What's up?"" I went on to tell her how Zoom lectures are really hard for me to focus on and asked if she thinks bio 19C is something I should wait to take next year in-person, or if she thinks that's a class in which you can get by with just reading the textbook.

I think it was an acceptable question to ask. Obviously I asked her because she's a bio major who had taken the class, and I was asking about this for my own reference. I'm still weirdly apprehensive.

**TL;DR: I had a tendency in the past to say things that weren't necessarily offensive, but were really weird. I'm now trying to prevent that from happening again, and I'm often really shy to say anything. Do you have any advice?**",06May2020,1

This year I started an online school. The way this school is set up it lasts about 10 months and you have 1 professor thru out the year. Their way to get in has a 2 week process of work that you have to pass in order to make it into the program or you get switched out to try again. I fell behind. I had a video conference scheduled to discuss it with my professor. He’s young, late 20s. When we met, he was charming, funny, and of course flirty. Very caring too. Really wanted me to stay in his class.. He messaged me after our conference and initiated a conversation. He was bending over backward so that I would stay in his class. Ultimately, I was still falling behind. The fact is that I would have failed, had he not intervened. I .. i feel so ashamed for accepting his help. I am not special. I am not incredibly talented. I know why he helped me. Hah. The following day from our discussion/meeting. We started messaging each other in a personal way. He was funny, charming, interesting, geeky, and all. Greatttt guy. We video chatted one day just sharing stories, he was super respectful and charming. Suffice to say I really liked him. The day it was due, I was still behind. I didn’t ask for help, but he insisted. He hopped on a video conference with me and he coached me thru every single lesson and when i was exhausted about 7 hours later of work, he took over and finished it for me. I only had about 6 lessons left by then. The thing is. While I was working. He began to masturbate. I didn’t have to say anything or do anything, my v neck was enough. I can’t describe how I felt in the moment. I didn’t join in, I kept working, but I was obviously aware of what he was doing and a part of me was into it, another knew how wrong it was. I let it happen. When we finished that day, I cried. A lot. He neglected to help other students to help me. He said he would not have done it if he didn’t think I would ultimately understand what I was doing. But I still feel guilty about it.  I’m getting better at learning this and whatnot.

Our warped relationship continued. Sometime later, he told me that he really liked where we were going and he wanted this to continue butttt if we could keep our personal lives, personal. But I, of course, was welcome to share with him. I immediately knew that something was off with that. I am a very understanding person and I do not judge others for their choices, I try to understand what get’s them there. He confided in me, that he is married. Ha. I felt like i had been punched in the stomach. More crying ensued. He gave me a whole story about how they do not have sex and they have grown apart... I accepted that statement, I mean I have no way of knowing if this is true or not. I remember that evening i looked him up on facebook, flooded with photos of him and his wife. I couldn’t do it. I told him. I could not do this. He asked we stay friends. But the thing is, he would be my friend and then it would always turn sexual. I am not saying I am not at fault for participating. But over the course of a two months i broke down again and again and again. I feel utterly disgusting as a human, i broke personal morals for this person. The idea of what this would do to his wife, to any human being's self-esteem, it breaks my heart. Yet, I still have a soft spot for him. About a month ago, I became much more rigid with him, no more sexual stuff. We can be friends. This happened after an incident in which i expressed that i was upset about how it transpired. I told him i needed help with something but i could wait until the following day, since it was late that evening and it was not troubling me too much. He sent a zoom link, he taught me about it for 2 mins, masturbated, and as soon as he came, he left. I expressed how upset i was about that. Suddenly... he has much less time to talk to me. Because he “cares” and does not wish to hurt me. Hah. I fucked up too. About a month later when i was drunk a few weekends ago, he was messaging me and i sent a video of myself in a bra. We had just finished video chatting about school, he put his hands in his pants, ended the convo. I started drinking and I know i fucked up, i had been so good about saying no before that. And its like i gave him free rein again. i feel like i am losing my mind, now whenever i have a video conference with him, it almost always ends with his hands in his pants. He’s smart too, won’t ever show anything. But fuck dude. I asked if he had ever done this with another student, he said no, that i was the first. I feel like an ass hat if i believe that. I literally do not believe anythingggg he says. At all. I am angry. I miss the person i got to know but i refuse to budge. I keep seeing the asshole side to him now too. But i am fucked when it comes to school, because he is who i go to for help. That’s the only person i can go to. Every tutorial, every video, every study group, its him. HE IS EVERYWHERE. I dont want to see him, talk to him, anything. I range between crying to feeling numb and paralyzed. It boils my blood to allow anyone to interfere with my studies. I feel like screaming. Even posting this i am terrified but this is not something i can share with a family member or a friend. I don’t know how to proceed. As of now I am making sure all of our conferences are during the day when i know he will have others scheduled afterward and nothing can happen. Yesterday, i saw the way he was behaving with a new female student, the giggles, the attention, and i could not help but wonder if i was the only one... 

I would like to say that I have feelings for someone else too, and i really really like him. He is a completely different person and he's wonderful. I have been open and honest with him about this and he has been understanding. But i feel gross. I don’t want to leave this class, i have made friends and tbh he knows the subject so so well. I keep telling myself to tough it out but again, i feel like i am going insane. My emotions are so mixed when it comes to him.

969,"This is an odd request for advice, sorry about typos and formatting, I'm on mobile.


My sibling and I share an apartment, we've been here since December 2019.  The apartment itself is basically one long ground level house with five units.  It sits on a foundation with accessable crawl spaces barred with chicken wire latched doors (I'm assuming for maintenance to access the crawl space.)  


The pipes here are terrible, but what else is new in cheap socal apartments?  In January, our toilet began spewing sewage from God knows where and so did our shower drain.  Property manager sent her relative, who is a handyman, he crawled under the house and snaked something, and the sewage drained.  


Last night, our toilet began backing up with water.  It's not hit our shower yet, but our kitchen sink is now refusing to drain, at all.  I took a wrench under the kitchen sink and drained the basin by taking all the accessable pipes out and checks for clogs, no clogs.  Put all the pipes back.  This is something to do under the house, because when we ran the shower, you can hear dripping from the accessable crawl space area.  


We texted our neighbor asking if they have similar issues and they said yes, but not to call the property manager.  They are on month to month rent and they get their rent raised every time they call maintenance.  We are on a year lease and have never had that happen.


My question is this; should I call the property manager and get her to send the handy man?

She says I'm just like my father (which do we have similar tendencies and she doesn't like my father much so...) Anyways, I just find it depressing?

973,"I think this stems from middle/high school when I had an objectively bad sense of what was appropriate to say and what wasn't. I wasn't really funny when I said something inappropriate, just weird/awkward.

For example, ""Alyssa"" was a girl in my ninth grade English class whose dad fixed computers for a living. She told us that in one of those beginning-of-the-year ""get to know each other"" events. One day, the teacher was trying to play a movie on Netflix but the computer kept showing some error message. I said ""go have Alyssa's dad take a look at it."" At this point, no one else even remembered her dad worked with computers for a living so what I said felt really awkward and bizarre. And I didn't think to explain myself by saying ""remember at the beginning of the year how she said her dad fixes this stuff for a living?"" That might have made it less awkward, but it might have still been weird to be mentioning Alyssa's dad randomly.

I'm now on the opposite end of this spectrum. I am too careful about everything I say, to a point that I have a social anxiety. A handful of people out there have ""say whatever you want to me and I promise I won't judge you"" face/voice/mannerisms, and I feel comfortable around them, but that's not the majority of people.

Today, I texted a girl I knew a year ago, who was a bio major back then, asking about a class I have to take since I'm a bio minor. When I asked her if she took ""Bio 19C,"" she said ""yea! I did. What's up?"" I went on to tell her how Zoom lectures are really hard for me to focus on and I asked if she thinks bio 19C is something I should wait until next year to take in-person, or if she thinks that's a class in which you can get by with just reading the textbook.

I think it was an acceptable question to ask. Obviously I asked her because she's a bio major who had already taken the class, and I was evidently asking for my own personal reference. I'm still weirdly apprehensive about it.

**TL;DR: I had a tendency in the past to say things that weren't necessarily offensive, but were really weird. I'm now trying to prevent that from happening again, and I'm often really shy to say anything. Do you have any advice?**",06May2020,1

I (F 23) just got a new job as a consultant last month. My schedule would be traveling M-Th and home on the weekends. My car note and insurance are $800 together. I just graduated college last year, so I still live at home. My plan was to let me parents sell my car and stop paying my car insurance. My last day driving would be May 17th. I’m saving up to get an apartment in the city and building my savings in general, target move out date is January 2021. However, now with Covoid- I don’t know how long it’ll be before I travel. 
Here’s my question: should I still continue w/ the plan to get rid of my car (and the extra bill that comes with it) this month, or wait it out until I’m able to travel for work?
I don’t want to be stranded w/o a vehicle but then again everything is closed bc of covid.

I’m not sure when I plan to get another vehicle bc I will be moving to the city where a car is not needed- I live in the suburbs now.

978,"tl;dr Recent expat in Germany. When I talk to people (not just Germans), it feels like they are not engaged in talking to me really. Something's wrong with my personality somehow and I don't know what to do. Please advise me.

I may be going dull, and as I go about overthinking about it, I am going insane. 

I am a south asian guy, and I moved recently to a major city in Germany, for work. I consider myself to be fairly outgoing, reasonably extroverted and charismatic, and I have never had much of an issue in having a social circle around me at home. Even in Germany (I know, don't tell me about Germans being reserved and what not), I have been able to get into at least three social circles of different kinds.

What's making me go insane is the sudden absence of charm in my personality! I feel like suddenly I have lost all traces of my personality, and my charisma is down to zero. This goes even when I'm interacting with non-Germans (although I should also add that I am new to living in the western society). I don't have much of an accent when I speak English, unlike others from my country. The language gap is a barrier, sure. But in my city it's not hard to find people who speak fluent English and are willing to speak it. But when I talk to people, it's insanely hard to have a flowing conversation. No matter what topic I pick. From sports to music to pop culture to gym. Nothing really works! I don't know what to do. I'm not even ugly FFS, although I'm probably not super sexy and attractive either. **My guess is that the problem is because of a culture gap**. When I talk, people don't reciprocate with any interest at all, most of the time. My jokes just fall flat or go unnoticed. What I say doesn't seem like it matters at all. And it's definitely only for people in here, around me. When I talk to people from back home, even when I talk to new people but from back in home country, they seem to reciprocate okay. There are some people in my circles, some Americans, and one German dude who seem to respond well. But by and large, most people just give a vibe that they are bored of talking to me. 

Dating and friendships are extremely tough this way, when i don't even know how to be charming. I never ever thought that I would have to think about something like charisma, and definitely not in a self-aware fashion. It's almost as if I'm questioning my own identity! My confidence levels have dropped like anything, and I am only faking it these days when I don't wanna look like a wuss.

I should add two things here. The first thing is about what I think are not the reasons for my issues: 

* I wouldn't believe it if you go about explaining to me that Germans are reserved, unsocial, etc. Compared to where I come from, they are not too far off. 
* Language is certainly not too huge a barrier. English works pretty well with everybody.
* People are definitely not being racist towards me. I don't see a difference in *their* attitude when they talk to me versus when they talk to some other brown person. The only thing that changes is how the conversation flows, how they react to what is being said, etc.
* There is a stereotype that south asian dudes are misogynistic, sexist, etc. We could debate about the generality of it at a later time, but at least I am sure that I am not being a prick. I could extract this opinion from two westerners in a casual conversation, so I am doubly sure that that's not being an issue with my personality.

The second thing is what I have been able to do to make my life not too miserable:

* I am participating in various activities and trying to socialise with everybody I come across. This ranges from gaming, to sports, to parties, or simply hanging out with people in a pub and chill.
* I am learning German so that I can communicate better. This also includes consuming German media

I want people to respond when I talk. What do I talk about? Small talk doesn't work. Serious talk doesn't work. I guess the issue comes down to how can I go about rebuilding my persona, one that doesn't make people feel boring when I talk to them. And this, while there is a culture gap in place. Of course I am learning about the culture, and that's gonna take time. But I need to not go insane in the mean time. What can I do?",06May2020,1

984,"I was enrolled in Computer Science at my community college and I dropped out because I couldn't seem to keep up with all the math. It destroyed my self esteem and made me feel like an idiot everyday I stepped into that class. In the fall I'm thinking of enrolling in another college for a cyber security degree but I read around and it's more of a specialized field and I'd need years of experience before I even get a cyber security job. In my first semester of college I was put into a very heavy Biology course and although it was one of the hardest courses I've ever taken, learning the material felt rewarding and I found a lot of it to be very interesting.  I'm just stuck. If I commit to a biology degree or whatever I would need so much more school than if I just did the cyber security degree but I feel like I would like it more. But I also don't want to spend all that money just to find out that I don't want to do it anymore. I'm just stuck on what to do and I don't have any friends I can talk to to really figure it out.

I just want to finally move out and start life and stop working my barista job and finally feel like I'm doing something worthwhile. It seems like I'm going to be stuck doing customer service and fast food jobs for years and years and I don't know how I am going to get out of it. I know I'm not the dumbest guy but lately it feels like I'm absolutely clueless. It seems that everything is such a huge gamble. 

Biology is interesting, but it's a big commitment compared to cyber security, and also a lot more money. I just don't know what to do anymore and it's so stressful. Has anyone else felt this way and persevered through it? If so, could I get some advice on how to navigate this situation?",06May2020,1

986,"I'm 18 and the only child, but I have a couple older (in their 40's, has their own house and family) half siblings nearby, My dad is 78, mom is 59. Neither of them speak very good English, so I handle phone calls, appointments, translating at the doctor, etc. IS it wrong to want freedom? I'd want to just start dorming and living on my own for a while. I'm not trying to completely abandon my parents. I've always been expected to stay with my parents forever and take care of them, since they took care of me growing up. To stay in my little city, and go to UCR (20 minute drive) instead of my school of choice, UCSB. To never move out, and spend the rest of my life here in this city. I feel trapped, I want to live my own life. At the same time though, I feel indebted to my parents and feel obligated to stay to help them, which is why I chose to not go to UCSB.

It frustrates me because though I know my parents rely on me for certain things, I know that they are capable of taking care of themselves. My mom’s too afraid to drive, grocery shop, or go anywhere on her own. She is capable, just too fearful. I know she CAN do it, and I hate how much she relies on me for simple tasks. She knows how to drive, and I've tried again and again to encourage her to drive alone and teach her how to check out at American stores.

My dad's health is in decline, but he's still able to drive and knows enough English to do bills and stuff. I chose to stay local and go to UCR so I will be nearby whenever they need me there, whether it be groceries or to take them to the doctor or something. He lives very secluded and quiet, and even at home we don't talk much. I don't want to just leave him even more alone, even though now that we're living together, we barely speak to each other.

My mom takes this as me betraying her, not loving her, and being a terrible, shitty, and ungrateful daughter. My dad feels the same, that it's wrong of me to leave them. I feel like it's unfair that my older siblings were able to move out and build their own life, and I'm obligated to stay with my parents. But I also don't want to abandon them. I want to be able to make a good living later on in life and support them.

My mom is heavily emotionally reliant on me. I'm the sole reason she lives here in America, and without me here, she'd move back to her home country. I don't know who'd stay to take care of my dad though. My siblings are nearby but if I don't want to be obligated to take care of my parents, it'd be hypocritical to make them do it.

Is this selfishness wrong? Is the only “right” thing to stay at home and continue to serve them til they're gone? I was originally only planning on dorming my freshman year, then commuting, to be able to take care of them. But deep down, I crave freedom. I want to just live my own life without their restrictions. Am I in the wrong for wanting to give myself more opportunities outside of my little town and UCR? Is it wrong to just leave for dorms and not tell them? Our relationship sucks right now and I don't want to hurt my parents and make it worse, but I hate feeling so trapped. Thanks.",06May2020,1
987,"Hello all,

I'm creating this post, mainly because it's something I've always wondered about myself, nothing that has ever manifested past a mental ""what if?"" But what really made me want to ask was when I had read the comment another redditor made earlier today. It was a post about lame/arbitrary punishments that you received as a child in school. 

The redditor commented that their child with ASD had received punishment at school for nothing other than collecting caterpillars in the hopes of saving them from their unruly peers that found amusement in stomping on them. Catch and release if you will haha. Unfortunately the child was caught by a teacher and was then subsequently punished. 

Now, in most cases this isn't really anything new. Children tend to stick up for bugs or animals all the time. Some kids just don't take pleasure in that behavior. However, this is something that I tended to do ALOT as a child and even now as an adult. And I think the difference here is that I was 100% willing to be ""that weird kid"" and face ridicule from my peers to prevent the death of a bug, or the destruction of a toy with no regard for my ""social status,"" so to speak. Even as an adult today I find myself avoiding critters on the ground at work or home as to not injure them. Once while I was serving in the Army, I was tasked with the night shift gate guard duty during pre-deployment training with another soldier in my squad. A beautiful moth had landed on the barrel of my squamate's SAW. As I was examining it, he pulled out his pocket knife and pinned it to the barrel by what id assume is the base of its neck/head. I jokingly but also kind of seriously told him to leave it be because it was a pretty cool fucking moth, I ain't even gonna lie haha. He cut its head off. I was deeply unsettled and quite angry, but I bit my tongue and tried brushing it off. That was a while ago and it still sometimes bothers me.  

I am also very meticulous in regards to maintaining my personal belongings. I am careful in how I use my belongings, I do not like damaging my things. 

To be fair, most people don't. But I sometimes feel an unnecessary level of anxiety when letting others use my things unless I'm 100% whatever it is will be taken care of, which is rare. I just don't like people touching/handling my shit. 

Here's an example. I have this little action figure I got last 4th of July from one of those parachute fireworks. It's just a little figurine of a Paratrooper, poorly painted and not well constructed. Just a gimmick so mom and dad will buy Jr. the more expensive version of the original parachute firework. It's literally worthless. 

I had let my good friends child play with said action figure when he came over to my apartment one day a month or two ago. Just something to keep the kid busy while we chatted. Remember, I'm a 26 year old man, a veteran of the armed forces...and the whole time I couldn't stop thinking about the welfare of this dumb plastic army man. I was slightly dreading the moment the kid would walk in and it would be destroyed. And the thing is, I know the kid isn't destructive by nature. He's a good kid. Why on earth would I get so worked up about something like that? My guess is that I associate the action figure with an emotional tie to the 4th of July. Hanging out with my parents, drinking a beer with my dad, having fun. But is that normal? Do we make emotional ties as adults with objects of that nature? I've yet to meet or even speak to someone else who would do that. There's a 4th of July every year and a near endless supply of army men acquired through the use of a projectile based firework.  

I've taken multiple of those ASD tests/quizzes online and scored pretty high on all three I took. Two of the three stated that I exhibited symptoms of someone with ASD, the other stated that I did not...but I did also score two points away from meeting the requirement. I know these are not to be taken seriously and that a medical professional needs to be the one to do the diagnosing. But I mean...they were still pretty consistent. 

Some of the question though I found to be too vague to answer. such as, ""Is it easy for you to make new friends/meet people?"" or ""Do dates (time dates not dates with women) interest you?"" ""Do you remember birthdays?""

I mean...in what context? What person is consistently meeting new people? Who is always making new friends? I'm not a person who goes out of my way to meet new people. I'm content with the few friendships I do have. If I meet someone who I like enough to spend time with, cool. But again I'm not going to just start conversation with a stranger in the hopes of an arbitrary friendship. In the past 3 years I have made two friends whom I enjoy being around. But what's the criteria for having enough friends to not have ASD vs. not having enough friends to qualify for ASD? Historical dates I do tend to remember but I also love history and learning about it in my free time. Now, as an avid gamer I know WAAYY more dates for console releases, game release dates, patch and update dates, old and new alike. Same with classic cars. I'm not even a car guy really I guess, but I know which years Ford made the cool mustangs vs. when they didn't (1970's mustangs are gross looking. 60's and the relatively newer mustangs from the 90's like the fox bodies are cool imo.)  But does that mean anything? It's just shit I know I guess, I read a lot about video games and cars. I like to read and its just one of those things I remember. Birthdays are a different story, I know my parents and brother and sisters birthday but not anyone else really. That question I found the most arbitrary. Because what does that prove? I know their birthdays...big deal. Some people do and some people don't, I don't think that means anything, personally of course.

A few questions did stick out to me. Questions I didn't doubt for a second being things that I do. One was knowing a lot of facts about a lot of different things, even things that may not be of particular interest to me. I don't watch anime AT ALL, and yet I know the lore or quotes of certain anime, even the less popular ones. I understand the satirical elements and basic narrative of ""One Punch Man"" and yet I've never seen a single episode, only because I watched a 5 minute clip of a fight scene from the show on facebook once like a year or so ago out of boredom. 

One question hit me hard. Like...emotionally hard. 

""Do you feel like you've never have or ever will have a best friend."" 

I thought about that one a lot, even before I questioned this ASD thing. I've never had one true best friend at any point in my life. Again, in school I wasn't particularly normal so to speak. What is ""normal"" after all? Anyways I only had 3 real friends my schooling career, but none I'd say are my ""best friends."" They are my really good friends to this day. But best friend(s) is a stretch. In the Army I had friends I guess, more so people who could relate to me and I could relate to them to an extent. But I hardly, if ever speak to any of them. I do try to reach out and inquire about how life is going for the few that I still have some contact with. The one military friend I did have that I enjoyed being around no longer speaks to me, and I'm not too sure why. But that's life I suppose. 

I've never really been one to initiate small talk. And if I do I have to sense or feel like its warranted, or will be reciprocated which is pretty rare. If a stranger tries making small talk with me, I am polite and do my best, but id rather not talk to them.  

Large crowds of people stress me out. I don't like being alone in groups of strangers. I feel unsafe most times. I've actively combated this by going to bars or clubs by myself and that feeling has eased some. I'm not as on edge as I used to be in my teens or early 20's, but I still can get sketched out. The unpredictability of human nature can be a spooky thing. I wouldn't say I'm paranoid, its just always in the back of my mind. Almost as if I'm not welcomed, like everyone is watching my every move with contempt. 

Dating is one thing that stands out, as I'm good at going on dates with women, but suck at actually dating. I weirdly find women I go out with easy to speak to. I'd consider myself a decent conversationalist in that sense, that has come with experience of course as I never was, but then again what guy is haha? I do tend to ramble about my hobbies and interest though. I have no trouble telling women about my love of video games. I once explained the concept and execution of the game ""Exanima"" in great detail to a girl I went out with. I slightly cringe at myself thinking about it, but she was fascinated so I don't feel all that bad. Then again I have read that women enjoy hearing a man speak about an interest passionately so maybe I just got lucky. I have been told and am still told that I'm ""extremely attractive."" I have no opinion on that as I'm not one to boast, nor do I really care if I am or not. But if true, I suppose that puts the ball in my court on these interactions. Offsets the dorkiness and rambling maybe? I've been in a handful of relationships, all of which I struggled to relate or be sympathetic to my partner about their emotional distress. I listen and I did try to give feedback, but in the back of my mind I couldn't give a shit less. ""You're an adult, deal with it like one."" I know that sounds cynical, but I cant rationalize it hardly at all. Unless it was something that was super serious like a death of a family member or an injury, that I could gladly handle. One of my ex's had her cat mauled by a dog and had to put it down. It was agreeably sad, and I truly did my best to be supportive, and I feel horribly bad for saying this, but I really didn't care. I just wanted to go home the whole time. 

I'm terrible at making eye contact. I struggle with it. And if I do its overbearing. My brother in law expressed that I can occasionally ""stare too intensely.""  I find myself sometimes looking around and not at the person I'm supposed to be listening to. I find prolonged eye contact unsettling. 

I have a pretty in depth imagination. I'm very creative with my thoughts. My dreams are vivid, if that is relative. I daydream a lot about many outlandish scenarios where I'm the protagonist. I feel like we all do this though, the extent of human imagination is near limitless so I'm not sure why those with ASD are outliers. 

I cant think of anything else. I do have ADD and I do take Adderall for it which helps. But I read that ADD/ADHD are somewhat synonymous with ASD. 

If you have any questions or advice for me I'm more that happy to answer them or listen. I apologize for such a long post, I just wanted to be as transparent and truthful about myself as I could.

Thank you for taking the time to listen!",06May2020,1

989,"So for as long as I remember my mom's cat has been afraid of me. The top two reasons cats are afraid don't apply here. I've been in this house since before the first week him and his brother were brought home, I've never hit/stroke/slapped/smacked/kicked/thrown/etc'd the poor thing. The most I've done is yell at it a few times for pissing on things before it was potty trained because I thought I wouldn't be able to stop it in time any other way.

The weird part is his fear influences his brother? Like, his brother loves getting rubbed by me and will literally snuggle with me, but if they're sitting together and I try to rub the calm one then they just both run. The weirder part? This cat will bolt if I look at it funny but will also literally use my legs as a bridge from table to couch when he thinks I'm not going to notice.

The point of us going is to visit family &amp; hang out &amp; stuff like that so if we're going to be stuck in quarantine either way idk what the point of going is.

993,"One of my new bosses gave me his son's old bike, but I've only ridden a bike a few times before in my entire life, and I still have a hard time balancing and confidently braking. This combined with the stress of riding alongside traffic and other people (at the age of 25 no less) make it even more terrifying and embarrassing.

But a lot of times these people are above me in seniority and position. I don’t really have authority to tell them what to do, but if they don’t do what I say, then I am on the line for it and my boss is aware but just accepts this. I am basically left requesting sternly but politely for things from these people. How can I tell them to do things and give them deadlines when I am below them. My boss won’t intervene because he is busy and “wants me to take care of it”.  I am confident when speaking and they respect me as a person, but I don’t think they always understand how urgent it is when I request things of them.",06May2020,1

999,"My best friend is depressed because her ex cheated on her, it was a very traumatic experience since it's her first real guy. 

That asshole was my friend and knew that adultery destroyed her family so it's an even bigger toll for her. She went to therapy but quit because she didn't feel like she was seeing any progress, I advised her to see another therapist because she might not have felt a connection with this one. She's taking hard pills prescribed by a doctor. The pills make her fade away and make her really tired but she tells me it does help her (she's been having nightmares every night but it stopped with the treatment).

I really love her with all my heart but it's really hard for me to keep listening/trying to help out because sometimes she pushes me away and it gets worst with the pills.

it's getting hard for me because those pills get her so high they make her feel less empathy,

 I know I have to leave some personal space but I feel the need to protect her. I know I can't protect her from her own feelings but it's killing me. I'm trying not to show how afraid I am for her but it's getting harder and harder. 

I really need help, I've been considering going to therapy myself because I can't watch her become a depressed pillhead who doesn't even care about me anymore while she's my whole world.",06May2020,1
1000,"Warning: racism

Last night I got really upset at my Dad. He was talking about Asian people and said, ""EVERYONE calls them [racist Asian slur], but you go nuts when we say it!"". I don't want to type the slur out but yeah. And I got so mad. I asked why he thought I reacted like that, then said I was going to my room.

This isn't the first example of him doing this either. I've reached boiling point. He only said that because he knew it would upset me, he wanted a reaction out of me I think.

I cried for ages last night.  I haven't really talked to my dad since. When he asks me something, I give monosyllabic responses. I'm so upset with him. Me and my dad and sister were going to be going to Korea and Japan over the summer, and honestly I want to go up to him and tell him to call it off because of how he speaks about Asian people.

1006,"I'm a 28 year old guy. I have been thinking a lot these days about how I should turn my life around after Covid-19 goes away. I was a straight A student in high school, but suffered bullying and social isolation, and as a result I wanted to get away from my city and went living with my father for the last year of high school. Unfortunately things didn't improve much. I wasn't bullied anymore, but social isolation continued, and my father was very strict (no parties, tight control of my whereabouts and strong opposition to alcohol). As a result, I decided to move yet to a different city to pursue university studies. I did well my first semester, but had to stop right after that, and next semester I was offered a job by an acquaintance. It paid decent money for that time and, although I continued to struggle socially, it at least offered me a semblance of a social life, so as I was struggling to juggle school and work, I prioritized work, and changed faculties two times. 

In the meantime, I have been holding various jobs, but most of them were entry-level jobs, until I had the opoortunity to join a big IT company as a technical writer last year, however, I was coming from a string of easy, relaxed jobs, and was not prepared for the level of responsibility this position would entail. As a result, I slacked and got fired before the probation period ended. I tried to take it in stride as I acknowledged my responsibility in getting fired, but I haven't been able to find a job ever since (it's been almost a year), and reality is starting to hit me hard in the face. While my former classmates studied in Europe or the US, and/or have fancy jobs or are starting companies, I am still depending financially on my parents at age 28. I also slacked through university, and while I finished my studies (Business), my school is mediocre while I had the chance to enroll at the best universities in my city, my grades were average, and therefore I can't access scholarships to do postgraduate studies out of the country, which has been my lifelong dream. My parents offered to pay for a Master's, but it has to be in my country as that's all they can afford, meaning I'm all but sentenced to remain in my developing South American country. 

At the same time, while I'm grateful I might have one more chance to redeem myself academically, at the same time accepting their help for a Master's would mean to continue depending on them, which I don't want, the reason for which I'll explain in a few moments. A few years ago, my social situation finally started to improve. I made a great friend who pushed me out of my shell, as I was a sheltered guy my whole life. We eventually parted ways, but I was changed as a person after being his friend for two years. I was a lot more social, and soon I would make new friends, including my current best friend, and started to go out and party more, which my family started to strongly dislike. Both my parents have extremely negative views towards alcohol, even including social/moderate drinking. They all but expect me to be teetotal, even if they never said it explicitly. I, on the other hand, would like to continue enjoying life, partying included, a few more years. I am of the opinion that if I experience it enough, it will eventually get out of my system on its own.

I live with my older sister and her husband, and my mother still lives in my hometown, but she still exerts a great deal of influence because she still pays for a lot of stuff and calls everyday to chat with us, often more than once a day, therefore it's impossible to keep anything I do hidden from her without the collaboration of my sister. I have to let her know everytime I'm going to a party or a club, or else my sister will not let me go. Understandably, she says the reason for this is that she doesn't want to be blamed if something bad happens to me. She also gets mad if I arrive after a certain time, or if she believes I'm spending too much time outside. I try to make her see that she had her fun when she had my age, but she replies that I'm focusing too much on parties and my friends, and she doesn't see me putting as much effort in improving myself, which due to pressure from my parents includes losing weight (I'm 5'6 and 190 lb), and I realized that she largely agrees with my mom on her views. She doesn't go out very often and drinks very little, and neither does her husband. Both are 35.

Things got even worse when I got mugged last year. They blame my best friend for it, because it was on the way out of his birthday party and I was taking him home as he was way too drunk, but he asked me to take a cab and I stubbornly refused and wanted to walk to the bus stop to save money. I met a guy who claimed to know me through a mutual friend, offered help to take my drunk friend home, and to go somewhere else to have a few drinks afterwards as it was barely midnight. I was sober at all times, but at some point my drink was spiked and I arrived at my house with wounds in my face and without my phone. Although I tried to explain this to them a million times, they still say they don't believe me and try to pressure me to reveal what ""really"" happened. This is probably because in the past, due to their control, I had to lie a few times to in order to go out, and got caught. From then on, there's a lot of scrutiny on my friends, with they wanting to know all the details about who they are, where I met them, what they do for a living, what we do when we are hanging out, etc., and my mother has stated openly to my sister that she wants my best friend away from me, even if he's a great person and has been nothing but an amazing friend to me since we met, and what happened that night was entirely my responsibility as my friend was too drunk.

I would understand any parent reacting like that, but the problem is that my mother has been very overprotective of me since I was very little. She even refused to let me do military service, which is mandatory in my country for males, fearing I would be mistreated. She is also frightened by the constant influx of news on TV about murders, robberies, etc., and talks to me often about how the world is a dangerous place and it's better for me to stay home. As a result of all of this, I am a very sheltered person. I don't know how to fight, and tend to be shy and naive, which probably factored in my former inability to make friends. Whenever I'm out, I'm always the first one to leave because I have to text my mother when I arrive home, or else she'll be too worried to sleep (this is from before the mugging incident btw), and besides that my sister gets very upset when I arrive drunk, even though I just slip quietly to my room and have never made any scandal. It's ironic because my mom is worried that I never had a girlfriend, but if now that I'm single spending a night outside is impossible (my sister got very upset when I arrived 6 am one day), I don't want to imagine how it's gonna be once I get a gf.

This has pushed me to realize the need for becoming financially independent, but I have been applying to jobs for almost a year without any luck. I can't make it past the final interview and it's starting to make me depressed. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Also, all the jobs I get interviewed for are sales positions, which I don't want anymore, as I would like to move to an administrative/clerical position, but all the experience I have is in sales so I can't even apply for those roles (I only got the IT job because of my English skills, and no other company hires technical writers). I am still very frustrated about my unfulfilled dream of living and working abroad, but at the same time I started liking the life I have here. I have considered moving to my country's capital to get a bit out of my family's grip, but I don't want to leave my friends behind, as I made them only after 7 years living here. I want to move out of my house, but both my mom and sister have said on several occasions that they don't believe I have the necessary emotional stability. 

To make matters worse, my mom bought an apartment in this city, which is due to be completed at the end of the year, for us to live there. My brother in law accepted the offer, and my sister was shocked when I told her I would like to rent my own apartment by then. From a financial sense, it doesn't make sense to rent when you have a free apartment, so when the time comes to move out, they will definitely realize that it is because I want to take some distance from them. It also makes me depressed because, barring these issues, my family is actually very loving and supporting, and I don't want them to think I don't love them or care about them anymore. I do, but at the same time, I'm tired to be mommy's little good boy and want to become my own person. I realize I've grown in ways that probably clash with my family's expectations, and I realize taking this step might seriously strain my relationship with my family. This is also the reason why I hesitate about accepting their paying for my master's, as I have decided that my priority is to find a job, but with Covid-19 it's totally uncertain when that's gonna happen, which makes me feel worse. At the same time, I could use the extra education, so I'm totally lost.

If you made it this far, I would like to truly thank you for this and for any advice you could have for me. I want to start doing things right after this pandemic is over, but don't know where to start.

TLDR.- Can't get a job and want to move out of my house, but don't know how to do it without ruining family relationships.",06May2020,1

I’m tired of watching the girls who made up vague excuses why they’re too busy to date me make out with people in front of my face, I’m tired of being told how great I’ll be for someone someday by women who are dumping me, I’m tired of my only options being desperate people who are either mentally unhinged or people who take no care of themselves and expect me to do everything.

1019,"My brother has been living in my Moms house for the past 4 years with his 2 children aged 16(F) and 4(F). In that time I have since gone away to University but I come back for breaks and I am slowly starting to notice the deterioration of her house because of him and his kids. My mom is a very pristine woman and always emphasized cleaning habits when I was growing up however, since she is getting older in age she can't clean as much as she used to. My brother on the other hand does not like to clean. He lives in the basement of our house and it is completely filthy. The manner in which he treats his living space rubs off on his kids as well. His youngest daughter does not like to clean up after herself and the oldest one does not either. This shows in their rooms upstairs as well. Whenever my Mom complains about the amount of filth, there is always backlash with my brother who has anger problems and chooses to raise his voice instead of accept reality or come up with excuses as to why it is the case. 

Since coming back I have been the subject of excuses because I am one extra person that lives here. Instead of taking responsibility for his own kids he uses me as an excuse. While I was never a saint when it came to cleaning up around the house growing up, I have since learned once I got to school the importance of cleaning up after myself and I have now turned into my mom (inevitable right?) in that aspect.  

Aside from cleaning, my Mom instructed him to pay rent if he were to live under this roof. He hasn't. Most recently he got his stimulus check money from the government but instead of paying my mom what he owes in rent, he went out and bought a brand new Iphone 11. Mind you he hasn't paid her the past couple of months although he has a full time job as a plumber.

When my mom gets home early he and his kids eat whatever she/or I cook because he does not cook for them often. Dinner to him is ordering or picking up some sort of fast food. While that is quick and easy, it develops bad habits especially for the youngest daughter who seems to only enjoy chicken nuggets and french fries. For the eldest daughter, she has never been taught how to cook and doesn't even request to ask my mom to show her how. 

There is an extensive list of things that I could vent about from broken a refrigerator, sinks/lights being left on because of carelessness, and other damages but that is just what I have noticed since being stuck in the house witnessing this day after day. It is like me and my mom have to clean up after slobs who take advantage of the home that they live in. 

While it is not my jurisdiction to make the call, I just want to tell my mom to kick them out because he is clearly comfortable with using up her resources like they are his own and not paying her a dime. She complains about them everyday and I cannot take another year or more of this going on because not only is it hard mentally, but my mom plans on retiring soon so I don't want her to spend as much money as she is especially when she won't be working soon.

What can I say to my mom to get her to deeply consider taking action with him, or what can I do to at least tell my brother to stop using my mom for her resources like he has been without causing a fight?",06May2020,1

In fact, my only two boyfriends have preferred asian girls. There’s an app called Yubo where teens make friends, but we really use it for dating lol.

This is when I messed up. 

The first day, he gave me advice on how to move on from my crush. 2 days later, this 42M creep dmed me on Reddit. The creep wanted to voice call me and ""teach me"" some things. That made me freak out. As a result, I contacted Adam. He dmed that 42M and Adam said that the guy made some personal remarks about him. This was when I kind of developed some feelings for him. But, I still wasn't crushing on him at that time. I just felt like he was a caring person. 

The next day, I tried talking to him but I could tell he wasn't interested. Later that day, I told him that I kind of liked him. He then made his biggest mistake. He asked me if I wanted his insta and I said sure. We then both started talking on insta. We both talked for a while. I later had to go to sleep bc it was really late. The next day, I texted him when I woke up. He didn't reply and I think he was probably ignoring me. I later blocked him. But, I ended up unblocking him after 4 hours. I texted him immediately after unblocking him. I apologized to him for blocking him and I could clearly tell he was really mad at me. 

He later started saying that he believes that I'm lying about everything including my age. I tried to explain to him that I'm not lying about anything. He also started saying that he's going to report me to the police. Idk why I freaked out when he said that. So, I asked him if he wants to talk to my friend. And he agreed. I asked my bff to text him. She already knew about everything so she dmed him right away. I didn't know that she was really mad at him. She ended up being really rude. And she threatened to wack him in the nuts. She roasted him pretty badly. But, she didn't mean anything she said. 

Adam and I didn't talk for a few days. I later got dmed by a creep on Reddit who said he was having an erection bc he is thinking hard about me. As always, I ended up dming Adam without thinking twice. Anyways, I ended up dming Adam whenever a creep dmed me and along with that I sent him ss of the chats. This went on for a while. He also asked me to stop texting him during this time. 

Anyways I also dmed him about a creep who was 23. Along with that I sent Adam a ss of the post from which the creep found my user. And I regret sending him that ss. From that post, Adam started believing that I was suicidal. He also asked me to stop texting him. That day, I saw his Reddit post about me on my feed. The post was mostly made up. And I actually got really mad after reading the post. I ended up asking him about it. He said that he was really worried and didn’t know what to do since he thought I was suicidal. 

Adam and I started talking again for a few days. This was when things got really bad. His brother joined the discord server in which I was in and I don’t think that was a coincidence. Let’s call his brother Eddie. So, Eddie started asking advice on the discord server about Adam. I think Eddie probably knew I was in that server. Eddie later contacted me on my Reddit account where he asked to stop talking to Adam. So I told Adam that we should stop talking and I blocked him. 

A few days later, Adam got a panic attack. He got it for a variety of reasons. But, I was also one of the reason why he got the attack. His brother contacted me again on Reddit. He told me that Anthony wants to talk to me. I honestly didn’t want to start talking to Anthony again since I thought I’ll mess up again. But, I ended up unblocking him and we started talking again.

Yesterday, I blocked Anthony without giving him an explanation. But, I did dm his brother that I blocked Anthony. Idk why but Anthony thought my parents deleted my insta and that they found out about him. Anthony believes my parents are abusive even though they aren’t. He was going to call the cops. But, thankfully he contacted me on Reddit before calling the cops. And I told him why I blocked him. The reason why I blocked him was since I didn’t want to mess up. But, I ended up unblocking him since I think he still wanted to talk to me. His brother was also really mad at me when he saw my dm in which I told him that I blocked Anthony. Eddie told me that Anthony had a minor panic attack since he thought I was hurt.

Anyways, today Anthony blocked me. And I also blocked him. I also dmed him on Reddit saying “Thank you for blocking me.” Anthony asked me to not block him but I already blocked him before texting him. He later said he doesn’t care and that he’s going to go die. So, I ended up unblocking him. I got worried about him since his brother once mentioned that he was suicidal. After a few hours, I texted Anthony asking him if he was actually serious that he’ll go die. I know it was a stupid question. But, I wanted to make sure. Anthony was really pissed off when I texted him. And he texted me “fuck u” and his brother texted me “fucking insane bitch” earlier today. They both were honestly really rude to me. So, I reported his dm that said “fuck u.” Anyways he later asked me to never contact. I ended up blocking all of his accounts. 

I don’t understand him. Sometimes he wants to talk to me and other times he just hates me. Pls give me advice. I don’t want to mess up. 

TL;DR Basically, I’ve been talking to this boy who I’ve never met irl. I asked him out after only talking to him for a few days. The situation with him is really confusing. He repeatedly threatens to report me. He sometimes wants to talk to me and other times he just hates me. I blocked all of his accounts today. Idk what to do.",06May2020,1
1027,So I recently moved to a different state and school doesn’t really start until the next school year. But I’m going to be a senior at my new school and don’t know anyone there.

1030,"I've been a daily smoker for almost a year now, but my use during quarantine is becoming problematic. I don't consider myself addicted, but Im worried I may be on a slipperly slope. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life, and I feel that my pot use has become a crutch. I used to just smoke a few times a week, or after school,  but with quarantine, I spend most of the day high.  I don't want to quit smoking all together, but I want to have more control over how often I use it. How can I be a more responsible smoker without giving it up entirely?",06May2020,1
1031,"During quarantine, I often sit outside in the general areas of our apartment with my dog. There is a neighbor who also lives somewhere on the complex who seems to have targeted me for bullying. This is triggering me in ways that I have found enlightening and also dreadful.

When I'm alone in an area with my dog, she would come speak to me but only to ask me to move, making up a reason for why we aren't allowed there. My dog is a service dog and has been sanctioned to be allowed to accompany me everyone on the complex. We've also been greeted by various complex managers and staff while sitting in the same area that she would make up rules for where we don't belong. I somehow felt unsafe in mentioning this, for fear that she would bully me further. This has happened three times in the last month. The last incident happened at night time two nights ago, where I had the strangest feeling that she was going to physically attack me but didn't because there was a security camera right where I was sitting. Here's how that conversation went:

We were sitting on lawn furniture at night time in a deserted common area. She was walking her dog.

Bully: ""You know dogs aren't allowed on furniture. The last time I sat there, my clothing became covered with fur.""

Me: ""I'm sorry. I'll clean up her fur after her. We have lint rollers and lots of tape.""

Bully: ""You can't keep going about here like you own the complex.""

Me: ""I'm sorry, I'll clean up after her after we leave.""

Bully: \[clearly unsatisfied but unable to come up with another reason, leaves\]

She left me very disturbed and spooked. I kept looking behind me uncertain for fear that she would physically attack me.

When there are people around, she walks by ignoring me, talking on her earpod phone conversations, never in a good mood. (If I were like her, I would be interrupting her and telling her that this complex isn't her home, she should take her drama-filled phone calls in private. I'm afraid I might say something that may trigger the next time she singles me out when no one is around.)

To me, she looks like someone who just wants to take it out on targets like myself. Something is off about her and very menacing. For the most part, I try to avoid her when possible.

It's come to the point where whenever she walks by or when I spot her, she triggers a deep sense of dread where my heart lurches or my stomach sinks.

I don't know if I became an enabler for her the first time she approached us where she told us to leave and we left immediately, having no time and not in the mood for trouble or argument.",06May2020,1
1032,"So as a ""quick"" preface before this whole COVID thing started I had already decided to take time away from college. Previously I had been in a Mechanical Engineering program and switched after 3 or so years into Psych. I've done a semester in it and in either degree my grades haven't been fantastic. I made the decision to back out because of mental health and felt like I could do better. My heart really isn't into college at the moment. I'm planning to take a semester or a whole year to just take a break and work. I was thinking of going back to Psych but after talking it out it felt more right to go back to the engineering degree since I was pretty close to being finished. Personally I didn't like how the engineers I met operated, mostly how they treated other people, but I understand now I don't have to be like that. If they judge me for having sympathies with ""lesser"" degrees then I shouldn't care whether it be the professor or even my fellow students giving me dirty looks. I'm pretty sure now anyways.

I guess I really just want to know if that makes sense. I don't have a whole ""lot"" of debt after this many years. A couple thousand. So does it make sense? Should I just continue Psych when I go back? The reasoning is that I could just get back into engineering, find a job, and do a degree I want on the side after.",06May2020,1
1033,"So since the lockdowns began. I’ve been sleeping from 4am-3/4pm. I attend classes (the essential ones) and do school work. I live with my 2 other sisters whilst my mother is living with my stepfather. My sisters are 23/22 and I’m 18

My usual day to day basis is wake up at 2pm, wash my face etc. Get breakfast and do chores if I’m asked to do something. 

Today my sister barged into my room at 3pm and told me to get up, she then began shouting at me telling me that I do fuck all and I’m useless. I reluctantly woke up and spent time washing my face. One thing led to another and I found myself arguing with my sister, she exclaimed that I did no work and that I’m extremely disrespectful. She made multiple excuses most of them were bullshit but they mostly centred around my chosen sleep schedule and my preference to stay in my room most of the day. 

After doing a chore, I received a message from my mother telling me to “Answer the fucking phone” she basically rang me telling me to grow up, that I should be out working. I’m “Fucking horrible”. She went on to repeat the same things my sister was saying, that I do no work and that my sisters are always right because they go out to work (They work in retail). I have sent my mother screenshots of my schoolwork in the past for evidence but she didn’t tell my sisters anything, further increasing the arguments and threats made towards me. 

At this point, I lost it, I was always defending myself and I completely broke. I never swore in front of my mother but for the first time I just told her to “Fucking say something to them, I do fucking schoolwork and I will wake up when I fucking want to” she was absolutely horrified, telling me that I was extremely disrespectful and that I shouldn’t swear towards her. She then threatened me by saying she was coming home and was going to fucking do something. I just hung up and began crying because I felt alone and I didn’t want to be part of my family. I still feel that right now and it’s been 8 hours since. 

I just wanna know am I in the wrong?. I just feel like I’ve no one to help me and it’s crushing me, I just got over my depression a week ago and now i don’t know what to do",06May2020,1
1034,"So before I start I understand how fucking stupid what I've done and I honestly haven't forgiven myself what I did because it is so out of character for me.

Recently I ended up signing up to OnlyFans. One night I was drinking with my friends over video call and got  drunk. Anyways I got a message on twitter from someone who had a lot of followers. I thought it was weird because I don't use Twitter that much but she sent me a message asking me to sign up to her OnlyFans straight out the gate.

It was a little weird and I started questioning what OnlyFans was as I wasn't too sure what it was. She explained what it was and insured that it's safe and everything.

So subscribed to this girl and many others (still don't even know why). The next morning I woke up and found out I had spent $200 on this fucking shit. I quickly unsubscribed from everything and deleted my account.

I tried to get my money back but I can't still trying to sort it out. 

I'm so fucking frustrated and angry. I haven't been easy on myself at all as I haven't slept in days and I've been physically hurting myself because of what happened. I just feel so fucking embrassed I really don't know what to do and that's all I can think about how much of an idiot I am.",06May2020,1
1036,"I have seen this exact same job posting every time I look for jobs online. 
Last night I had a dream that I applied to the job and it went so amazingly well and I got along with the people.
Today, I decided to apply. After I handed the application to the guy, he informed me that many have applied for this position, but no one has ever shown up for the interview. 

I feel like there is a reason I always see it, had the dream and he said that to me. I feel as if this job would be good, but I'm also scared.

1037,My wife and I just found out her mom is an anti-vaxxer and my wife was never vaccinated.  My wife is currently pregnant with our first child and we are both extreme believers in science and technology.  We try to get most of our information from reputable sources and read scientific studies typically posted from .edu sites to ensure the best scientific journals and information.  We are absolutely going to vaccinate our children.  However considering my wife is pregnant and hasn’t been vaccinated we were wondering what/if any of the vaccines she can and should get immediately also which ones should she get after giving birth.  We also would like to know if it’s better to get her fully vaccinated after she gives birth.

1039,"I (23F) was really drunk at a party and I think I got taken advantage of by another girl around my age but I’m not sure. We’d been friends for a while and she told me she had liked me as more than a friend or whatever, but I didn’t feel the same way she did so I told her that. One time we got really drunk and we like hooked up. I don’t really remember how it happened, as I had blacked out. We didn’t even talk about it afterwards because it was just so odd, especially for me. I had never been with a girl before, I mostly only noticed girls in a platonic way. Maybe I felt ashamed, I don’t really know. I didn’t remember anything, just waking up in her bed the next day and a few moments when the hook up was actually happening, but mostly a blur. What I do remember seemed to feel good, but once I was conscious I felt weird and kind of gross. I would just much rather do things like that conscious, ya know? 
Anyway, I asked some people what they thought about the whole situation and I mostly got answers like “when girls hook up, it doesn’t count” so idk. I know it’s technically wrong, but like what if I was the one who initiated it or something? Like I just don’t understand why the situation weirds me out so badly. I don’t want to go after anyone or anything, nobody would probably believe me anyway, but I’m just trying to gain some sense out of it. I also get really paranoid now about people trying to take advantage of me or hurt me. 

Also (and I don’t really know if this relates but it seems like an important piece of information) but I had been raped by a guy about a few months before this situation. I heard that it’s more likely to be raped again when you’ve already been raped once (I’m guessing it happens when you don’t process your trauma correctly which is something I did not do). This situation just hurt me a bit more because I really thought I could trust this girl, she was a close friend of mine whereas I was not close to the other person at all. It was a guy I had a crush on, but we were not close in any way. 

Please let me know what you think and if I should just forget the whole thing altogether. That’s what I’d really like to do, but for now I’m going to try to figure it out. I don’t know how to even process all of this stuff but I’d appreciate any advice. Thank you.",06May2020,1

We instantly clicked and became friends. I thought we had a really good connection. we spoke every day and were getting to know each other. 

I made it pretty clear that I have a significant other, and things are serious... Proposal serious. So I thought everything between us was platonic.   

One day they mentioned how our relationship was inappropriate. You could instantly feel tension in the room. Things have been awkward ever since. 

They've denied ever attempt I've tried to make to fix things between us. I eventually gave up reaching out. It's been about a month without speaking now. 

Thing is, when COVID-19 and quarantine ends, we'll be seeing a lot of each other in real life again. we're going to have to face each other soon. I don't want it to be awkward and I just want your opinions.

this month, she finishes university, and because of everything thats going down right now i wont see her before then, and my track record of keeping n contact with people is not great, i want to tell her how i feel BUT dont want to end our friendship, i have no doubt in my mind that she dosent feel the same way about me.

my freinds all figured out my crush independently and all think that she might like me back but all three of them are giving me conflicting advice, one believes i should tell her because in his mind theirs no way it could go wrong, hes shipping us hard so i think his judgement is a bit clouded, my other friend, airs on the side of caution and says not to tell her since i know she has a boyfriend, whilst my last friend and her best friend keeps telling me that i should hold off telling her but at the same tme wants me to tell her.

He said he’s been busy (which I’m sure he is bcuz he works with his family a lot) and recently he’s been ghosting me too fucking much. He barely even plays video games with me anymore bcuz hes busy. I just hate how he always fucking ghosts me 70% of the time I message him which is a lot each day. I feel like the spark is just gone in our friendship.
