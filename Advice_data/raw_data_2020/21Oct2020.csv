1,"So I'm a student, and made the pretty poor descision of getting a shared house with, among others, a couple that got together that year. Let's call him K and her M.

Fast forward to now and everything's been fine so far. However, K is often hugging/kissing M in public, and when it's in front of the group it clearly makes her uncomfortable. 

A lot of the people in the house are pretty introverted, and so they don't get drunk that often, but about a week ago we had a small party of sorts, drinks, games, etc, everyone joined in and we had a good time. M and another member of our house, H, both had their first time getting really drunk, so K and I babysat them, but everything was OK.

Post drinking, M and H have rapidly become much closer friends. I can tell that while this makes K uncomfortable, he is not the most socially adept and won't be able to sort the situation out by himself.

Here's the fun part: We go into a 3 week covid lockdown on friday.

Over the last 2 or 3 days things have become progressively more awkward. M is always pleased to see H, and while there was a sort of 3-man-mini-gang thing we had, now I feel like its just them (idm, I have enough other friends and am quite introverted myself). It's been things like the two of them staying up late into the evening, with K telling them they should probably go to bed, and struggling to get involved.

I'm worried for K, he is pretty inept but he's a genuine guy and a good friend. H and M are both great people as well I think, and I don't even know if they're heading towards a relationship or just a healthy friendship, but it's clear they make K uncomfortable.

I'm terrified that they're gonna split and I'm gonna be in a house with a failed relationship. They'd probably handle it fairly sensibly, but it's not something I wanna have to deal with. Any advice that can help me at all is appreciated!",21Oct2020,1
2,"I am currently in my fourth year (junior standing II) and majoring in sociology. I have been telling myself that whether or not I want to go to graduate school/law school that I would take a year off in-between. Today, I think I have decided to go to law school. So for those who are in law school or went to law school, what is the process? I know there's the LSAT, but when should I take it? (I'm graduating Fall 2021). Should I get a tutor? And, also, do you have any additional or information on law school.",21Oct2020,1

4,"So here's the sitch: If the cards fall just right, I will own my own home by summer or fall of next year. I'm really excited, but I also need to be thinking about my safety, because I will be a woman living alone and out in the country. I plan on buying a gun, and I'm also seriously thinking about getting a dog too. 

I grew up with cats, and I own one cat now; I have no experience caring for a dog. I think I would prefer some kind of medium-sized dog, to reduce the cost of care, but still big enough to be more intimidating to potential aggressors who might come around. Do y'all have any advice on picking a dog breed that will be (relatively) easy to care for, since I'm a newbie? Also, should I adopt a puppy or an older dog?

And how should I go about adopting a dog when I already have a cat? I've had him since he was an adolescent, and as long as I've had him I don't think he's ever met a dog. Before that, and I have no idea. He's skittish about some things, like loud noises, but other than that he's a true farm cat. He lives outside and hunts, so if I get a dog they will be meeting, it's not like I can keep one inside and the other outside so that they never really see each other. I of course want them to get along, because I don't want my boy running off or potentially even hurting the dog, or vice versa.

Any advice would be much appreciated.",21Oct2020,1
5,"So long story, i really liked this girl in middle school and i once she called me cute, which i didnt get because i weighed almost 340 pounds at 6'3 so i looked absolutaly terrible. Fast forward 4 years were both seniors but i left for an all boys school, so i havent seen her in like 3 years or so. Apparently she saw a picture of me and i lost almost 70 pounds and grew to 6'6 so i look pretty good and athletic. She told one of my friends that i was very attractive and by a coincidence we ending up meeting her and her friends out for dinner. They ended up hanging out with us all night. I drove a group of us like 40 minutes to a cool ""haunted"" cemetary but thats besides the point. The next day she told my friend that shes so happy i came and that im super nice. Then i snapped for a bit, she talked amd seemed interested then left me on read. Then snapped me back like 4 hours later, we just snapped random pictures then she said wish me luck cause she had a soccer game, i said good luck and stay warm. Then after her game she left me on open again. I dont get it, does she not mean what she told my friend, or am i overthinking it alot.",21Oct2020,1
6,"I tried to overdose recently, and called out the same day to hug my toilet so I could purge my stomach. Fast forward to this week, my very compassionate and keen eyed manager noticed that I've been a lot more soft spoken and in general sad, now she's wondering what's wrong and is worried about me, so much so that she's asked me two days in a row. 

She's offered her shoulder to lean on, and while I'd like to talk to someone about it, I don't know if my boss is the best person to open up to, no matter how compassionate she is, especially when I'm up to get a promotion soon.",21Oct2020,1
7,"Context: I to college. Saw a girl. Thought she was pretty. Then realized out she was pretty intelligent. Shared some classes but they contained over 300+ students. 

Tried to introduce myself in a completely attempt when I passed by her while noticing her by chance while she was in a computer lab. Some short time later, overheard her and some other folks talk about the incident and how odd it was, given there’s so many people in the class. 

Decided to never speak to her again thinking I’d never run into her as college went on. But as luck would shave it we ended up being in the same major graduating in the same year and the major graduating glass had like probably less than 50 students to it? Never found out if she remembered me and never reached out to her.

Still heard about her through gossip though. Someone I thought was smart turned out to be pretty motivated and successful, getting an internship and working on a cool successful science project. Ended up Facebook stalking her at times learning she was into swing or jazz, and given the small class size, can still tell she seemed friendly when interacting with other classmates.

Graduated and Facebook stalking shortly stopped a few months after graduation. Still I learned she went to grad school. However she did have a YouTube presentation on advice on time blocking, aka how to manage your time properly which I found out about and saved years ago.

Cut to over 5 years later. I have no idea what she is up to now.

But I’m currently struggling with time management (and a bunch of other stuff. Bipolar, socially awkward, overly anxious, though I’ve always had those thing, just in downward spiral at the moment). Decided to go back and rewatch the video I saved off to remind myself of those tips during her presentation all those years ago. And that led me to writing this post.

My question is did I cross a line with how I handled that relationship? If I did, how do I forgive myself? What do I do with these lingering feelings of anxiety in terms of how I handled this lack of relationship with this girl?",21Oct2020,1
8," When the pandemic began, my wife and I had jobs since then we were cut hours but still working peacefully then we both get laid off and of course we fell behind on our car payments. Now up to the present day we were doing good for a while living in a motel and still able to use our car, everything was good till her parents found out where we were staying, just as we thought we finally got out of their grasp,  they found us (via tracking).
   They do not like me, they dont want me with their daughter  so we led them  to think I'm not with her and they bought it.. back to the car they found her recently and basically told her to give her the info so they can repo the car and push the blame on me she told them no they dropped it then, until today they got the info today not via my wife and had our car repo'd

9,"Hey everyone, 

on Sunday I was pretty drunk. I was drinking a redbull as my chaser and the can tab fell into the drink since I was playing with it. I thought it was whatever and kept drinking the red bull. I took it with me on a drive with my friends and left it in my car. Ended up going home later that night and woke up hungover but managed to get myself to work. I noticed the can in my car and shook it, but there was no tab inside of the can. I looked inside hoping I’d find it in there but nothing. I don’t remember emptying the can or swallowing anything, I think I would at the very least have felt it go down if I swallowed it?? I have some pretty severe anxiety and tried to take my families advice that it will just pass if I did indeed swallow it but I haven’t been able to calm down. Do I go to the ER/urgent care and tell them I might have done this but I don’t know? Do I call my PCP? Should I just relax cause this isn’t a big deal at all?",21Oct2020,1
10,"Hi all,

To begin, I’m not a “depressed” person. I normally am very upbeat and happy. I (thankfully) have no major issues that I deal with in my life. But I do have a problem.
Come winter time/when daylight savings ends, I do become seasonally “depressed” if I don’t get enough sun light, it alters my mood drastically. I hate the dark and I hate the cold, and I dread winter for the sake of my mental health. For example, I live in the eastern time zone and it gets dark around 6:30 right now. I get home from work at 5:30, shower, then 9 times out of 10 usually crawl right into bed because the suns already down. Half the time I don’t even feel like making myself dinner. I lack so much motivation and energy when it is not warm and the sun isn’t shining for 12 hours a day. 
What can I do to combat this seasonal sadness? I don’t want to live like this all winter long or ever again, but I have not found a good method to help cope.
Thanks in advance",21Oct2020,1

13,"Alright, so here's the deal;

My older 35 year old brother / room mate owned this bike, is was a fancy carbon fibre frame mountain bike worth around $5,000, he's owned it for 7 years, has never riden/used it, it's been furniture the entire time.

He received this bike as a result of the theft of his previous bike from our at the time second floor apartment balcony through our insurance, which was also worth about $5,000 (which also had never been used after 3 years of owning it).

His bike was stolen off the balcony (4th floor this time) again, in both cases he refused to secure the bike with a lock or tarp/cover it, instead his argument was that the bike should be stored in the apartment living room, which floor space is at a luxury being a smaller apartment.  I suggested if we wanted to store the bike inside, he could store it in his room, but he didn't see that as a reasonable request.

The bike is again being covered under insurance (somehow), but granted he's going to lose the $1000 difference on the deductible whether he replaces it or not.

My question being, **I don't feel responsible for his decisions that led up to the bike being stolen (again), particularly about refusing to allow it to be stored in the shared living room if he wanted it inside, instead of in his room, but should I feel responsible?** Was it inconsiderate of me to insist it went on the balcony or in his room? (My bike is/was also on the balcony during both thefts, I've had it for 11 years, but it's your run of the mill $150 mountain bike).

I'd appreciate any insight, we've (I've) been dealing with the insurance company getting it all panned out and covered, but my brother has been trying to lay the guilt trip on thick that the whole situation is my fault.  Thanks!",21Oct2020,1
14,"i broke up w my bf of 9+ months about 2 months ago-the first guy i think ive actually ever loved. we’re both really young so everyone (friends, family, etc.) keeps telling me i need to move on and that i will find someone again, but even when i think i’m getting close and doing good for a few days barely having him even cross my mind, suddenly i’ll get a memory of us or him and i’ll go right back to being depressed over him. we weren’t together for very long but we always talked about a future. a realistic one, too. he had broken up w me once and didn’t last longer than a day before coming back, apologizing and asking for another chance. i thought he’d do that this time, too, but ig he didn’t bc i was the one to end things and we had been bad for a month (constantly fighting and since we worked together, too, that only made things worse) instead of just a week like before. now, two months later, we haven’t spoken since the end of september when i told him i still loved him and missed him (and then got in a fight about work before he told me how he felt), and i haven’t seen him since then, either, bc i got a new job (not bc of him). idk why i can’t get over him. we were so beyond happy together for those 8 months until something changed and we couldn’t figure it out and i felt like i had to walk away bc i wasn’t happy. he has me blocked on all social media, and i’m sure he blocked my number now, too, since the only reason he hadn’t blocked that as well was for work but seeing as we no longer work together there’s no real reason he should have to contact me. i miss him. but i’ve already expressed those feelings and never got the kind of response i was hoping for. all ik is he hasn’t talked to any girls since we broke up, and mutual friends of ours seem to think he won’t for awhile. ig i’m just looking for help as to why i can’t move on and how i can. i don’t want to, but there’s no point in dwelling on him if he won’t come back.",21Oct2020,1

16,"I just broke off a relationship of 1.5 years for reasons I'd like to keep undisclosed. We both agreed its both our faults and we're not on awful terms even though things have ended, though it still upsets me that things turned out this way when I just poured so much time into us hoping that we would go far. I always stayed up late for him no matter how much work I had, and we spent more time with each other than anyone else. . . just so that a year later, we're both completely exhausted with each other.

I guess I'm just frustrated every time a relationship I put so much effort into turns out to be a waste of time. They say never regret relationships because you learn, but my last relationship from when I was 15 to 18 ended in the same way :/ so why did it take me so long to learn these things about myself/the partners I pick? Why did I ruin what could have been just fine friendships and miss opportunities with other potential partners?

17,"*note that all of this interaction was over snapchat

So he seemed kind of distant yesterday and that’s usually a good indicator that something is up with him. I ask about it and he starts sounding like he wants to break up. I try to get a solid yes or no from him, but he keeps going back and forth. He feels bad because I get anxiety about him sometimes, but it’s nothing he can control. Also my grades have dropped slightly since we started dating, but he was a correlation to that, not a causation. At this point I’m falling apart and so I ask something along the lines of, “Do you want to make this work? Are you willing to put in the work to make it work?” He said yes so I was all so then we stay together. And he agreed. This all took like ten minutes and I almost had a panic attack. And so now I start my whole going numb thing where all feelings are just cut off. Then he drops two more things one me. He lied about wanting to do something with me, which if he had told me this on its own I probably wouldn’t have cared really, but on top of the almost break up it felt like a punch to the gut. Then he says that two weeks in he felt feelings for another girl. And I was all that was two weeks in, I get having a passing emotion or two. But then he said it happened again a month in. And that he felt the same way toward her that he did toward me. And he said he loved me, so he loved her too. Nothing happened between them but he’s now telling me a month later. Turns out the girl was a serious ex. I knew of her but didn’t realize this was her. I knew she had depression and that he sometimes talked to her to help her out, and I was cool with that. But now it’s idk. I feel numb. Logically I understand that people can catch old feelings. Logically I get that nothing life-altering really happened. But emotionally I can feel the hurt through my normal defense of going numb. Like I’m glad he managed to tell me instead of covering it up because I never would have known. It’s just am I overreacting? Is it normal to feel this way? My head and my feelings aren’t matching up and I just want what we had back but idk if it’s possible seeing as he destroyed me  and managed to hit almost every anxiety I’ve ever had about our relationship.

19,"Hi! So (I promise this matters) I am a white girl particularly of German and Swedish descent, however my family has lived in America for two generations and I am the third generation. The popular American tradition of a sweet 16 is something I have often thought about, especially since I turned 14 about two years ago. I am now 15 and have my party all planned out— however, the problem is my dress.

I am planning to wear my dress with a hoop skirt because I’m barley 5 feet tall and I wouldn’t be able to walk otherwise. The hoop skirt makes my dress larger, but not nearly as large as a quinceanera gown. Quince gowns are beautiful, but I cannot wear anything similar as I have been told it’s offensive. I’m really concerned about the size of my dress. It’s a very basic $90 gown from Dillards— it’s a ball gown with no corset or even stays, and the whole thing is a cream satin. I wish I could attach a photo but I don’t know how. I’m so worried I’m going to offend someone as most of my friends are Hispanic. The ones I’ve asked said they don’t mind and they like it, but I’m so worried I’ll get made fun of on social media or hurt somebody’s feelings. Should I not wear the gown? I’m not trying to be mean and I really don’t want to hurt anybody. I just want to enjoy my party in a way that everyone I’ve invited can enjoy too, but my anxiety about it is really getting in the way of that...

22,"I need some overall advice of how to get over my feelings. Basically I moved in with a close friend of mine back in August, and ever since I have moved in I feel further and further apart from her. I feel like I'm annoying her with either my habits, or just talking to her. She never talks to me or asks me how I am and when I ask her she literally sounds so uninterested and bothered. I thought maybe it was because of my bad habits (I will admit I'm not the greatest with my dishes, she isn't either, but we're on opposite sides of the spectrum when we keep up with our messes) i watch the same things over and over and always have my tv on in my room (at a quiet level for the most part but it's a coping mechanism for my anxiety), and that's all I can think of? I've moved things around in the apartment and she puts them back to where they were before (which is totally totally fine since she's been in the same place for longer than me) but I just don't know what to do or feel anymore. This is what I'm most annoyed and concerned about; her boyfriend is here every single day and night. Even when SHES not home, at work, he's here, in her room, and it annoys the living hell out of me. So back in late August I got COVID and we all had to quarantine, and shortly after he brought up that he's appreciative of me being so cool he was around all the time and that if I wanted help let him know. I said 'no worries!' because we all HAD to stay here, BUT I did not think that it meant he was going to continue to stay here after that fact. So finally, less than a week ago I brought it up to both him and my roommate, and I said I would like for him to either pay for one of our bills himself, or at least part of one. He got defensive, by 1st off stating that it was a month ago he asked me if I wanted him to help out (was not a month ago since I've been feeling like this for over a month) and its been around 2 months now. Then he started going in to say that he still has to pay $600 for rent at his place, and a $75 electric bill, and i quote ""not use my mental health as an excuse but, i fucking hate my roommate and i can't be home"" and then he got mad and left the room. My roommate said she would just pay the bill, and that's not what I meant (he makes more than her, not by much but more than her) and I highlighted that I know he can chip in, and he should if he is going to stay here and basically be a third roommate. We pay $1400 plus wifi and electric a month and he hasn't chipped in once. I am trying to not bag on financial reasons but they combined total up to I swear $300 between weed, alcohol, and ordering food. (also want to highlight I'm not tripping on her money because she also pays to live here) So I just don't understand why he got so mad. But then it got worse, because I heard him slightly talking about me, and shouting ""for fuck sakes"" and saying something along the lines of me being entitled and controlling (which i mean yeah i am being so) and to conclude it he decided to stomp obnoxiously loud to the kitchen, slam things around a bit, stomp back to his gf's room, and SLAMMED the door shut, making me so uncomfortable in my own place. And proceeded to bang the headboard against the wall  (we share a wall) fast and repeatedly and when she asked him to stop he went ""how am i gonna annoy her then?"" and it was just super annoying. the next day, nothing is said by my roommate or him about the incident, but he tried to be a little nicer to me (which is bullshit imo). And now I'm slightly concerned that maybe my roommate is liking me even less bc I don't agree with how he and her handled the situation (more on him not her), and I do also need to ask this, is it OK that I changed my mind about him helping out? Like I said at the time I said no worries I didn't know he would basically be living here. Is it ok that I changed my mind? Do I have the right to do that? I need advice, I also just am so bummed and sad that once one of my closest friends honestly doesn't really care about me anymore..(I've tried talking to her about us hanging out more, and she says why since she doesn't go anywhere so) maybe she does but I just don't know anymore, also so sorry for this being so long I partially just NEEDED to vent and because I can't do it when they're at home (like over the phone or something) this is my best bet",21Oct2020,1
23,"I’ll be as brief as I can be.

A few weeks (almost exactly a month) ago I broke up with my then GF of well over one and a half year. We went out separate ways as friends, and still get along well. Last weekend was the first time we met up, and she visited me. Things went a-okay. We are on great terms all things considered. 
When we broke up, we kind of joked about it, and one sentence of her’s in particular stuck with me: “just don’t get a new girlfriend in... let’s say at least two months” after which we both giggled and I said that would not likely happen as I’m not very socially active with this pandemic going on. 

Here’s the thing: I’ve gotten in contact with an old girlfriend from school after not seeing each other for a long time. We have always been good friends, just with some time in between talking and all that. We used to have a thing but it was still early in our youth, so nothing serious or anything. However, I’m fairly sure she fancies me, as she has said she still gets nervous when meeting up with me and regularly messages and facetimes me. And to be honest, I have always fancied her quite a bit as well. We have a lot in common regarding how we see the world and we get along great. 

However, now that we are actually messaging more and more, and she has invited me over on sunday, I feel this weird gut feeling. On the one hand I feel like I should just see where this leads, because I wouldn’t mind the company at all, and especially with her. However on the other hand I feel kind of guilty for moving on “too fast?”

I’m not sure what to do, and I could really use other people’s experiences and advice. I don’t want to hurt either of the ladies, but ultimately, I’d like to be happy. I’ll try to answer any further questions anyone might have, I’m an open book. I just want advice. Thank you in advance.",21Oct2020,1

We had discussed in the past about me being on a food diet if not being on birth control. She then responded with a serious expression, no laugh ""On a sex diet?"" I felt how that comment stung and it left me to clarify what I actually meant. Both the workers in the room with her looked uneasy. After getting home and thinking about it, that comment left me feeling pretty upset. I know I have not had sex in a long time, but I felt the comment was way out of line and incredibly inappropriate.

Since the pandemic started my life has started to crumble slowly. My grandmother survived cancer for the last two years and I got the very sad news that she passed. I wasn't able to see her since she lives in South America and my parents live in Africa. That same week my best friends grandpa passed due to Covid. I was more sad due to the fact that I couldn't be with my dad and give him a hug and tell him, ""everything is going to be okay,"" This took a toll on my mental health for a bit. School bills started pilling up and I have no idea how I am going to be able to pay for them. I was wondering if anyone knows where I could get a scholarship. Remember that international students can't get FASFA or whatever that is called lol. Just asking if anyone knows private scholarship places or banks that give private loans. 

I have also started doing some art. That has helped with the hard times. If anyone would like to see my art pieces, fill free to shoot me a DM.

I'm still looking for work, but even thinking about it makes me very depressed. I have the option to either look for work, or sign on to something that puts me into the ""not fit for work"" category. What should I do? The last thing i would want to do is be viewed as lazy, or like I'm being a financial burden from people. 

Thank you for any advice!",21Oct2020,1
28,"Early 2017, I hit a dark phase in my life. I had just come out of an emotionally abusive relationship a few months prior. But I ended up doing something really bad. I locked myself in my room at university for just over 3 weeks. I ran out of food and the last two days I started eating salt and I was beginning to think I had people in my head telling me what to do. I self harmed a bit too due to this. I was being controlled by a shadowy figure. I could not see his face, he wore a black hood. Kind of like death, but he was in charge of the emotional situations in my life. And will try to force me to change things for the benefit of myself. 

When I finally knew it was time to get some help I told a counsellor. He spoke with numerous professionals about what it could be... schizophrenia? No, Autism, no any form of psychosis? No. It just bowed down to having a very creative mind which I have always had. 

With my creative projects I have a big attention to detail. But what really intrigues me is what I can do in public. I am extremely and unusually observant. Doctors have noticed this from a young age but can’t pin anything to it, just said I was very smart. But I feel like there’s something that’s not right about my head. 

E.g. if I am at a bar with friends, I can listen to my friend’s conversation and listen to a strangers conversation on another table without focusing.. I could tell you how many ice cubes the guy in the blue shirt, standing at the bar had in his glass and the eye colour of the girl in the red dress that walked by at 10:34pm. My spacial awareness is very high and it is quite annoying as I find myself listening to conversations or automatically finding out something I don’t want to know at times. 

Recently I hit another depressive episode. I did not lock myself in my room this time, but now I am having very vivid dreams and night terrors. My dreams turn out to be connected in one way or another. Like it’s an ongoing story. But when I am nodding off to sleep, I can sometimes hear sounds and voices. E.g. I once heated the sound that sonic makes when he jumps on a trampoline, and the other night I heard a girl say my name. It creeps me out. My dreams also contain death. The guy who I felt like was talking in my head. My dreams show him stood over me when I’m sleeping or death with his scythe in a field of wheat. It’s very strange.",21Oct2020,1
29,"Hi Reddit! I’m on mobile so apologies for any formatting issues. TLDR at the end. 

My (30) grandma (95) is being cared for by my family in the Philippines. My family there is very poor and expect handouts from my grandma, myself, and my sister because we live/lived in a first world country. They believe that since we live in a first world country, we should be sending money back home for them. These are my aunts and uncles who don’t work and just rely on my grandma’s pension, and occasionally my sister and I, to survive. 

I used to care for my grandma but it was very difficult as I work and my grandma needs help to even walk to the washroom. It eventually became too much for me so my family in the Philippines started taking care of her. 

Recently there was an issue with my grandmas bank account and, long story short, pension money can’t be sent to my family any longer unless my grandma goes to the bank in person to resolve the issue. The bank is in Canada. Now my family is pushing for my grandma to travel to Canada to sort it out, but I don’t see how a weak and frail 95 year old travel from the Philippines to Canada during a pandemic to sort out banking details because grown adults simply rely on her for money. 

I want to visit my grandma and stay with her as long as I can as I know she doesn’t have a lot of time left, being so old. My plan was to rent a condo for a few months for her and I. I’m worried about a few things:
1. My family will expect me to support them since my grandma’s pension isn’t being split. They’ve already asked my sister for money to cover their bills. 
2. If don’t I help them, they’ll be angry and when I have to come back to Canada and give my grandma back to them, they might stress her out even more about money. 
3. They will expect me to bring my grandma back to Canada to sort out the bank issue so they can get their money.

Redditors, what would you guys do or say to my family in this situation?

TLDR; I want to to visit my grandma in Philippines but my family caring for her will expect me to give them money. I don’t feel comfortable saying a flat out no because I’m scared they’ll take out their frustrations on my grandma. What would you do?",21Oct2020,1

I know I had a problem holding my poop as a kid so maybe this is why. Also I have a lot of gas I don’t know if pooping regularly would help this or if it’s a sign of something. It’s just really frustrating because I really want to be able to poop every day at the same time",21Oct2020,1
33,"  So when I was in high school I dated a boy down my street for all of my junior year and half of my senior year. Almost every night we’d meet up at our little spot down the street and would just talk for hours. He was the easiest person to talk to, I’ve told him things I still to this day haven’t shared with anyone else. He wasn’t like anyone I’ve ever met-I’ve dated plenty of guys before and after him but none of them were ever on the same level. I wanted to marry this man and have his babies but I had fucked everything up.
Towards the end of our relationship my home life was falling apart. My mom and stepdad were on the brink of divorce so I had to pretty much be both parents to my three little siblings and on top of all of this I had very low self esteem and would question my boyfriend ALL the time over the littlest dumb bullshit (like him having friends that were girls, or what friend’s house he’s going to and what they’re going to do). He never gave me any reason to question him- I was just a toxic insecure teenager at the time who wanted him all to myself. After weeks of fighting he was tired of never feeling like he was good enough and broke up with me after his birthday. We cried together during, he held me and said that he didn’t want this either. This left me beyond devastated. I was IN LOVE with this boy, he was my best friend and my first love and now he’s gone. 
  The first three months of the breakup were the hardest, I sobbed almost every hour of day, and I couldn’t eat. It felt as if I was mourning an actual death. Later down the road I tried to cope by having flings and one night stands- even a two week “relationship” in hopes of moving on...but it only made me miss him more. 

A year after high school I met a guy at my work who I actually kind of like, and eight months into dating I got pregnant. My baby daddy (we’ll call him Jeff) was a genuinely nice guy but as my pregnancy progressed Jeff became impatient and mean which  quickly evolved into severe verbal and emotional abuse. 
Jeff didn’t help out one bit when our daughter was born (surprise!) he would barely even hold our baby when he was home and if he want home he’d be at work or would be drinking and smoking with his buddies until early morning hours with his coworkers. When our daughter was around eight months old, I left the relationship, or at least tried to. He physically wouldn’t leave our apartment. Jeff just completely refused to accept that I wanted our relationship to be over and he later convinced me that he would change and give me the help and support that I needed. I believed him so I went back.
 Down the road we were surprised with a second pregnancy. This time around Jeff is even more abusive and has even gotten physical with me. One night when I was around six months pregnant we got into this huge fight where he strangled me and kicked my stomach. After the fight, he sobbed and told me that he was sorry. I was in a place where I believed that this was the love I deserved, so again I stayed in the relationship and even married the bastard months later thinking that this would be the only way he’d ever really respect me (he would tell me this weekly). 

Now a year into the marriage, I am utterly repulsed by my husband- we haven’t had sex in months (we didn’t even have sex on our wedding night). He’s still as abusive as ever, he constantly disrespects me in front of our daughters, and will be embarrassing af by cursing or yelling at me in public. I’m done. I want out. I need out. If not for me, then my daughters.
I’ve gradually been spending more and more time away from Jeff and am finally gaining a sense of self love for the first time in years. Now I finally believe that I deserve the love that I want. 
 I finally got the courage to tell my family about Jeff’s abuse one day after he had pushed me so hard that I flew across the hallway and landed on our youngest daughter. My family is being nothing but supportive of my daughters and I and are creating an exit strategy. My main goal right now is to focus on my daughters and to become an independent woman who don’t need no man.

Still..

It’s been eight years since I’ve seen or even spoken to my hs ex, but I’ve thought about him every.single.day since the break up. 
I always think about what life would have been like if I never pushed him away or what if he had stayed.
I miss him. 
I miss everything about him. I miss his laugh, his sweet love. I miss singing with him and dancing around his room to cheesy music from 2007.
I really wished it was him.
Both moments when my daughters were born, I thought of him... 
The whole day of my wedding I thought about him...
God, I really wished that it was him.

In conclusion: I need to work on myself and strive to be the best mother I can be. I want to go to therapy and learn what it means to be in a healthy, functioning relationship and how to recover from an abusive one. Whenever I’m ready, I would like to (like in a cheesy rom-com) get a coffee with my old hs ex? Haha idk I would like to think that if we were to try out our relationship as mature adults it would be way more promising than before but again, idk. I feel like I would be unappealing due to my baggage. Has anyone been in this situation before?",21Oct2020,1

40,"I met this girl on Instagram back right before COVID hit. She was in the process of getting a donor match for a new kidney. I wanted to hear her story and so I set up a time to talk. We hit it off kind of quickly. She had some medical issues going into the transplant but the transplant was going to be very necessary. She and I continued to FaceTime and talk pretty often even going into long text threads of support for each other. We had FaceTimed for like 6 hours one time and that spark was there. We have all these weird things in common with each other and on top of that she’s beautiful (in my opinion) even though she looks sick as a dog. Post transplant, she’s been in and out of the hospital even more now and frequently forgets we were supposed to FaceTime. Ghosts me for a month or something crazy like that. She even still comments or likes my content on social media without a text or call back. I finally stood up for myself and said that she’s gotta do better when it comes to commitments to FaceTime and she just said she was going through a breakup and her medical issues aren’t an excuse and she’s sorry. I thought things would be fixed. We FaceTime for another 5 or 6 hours and then back to that month-long ghosting. Recently I went off again after 4 texts and no reply but she was still liking and commenting. I just spilled the beans about my feelings. I said that I don’t need a relationship but I just want more commitment. She took 3 days to respond and was super vague not even mentioning her feelings towards me. Only apologizing for not noticing my romantic feelings, not catching up with her, and that she admits we had a spark. I follow up after a week of waiting to just asking for even more clarity. Don’t waste my time. I’m sick of comparing women I date here at home to her when she’s been stringing me along like this but this spark really doesn’t come close at all to the girls I date here.

It's the easy way out and even though people try to make taking the easy way out sound like a bad thing to do, it honestly feels so tempting right now that I just don't care. This isn't a suicide note btw. I'm not actually going to do it, I'm just feeling really low right now. My life sucks and I've been trying not to self deprecate but I'm a pretty useless person. My childhood was fine. I was poor but blissfully unaware of my family's hardships so it didn't affect me much, but all of middle school and high school have been so hard. 

I feel like I've been stagnant for the last 7 years. I suck socially, I suck academically, and I even suck so bad at video games despite using it as an escape and playing all day long. I'm literally not good at anything. I go to school, do homework, and play games or use other forms of entertainment to pass the time. Distractions I use to keep me from just wallowing in pity. I've never had a job despite being 18 and just entering college(other than babysitting for a family friends). It's not that I haven't tried to improve myself. I tried practicing improving my social skill. I watched a bunch of videos, research a bunch of stuff, and joined a bunch of subreddits. I used my babysitting money to buy a pc, research a bunch of gaming tips, joined subreddits, youtube video after video, bought kovaaks, and all the other shit. No matter how much I try in anything nothing changes. No improvements nothing.

The worst part is feeling like shit despite being better off than most people. I have 2 parents who aren't divorced and two really supportive sisters who I love soooooo much. Why isn't that enough? Like I know in my head that I don't actually want to die, but I'm just seriously not happy. 7 years of my life just down the drain with nothing to show but hours of just feeling like shit. As I type this I want to think that maybe in the next 7 years when things actually do get better that I'll look bad and laugh at these thoughts and this post but I just can't see things getting better for me honestly. Especially now that I'm in college and I actually have to make something of myself and idk what to do. I can't see myself succeeding in college ( I go to a community college while my sister both left the state to go to really good colleges. Grinnell and Stanford) or at anything quite frankly.

At first glance to me it seems like i should be very compatible with school but im not, I always dread doing school work and at this point i'm no longer doing it for myself, i'm doing it because my parents want me to and so does everyone else in my life.

TW: mentions of suicide 


Ever since then I think ab reaching out to my ex every so often, less now but I still do, the only way I could do that is over email. It feels horrible that I was the one blocked on everything when he said I did nothing and it wasn’t my fault. That doesn’t make it feel like it. I only have one close friend and she’s away at college I’m seeing her this weekend but I still feel so alone. I want to make new friends but don’t know how and now more so after the breakup I feel like nobody could care ab me as much as I care ab them. 

There is this really cute girl at my work and I want to be her friend and even kinda have a crush on her. But I don’t know her that well.I don’t know how to approach the situation.I don’t understand myself sometimes. I just want to love and be loved why does everything have to seem so twisted?

I have not done a school assignment in about two weeks and at times feel useless as an individual and don’t know who I am. 
I am going to therapy but it’s just so hard without proper friends, which I don’t think I have had in a very long time.
 
Nobody tells you how to do this stuff and I feel like I have tried my best with the knowledge and experience I have and I just give up or give up before I even try.
How do you leave someone in such a state and just never bother to check up on them?(my ex)
It makes me so angry bc he said he cared.

I think about suicide semi-often because I feel like I don’t have anything to look forward to and am unsure of how to create something by myself.
It’s so difficult and sometimes I wish the few people that care bare minimum would just stop so I wouldn’t feel guilty for going away.  
 
This post is kinda all over the place but so am I. I just wanna speak what comes to mind sometimes. This is high key a cry for help if you can’t tell I just need to write something in the hopes that some stranger will read it, just listen, even if I don’t know them maybe we could keep each other company for a while.Despite not knowing each other we may be connected in how we feel which is so amazing and I just want to be connected to something even if it’s just for a moment.

47,"     Ever since early December of 2019 everything has been extremely complicated for me. I was going to college but my house had been foreclosed on and me and my mother had to leave. We went to go live in the apartment that is above my grandmother’s house and we rented it from her until late August. Everything started off well there and I got my drivers permit and applied to jobs. But then my grandmother started acting really strange, she would constantly come upstairs and start arguments about anything she could come up with.

she ended up getting a restraining order on my mother. We were both really confused why she did it, my mother went and slept in her car in the parking lot of a church nearby for about two months as I lived alone at my grandmothers still. My grandmother decided to sell her house and the restraining order was altered so my mother could come and we could move stuff out. We left on the last day of August and my mom bought a trailer as a last resort and we’ve stayed in the parking lot of this church that has been very kind to us but we have to leave this Friday. 

At this point I don’t know what to do, my mother is on disability and she’s tried getting apartments and going to trailer parks but she says nothing works because she can’t afford it. I can’t keep moving from place to place, I want to start my life and there’s no friends I can stay with. I love my mother and I wish I could stay with her but I feel she’s gonna be moving around from place to place for the rest of her life. I need to figure out something I can do, somewhere I can go, so I can get a job and try to start my life. I feel my only option is to become homeless and get a job and keep saving up money.

So I applied for this mentorship program as a mentee and I got accepted. But lately I have no energy to do anything. I can barely get anything done at my current job and I have no motivation for my mentee project either.

Like last week I felt like I was gonna throw up from the anxiety and i ended up asking to reschedule with my mentor a few hours before our meeting (I lied and said I had an emergency which is awful thinking about it).

I had another meeting for today but my anxiety was so bad I missed it and I got a text saying “do you need to reschedule?” And just giving a response is stressing me out. I know it’s awful of me to do this but I can’t think of a way to cope or respond. I haven’t been getting my work done and can barely cope with my actual job. I’m wondering if I should make up some excuse to drop the mentorship program entirely if I can’t cope with the workload.",21Oct2020,1

I’ve been drawing for years and up until recently it was my favorite hobby, now it’s even hard to pick up a pencil without getting so horribly bored out of my mind doing something I hadn’t even started. I got a VR headset (I’m considered spoiled by a lot of people, trust me I know, it’s one of the reasons I hate sharing things like this) but I used it all the time. Every day, I’d play something on that headset. Now, I’ve used it like 3 times in the past like year. I hate it. I hate it so much, not the headset, or anything else, just the fact that I’ve gotten bored of it. I want to stop being bored with things. Help? Lol sorry for bad grammar.

The thing is i was friends with a girl way back when we studied in high school, we were from different schools but we went to the same coaching classes.
We sort of clicked on the spot i fell for her really hard.
But being brought up in an orthodox family my morals were not to talk to a girl unless spoken to.
The society had moulded me in such a way that i couldn't freely express any of my feelings to any girl.
I was and still am able to do so with guys.
The thing was i never built up the courage to confess to her. Eventually we guaduated from our respective schools and went to seperate junior colleges.
I have had a lot of interaction with girls but i never found anyone that was dateable. They were perfectly beautiful, but i never saw a future with any of them.
Still whenever i get time i try and stalk her on socials just to have a peek at her.
But I have never had the courage to just talk to her.
How do i go about this situation?
I want to express my feelings for her but im too afraid she'll distance me. Or it would end our friendship.
And if she says no it will just break me.

61,"When I was little, my first stepmom put me through a lot of emotional and physical abuse, and I moved to my grandmas and got diagnosed with severe adhd. I was a happy kid living with my grandma at the time, and eventually moved out to my dads again after he got another wife, just to be emotionally manipulated and taken off my meds. I got depression a few months after, and a couple years ago I moved back to my grandmother's. At first, things were getting better mentally, and I was happy. But then she started to get on me for small things- my weight, my clothes, the way I talked. It didnt really bug me at first but its gotten so much worse these last couple of years, and even worse now with Covid. Every day it seems like shes yelling at me for the smallest things, and making me feel like a dumb child. A couple of weeks ago I relapsed and ended up cutting and her response was ""Im so pissed I could choke you"" when she found out. I honestly feel like suicide at times but i know if I even cry in front of her shes going to say I'm doing it for attention. Shes constantly calling me a liar and saying i have an attitude when I dont even realize i sound mean at times. Lately I've been feeling pretty bad, and she's just not helping. Shes yelling at me for not talking to her as much as i used to, but the few times I've told her my emotions she turns around and uses it against me, and makes me feel like im not allowed to have these emotions. I feel like she's mad im not the same innocent kid i was when I first lived here, and I'm always walking on eggshells around her to keep her happy. If shes not happy, then I definitely cant be happy because she'll yell at me nonstop. I tried talking to my dad about possibly moving back but he wouldn't even listen to me and just said I was overreacting and refused to believe me. Its getting harder everyday to wake up knowing its going to be another day or her yelling at me about something as small as me taking a little bit longer to get out of bed. I feel emotionally exhausted trying to be perfect for her, but its just taking all i have to keep her happy. I've tried telling her in the past about the effect of how she treats me feels, but she just used that against me as well. I'm trying to get a job but with Covid its been difficult, as well as the fact i dont have a car.

62,"She’s 30, I’m male and 34 (not sure if that matters). She gets probably around 5-10 packages per week. She’s jokingly said many times in our four year relationship that she has a shopping addiction (I don’t know if she actually does or not), and more recently has said that it’s a hard year and it makes her feel good. The problems are: we have waaaaay too much stuff (mostly hers) (oh yeah we live together and have for ~3 years), she eventually gets fed up with all of her stuff and does a purge (this might happen every month or two), but the purchasing doesn’t really slow down; also much of the stuff that she buys is just junk, that is used a time or two and then never again. 

I’m asking because it seems to just keep getting worse. She/we don’t go shopping anymore during the pandemic, so that’s one outlet that she can’t use, and I understand that. But when I try to say anything to her, she gets angry and defensive and says that I’m trying to control her. It’s scary and stressful to me - her future husband - to always have too much stuff never what I view as a money spending problem. I’m not trying to control her, I want what’s best for her and for us. Shopping makes her happy, but it’s an extremely temporary happiness. I would want to say the same things to a good friend or anyone that I care about. But she doesn’t hear/listen to me and usually says things like I’m trying to control her or it’s her money and it shouldn’t matter to me. What do I do/say?

70,"So I have my best friend and another friend who im not sure that they'll be my best friend after I do what I'm about to share.

So back in high school we were all really amazing friends. That was all amazing until the love triangle emerged and tensions started to heighten that were only discussed with me. And me being who I am, I kept all the secrets to myself and never told anyone within the group...

There was one person out of our friend group who was really into...basically in love with my best friend who we'll call Rin and that person was... Viola? (Making up names here) They did some heavy flirting even when Rin was in a long distance. I brought up how Viola was acting to Viola and she didn't give a FUCK. To my surprise...I was baffled. I asked her if the shoe was on the other foot how would she feel and she didn't care...

Well...

We had portfolio show and...the shoe did end up on the other foot and she was heartbroken. But while she was heartbroken I'd been trying to tell her for months, that's probably not the best person to date right now, everything's a mess with Rin right now..that would be your first relationship...I don't think you want that right now. I was simply trying to protect her. And I was successful. I couldn't have stopped what happened at portfolio but I was at least able to prepare her for what was to come. 

At portfolio show, Rin brought the ex girlfriend who lives here in the same state with us. And it was upon arrival that we found out that they were dating again. At the end of the show Rin left us without even saying goodbye and we were both pretty hurt at that point and figured this was the end. There was no more squad of friends. Viola and I went for food after the show and she was distraught and heartbroken in the car and didn't have much to say but I was there for her. I didn't bad mouth Rin because of that poor exit, that's my friend. But Viola and I both looked at the realities and realized that was pretty shitty. Viola decided she was basically gonna go back home and probably never hangout with us again unless it was me or our other friend because it was gonna take her a while to get over Rin.

3 years pass

Rin shows up at her door to return something to her with a group of people we all went to school with whom I didn't consider friends but they did. Viola opens the door and Rin told me she her face was in absolute shock. Rin was under the impression that Viola was in shock due to all of the people that showed up at her house. Viola informed me that she was in shock to see Rin because she had no intention on seeing Rin again. 

Recently we've all started hanging out as a trio again but I'm starting to not want to so much anymore. I'm holding Viola's secret of her being in love with Rin and based on communication and her actions she still is. I'm beginning to hate hanging out with them as a group because I feel like a third wheel. I feel like a friend who's been invited to a date and shouldn't be there because...friends shouldn't be on dates..it's so uncomfortable. Carrying this secret around literally is driving me into anxiety during each hangout and it's uncomfortable. 

Rin and I are like siblings and I feel horrible for not sharing this but I was trying so hard to be a good friend to Viola by keeping this secret for 5years now.

I feel like this isn't truly affecting anyone else in the group except me really and I feel like I should Rin because it may not come to a surprise but at the same time I feel like I'd be breaking Viola's trust...I'm not even sure what to do at this point other than let it out.

73,"Everytime I think about this, I feel guilty about it. I want to apologize, mostly. I used to live with a guy when I got into college in a new city, he was my high school friend and a smart guy, but a terrible person and boyfriend.
He had this really cute GF (like, not just her appearance. She was cute, but also a really sweet girl, but I never talked to her much. We didn't share many interests). He cheated on her many times, with different girls, and as I lived with him, I knew about it all. But I never had the courage to tell her, because he was my friend and I lived with him, so if I did so I was afraid of what would happen to our friendship and my home situation (everything was so stressful and new, I just wanted a place I could relax by the end of the day).
I always got angry with him because of what he doing to her, and thought it was unfair to her, since I absolutely sure she was head over heels for him and would never cheat on him, and in her vision, I'm sure, they were High School Sweethearts.
Eventually, he cheated on her with a girl who was his childhood friend (let's call her CF. She was a common acquaintance of both me and her as she also used to study with us), and broke up with his now ex to be with CF. This is where it becomes tricky. I'm sure she hates the both of them. They basically started dating not long after the break up, but I don't know if she knows about all the cheating. It's been a long time since that happened, but I haven't seen her dating anyone after that (no, I'm not interested in her), but I always wonder if I should tell her that I knew, what I knew, that I'm sorry for not telling her before... Or is it better for her to not know about it now? What if she doesn't know and bringing it up will only open old wounds? Will it make her resent me for not saying anything sooner (sure, I deserve it, I know)? I feel like an a-hole everytime I think about my conduct in regards to that situation.

Okay, so here's some background. Me (F14), Friend C (F13), and Friend P (F14) are really close to each other. We tell each other everything. This is where we get to the story. Last week, I'm at school getting my books for first period with Friend P. Friend C comes up to us and tells us a situation she's in. It turns out, some random sicko added her on snapchat and sent her address, contact info, school name, parent contact info, and more to her. He even sent a picture of her bedroom. She knew the picture was taken recently because she just got a new bed, and the bed was in the picture. She lives in an apartment complex, so he would have to find out exactly which apartment she lived in. He said that if she didn't give him $100 (which I found odd that he was asking for so little), he would kidnap and hurt her. This terrified her. He was threatening to send her to Egypt and traffic her. Obviously, Friend P and I were furious. Who the fuck does that to a 13 year old girl? But we were also scared. We didn't want her in any trouble, she's already been through enough. Her mother is emotionally abusive and favors her older brother. Her dad left when she was young and he is a drug addict and alcoholic. She visits him occasionally. Soon after she told us, he sent a message saying he would pull up to our school at 7:40 in the morning (right as our first period starts). He didn't, thankfully, but it still scared the shit out of us. Friend C sent some audio messages of her insulting and yelling at him, and he has yet to open the message. It's been a little less than a week since she sent those messages. Friend C has not told her mother or brother about this situation, because this happened on her second snapchat account that she hides from her mother, and she's afraid her mother will blame her. Friend C's mother is currently threatening to kick her out of the house to move with her abusive and alcoholic dad or send her across the country to live with her aunt. Anyway, what I really need help with is finding this bastard's location. I don't plan on harassing him or posting his location online, I just want him to get a taste of his own medicine (and possibly tell law enforcement, but I don't think they'll actually do anything about the situation).

78,"Over the past few years, I’ve researched a multitude of schools and have settled on one specific T20 that is absolutely perfect for me and I feel like I would be able to succeed at.

Unfortunately, only one of my parents supports my hope to apply there and attend- they actually encourage it. My other parent is completely against it, and has been limiting me to applying to 3-4 in state schools. I like all of these state schools, but none to the extent of this specific school. My parent claims that because of the responsibility it takes to go to this school, the competitive nature, financial burden, and 2 hour distance, I’m not allowed to apply to this school.

Eventually, I convinced my parent to allow me to apply, but they said that even if I get in I won’t be allowed to attend. I can’t help but feel like I am being completely limited as I watch my peers applying to all of these T20 schools for college. I’ve heard it all- that it doesn’t matter where you go to undergrad, but I just know that going to this specific school would be amazing for me. Regardless, I feel like my options are not open, and I’ve discussed this with my parent for hours but they simply don’t budge. Should I just let it go and attend my top state school next year?

79,"I was already against schools opening during COVID times. I chose my schools online-only option as opposed to the in-person. I made the impulsive decision to go back in-person as I was given the option as the school shifted from two days a week to four. (Teachers were neglecting to teach online only students at all and completely forgetting about them, not even giving them proper directions sometimes.) I’ve been back in school in-person for four days.

But today I got home and my grandma asked me if I heard the news. My cousin had gotten sick Thursday and gotten a positive COVID test back yesterday. Her mom/dad/sibling were also pretty ill. My parents and I had just seen all the aforementioned sick people nine days ago, Saturday. We’re positive they have COVID. 

I want to stay home from school to keep people safe and all in case I have it too. But my parents want me to go to school and keep telling me it’s no big deal and not my responsibility or my fault if someone gets sick. Thing is, it absolutely is if I make that decision to go when I know I could be sick. It’s not like those other kids are choosing to be in school, it’s that or fall behind as their teachers neglect them. 

I hate school with a passion, but I don’t want to go remote tomorrow. I’m halfway through too many things. That’s no excuse though, that’s just me justifying to my parents I’m not just saying this to get out of school. Not going to school until I hit the two week mark is the obvious answer but my parents are making me doubt I’m making the right choice. That there’s no way I could be sick and even if I was it wouldn’t matter.I’m sure strangers on the internet will be just absolutely great too. 

I just feel so horrible and guilty. I’m going to feel that way no matter which choice I make, but it’s not about me, it’s about not getting more people potentially sick. Im sure I’d feel much more horrible and guilty if someone got sick on my behalf. I don’t have any symptoms as far as I can tell.

I frequently get high marks, I joined United Nations youth, I play club cricket and volleyball, I do photography and more.

88,"I am planning to end things with my ""best friend"" of 6 years. I met him online back in 2014 and we became very close. We would talk EVERYDAY on text and video call and we would always help each other get through a lot of shit in life. He was my very first ""best"" friend so it felt very good to be close to someone..at first he said he had feelings for me and said he wanted to date and meet and so he asked me out but then the same day he said he couldn't do this and he came out to me instead and from then on we decided we'll just stay best friends and I'll support him as much as I could. 

Anyway, 2016 came and I was going through one of the hardest times in life and I was suicidal and sort of relapsed into my self harming habits and so I let him know what was going on but he completely ghosted me and I was very hurt and desperate to talk to my only best friend so I decided to reach out to our mutual and asked him to ask my best friend why he was avoiding me all of a sudden. The mutual showed me the screenshot of their chat and he said the reason why he was staying away from me was because according to him I was ""romanticizing"" suicide and he does not like people who do that and that others have it worse than I do plus I would never k\*ll myself anyway. After reading all of that coming from my own best friend's mouth..I was hurt but then he eventually came back as if nothing happened and I never confronted him because I was too afraid of losing him. 

Every year on his birthday, I would literally spend my money on him, sending him presents while I would just get a simple happy birthday wish, but I never asked for anything in return and I still don't care about it but there was a point in my life where I wanted my best friend to do something similar for me because I have never been treated like that before..

He never even texted me first anymore and would ghost me so many times and he would only text me first if he wanted me to choose pictures of him so he could post it on instagram lol but I kept thinking it was okay. I went to Pakistan like three times (my home country and where he resides as well, same city) and asked him to meet me up, he would tell me he was ""very excited"" to finally meet but he would always end up ditching me whenever I would go to see him like at a restaurant or whatever, making up some dumb excuses.

He eventually moved to the US and got married to a guy and I asked him to video call me on his wedding because it would mean a lot to me but he never did that..maybe he forgot? or maybe I just wasn't special to him? I don't know. 

I really want to end this friendship because it is so toxic and mentally draining. I haven't been talking to him at all recently, he's started sending me snaps all of a sudden as soon as he realized I've been silent but in all honesty, I am done being used by him. 

How do I confront him though? I'm still scared I might hurt him by the things I have to say..please help reddit! thank you :)",21Oct2020,1

I mean I had so much motivation to do things before this whole coronavirus everything planned and now I cant even go to school. I've tried doing new things like leather working or skateboarding but its just to hard and I have no motivation to keep going. I also thought my acne would go away now because I'm on Accutane but nope not even that.

I am also forced to go to boy scouts and I hate it its not fun to me anymore and I have to because my dad said if I don't finish it and get eagle he will not buy he my car.

I also have an intense fear of actually losing my friends, and these contradicting emotions are really confusing me.

My polyamourus s/o brought someone into the fold she thought she could trust around the beginning of this year, but circumstances have proved otherwise.

But we've reached a point where we don't really know what to do anymore except go to his residence and *at the very least* try to get her essential documents, which still reside at his residence. Beyond that he still possesses heirlooms from my s/o's late grandparents which have a great deal of sentimental value. He has blocked her, her parents, and myself on every platform, so at this point we have absolutely no way of getting in contact with him. He lives in a suburb of Chicago, just over 12 hours west from our area.

Smoking a lot of flower and a lot of wax. Well I got pregnant when I was 21 and quit obviously throughout the pregnancy and started smoking again when she baby was about 3 months old. I had 2 more babies after that and repeated the same cycle. Well recently I found out that smoking weed regularly from a young age can lead to schizophrenia. Well my dad has schizophrenia.... and my chances double because of that... this freaked me the f out so bad that I quit cold turkey. I have 3 brothers and we all smoke heavily. Them more than me because they don’t have kids. So I let them know and talked to them but I don’t think they’re going to quit like me, which i don’t expect them too because it can be hard. Well smoking weed for so many years I miss it.. It’s a crazy life here at home with 3 kids under the age of 5 and at night when they’re all sleeping I like to relax and smoke. But only during the night. I have a question that maybe someone can shed some light on. I don’t want to quit smoking entirely only at night and maybe not everyday.

I'm finally getting around to cleaning my awful fridge, sticky and grimy and disgusting (I procrastinated WAY too long on this.) 

I took the shelves and vegetable drawer out and into my shower, covered them with Ajax powder, then scrubbed away. Rinsed well with hot water and dried off. Then as I'm about to do the actual walls of the fridge I had a realization: Ajax has bleach and isn't food safe. They've been drying for about an hour now, and I haven't used Ajax on the walls (will be using a hot water/vinegar blend). 

My question is: did I mess up big time or is it not a big deal? It's just the shelves and drawer, but I did use a generous amount of Ajax powder. Is it fine? Should I run them over again with my water/vinegar mix? Do I need new shelves?

She had separated parents and I spent a lot of time helping her deal with her home life, then my father passed and 1 and 1/2 years after he passed i left her.

I was a mess and she tried her best but a few months after my father passed we moved over 2hrs away, what was a 10min drive became a 4 hour round trip. It was hard to make it work but I realized I was making her miserable. I let her go and hoped that she would be happier without me weighing her down...I didnt realize what she was going through and it was pretty rough.

It has been 5 years since we have broken up, however over those years we have meet up, talked on and off and occasionally hooked up reminiscing about our relationship and what happened after we broke up or since the last time we saw each other. We had both either been single or seeing someone when hooking up or 'secretly' seeing one another.

Early 2020 she came over and we talked a lot, she came over multiple times and we hooked up almost every time. Fast forward to now, I stupidly asked to see her and she says that she is with someone and plans on marrying him and I really am not sure how to deal with myself.

I made a random account on deviantart to post something I made related to a friend, just an image from a convo we had. From the post there's no way a stranger could know that I posted it or who the person involved in the image was. No doxxing/pics/info of him and I was using an alt account with no connection to me.

Somehow a few days later, he mentioned the post to me. My post had like &lt;10 views. Coming across a random junk post coincidentally would be virtually impossible with all the stuff posted to DA. He told me someone else found it... Which is even less plausible cause that other person doesn't even use DA.

The only way I can imagine he knew about it was if he was monitoring my computer in some way. Saying ""someone else found it"" is a pretty generic BS answer. What do you guys think?

Also, he used to host LAN parties for us and we would all connect to his server/internet. At one point we could access files from eachothers computers. He's into computers. For what relevance that has.

Don't really have any family and I was more-or-less homeschool through middle and high school so it's just me and the four walls all day.

Anyhow, we've recently dropped to our lowest alert level, and everyone in my dorm is in a group chat. I'll probably embarrass myself and regret this, but I decided I'd just drop in the chat and ask if anyone wants to hang out tomorrow. So, here's my problem: I don't know what to say. Am I like, ""I'm lonely, anyone wanna hang out?"". Or, ""Anyone busy tomorrow?"". The chat is super quiet and I don't want to drop in all awkward like or seem weird. It seems like almost everyone has found their social group and it would really suck to be the joke of the building.

I'm probably overthinking this. It's just that, like I said, I have zero social skills, and on top of that it hasn't been that long since I've gotten out from under crazy abusive parents that literally had a ""no talking to anyone but us"" rule.

I applied to this colleges european campus and was accepted then got fucked by the consulate of the country I wanted to go to, and was forced to go to the main campus here in USA as I had no other option. I couldn't stay home bc my step dad will beat the living shit out of me now that Im 18 (I began college at 17 and graduated high school a year early to prevent this) and he can get away with it, my mom will support him and take his side; she did it when I was 16. Im in college studying a language but I don't think the degree will get me anywhere and nor will the other things I am interested in that I could learn about in college.

Now I can't go at all and I can't afford another semester here, nor would I want to because this place fucking sucks. 

After this semester I will have nowhere to go and I can't get a job right now because of corona and my school schedule, as well as my lack of previous experience. IDK what to do with my life or what I should do, and I have no idea what to do after this semester ends; I could end up homeless. 

I have no car so I have no way to transport my things even if I could transfer colleges. The things I want to study and like seem to have almost 0 career path opportunities that will be able to win me money to be able to do what I actually like which is drive cars, I want to own a nice car(s) and be able to race them, its the only thing I like to do.

So I've been in college for about a couple months now and I got involved in a Zoom play for the theater department's festival. I made some good friends with the cast, but I was particularly interested with one girl. Let's call her Cassandra.

So after our final meeting just a few days ago, I shot Cassandra a DM not too long after. It took her a while to respond, but I try not to get anxious with this stuff, so I figured its fine. I text back shortly after and she doesnt respond back. Nerves got the best of me today and I texted her basically saying that if she doesn't wanna talk to me, she can tell me so and I'd be fine. She texted back not too long after saying she doesn't have the mental capacity to invite someone into her life. Even after this, I'm still interested in her, but I don't wanna be a bug and I wanna respect her wishes. So my question is how much space should I give her?

123,"Hi there, my little cousin (8M) has been staying over for the last few weeks due to some problems at home. He is staying here because my family doesn’t want to send him off to a foster home. His father was abusing his mother and currently there is a court case going on. He has some issues and is speaking to a therapist, but that doesn’t stop some of his breakdowns. His breakdowns mainly involve him crying and speaking to others very harshly. He believes his family doesn’t care about him. He calls his family members just to insult some of them or demand things from them. It may seem bratty, but keep in mind he’s seen his father beat his mother right in front of him and has seen him pull a gun out on her. He cries and calls people asking for things or insulting them. He wants to return home, but the very earliest he can return is December 1st and that’s if his mother gets custody of the child. He has some eating habits which are most likely correlated with the trauma.  He has been having these breakdowns ever since he came into this house. He asks us to leave him alone, but I feel terrible leaving him to sit and cry until he calms down. He forgets about it his troubles when he gets things he want, which only fuel his want for things. He doesn’t want to be here even though we’ve given him just about everything he’s wanted. We haven’t physically or mentally hurt him. He seems to resent us because we make him go to sleep.

To start off, I was born early because the placenta began to have problems when I got 8 months and I was getting a lack of oxygen and stopped growing. I was born almost a month earlier than I should have been. Then I got to 2, where I began to constantly vomit. After 6 months of tests and diagnostics, I was diagnosed with coeliac. However, after this 6 month period, I had lost an absurd amount of weight, and being a coeliac undiagnosed, the vili in my bowels had been greatly damaged. I already had a high metabolism too. Because of this, only until recently (like 3 or so years ago), I looked like golum from LOTR. You could see my spine, rub cage and majority of my other large bones right through my skin. I started puberty really late. My first pubic hair appeared when I was 12 and a half and my first pubic growth spurt occurred in between 14 and 14.5 years old.

So in conclusion, I was wondering if there was any way I could actually help myself get a little more buff and grow more despite my body not absorbing half the stuff I eat, due to my vili being terribly damaged and my high metabolism.

Generally you would assume that people wouldn't lock the top lock of the door seeing as you are essentially fucking anyone outside of the house at the time yet someone keeps fucking doing it. I've been living there since January and since then I've had the door locked on me several times, a couple of times when I just left out to pick something up at night, sometime if I leave out at night to go to a party, and even one time in the middle of the day someone locked me out after left to go to the store. I just started working a night shift and last I come home at 4 and for some reason the door is locked and I've just had it. I wasn't able to get back into the house until 6:30 that's ridiculous.

127,"
I have 2 friends from another city, R and C. I met R first and everything was good at the begining but then we had problems/arguments because she is too controlling, jelous and (even though i know she doesn't want to be), toxic which resulted in me telling C about this stuff and creating rough feelings from C to R, when they did not even know each other yet. R during this period of time had a couple failed relationships with other people, as she seems to always need to be with someone and likes to fight or pick arguments. 

C and R met and C was upset with me because all of the ""bad"" things i told her about R and they had a brief relationship that ended because, as always, R became too controlling and toxic. C apologized to me and told me i was right in saying that R needed emotional healing and that until that all her relationships would be a mess, but she stayed friends with R because she's the only one helping her with her transition (both R and C are trans girls, R has been transitioning for up to 2 years now and C only came out a couple weeks ago), i would help her too but i live hours ago from both of them and they live around 15 minutes from each other.

Now R is flirting with a guy both i and my boyfriend used to work with, and we both know he's the type of guy that is very sweet and falls for a girl inmediatly and takes ages to ""recover"", and we all know this will end pretty bad. I also know that if i tell the guy and R finds out i or my bf told him to stay away from her she's going to be very, very mad, and would get mad at C too for being my friend (i know her well and i know she would just explode at C too although she had nothing to do with it just for being my friend). I'm scared she'll leave C alone and not help her anymore, i don't want to screw up the only resource of advice, help and support C has in her transition, but i don't want the guy i work with to have a bad time with R and suffer. 

What should i do? Should i warn the guy i used to work with or just keep quiet?",21Oct2020,1

A while ago I saw a reddit post that reminded me of a man that would sit near a store window, who has one leg and stays there for most of the day, everyday. He would sometimes be given a smoke, a tip, shared food with others sitting outside, etc. I wanted to know what I could do to have a bench put outside that he would feel comfortable on rather than trying to lean up against the glass.

130,"Hi, 

This won't be long, I don't think, but I really need help. I'm a triple major in Uni (yes, you read that right), and I'm not even doing bad. However, I have lately felt a couple of things that made me reconsider being a triple major. 

A bit of background: I started college at 14 through a dual-enrolled program, giving me three associates degrees before I started in uni. Due to this, I brought in well over 120 credits to uni and was able to get all of my extracurriculars waived. The only thing I am studying in Uni is my three majors. I don't have to take any ""extra"" classes that are pointless to my degrees. 

Anyways, I'm not doing bad. I have a 3.6 GPA, and this is only because I had a professor try to fail me due to him not wanting to accommodate my disability. I consistently take high credit amounts, somewhere between 14-18 credits a semester, but the workload has never been a problem for me. I understand the material, I consistently enjoy the material, and I am able to easily balance school, work, a social life, and taking care of myself. 

Until this semester. I don't know if it's COVID or if it's just me being exhausted, but I went into this semester feeling run down. My uni didn't handle COVID well, so we had a large amount of cases in the first couple of weeks and we ended up going into lockdown. My uni also didn't handle transitioning to hybrid classes well either (partially online, partially in person). There are no caps on what teachers are allowed to assign, so I have a class that I currently work 48 hours a week on because my professor assigns 6 assignments a week, assigns reading, assigns 3 hour long video lectures a week, and then also has a 2 hour class twice a week. Oh, might I mention, this is a diff eq class, so one problem for homework can take 40 minutes easily. This is on top of 9 other classes: performance lessons, recital attendance, astronomy, astronomy lab, physics, physics lab, flute studio, music theory, and sight singing and ear training. 

Not to mention, I am an active member of my school's student government where I'm writing and introducing legislation twice a month, a president to a club that promotes queer individuals in STEM, and other miscellaneous things that I have to do like volunteer hours, attending honors lectures (I'm an honors student), doing research, etc. 

I wasn't this tired last year when I took 18 credits, like I am this semester, so I'm curious if I'm just doing something wrong. However, I really think the pandemic is hitting me. Our school shortened our semester to 14 weeks, so I've only had 3 weeks so far this semester where I haven't had an exam. The teachers are having a hard time accommodating my disability. The professors also are having a hard time getting information to students in the provided time. Oh, and we haven't had a break. My school eliminated breaks for this semester in order to get us home before thanksgiving. 

I need to know if I should drop a major or something, or if this is some sort of pandemic induced exhaustion. The only thing holding me out from dropping right now is that I have 3 semesters of 14 credits or less after this semester, and I know I won't be exhausted with this credit load. 14 is nothing. If you have any advice, please let me know. I want to cry all the time, and I need to know if this is normal or not.",21Oct2020,1

That makes it very difficult for me to see my mother because he lives with her and it is a very hostile environment with him there, and I don't feel safe bringing my family there when he is there. 

He reached out to me in a half-hearted attempt at some form of reconciliation. He made it clear he still hates me and he just wants to check a box so my mom won't blame him for me never coming to visit and she never gets to see her grandkids.  I can't speak to him directly however because it is too painful to for me do to the deep hurt of him disowning me and refusing to speak to me for years.

134,"I recently got a new job with a massive salary bump, signed the lease on a new flat in a lovely area, started making new friends in my city after the longest time. I should feel calm and happy but for some reason I can't sleep, for the last 4 years I've grown so used to absolutely nothing going right for me that this just seems unbelievable and I feel like I don't deserve it. I'm very close to having everything I ever dreamed of and instead of feeling happy and calm because I finally made it, I'm scared because suddenly it's a lot of change and... yes, that's scary. 

Also I've been sick with Covid for two months now and don't seem to be getting any better - if only, slightly worse, as new symptoms keep appearing. I've spoken to my GP and been to the hospital and everything seems normal, so I'm kind of relieved but at the same time I'm still scared. Sometimes I can't sleep at night because I can't breathe properly (even though my oxygen is at 100%), I've started to get anxious and, even though I try to carry on with my life with as much normalcy as possible (at least I don't have to keep self-isolating), it's hard to not notice the chest pain or the lightheadedness 24/7. And I know it's very unlikely that I'm going to die from this, but obviously that has crossed my mind at some point too.

All my friends and family seem to be a lot happier and more excited for me than I actually am, and I wonder if this is normal or just a side effect of being ill for so long. I always thought I would be jumping on my bed if something like this ever happened to me, but instead I feel kind of tired, scared, lonely, and melancholic. Sometimes I am able to feel some genuine happiness when I think about it and it's like 'WOW, this really is happening!',  and just I wish I could keep that feeling with me for a little longer.

Our store manager Matt is a white middle age guy who has sexually harassed and racially stereotyped his staff and even goes as far as to try to only hire 18 year old to college aged girls because he wants a ‘better reason to come into work.’ When i try to hire males, i have to go behind his back or lie about their gender until they came in to work. I even had to lie about race when i hired a girl as assistant manager because he said he ‘couldn’t trust a black manager from stealing money.’ 
I tried talking about this to the district manager Anthony and was told that it didn’t matter because the store wasn’t open for long enough to make a deal out of it and that HR wouldn’t care. I tried getting the HR number from him and he refused because I had ‘no reason to ask for it’ 
He racially profiles everyone who walks in and will automatically think you’re stealing if you aren’t caucasian and makes awful remarks such as ‘damn we really need to start checking cameras more often’ whenever someone who isn’t white passes by him and he also walks around following people, most noticeably teenage girls and says things like ‘wow my day just got way better’ until they get uncomfortable leave. He even reprimanded me for complimenting said second assistant on her Black Lives Matter mask and told us that we weren’t allowed to wear any ‘false political statement’ masks as such and that we had to take any customer regardless of what they wore or if they didn’t have a mask on. Multiple customers have complained about him but they get brushed off by the district manager being told ‘if you have nothing to hide you shouldn’t feel uncomfortable’ and then get told that he has to check their bags before they leave.

159,"I need help deciding on my career.

I am 17 and having to choose what I want to do and what college I want to go to.

I know I want to help people. It is my reason to be on this earth. To make a positive impact in peoples lives. I am just having a hard time figuring it out. I want to be more hands on and involved rather than quiet and set back like a pathologist. I also don’t want to be a doctor or nurse. I’ve thought about social work but I am having second thoughts recently. 

One of my goals is to create a company that helps people. I just don’t know how. 

The only way I ever feel satisfaction is if I help someone or give someone a gift. 

If someone hasn’t had lunch is hungry but I need gas and I only have $10 to my name. I’d buy them lunch.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated, thank you.",21Oct2020,1

171,"My mom is moving into her dad’s house. She had a couple brothers and a nephew bring alot of her stuff up to my grandpa’s house excluding just a few pieces of furniture. Those couple of furniture is for me because my roommate will be leaving in the summer and taking most of the furniture. 

The plan was to bring the furniture (mostly wood and upholstery) to my house and put it in the basement. The basement is kindof humid and unfinished. We have things down there, but there are either packed well or are just cardboard. I plan on putting a cloth on top of the furniture, putting them on pallets, and buying a second dehumidifier. All this together would cost about $200?

My mom thinks it would be best to put furniture in the storage. The climate control storage nearby seems about $70 a month. This would just make the whole debacle not worth it to me. I feel like I could save $200+ and buy furniture in the summer. My mom suggested taking the furniture with her and put it in a storage she already has, but thats in a bigger city and might be even more expensive. I would feel bad because I can just buy furniture later and I dont think she will take the time to sell this furniture. 

I guess is the bargain of possibly getting moldy furniture worth it compared to buying storage for the furniture?

175,"Basically, this girl (we’ll call her B) that I know came out yesterday saying that she’s lesbian (I’m proud of her for coming out). Anyway her friend (who we’ll call C) who is older than her (3 year age gap) explained yesterday how her and B were “practically dating.” Yes that is an odd statement to say to a girl that’s way younger than you (B is 10 while C is nearly 14). Anyway, I talked to B yesterday and she said how the things C told her made her uncomfortable. C said things like how her and B’s genetics would make a perfect child, how they could have a life (relationship, family, etc.) together and more. Now this made B severely uncomfortable as she only thought of C as a friend nothing more. Today B, B’s brother, and my other friend confronted C on her behavior. She tried denying many things and it ended in C and B’s friendship ending and C feeling very crushed. 

Listen, I have nothing against liking people, etc, but when you talk about having a relationship and whatnot with a 10 year old whilst being nearly 14 it’s a little odd ya know. And I feel a bit saddened by confronting C but we confronted her since we were concerned for B (C has been very manipulative and rude to B before, leading to many other disputes). I feel bad that we crushed C and hurt her emotionally but her discussions and whatnot were uncalled for, considering she made B feel very uncomfortable. 

In return I am seeking others thoughts on the situation. Did we go to far? Did we do the right thing? I just have mixed feelings on the situation... but for the most part, I believe me and my friends were in the right (deciding to confront C).",21Oct2020,1

178,"Hey reddit,

Kind of hurting a lot right now and in need of advice or reassurance or acknowledgement or something. Anything. I fucked up majorly. I let my mental health take advantage of me, making me emotionally unavailable, hotheaded, unempathetic, careless, etc. I wouldn’t listen or downplay my girlfriends feelings when she would tell me, and I would get upset often times since I didn’t know how to help or I was bothered by her. I let my mental health get out of control. I didn’t take my meds and didn’t go to therapy for the longest time. Finally, I’ve been able to become more consistent about taking my meds and I’ve started going to therapy, but I had a major unreasonable panic attack today that resulted in us breaking up. 

She told me how much she loves me but she can’t handle me right now. I told her I love her too. It’s when I lost her that I finally realized the true severity of my actions, and what a massive douche I’ve been. I’m committed now to getting better, both for the people in my life and myself. 

But there’s an interesting catch to this all. We still love each other very much, and I can tell she didn’t want to do this but knew she had to. We agreed to meet up in a month or two to see how I’ve been progressing in terms of therapy and my mental state, and from there we will decide if we want to try things again.

I’m not here asking for “how do I cure myself of all my issues in a months time?” because I know that isn’t possible. I’m asking, how do I start truly caring about myself? My apathy towards myself allowed me to get this bad. My lack of ability in understanding my emotions created frustrations that were then fueled by past trauma and present stresses. I wasn’t able to be the man I need to be, and I need help in figuring out how I get myself on the right track. Not necessarily for her. But for myself.

183,"I need feedback ASAP!! Even if anyone wants to DM me, keep it on the DL. I’m hitting rock bottom in life, my husband of 2 years decided he wanted a break and wasn’t sure if we’d ever really work out (this happened in July). I’ve loved him for years, we’ve been together since the beginning of 2017. I moved out, started doing my own thing. I was convinced we were over, I responded by drinking almost everyday, coke, partying, etc. I blew everything I had. Nearly 12k. I didn’t even realize until a few weeks ago how bad it got for me. Over a month ago, he called me over and said he wanted to work on things, and of course I wanted to, but I told him I had met someone. At that time, I wasn’t sure how much I cared about the guy I had met. Even after I told my husband, he said he still wanted to work it out. I just had to block him, and cut everything off and seriously put in effort towards our marriage (drinking/partying). The only thing is.. I found myself in a way, since we we’ve been split for almost 4 months. I lost myself also, but leaning towards I found myself. I realized I wasn’t the issue. I realized I am normal, I CAN and should be loved. I gave this man everything, I was the best wife. He lacked the ability to be intimate in every way possible but I still loved him and waited and waited. But now I can’t accept the fact that he just pushes me to the side whenever he’s having fun in life.. and calls me bavk whenever he’s feeling low again. It’s not fair to me, it’s fucked me up for a while now. And now I’m so hesitant on going back. And since last night, I’m sure he’s done. He knows I unblocked the guy I was seeing before, and while we were talking yesterday, a woman came to his front door asking for me. I knew exactly who she was. Back in May, me and a friend went to her house to party. Met them that night. We all got super drunk, she passed out in her bathroom, her husband offered to smoke. I’m drunk and would love to smoke a quick blunt. We go upstairs, he shows me this box that he keeps everything in, and starts touching me. He also has one of their BABIES in a crib next to their bed, his wife is passed out downstairs on the bathroom floor. I felt sick, I said no. He kept trying and trying, said him and his wife wanted to have a 3sum. I said for him to talk with her about it when she’s awake and aware. 1) I knew he was trying to convince me to just sleep with him. 2) I also knew his wife did NOT want that. 3) I would never sleep with another woman’s husband. He grabbed me by my throat and flipped me in a way and pulled my pants down and I continued to tell him no. I got up fast and said I had to go and I left. I felt disgusting, disgusted, useless, I felt like an object. I walked home and vented to my two best friends the next day. I cried, I didn’t know what to do, I’ve been in a similar situation before when I was 17, with a 23 year old. He took advantage of me while I was passed out and unaware. It’s hard to go to someone about such an awful situation when you know you were under the influence. If we’re being real, no one believes you. So instead of saying anytbing, both times I just sat and let it eat me for a little bit and I continue with my life. Fast forward to last night, me and my husband are talking about our failing marriage. She comes to my house, I know what it’s about, I let her inside, my husbands standing there, and she’s accusing me of sleeping with her husband. Asked why I did it, told me she’s thinking of divorce, telling me I ruined their marriage. I told her what happened, I told her I was so sorry, and that I swore I never did anything and that I had messages. He had messaged me in August and said he got a room at the casino down the road, told me to come through and finish what we started, said he knew he missed an opportunity, I wanted to show her so bad but she was so focused on telling me that I ruined it and left. All in front of my husband. Couldn’t have chosen a different time.. ? No. Right when we’re talking about our failing marriage, a woman comes over accusing me of ruining HER marriage. At this point I’m falling apart inside. My husband said he believed me, asked why I never said anything. It’s hard. So, My roommate leaves November 10th, my husband is done, I blew through 12k, he’s taking the insurance off of my car, I have maybe 2 weeks to figure out how I’m gonna keep my car and put everything in my name. I’m selling my stuff, I have 2 dogs.. I’m all the way in California, my families in Georgia. I love my husband, the guy I met makes me happy, he WANTS me and it’s been years since I’ve felt that. But I love my husband, and I tried for so long.. why couldn’t my husband just love me and treat me like a normal person? Why did he push me away for so long and convince me we were done, and convince him and myself that I’m the bad person? I just want to be happy. I was on the verge of killing my self last night. I have nothing in my name, i have no time to get on my feet. I’ve struggled finding a job here in central California. This is an awakening. I have rheumatoid arthritis, I’ve had it since I was 17, and I’ve often thought about skipping 10 steps in life and just joining the army, but I know arthritis is a disqualification. Has anyone gotten past that? How would I hide it? I take medication, Idk if I could sneak my medication in with me so I could physically perform okay?

I thought it would be fun in the moment but now I’m realising how stupid of an idea it was. I didn’t show him anything but my butt (it was without clothing) but I’m still worrying that he took pictures of me. At first I was telling him “No.” but I guess the pressure got to me and I eventually caved? I kept asking if he did and he reassured me that he didn’t but honestly I have no idea if he was being true or not. I honestly can’t believe I was dumb enough to do this. 

The reason I’m so worried about it is because I’m a minor and I don’t want any of my friends or family to see it because they’ll immediately know it’s my room. Also, I can’t stop thinking about the guy who I showed my body to. I have no attraction to him at all, but everything I do or see or hear just reminds me of him. I know, sounds like the beginning to some cheesy romance novel, but I just can’t for some reason.

189,"A bit about me. I've always been a hikikomori, as far back as I can remember, basically a shut in for those unaware of the term. I have no social life and maybe 5 friends. I'm 22 now and I've been going to university for 4 years for a computer science degree. Had my only job for 2 months during my second year of college, was a basic minimum wage job, left it due to depression and the job sucking. Technically, I am on my third year, as I failed my 2nd year due to depression and anxiety and I had to repeat it, and now I am going to fail again this year due to depression and anxiety. I have zero motivation to do schoolwork at this age, whereas I was a very good student throughout the rest of my schooling career. The only thing I have going for me is that I have made 7 figures from speculation on the stock market, which I started doing when I was 18 with my parents money. Money isn't an issue for me, but having lots of money doesn't make me happy whatsoever. To me it's just numbers on a screen, nothing more. I enjoy speculating on stocks but other than that, there's not much I enjoy and I don't have any real goals in life. Videogames do nothing for me at this point, so I can't even escape the inanity of daily life. I still live with my parents and I don't even have my drivers license due to anxiety. I don't really get happiness from anything. What should I do?

190,"One of them is one of my best, longtime friends. I moved to a nicer town a few years ago, and started a whirlwind of growth, really working on processing my childhood trauma, growing spiritually, getting my mindset right to achieve my dreams, and actually taking a direction with my life and moving towards self-actualizing. In working on my self-worth, and letting go of my past (or trying to), I found a new identity. I believe in myself now. I was a complete fraud in the past, I hid myself, I was afraid to ""shine"", I didn't take proper care of myself as far as mindfulness and self-care, I had a chronic illness and that seriously messed with how I see myself, I was a people pleaser, but now after many lessons, I have impeccable boundaries and a high reverence for my time, which is our greatest asset in this life. 
So yeah, I've been working on my mentality so much, and I feel as though (without discussing this with them) my old friends just can't see what I now see in myself. Like they say, sometimes strangers support your dreams more than the people you know. 
In all seriousness though...
why do I want nothing to do with my old friends at all? they're good people. i still love them. and want to be friends, from a distance. but I don't want to see them because theyre not in alignment with my new identity and life? is that heartless and disloyal? or is that just how life ebbs and flows? because just as much as i dont want to f**k with my old friends, I Do want to invite new friends into my life - friends who share similar ambitiousness, or who help me feel more in alignment with my true purpose by having similar work, interests, passions, gifts, and goals as me. 
but why in order to help strengthen my own new identity, my newfound self-worth, and vision for my future, must I throw almost everyone from my past away in order to keep believing in myself? Why does how I ""think"" they see me affect how i see myself so much??????????? This i need to examine. In my defense, my little sister said she noticed that all my friends are doing the same exact sh** that they used to do in highschool, as if time froze. She noted that their social media posts look the same as they did a decade ago of them hanging out in the same types of places and doing and talking about the same things.

191,"I've been suffering from severe depression for the past 6 years, and when I was at my lowest of lows I would sometimes go months without brushing my teeth, showering, brushing my hair, etc. I'm finally at the point in my life where things are starting to look up for me and my depression is getting less severe now that I'm an adult and I have access to what I need. 

However, I have major anxiety when facing dental work and my teeth in general. When I was 14, my family dentist (70-80m) had filled my very first cavity on my front tooth without ANY anaesthesia at all. Yes, he did give me the option, but he failed to explain it. All he said was ""Do you want the needle?"" Without explaining that the needle was novocaine. Yes, I understand that's my fault for saying no, but I didn't know any better at the time. I ended up feeling everything from the buzzing of the tools to the pain in my teeth. I had to get it refilled a year later because he filled it improperly and I was in a lot of pain whenever anything touched the tooth. 

Along with this, he would always give me a giant lecture about how I have to maintain my dental hygiene and it was my fault for getting cavities. All of these things combined have now made it to where I am 100% distrustful of dentists. 

How do I go about talking to any future dentist I have about this? What should I say and how do I know I can trust them to spare me the judgement?",21Oct2020,1

He’s 52 and I’m 20 but I’m stuck at the age of my trauma which is 9 so I need a guardian as I cannot live or function on my own (in terms of cooking or remembering things basically what a 9 year old can and can’t do) Are any of these reason for her to have the authorities to come and get me?  I’m scared of him but if I leave he already said he’ll have people break in and hurt me so it’s like double edged sword. If I go to a mental hospital I’ll lose my job. I’ve said my fair share of abusive words but that was in response to his psychical abuse. He said she won’t believe me and will say I gave myself the bruises because I’m crazy. So what are things that will get me locked up in a mental hospital? If I go and then get out I’ll have no one to go to (not allowed to talk to family or have friends) so I’ll be homeless so I really need honest answers living in Kentucky if that matters.

On the other hand, settling down TERRIFIES ME. My whole life up until graduating college always had something new in store. Elementary school, middle school, high school, college, always a new exciting journey to embark on. 

I’m so incredibly scared of settling down because I just don’t want to get comfortable. It really sucks that all of my friends that would agree to plans and hanging out on an instant are now getting engaged, married, buying houses. Yea we still do stuff together time to time, but it just seems like everyone and everything’s changed so much.

198,"Idk what I should do about work. I graduated high school and got a minimum wage job until I decide if I want to go to university of college. 
I won’t mention the company I work for but it’s total shit. I only got the job cuz two of my friends work there. The other co-workers are nice but the general manager is a dumbass. When I first applied I said I was looking for full-time cuz I’m not going to school. They told me they have part time until school starts and I can start working full time in September. They gave me so many shifts and then suddenly I started having none when school started, because she forgot I graduated and they only give students like two shifts a week. I told her I graduated, got more shifts and then my pet died...I had my dad call in for me telling I not able to come in cuz I was to depressed to get out of bed. Next week I went back cuz being at home ended up making me sad so I wanted to be at work, but the general manager got petty and started giving me one shift a week...luckily whenever someone couldn’t show up they asked me to fill and I was able to show that I’m committed to the job and got more shifts. 
Started getting more shift! Then I got sick....I called in and I quote, “hey I think I have a cold” the manager responded with “just where a mask” and she hung up on me....an hour later my uvula is swollen, I can barely talk/breath and I’m worried I got strep throat (had no fever tho so it wasn’t corona) I called back in and said “hey I think I got strep-throat and I wanna go get tested” and all this woman had to say was “so, you’re not coming in?” I responded saying “it’s an airborne illness” she just said “K, BYE” and hung up on me :|
It’s been a week since I’m back and I got two shifts this week and next week :|. Which I only was able to make it to one of those shifts because I have karate on Tuesday’s 7-8 and she always gives me 5-9 shifts on Tuesday and I have to tell her every week I can’t do 5-9 shifts on Tuesdays. This time I switched shifts with my friend cuz I didn’t only wanna have one shift this week and when I told her she said “if he doesn’t show up for ur shift on Tuesday it’s on you.” I kinda wished I reposted with “then stop giving me shifts in the only day I can’t work” but I just said “ok” cuz I’m not really sure what I should do.....



Also when I started working I worked 9-5 shits usually...but I have my drivers test at the end of the month so I signed up for lessons. And all my lessons where twice a week from 11-12 but she was so lazy to write down my schedule and just said “I don’t give you shifts before 1” so I also stopped getting 8 hour shifts and only been working 4-5 hour shifts since October ._.",21Oct2020,1

Ok so I’m single and never had a proper relationship. I get a message from this attractive girl and we talk for hours on text and then she flirts with me and snaps me nudes.

We talk some more and then we decides she wants to hook up with me and arranges a date for me to just rock up at her house. We keep talking and talking and then she says that she’ll tell her life story and I say ok and listen.

She was raped twice as a teenager and one of them she miscarried a pregnancies she got after one of the sexual assaults and suffers from depression,anxiety and panic attacks.

After hearing this, I realised that I think that he’s hyper-sexual because of her trauma and hooking up with her would be taking advantage. Why would she hit me up and be so flirty I thought and then when she told the story it was because she has a lot of issues stemming from her trauma.

This was unexpected, so I asked him what the problem was. He says that ""this doesn't pay enough, and that he's failing school anyway (4 year school for this trade), there's no way he's going to pass, so I'm going to quit and go into the military""....this was condensed

After a while minutes of arguing, verbal only, I tell him it's up to him, but he either needs to finish the job or quit. He walks away and says he'll finish it an then quit.

Here is some background which will be needed to understand where I come from: This friend of mine has been iffy throughout the last 2 years of our friendship and I feel like I put in a lot more than I got out of it. In the past year or 2 I have mostly been asked to ""hang out"" when he needs a ride to pick up weed or food(he doesn't have a license). This never bothered me when it was occasional but it happens nearly every time we hang out. He also began using other substances I don't support like LSD and shrooms and hasn't been the same person since. We don't talk like I do with my other friends who I go to and tell personal things but I have spent the most time with him because he is free the most and I felt obligated to hang out with him. He has his days where we get along great but has recently been rude and overall not the best friend. I also don't want to watch him go down the path he is and potentially ruin his life with drugs.

The situation: He and I recently had an argument which ended up with him storming out and running the night we were having. I had tried to reason with him and was even trying to apologize before it escalated but he wasn't hearing it and ignored what I was saying. I in return decided to not respond to his messages for the past couple days because honestly this situation put me past trying to fix out friendship. I feel like an asshole for just ending it like this but when I have tried to in the past I have gotten sucked back into it and gotten back into smoking and drinking with him(which I am currently trying to quit). I feel like this is the only way out of the situation where I will actually stay away from those habits and get on with my life. He has recently tried messaging and calling me both of which I ignored but feel shitty about doing. Should I be handling this differently?

204,"21 year old male lives with his parents in the midwestern USA as he finishes up college online. I am posed to work in the corporate world after graduating, and am not too concerned about finding a job. 

Even prior to covid isolation, I have had trouble socializing/relating with others my age. I do not understand the obsession with partying, drinking, getting laid, etc. 

I would consider myself an introvert, but possess the social skills to survive among extroverted corporate-types. 

I crave a larger purpose in life, once of significance. I do not wish to be like my father, or various uncles before me who have no hobbies, and spend all their time working to provide for a family. It is for this reason I do spend any time pursuing women atm. 

I have a few hobbies, but they are solitary activities and only serve as temporary distractions. I exercise moderately and read rigorously, but feel I must apply what I have gained. 

I would like to travel internationally (alone), but alas Covid is not allowing for that. 

So here I sit in solitude as I have for most of my life. I have not had true ""genuine"" friends since highschool, and realize that dwelling in the past is not healthy. 

I have made plenty of new acquaintances, but no friends. Everyone is seemingly pursuing the collectivist path of get a good job, reproduce, and rinse and repeat.

Next year, if covid isn't over, I'm going to buy a motorcycle because I'm craving euphoria. This is coming from someone who has always been risk-averse.

I broke up with my ex 12 years ago...

Background Info: 

* I am not, nor do I claim to be perfect
* During the course of our relationship, I grew quite close to their family
* Drugs/alcohol/abuse were **NOT** a factor in our breakup. However, 
   * my ex was repeatedly making the same-ish mistakes 
   * spending saved $ irresponsibly 
   * not asking for help 
   * not following through on important things (even after getting help sometimes) 
   * prioritizing the wrong thing(s)
* I reached my breaking point and (obviously) ended the relationship 
* I **do not** regret the breakup. In hindsight, I **do** regret 1) The timing of it, and 2) My choice of words when doing so 
   * I have a strong feeling that their family was/is? *very* angry with me about the timing/wording of the breakup
* Afterwards, we crossed paths on a fairly regular basis for a few months - work locations in close proximity to one another. We chatted on occasion (pleasantries, peacefully). I eventually started a new job
* After starting my new job, we never saw each other again and never spoke again 
* Despite their (aforementioned) mistakes, in the grand scheme of things - *MY EX WAS A GOOD PERSON*

I found out that my ex passed away recently, under very tragic circumstances. I missed the viewing, funeral, everything. I'm feeling a lot of emotions. I'm mourning. It's hard to explain...

**All of this said**, I would like to reach out to the family in some way to express my condolences. However, I'm seriously concerned that I/expressing condolences would not be welcome. 

* Donations to a select few charities were requested in leu of flowers, and I would like to donate to them regardless

**SO - What do I do? Do I reach out to the family? If so, how? Should I just make some donations and leave it at that?**

Advice and suggestions are appreciated.

Thank you.",21Oct2020,1
209,"Life just feels like a train wreck. I fell in love and got married to my wife six years ago and we moved to Europe escaping life in a crime ridden country (like five million others since). We started to study and discovered we wouldn’t be able to get our savings out of our native country, which we were counting on to pay for tuition and life here. 

We powered through and graduated, going into debt and having an exceptionally hard time to find a decent job for the kind of degrees we obtained. We also got pregnant, without trying (and trying to be really careful). In spite of the circumstances, our child was truly a blessing. 

I finally was able to get a decent job in a large company, while my wife took care of our child for a year. I was (for reasons I’ll explain next) unable to keep the position and got put on PIP and straight up fired a year and a half into the company. Fully unemployed with wife, child, rent and all payments to make and cover. Since then I haven’t found any position that pays anything remotely similar. I’ve been on at least fifty interviews and applied to over 1000 positions and no real luck. Wife has also been unable (and unwilling) to look for a job herself as she claims our child needs her and we have no support system here. No family or anyone to take care of our child while we work. 

Since last year, our child has been diagnosed with Mild ASD and it has really put things into perspective for me, as I see many patterns of my behavior mirrored in him. Especially a lack of concentration and follow-through, as well as an inability to focus to finish a full string of tasks. After observing this i’m going to talk to a psychiatrist to try and get whatever medical help is possible for my ADD to be diagnosed and treated. 

That said, and with the shithole 2020 has been, it still leaves me in the awful situation of having to find a job or something for income in this market with no supplemental income from my wife, as she’s neither concentrating on finding work nor willing to talk about any possible way to help me make ends meet. Our child has finally started at a school that should help us, and she finally has some free time, but refuses to discuss employment options. It’s incredibly frustrating and tiring. We’re reaching our third month without paying rent, about to be evicted, and have less than 100 eur for groceries for the foreseeable future. 


I crossposted this to /r/offmychest but I need to hear something, anything as to what my next step should be. Any suggestions will be very appreciated.

211,"I am a first year in college, and I live in a dorm that is co-ed but girls and guys are separated by floor. I live on one of the girls’ floors, which is also the floor of the main entrance to the dorm. What I’m going to talk about now are only two incidents, but they were troubling nonetheless. 

1.) Closer to the beginning of the school year, there was continued knocking at my dorm room door. It was around 2 am or so, so I went to check through the peep hole of my door to see who it was. My roommate hadn't gotten to campus yet, and it was late at night, so I decided to just check instead of opening the door unless it looked like an emergency. All I catch a glimpse of are some guys walking away from my door. I figured they maybe realized they knocked on the wrong door or something, so I tried to go back to bed. Then, not long later, I hear the knocking again in addition to **the door handle on the other side being tried and tried, and the door shaking/shifting from someone trying to get in.** To say the least, as a not very strong young woman alone at 2am in my room and not knowing anyone, there's no way I open the door. I was really scared that they might actually open the door despite the keycard locks. I could hear them going down the hall, knocking, trying other doors, and laughing, and all I could do was lay in bed, really scared. I texted my RA (who lives in the room next to mine), but she didn't see my texts or hear the people doing this. She didn't know until later that morning but assured me that if she had known, she would have yelled at them. 

I figured that maybe the guys were just drunk and being stupid, or maybe they really did intend to do something... bad, to say the least, but either way, I hadn't opened my door and didn't find out. Because of these things, I tried not to think about it though I did warn my roommate about it when she arrived (we knew each other before college).

Then came event #2.

2.) This happened only a couple nights ago from when I'm writing this. My roommate was hanging out with her friends (somewhere out of our room) as it was a weekend night, and I was trying to settle down and go to sleep. Around the same time as the first event (2am), I hear someone knock at my door. I pulled on some sweatpants as I thought it might have been my roommate who forgot her keycard or something. Nevertheless, as I hadn't gotten a text from her and because it was 2am, I looked through the peep hole first. I saw three guys I did not recognize, and I swear I heard one of them say ""...no one's answering, so I'll just say I got three tonight..."" I include ""..."" because I'm not sure exactly what they were saying, but that's what it sounded like. I know for certain though that one of them started to rattle off girls' names, definitely ones that belonged to girls in my hall. I saw them knock on someone else's door before they walked out of sight. I couldn't sleep until my roommate got back (around 4am), and I told her about all this.

I haven't gotten hurt or anything from these events, but I'm still really worried. I haven't told my RA about the second event, but I'm not sure whether or not I should. I don't want to overreact, but I also don't want to be worried/scared about random dudes trying to knock/get into my room at 2am. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and I will just say now that I will not open my door if this happens again because I don't want to invite any possibility of getting harmed.

213,"My (23F) sister (21F) is in a narcissistic relationship and I am trying to get her to see that she needs to get out before it's too late but she won't listen to me. 

A little back story to lead to tonight: My sister we will call her Sarah got with her boyfriend we'll call asshat about 4 months ago. At first asshat seemed okay and was making her happy ( Sarah has a history of mental health problems that she is working on.) Sarah has two kids under 2 years of age from a past relationship (father is not involved) and asshat has a child under 1 year of age (baby momma heavily in picture). Asshat took Sarah and her kids in with ease and made a future look bright for them.

About 2 weeks into their relationship Sarah told me that asshat was only off on weekends and he would rather spend time with his friends than with her. I told her that she should communicate her feelings about wanting to spend more time with him because maybe he didn't think it was a problem. It didn't work he still continues to spend his weekends with his friends, and when he does stay with her he stays outside the whole time getting drunk and high while she tends to her kids. 

A month into their relationship she finds out that him and his baby momma are real close. Meaning they talk crap about their spouses to each other and then play it off like its no big deal. 

He has said to her "" our relationship isn't going to work if you can't get over your insecurities"" after she found that he still had old naked pictures of his baby momma and screen shots of dirty messages between them. And when she confronted her about it he told her that wasn't what he meant and that he meant that she just needs to work on her insecurities. Had a text on his phone from an unknown number saying he was at their house, and told Sarah he didn't know who it was.

Asshats dog bit one of her kids and he brought out a gun in front of her children and friend and threatened to shoot the dog in front of them all. 

He told her they can't get married if she can't hold down a job. Sarah has trouble holding down a job because of her mental health problems. She can't sleep at night and her baby has collic so she would sleep through her alarms. 

And the latest thing, she told me that he shaved his pubic area (has not shaved their whole relationship) and does not want to be intimate with her. 

I told her that she needs to leave and never look back. That her children and her deserve better than that. And now she is mad at me telling me that she will never vent to me again about her problems and that she won't be coming around me anymore. How can I make her see that her relationship is super unhealthy and she needs to leave asshat for good. 

TLDR: My sister is with a narcissistic asshole and won't listen or reason with me when I tell her that she needs to get out of there for good.",21Oct2020,1

Carl and Jess kinda had a toxic friendship nearing the end where every single day they would fight over everything and nothing. So, Carl quickly lost any feelings he had.

I had no idea any of this was going on and honestly I always thought they were just friends. I knew they had a thing but I didn’t know anything went farther than cuddling and whatever. So, I began to get closer with Carl and we started going out a lot. Jess began to get jealous and texted me to give her time to hang out with Carl. It was weird but I went along with it a bit despite it feeling like I was treating him as a possession.

Then, it happened. Carl and I started dating and we had to tell Jess. Jess scratched and hit Carl when she heard the news and texted me she was actually in love with him and I never knew. She always said she had absolutely no feelings for Carl and they were just friends. Carl had no idea she liked him until Carl and I got together. 

Most this situation is behind us and Carl and I been together for abt a month now but I can’t help but feel like a homewrecker.",21Oct2020,1

He invited her to his house which I am a little creeped out by. She jokingly texted me earlier if she dies I am in *town name*. She also said she would try to call me when she was on her way to work at her third shift job. Should I be concerned? I don't want to be a weirdo in case she is simply spending the night with him, since they are grown adults and can do whatever they would like.",21Oct2020,1
218,So I’m in college and have a lot of classes with this girl that I was interested in. I got her snap and basically talked exclusively about school work for months. Didn’t talk over the summer and it was her birthday a couple weeks ago and I told her happy birthday. And we’ve talked about class several times since. I just asked her if she wanted to go get coffee and study sometime and just got left on read. I mean clearly she isn’t interested. But should I say anything to her? How do I make things not awkward the next time we have in person class together? We’re bound to have a lot of classes.,21Oct2020,1
219,"So my chest felt heavy yesterday when I was in the shower, and I could breathe but I felt strained while doing so. today it was worse and I had a full on panic attack because of it, screaming and crying. My chest felt heavy whenever I was upright, standing. It was fine when I was propped up on my elbow earlier after the feeling had passed earlier, but now when I sit upright I feel it too. I feel like my breathing isn’t shallow, but like the air isn’t going to my lungs all the way or maybe the blood flow is less than it should be ?? Does anyone please know what could be happening. I’m very concerned and don’t know what to do. My parents wouldn’t take me to the hospital but I wanted to go because that’s how freaked out I was and how bad I felt. I have never experienced anything like this in my life before today. I’m 18 years old and have anxiety, but I haven’t had severe panic attacks on a continuous basis since about 2 years ago. Also, I’ll mention that in the shower today, when the feeling started, I was a little worried but not to the point where I think my own panic could cause this feeling and the intensity of it.

I’m applying to some universities and art schools but I know even with FAFSA and possibly scholarships if I get some won’t make up the tuition. So as a plan B I’m thinking of working during my time off before the fall semester starts. So when I asked my parents they said no because I wasn’t ready and compared me to another person who already has a job and wants to drop out of college because of how much money the company is paying them. I know it’s hard especially in this time and I know community college is an option, which is something in applying to as well. But I want to start helping them since their getting older but they don’t want to. They don’t want me to worry about this and I’m going to be 18 next year. I don’t even know how to drive and I asked them and they said no and not even my older sibling won’t teach me when we have free days off. They won’t pay someone and I don’t know if I should be worried or start helping out once I’m 18. I might be in the wrong but sometimes I feel like I can’t be myself or choose things for myself, even in the next few hrs when I’m over 18 because they don’t believe I should move out unless I get married.

222,"Basically I've had this friend over a game called roblox for the past 10 months now. He was 22 and I was 16/17 during these times. Up until August, I'd say things were getting pretty intense. 
In August, me and my friend got super duper close. We'd talk everyday and we'd play games together 24/7. He was also a developer on the game, so I'd join him and help his game frequently... At least almost everyday for these past 10 months id interact with him. We grew a huge bond and we were like best friends.
While in the midst of August, I'd notice that he'd sometimes get really close to me in the game and he knew my age too. I was 16, he knew that. Sometimes he'd hump me, kiss me, get in my face and hug me, pick me up, drag me away from my friends, want my attention on him 24/7, tell me what to do (because I was one of his workers for his game) and he'd always just be there .. like standing behind me holding me. He'd also spank me too, have me sit on his lap, and he'd just stare at me sometimes. I didn't really mind it though because I thought he was just being friendly and it's also just him, I was used to it and I was comfortable with him so I let it happen. 

This happened also in September aswell.

I ended up noticing that he started doing these more of actions frequently before my birthday, fast forward, I ended up turning 17 in october and around that time he ended up telling me he liked me. 
I told him I liked him too, I really did... But I know I shouldn't have and that it was stupid to because he is

1. 22 years old and I'm 17.
2. I've never seen him before.
3. He drinks and he smokes.
4. He was on probation.
5. Hed also hang around other minors in the game too, but I thought it was normal because he always did? Like we were all friends.

All of this didn't come to me at the time because I thought he was my friend and I trusted him with a passion. We'd always talk and he'd tell me about him, I'd tell him about myself too. We knew each other for ten months so I thought everything would be perfectly fine between us and that everything was okay.
When my friend told me he liked me, I brought up our age difference and said ""you're 22 and I'm barely 17"". He ended up saying that the laws were different there and that the age of consent was 16 (oklahoma) so I just went with it... Mind you I'm in California.

After that whole thing went down, all the flirtatious acts he did continued for a while until I started getting depressed about the whole situation a week later. I began to notice that this may be wrong, but I was confused because he was my friend and we had a close bond. He was my best friend... I noticed He would also hang around other girls that were minors too and it made me sad because I thought that maybe I wasn't the only one? This continued for a few days until I finally got sick of him playing with me for days.

I eventually unadded him and ghosted him out of nowhere because I was not in a really great mental state at the time because of him basically. A day later he messaged me and asks why I unadded him, I told him I got upset and I was confused because of the actions he was doing and he told me it made no sense. After than I said ""Why?"" And I never received a message back. 
Another day passes and I end up joining his game to talk it out with him. He ended up ignoring me most of the time and acting very rude towards me. I apologized and explained to him why I dissapeared. He told me he didn't care and he said I'm obligated to do whatever I wanted because I'd be in his game most of the time and I had asked ""Do you want me to never come back"". After thatt I had asked ""Could you at least tell me how you feel"" and he told me that he was tired and that he was getting off. I pleaded for him to stay so I could talk it out with him but he left anyways.

After that I got off and cried because I lost a great friend. 

Also in the middle of this, I had told another really close friend what had happened between me and the 22 year old. he told me he was a pedophile, but I thought he wasn't because I thought he genuinely liked me so I skipped over the fact that he was 22.

My friend on the game was pretty popular and known (the one I told). But After that whole thing went down with the 22 year old, my popular friend on the game decided to copy one of the 22 year olds games and make his own. While this was happening, rumours started going around about the 22 year old that he was a pedophile. It spread very quickly throughout the community and most of his supporters hate him now. His supporters play my friends new game that he had made based off the 22 year olds, and the 22 yr old got really pissed because he thought we had stolen his game and visitors.

60-70% of his supporters has turned on him and turned to my friends new game. We all ended up shutting down his community on discord and he tried to defend himself by saying we're all lying, we were trying to steal his money, game and visitors. He also stated I put myself on him and he didn't touch me, which made me really sad.

After all this happened, I sent him a message saying why couldn't you just talk to me about it? (I was blocked so I had to send it through somebody else). I got no reply once again. The 22 year old had blocked most of his own community due to all of us finding out, once he was confronted about his actions hed also block that player too and run away. He stated he tried to tell his side of the story but he keeps blocking everyone once we try to talk to him.

I honestly feel sad. I feel like shit too because I thought he  was my friend and we had made alot of memories together in these past 10 months, all just to get blocked in the end. I wish I never unadded him because none of this would have happened really, I do miss him because he was my friend but things started unravelling and it made me realize that he was... Gross, I honestly just don't know anymore. I've been thinking about this for the past two weeks and I'm just confused on the outlook of it all.

Any advice or insight on this would be appreciated, thanks...",21Oct2020,1
223,"(21F) I’m the type of person that has few very close friends. Once I become close I can’t really break that bond and I feel like I’m a loyal and caring friend but only with people I trust and love. One major issue I have is my insecurity of being easily replaceable. I always feel like my friends will forget me and find someone else to become close with. I know it’s so silly. Idk I feel so strongly about this. Nothing traumatic has happened to warrant this feeling. I just have had relationships where we just stop talking. And it makes me feel sad that the people I’m close with don’t feel as attached as I do I guess. Which I know isn’t fair. I just hate this feeling so much. Like I know it’s okay for people to lose touch or to not talk constantly or to just not be as close. But I just don’t wanna lose the people I love... 
how do I stop feeling this way and overcome this?",21Oct2020,1
224,"I attended college for 4 years and obtained a B.S. in an engineering field. Towards the end of my 4th year I realized that although I had this degree that allotted me plenty of job opportunities, I still didn’t have a great idea of what specific field I wanted to go into. I decided to jump right into a graduate program to give myself another year to think about it. 

Halfway through my graduate degree I found that I wanted to work in field A after I graduated. However, I still decided to apply to jobs in fields A,B,C, etc. to increase my chances of employment. I ended up landing an entry level job in field B. Not only is field B not my preferred field of employment, I didn’t need a masters degree to obtain my current position, and it doesn’t pay me any more money than my peers who only have Bachelor degrees.

I’m 3 weeks into this role and so far I enjoy it. I like my coworkers, it’s challenging enough to keep me busy and stimulated, there is plenty of room for growth throughout the company and the industry, and the company atmosphere is great.  

While I realize I was fortunate enough to land a job at this time given the current circumstances in the world, I just can’t help shake the feeling that I wasted a year of my life for no reason. I put myself further into debt for a degree that is unrelated to my role and will collect dust on my desk.

So should I bite the bullet and stay in this industry for the foreseeable future? Should I try to put in a few years here and possibly change fields later in life (which of course would result in a pay cut)? Should I immediately start applying to jobs in my preferred field while still working at my current job? I’m pretty lost on which path to take.",21Oct2020,1
225,"(sorry for any typos i’m on mobile)

i’m a 13 y/o boy that’s currently in high school, i suffer from ADHD and im being medicated for it. i have difficulty following through with tasks, needing constant reminders. the listening isn’t that much of a problem, it’s just me not doing work automatically. and that you can understand.. because of my ADHD. the meds aren’t there to cure me of the conditions temporarily, they’re there to temporarily lessen the effects of it to the point where it’s manageable.

now this is where the story starts. i have a close friend which i’ll call F. now i’ve known F since grade one. he’s been in my life for a long time and we were always friends since we met. he’s a smart guy, always getting good marks and always knowing the best way to handle things. then there’s me who gets decent marks but rarely makes the right decisions. but nevertheless we’re pretty close.

so at the start of this school year, me and him were put in the same class but our other close friend wasn’t. me and him spend most of our time in class together. yet the problem arises when we have to do partner projects.
F never picks me to be his partner and picks some of the popular guys to be partners with. i also try doing the same and ask one of the popular guys and they say “aw hell no. your just gonna fool around and not do any work”.
that hurts a lot.. it’s something that i can’t control. i want to do work but it always ends up with the other person doing all of the work. but i always brushed this off and either did the work myself or got grouped up with one of the guys that don’t know english too well.

however, yesterday i had a talk with my friend. it went like this:
i went up to him and asked him why he never wants to be partners with me, and that i want to be partners with him but he instantly asks to be partners with the popular guys. he says that it’s because i never do anything, that i always leave everything to him. that i don’t necessarily fool around, i simply don’t do any work. and i tried to explain to him that i need to be told what to do. he didn’t respond or i likely didn’t hear his response.

i was really hurt by that. i wanted to tell him that it’s out of my control. that i want to and i’m willing to do work. that i’ll put in the effort and that for the next parter task, i’ll prove it to him that i can do the work, i’ll literally do all of the work if needed.
i’ve done a lot of self reflecting since that, but i can’t figure out how to improve myself. and this is why i’m asking you guys, how can a guy with ADHD improve himself to the point where people will be willing to be partners with him?

i summarized most of this, so feel free to ask me if anything seems off.

228,"

So I'll try and give as much context as i can without making the story too long. 

Background history. We were together for almost 3 years. We broke up a few months ago in June after a pretty shit year of lots of fights. Pretty sure last time we had sex was January. 
Anyways after we broke up i found out she started fucking her ex. Someone she said she hated and that the sex wasn't that great with. 
When we spoke she told me how she regretted it and when i asked her why she said she just wanted to be around someone she felt safe with. She then proceeded to say that she actually doesn't feel safe around him emotionally and that the only attraction is that he's tall. So naturally my question was why not come to me if it was just about sex and she said she didn't want to. Fair enough.
I'm not going to lie the fact that she went back to him so soon after we ended hurt. It was about a week or two. 
Anyway we started sort of speaking recently and today while talking (first time we've actually spoken normally and naturally) she essentially/literally asked if we should have sex. 
Now while it's sort of a no brainer it's also a bit complicated because truth be told even though I felt it was right that we broke up I didn't want to and i am fairly certain i still have feelings for her and I'm definitely still hurt about the post breakup behavior.
And additionally when i spoke to her and asked if she was still sleeping with her ex she said yes and is in fact staying over tomorrow. I asked if they're together and she said that she'd never be with someone like him and that really the main reason is because she doesn't like being at her place and it's a chance to get away from home situation.
When she first got with him after we broke up and i asked her why because she alway claimed the sex was shit and claimed best sex she ever had was with me. Which is why I'm confused why she didn't come to me but i was understanding and actually picked up her spirits because she was distraught at the time and not even about our breakup but about her recent escapade with her ex.
So anyway my dilemma, should i start having sex with her if she's being serious? 
It's a head fuck.

232,"My brother is 22(M) years old, I'm 19 (F), because of the pandemic I'm back at home and he's been making things really difficult. He locks the kitchen because he likes to work in the dining room which is connected to the kitchen so I'm not able to make food except when he allows me to unless I get my parents involved which I don't want to do and when he does let me in he says things lik ""5 minutes and then your out"" ""get out now."" 

He's just been really aggravating me, sometimes he's sweet and then other times he's just really cruel. He has said nice things like ""your smart"" and talented and I think he says this because he feels guilty for what he calls me the other half of time. 

He suspected me of taking an old pair of his glasses from his suitcase which I did not do and so he grabbed my glasses and trashed my room and crushed all the sculptures i made . I was not able to see and because I'm in college in a difficult university I wasn't able to have my glasses for my work and suffered as a result. He justified this action by saying they were his, and they were once but I've been using his old pair for a year now and he has multiple pairs of glasses. He uses my glasses  as a  way to control me and as sort of bargaining power. He also exploded the other day because I had more juice than him and clenched his teeth and raged at me: food is always an issue with him.

He also calls me manipulative and a brat, makes fun of my voice and my skinnyness. He also always used to make fun of my intelligence. He is very accomplished academically as he went to an Ivy  and got a prestigious scholarship after graduation. He also got into a selective high school and middle school in NY which I did not. He would always tell me I wouldn't get in and uses his greater academic success as leverage against me because he knows it hurts.  All in all he has really effected my self esteem. And I too feel guilty because I snap at him and call him selfish when he gets angry at me. I question weather I'm the manipulative one, but logically I don't think I am: I have never witheld his things or food from him. His proffesors all seem to love him so often I question my own reading of the situation and how I can see such a different side to him. 

I think he just has controlling tendencies but I need advice on how to deal with living with him during this pandemic. Because he is quick to anger the house is also always noisy so I find it hard to study.

As a child of immigrant parents I feel like he he is able to get away with a lot because he is so accomplished academically. But anyways any suggestions on how to live with him would be appreciated and how to stop myself from exploding back at him when he tries to control me.",21Oct2020,1

As stated earlier we have been away from them roughly a year ago now I noticed my friend has added them back on social media even though my friend recently vented to me how glad to be finally not involved with them anymore.

I do marketing, selling a product, games are a product. A lot of things I could do for free to improve any small project. But a rando on the internet is not somebody you want with your whole budget. So not a useful skill.

I do design, I know player psychology and how to design the first five minutes to impress and introduce ew player as. But it’s a dime a dozen skill that any small team would rather do themselves. Useful, but over saturated.

I do playtesting, which for game development is crucial to finding bugs and larger design issues. But small teams would rather do that themselves. Unwanted.

Production skills, coding, art, music, I have none. I know how each piece works in a design perspective, roughly how to edit them, some bug fixing, but can’t make anything on my own.

I don’t have a degree, that kind of dept for irregular, unstable, and competitive work is a bad investment. I get by on self teaching, but resources are limited.

Speaking of money, I have none. And I live far, FAR away from hotspots, so I purely lack any peers, teachers, or non internet based resources.

241,"My whole life I have always wanted to be a nurse but I never make the grades. I always feel disappointed and less then. I then gave up on the dream because I realized maybe somethings just aren’t meant to be and maybe a part of me loved the idea of being a nurse but never really fully understood what it truly meant. I was also going through a really dark time mentally, so everything hurt more. 

Years passed since then and I started fostering dogs. Around this time, something in me changed. I became happier and now I have two dogs of my own. I went on to a animal care program in a community college and I was sooo happy to do so. Until I met someone who changed my perspective about my career choice. They said I would never make enough money and everyone in the field would always look down on me for being the lowest rank, being a animal care attendant. It hurt me so much and I I’ve always been insecure so it really got to me.  

Recently, with my horrible part time job in retail and being in school for animal care, I’ve never wanted more to go for my dreams and achieve the most. I keep thinking about nursing for that reason but my heart keeps telling me I have a part to play in animal care still.

Can anyone help me with this :( feeling lost and confused.",21Oct2020,1
242,"Hi. I'm 17F, and I know this may sound weird to hear coming from a teenager, but maybe this will help some people.

Recently, I've been going through a tough patch. I'm in grade 12 and I got put with a teacher that makes my class even more difficult for me, and I'm just barely passing. He's very vague when I ask him questions and I feel like I'm supposed to know everything despite not knowing. I have tried to get out of this class but he said I would be fine and I didn't want to switch around my entire schedule.

I'm practically lost two of my best friends to someone I heard was talking about me + others (in a bad way). I used to be good friends with this person, but then two close friends of mine had mentioned they were doing that. I won't completely assume this is the case, but I've decided it may be better to avoid that person.

I told my friends about my situation with that person, and I said it 2-3 times, just to have it swept under the rug. Now my one close friend is dating them. Which is fine, they can do whatever they'd like, but I feel very betrayed because I *told* them and they've formed their own circle. It was very mean, and it's bugged me for months. I'm definitely going to tell them, it's just a matter of when and how. I don't want things to be awkward for our last year, but they have to know because I shouldn't be the only one going through this.

Awhile ago, I lost my rabbit. I had him for 8 years, and I had just gotten out of a social exam. My mom called me to tell me he had passed away. He was being treated for an infection which had been going on for maybe a month. I had to put ointment on him 3x a day, I had to feed him medication, and I had to put eyedrops in his eye 2x a day. When I heard he died, I had felt like I failed him. 

In the end, I got a 53 on my social exam.

Since then, I'd been failing everything. Biology, Math, Social. I was putting in the effort but never getting what I aimed for. Even now, I'm still struggling. 

My knee did a thing it hadn't done for months, and now I have to see a doctor for it.

On top of that, I'm trying to lose a little weight for my grad and all this stress isn't helping. 

Things have been terrible these past few months and I've barely been holding on. I don't even know what I've been holding onto. 

I've prayed and begged for better things to come my way, and slowly they have been coming.

I made my teacher a good luck card for her cancer surgery and got the class to sign it. I got her flowers. Just yesterday, she said she'd like to pay me back by buying a hoodie from our school (I really wanted one, and you can get more than just the hoodie). I was really happy to see that. I finally felt like good things were happening.

My grades are picking up and I'm recovering from the loss of my rabbit. My friends, even the ones who I felt had ditched me, asked if I was doing okay because I was missing some school. I don't feel as alone anymore.

Not everything is getting better for me, but even just a little bit is better than nothing.

So please, if you're going through a tough time right now, don't give up just yet. Find reasons to carry on, even if it's something as small as getting a learners or doing something that makes you feel happy. Good things will eventually come, we just gotta earn it or wait for it.",21Oct2020,1

245,"Ever since high school ended I have never been the same. Since the end of high school I have been depressed. If you look at my history I really liked this girl who liked me at one point and I never took the chance to date her and regretted it heavily. But that is not even the problem now. Ever since high school I have missed my friends. Almost half of them moved away but I was at least happy half of them stayed. However a few months ago my best friend said he was moving away. When I got the news I fell apart. This friend has been there for me all through my depression and every challenge I have been through. When ever I just wanted to end my life he was the only one I could talk to and he would always be there for me. 

We hung out almost everyday and now that he is moving away I don’t know what I am going to do. I made a lot of money while running my business in high school and now it makes me 300k dollars a year. But I have realized that my money has never fixed shit for me. No matter what I do my life gets worse and I can’t stop it. I try to think of a solution but nothing works. At first he was hesitant to move so I offered him to stay at my house but he didn’t want me paying for him. Which I technically wouldn’t cause I have free rooms in my house he can stay in that costs me nothing. He also started to realize moving might be a new adventure for him and started liking the idea more.

People have certain passions and things that make them happy in life that makes life worth it. For me that thing that makes me the happiest is just hanging and being with my friends. But sadly I may have escaped the rat race but none of my friends have. It really makes me feel lonely. I hate to say it but I believe I really did peak in high school when I had the most friends I have ever had and a good social life. Now those times are over and I will never get them back. Idk I just wish there was a way to fix all this. What do you guys think I should do? Thanks for listening",21Oct2020,1

Orginally it was planned to be closed by the end of March/April but thats also when everything shut down due to Covid.

 I've been given 3 different deadlines of when my pay would go back to full but they allways seem to come and go. The current one is ""end of 2020"". Its not just me having to deal with this either, I have two other co-workers I know for sure that are taking hits as well. At this point my back pay is over 20k and I'm not sure what to do.

250,"This is a long story so bare with me. A while ago my girlfriend and i cut ties with all of our toxic friends for our benefit, unfortunately that happened to be almost all of our friends. Her best friend who she cut ties with has always had a unbelievably obsessive connection with her (can’t stand to see her in a relationship and does everything to ruin the ones she gets in, including ours). After my girlfriend cut ties with her she developed a hatred towards me for “ruining their friendship.” To get revenge she decided to tell my girlfriends mom that we have been doing drugs together, she told other people she did it because she cares but to us we know it’s because she’s jealous.

 

She even told us that we got ourselves into this (implying we deserved to get our relationship ruined). We were on our way to stopping, but my girlfriend has a drug addiction. For me it was just occasionally for fun but it became something that i hated doing and something my girlfriend felt like she had to do to be happy. I was getting her to stop, but with addiction it takes time. Her ex best friend snitching resulted in my girlfriend being grounded and not allowed to see me for right now and it has put a strain in our relationship because now her family hates me and blames me because of these things since i am older than her. Her uncle even tried calling the cops on me to get me arrested for this.

 

I honestly don’t know what to do because the things everyone close to her has said to me or about me makes me truly hate myself. Ever since she’s been grounded i feel a deep hatred towards myself for letting it get this far.  I’m miserable every single day. Ive been trying to get her help but she doesn’t want to because she doesn’t think she has a problem, and if she doesn’t get help everyone who loves her will continue to blame me for this situation when i’ve been doing everything in my power to get her to stop even before they knew about it. She also has developed an eating disorder that people blame me for, even though I’ve been trying to get her to eat, but there’s only so much i can do by myself.


The ex best friend and her cousin recently started a group chat with my girlfriends mom constantly feeding her lies about me and saying that i manipulated her and that she got all the drugs from me which isn’t true at all. They’re making me look bad to her mom and she’s believing everything they’re saying. Her mom even said that the only reason she’s allowing us to stay together is so that my girlfriend doesn’t hurt herself. Her mom also said that she doesn’t believe my girlfriend has an eating disorder. 
 

I feel so lost and to blame for all of this and i truly don’t know how to fix it. How do i get her help when i’m the only one who cares to actually help her? Everyone else’s motives are because they’re jealous and want her to themselves. How do i deal with the fact that everyone blames me for everything that has happened to her?",21Oct2020,1

So I'm a 23F and I have a 9m old baby. I have two associate's, one in History and one in Social and Behavioral Sciences. The original plan was to major in history and become a high school teacher. I was applying to universities when I found out I was pregnant. So I took the year off, Covid hit, and now I'm soley financially dependent on my bf and I'm a SAHM. I need some guidance on what to do. On one hand I want to get a job just to be able to help with the bills, I'm considering being a Bank Teller, a working for the USPS, being a police officer... But on the other hand I want to go back to school, major in Human Resources (where they make the big bucks) but that would require me to start from scratch. The reason I don't want to keep pursuing teaching is because I know they make shit money and have to put up with bureaucracy and shit from parents. Ever since having my daughter I have the strongest urge to get a good job to support my bf and baby and to make my parents proud.

259,"Male 21.

Had a disagreement with my mother last night and made plans to move out. 

Today I talked to her more and explained that maybe I felt like she was treating me like a child and I didn't want that. She agreed and I felt better, and thought maybe she just wasn't aware. 

I cancelled my move out. This is like the 5th time or so I cancelled moving out over the last few months. I feel very insecure about this decision. 

Moving out right now can be a little risky, I'm in my last year of college and I am looking for a job. I have savings I can move on. I also don't have much of a support system. I worry sometimes that I will give up on some things. Like it is safer to just get things by until I graduate, but staying here makes me very frustrated. But outside I don't know if I can handle. 

Today she commented on a personal thing of mine, and I told her that I don't appreciate it. She spent a long time explaining her intention was positive, and that she brought it up since I talked about it a year ago. I said I understand the intention, but I didn't want to be on that close terms, and she agreed, but she requested other things like I had to smile/be happy when I made the request, that even though this topic I brought up a year ago I didn't close the topic. She brought up things from the past that made me uncomfortable and said it was my fault for bringing up the topics, which caused her concern. I asked her not to bring up these topics. Then she said those words are what you said. ....etc. 

I got a feeling that these people won't change, and that I had to leave to handle the situation. 

Eventually she talked about my father and said that he is closed minded, and that I could talk to her and she would be open. And that she would try to understand me, and that I should be grateful for that. I said that truth of the matter is if I can't communicate with someone, then no deal. Then she was like so you're not grateful? I said I appreciate the parts that she does that are great, but all the times she was hurtful makes it 50/50. She became very angry and said when has that happened. I mentioned a time, and she said it doesn't count. 

I had an assignment to do so I told her to finish, and she said if you're grateful why don't you act more grateful. And I said I am grateful for the parts that you do. And she said your father isn't there for you but aren't you grateful that I am open. And then she wanted me to confirm that that was the case. So I basically had to say yes, and she, Ok so you appreciate it, how many percent, 90 percent? And I said yeah.

Am I missing something in this situation? I had done some online counseling on this two months ago and the idea was I can work on my emotions, and that my mother seems to care for me.

I think she seems to want to care but displays it in a bad way, and if it hurts me, then distance might be needed.",21Oct2020,1

I find it extremely difficult to let go of her, especially because I’m trans. 
I feel like nobody will ever love me or see me like a real man like she did. Validate me like she did or make me as confident as she did. Although that period did die, she was the first person in my life to see through all my faults and into my soul. Now that I’m grabbing at the scraps and dust, I feel helpless and in a panic. I can’t help but message her over and over and try to get her back, I feel so pathetic. She’ll wait days to respond and I message in seconds or minutes. I know it’s wrong but idk what else to do. She was and is so special to me, despite how abusive and neglectful she is. I love her for who she is deep down, and idk how to stop.

263,"Alright, I'm gonna give you some backstory. Sorry if I wrote things poorly and fair warning I'm trying to keep it short but it's pretty long.

Okay so I've been friends with two people for about 5-6 years now and they have been my only friends. We all live pretty far away from each other so we only ever text. In the last few years, our text became only for venting and that's about it. None of us are going through a great time and it just has been a steady decline in mental health. Now in particular everything felt like it was falling apart for me and I absolutely just isolated myself. I have done this once before for like a week and when I came back they were mostly understanding and just asked me to warn them first before doing anything like that.

 So when it became all too much again told them I was taking a break and that I'd be back. One of my friends (let's call them Sam) welcomed me back and had no issue (or if they did they didn't say it to me) the other friend though (we'll call them Alex), said that I was ghosting them and Sam and that it was shitty of me to pretend that I was coming back. I was taken aback by the message Alex sent me but I understood because of what Alex has gone through. I did not apologize for not messaging them because I fully needed the break but I did say that I'd never leave without, at the very least, telling them. They quickly apologized said they know I wouldn't, then said it was because of their BD. We dropped it then went back to talking as we normally did. I tried to be more light-hearted but it was always ignored and the convos were just trauma talking.

 I fell hard again into being overwhelmed with everything and went to Sam and Alex for comfort. Alex instead offered a ""solution"" that I didn't want to take and they got mad that I wasn't letting them help me (Sam encouraged me to take the offer but did say that I should do what felt right to me). I asked to stop the convo and that I needed time to myself again. This time I came back sooner and set some boundaries that I really needed Sam responded Alex didn't. I left again feeling like I pissed them off and knowing that I couldn't come back to chat and start talking like everything was fine. There was no normal chatting with them and there hasn't been for a while. I waited for Alex to say anything about the boundaries that I set but nothing. So I texted Alex asking how they were and that I hoped they were doing well and they said ""Sure you do"" they then said that I hurt them and Sam by leaving again after I set my boundaries that they ""both agreed to"" and that I keep Ghosting them. I said sorry again and explained why I left and they said they get that but I had hurt them both a lot and that Sam didn't want to say anything so that they don't risk the friendship between us. 

So here's my problem they told me that they don't want me in and out of their lives and that they'll be hurt for a while. I agreed and told them that's completely understandable and that if I can, I want to make things better and for them to tell me what they'd like me to do to and that if they can't forgive me that's also understandable and to just tell me and I'll leave them alone. They said they'd never do that over something like this and I said I know you wouldn't want to but if we can't fix this and I'm only hurting you that's not good for anyone. I also said I won't leave again unless I know for sure that it'll be the last time and if I feel like I can't be there for them as their friend. 

I don't know how to fix it or approach the situation. I know they want me to talk to them since leaving was the problem but I can't take the constant ranting. What used to be a comforting place to vent and understand each other became a place I have to brace myself before entering. I can feel myself growing resentment and I don't know if I can handle any more of it.",21Oct2020,1

And I don’t mean I watched her get worse and worse until we got the news she had died.

No, she died in front of me. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD at age 13. 

Flash forward about 6 years.

Me and my sister are going over my grades, because I’m not great at school but I’m dedicated to getting a PhD. She was showing me something on the computer when I noticed a couple of “marks” on her legs. I asked about it. Pried about it. She explained what she had been doing. 

I immediately started to panic and start lecturing her. We called our Mama and we had worked through it, and my Mama is going to call the counseling office tomorrow about it.

Now, I am happy that she is going to get help. But I am terrified. Terrified that what happened years ago would happen to my older sister. Scared to sleep because I’m scared I’m going to have a nightmare, as I used to.

I’ve brought up to him on multiple occasions that if things are too rough for him, it’s okay to break up with me. 

And honestly, if he did that, I’d kinda feel relieved?? I don’t know if it’s cause I’m tired of the relationship or it’s the fatigue of being away from people cause of quarantine. I love him more than anything but I just can’t tell what I’m feeling anymore.",21Oct2020,1
268,"Sorry in advance for the long post, hopefully it’s not too hard to follow...
My husband has always been a hard worker when it comes to his actual career, but at home he acts completely clueless about everything from home responsibilities to raising our children. 
Since we have been together (8 years now) we’ve had plenty of arguments about things like, him spending way too much time playing video games, staying up until 4am most nights and not helping around the house. I have overlooked/put up with a lot of this because overall we enjoy our time with one another when things are going well and he is responsible with the financial side of our relationship. It’s the addiction to his phone/video games and ignoring my needs and the responsibilities of being a parent and a home owner that bother me the most.

In March, he lost his job due to covid and has been home since.

We had twins in July and since then it has only gotten worse. The shift from being a hard worker and traveling all of the time to being unemployed and staying at home has caused a lot of stress on our relationship and has shown me a side I haven’t really seen fully before. 
Like the laziness around the house. I would always make excuses for him before, since he traveled 4 days a week and I figured he just needs to recharge before leaving again, so I would handle everything like mowing the yard, taking out the trash, laundry, dishes, putting together cribs, I mean EVERYTHING around the house I would do. Even our two year old, I don’t think he has ever given her a bath or has taken her to a doctor appointment.
Now, with the extra stress of no job, and twins added to our family we are both experiencing high levels of stress, but I feel I am getting the most of it, he is currently receiving unemployment compensation and we are living off the rest of his severance package. With him being home for 7 months now, I am starting to wear thin and resent him. 
He hasn’t actively looked for any work, he is holding onto the thought that he can return to his old job. I keep offering to go back to work as a nurse, but with the virus and our 4 children (3 of them being 2 years of age and under) that’s not a real option in his opinion. He sits on the couch all day looking at his phone, watching tv, spending multiple hour long trips to the bathroom, and playing video games all night, while I’m trying to keep it together and care for our children: a 13 year old (from my previous marriage) doing virtual learning, a busy 2 year old, and our newborn twins. On top of taking care of the house, our HOA is super strict we have to make sure the yard and everything else is kept up, also laundry, dishes, cleaning, diapers, feedings etc... this has been thrown to me and I’m drowning. 
When I do tell him I need help with the babies and he tries, he ends up getting super frustrated and cusses at them. He tells them to “shut up!” “What the fuuuck” “little fuckers” “what is wrong with you!!” etc... he is so stressed out and huffs and puffs while trying to care for them. If they spit up on him he throws a big tantrum. 
I am just lost and appalled with his behavior. I feel like he acts like a kid himself and he is 40 years old. I don’t know what to do. I’m so overwhelmed already and I’m scared to ask him for help because he just gets angry with the babies, so I stopped asking for help and now I fume quietly while he sits on the couch staring at his phone. 
At night I sleep in the living room on the couch with the babies (they sleep in their pack n play) and he passes by me at 4am while I’m feeding the twins to go to bed after spending all night upstairs playing his video games. He ignores all other needs to keep up our house. We literally only have sex to conceive children and I’m starting to really question myself on why I’m still with him. I was married young once before right out of high school and that only lasted 4 years. My divorce was a horrible drawn out mess with my first husband and I’m not sure I can go through that again. 

He won’t see a therapist, he won’t even see a doctor for any other problems, and he has gained a lot of weight. I think he must be depressed, but a lot of these things he has been doing since we have met, I just never complained much because he was always working and traveling, so I felt like my contributing financially and taking care of our home was no big deal, it was hard and I did get overwhelmed some but it was nothing like it is now. It’s completely off balance.

My parents live 5 hours away from us and his family live out of state so we are mostly on our own. I just don’t know what to do anymore. Talking to him turns into nasty fights and feels like I’m arguing with a child, he will turn it around on me and not face the facts. I am not perfect at all, but I feel like the weight of our relationship has been placed on entirely on my shoulders. I just don’t know what to do in this situation anymore. Any thoughts?",21Oct2020,1
269,"Earlier today I saw cut marks on my mother's arm. I was about to pass them off as scratches, when I recognized them. They were all of similar depth, and looked to be the same age of each other. I could tell these self harm scars.

I don't want to help her. She thinks my gayness is a phase, and doesn't really engage with me with the things that I love to do. I have my own problems, and I don't think I can properly handle being her therapist.

I find the major to be draining, and it’s not as creative as I thought it would be, it’s really technical and structured. I just don’t have any motivation in me right now for anything. I want to pursue a career that I enjoy and allows me to be creative, but I also want to afford to pay my bills lol. I also kind of want to take a semester off, but I already took a gap year last year and don’t want to take too much off from school, I don’t want to spend all of my 20s being in college. At the same time when I did take my gap year, I still felt miserable just sitting around at home. I don’t know how my parents would feel about me taking more time off or changing my major, but I feel like it wouldn’t be a good reaction.

272,"Throwaway because some of this is my fault nad I feel super guilty. Was going to post this a few days ago but decided against it.

For potentially necessary context, I'm in out of home care because my mum wasn't able to look after me, ended up here when I was 11.

So I guess I'll start from the top, on the 13th at 6pm I lied to my mum about going to school, I don't want to try and justify it, it was wrong of me to lie and I do regret it (not just because of what happened, in hindsight it was definitely wrong) and she reacted rather extremely. She told me to not talk to her until I went to school I said ok because I didn't know how to react.  

At 10:40PM (I was asleep) that night, she messaged me asking if i turned off netflix (I share a netflix account with her, I paid for it at first but then she decided because she was using it just as much as I was she was going to contribute towards it so it wasn't solely on me) then she said if I have to not bother putting it back on because it's a waste of time money and credit then said she isn't getting me anything for Christmas then said if I have turned off netflix that I owe her $20 (price of the gift card she got to help out) by 9am in the morning then after 3 minutes she said to not bother and I might see her one day and I now get nothing from her ever again and she's now blocking me

Then about 30 minutes later I got a voicemail that said ""put netflix on now or you put $20 in my bank tomorrow morning ta 9am. Delete my number block my number and forget all about me""

Then just before midnight I woke up again and said I never took her off of anything and she said not to bother and to take her off and she's moving ""a long way away"" and to never speak to her again"" I ended up just saying ok goodnight because by this point I was tired as hell and needed to sleep to wake up for school at 5am.

Then at 10Am the next day (the 14th) I sent a long message saying I am sorry and that I thank her for getting the netflix card and at 1pm she said ""don't worry"" and asked if I could answer the phone, I said I'd rather talk via text because I didn't want to be screamed at (although I only said I wanted to talk via text) and she asked me why netflix isn't working and I said I want sure but if she gave me some time to wrap my head around this then I'd help her with it on the 15th, she then told me that she threw all of her food out the door (I even clarified this to see if she actually did, and yes she did) then she said that if she can't get it working in 10 minutes she's doing the same to her phone and tablet I told her that is her choice but I don't want her to do that and she didn't message me until 6pm

At 6pm she said she's taking a few days away from everyone And every thing to see if she wants to stay or leave the house she's in and I asked why, no response.

Then on the 15th at 11:50PM she said she was so sorry for all of this and asked me to choose a phone for Christmas, I said that's ok, I don't want anything but thanks for the offer and she said suit yourself (I said no just because I didn't want anything right then, I just wanted to get over this and feel a bit better, I felt like shit by this point)

Then on the 17th I got a message demanding the$20 or she will sue me, and has started abusing me because I'm obese and suffer from binge eating disorder (I really do my best but it's especially hard when this stuff happens) she also told me I am a list and a thief but she always knew I would turn out like this

Now this all really stung, like a lot and I don't know what to do, it's now Wednesday the 21st and I don't know what to do. I know I should not have lied, ever but I think she is really overreacting, I can fully understand her being upset, lying to her was a dick move but saying she will never talk to me again and berating me over something I can't control really hurts.

I know she is mentally unstable and she probably can't help this but it really hurts, I can't make her go to a doctor and I can't call an ambulance to have her mentally evaluated because I don't think she's a risk to herself and I wouldn't even know where to start.

This has all been really affecting me and I want to send an angry message but I don't want to worsen things and I don't want to talk to her but her not saying anything to me. seems to be making me more upset because nothing is happening at all.

TL;DR: I lied about attending school to my mum and she demanded $20 for a gift card she bought me a month ago for a shred netflix account and proceeded to sya really nasty things to me a few times before not talking to me for a while and it's eating me up.

Sorry for nay typos, I'm on mobile and thanks for any advice!",21Oct2020,1

-I took the advice of people, took a gap year, moved to another state, worked, became a manager and realized I never want to be a manager ever again or step foot back into the business world. 
-Things did not work out in that state, moved back home. Always had an inkling to be a teacher. Went to our local community college to get my gen ed’s out of the way and loosely decided I want to be a secondary education teacher but nothing set in stone. 
- The past year i’ve been doing tons of research, reaching out to teachers, got tons of bullshit and backlash from my close family/friends about wanting to be a teacher but really, the way teachers were treated during this pandemic was what stuck the nail in the coffin for me. Decided against teaching. Started looking into other careers and majors. 
-Decided social work. Spoke to social work academic advisors. Ya, never mind of social work. Lol. 
-My hobbies are, reading and taking care of animals. 
(-I do not want to become a vet or vet tech and decided against that long ago. I just enjoy spending my time being a foster mom for animals and taking care of my own. No money in that, just the kindness of my heart to take care of little babies until they are able to be adopted out)
-I struggled with depression in high school and honestly never thought I’d ever survive till 21, so I never thought about careers or cared. Depression is still very bad and still cannot picture myself in any career.
-My back up at this point is doing a CNA internship that costs around $2k and then doing the medical assistant program at our community college however, the most they will ever make will probably be around $20-21. I live in Hawaii. Thats poverty but at least its a job?

281,"this is kind of a small issue but im not sure where else to ask for help.  


one of my friends seems to have a really hard time respecting my boundaries, but i dont know how to ask him for personal space because i dont want to scare him off. hes one of the few people that will put up with me, but the things he does total up to a 'death from one thousand cuts' thing. i dont think hes trying to be overbearing on purpose, but he doesnt give me much personal space and ignores my signals when im trying to get him to back off.  


for example: prior to typing this message, i had my discord status set to do not disturb and a message saying that i didnt want to talk to anyone. this status had been up for a while after some family drama, which he knows has been happening for the past few days and is emotionally draining for me. still, he messaged me repeatedly asking me to do things for him and he got kind of annoyed when i admitted to not feeling ok enough to do what he asked. it is true that he might not have noticed, but this is the kind of thing that happens several times a month. and he starts to get kind of guilt trippy sometimes, which i dont think he really means to do, but its upsetting that he cant take a simple 'can we talk later?'  


theres been other things that he does too, like bothering me to buy expensive new games even when he knows im trying to save up money for important things. when i say no he gets weird and says that i should just tell him if i dont care about him or his interests, but thats not really the case and i dont know how to communicate that to him because he turns into a kicked puppy or gets pissed off. or hell try to insert himself into plans that ive made for myself: he gets really upset if i try to stream a movie alone or with one of the other people i know and sulks for a while until i apologize. every time.  


i dont think hes trying to be malicious or manipulative. i just think that hes kind of lonely, and maybe more attached to me than he should be? so i dont want to set him off, but it drives me up the wall when he blocks me from doing stuff without him or ignores when i say no to things. is there any way to tell him to respect my wishes without sounding like i dont appreciate his friendship?  


TL;DR: my friend gets annoyed and passive aggressive when i dont want to talk or when i want to do things with other people. how can i explain to him that this behavior is exhausting without being mean? am i just overreacting? i dont want to lose one of my few friends. kept really vague because i dont know if he uses reddit.",21Oct2020,1

Anyways,

I’m 26 and recently decided to become a Mortgage loan originator. I lost my debt collections job 4 months ago due to covid and and have been living off savings ever since and am completely out of money.

I’ve been trying to get a job as an MLO for months but due to the insane volume of applications I couldn’t seem to get any call backs.

I FINALLY got a call back, interview, and hired at a Mortgage company who is putting me and 200 other new hires through 3 weeks of training to prepare to take the national SAFE exam to get a mortgage license.

I am brand new to this industry so all the information I’m learning is 100% new to me. 

I’ve never been a note taker. I never took school seriously but it was more of ADD and laziness rather than my abilities. I’m a smart guy but have never had to take a test of this magnitude. Literally my life and well being depends on passing or they will have to fire me. 

The national passing rate is 55-60% of people pass on their first try.

The first two days, I paid close attention to the zoom meeting webinar and learned a lot but didn’t take much notes. It’s way too much info to retain and comprehend all at once.

Luckily, there is an online portal for us to go back and watch the same power point videos on each topic we covered while our trainer narrates them. So I’m thinking I can go back to the first two days material and just write everything down.

Starting on day 3 tomorrow I plan on literally taking notes until my hands fall off and my brain is destroyed and every day going forward. I’m hoping this will help me retain and understand the information better than just trying to pay attention to the webinar.

Are there any loan originators out there who’ve gone through this brutal test that have any tips?

Or anyone out there with test taking tips on general?

My anxiety is sky high and I’m afraid I won’t have enough time to study enough and fully understand the material. I have to delivery food at night to keep up with my bills so that cuts into my note taking time but I can atleast listen to the videos while I drive.",21Oct2020,1

I never viewed my brother as the type person who do bad things to me but I would learn soon that I was wrong. My parents were the type who would have to leave us at the house alone sometimes due to work and what not . And that's when it would happen i didn't know what he wasdoing wrong sence I was so young and naive . He didn't put his thing in or anything he would just touch me I guess, manly in the chest area. I never knew what he was doing I knew of was something wrong but I so naive and dumb . And through that time another boy would do the same at school except he would have me touch his ya know and i didn't know what to do,I knew what they were doing but I didn't know it was wrong i had a feeling that it was wrong but I didn't listen to that feeling.

However, recently I have been going through a lot of stress with my college classes, working 35+ hours a week, and trying to take care of my mental, and physical health. I feel like it gets so hard to keep up with all of these things in life that make us ""healthy"". Do you feel the same way? Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of things that you're ""supposed to do"" every day.

I have really been trying my best to get into a routine that will possibly help that way that I go about my days in order to reduce stress. I guess my main question for you guys is what are some things that you do in your daily life that bring you little pockets of joy or self confidence. Maybe you meditate, or journal, or go on a run every day. Whatever it is, let me know! I would love to hear from everyone and maybe start trying some things out to reduce my own stress.

292,"So I’ve been with my baby’s father for three years, since I was 15 to now. He’s 21 currently. He works 12 hours a day and has side jobs. So he apparently never has time to see me, which would be okay but he also doesn’t have a phone to text me. I’ve only seen him once since I’ve been pregnant, I am currently five months. It’s driving me crazy that we don’t see each other or text each other. He uses his moms phone or coworkers when he can, but it’s very rare.

300,"I'm posting this here because it's anonymous and maybe someone can give me advice. I'm gonna keep it very short and simple because I don't ever want to make it about me.

I'm a white kid who actively supports the BLM movement. I've supported it for pretty much as long as I've known it's existed. My life has been pretty shitty in a lot of ways, but growing up around racist people taught me that I was one aspect away from it being so, so much worse. 

That being said, growing up in a really racist area has an effect. I've been doing the research on antiracism and how to actively incorporate into my life, but there are a few experiences I had that kind of make my head spin. 

When I was 11 I told off my uncle in front of the whole family because he said a particular slur. Everyone got mad at me and told me that me getting mad like that was more racist than the slur itself, because I ""thought black folks couldn't take care of themselves."" There weren't any non-white people there so I know it made no sense and it was just a gaslighting incident but that concept still rattles around in my head. I want to stand up for people of color because everyone deserves an equal chance in life without going through hell. 

But then that gets me thinking about why anyone cares about something that doesn't affect them. Racism doesn't touch me, therefore the fact I cared about it was just obscene to the people I've always lived around. In some of my reading I read about the white savior complex. Is that what I'm doing? 

I have never said any of this to anyone before. Honestly I just feel really ashamed I have to wrestle with those questions, because they should have such obvious answers. I can't/won't talk about it to anyone because again, I don't want to take the issue and make it about me. I guess my main question is how do I know if my heart is in the right place? 

I want to be compassionate. I want to be better. I advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and women's rights and animal rights as well. I understand my privilege. I'm also really sorry if I said anything wrong in this, please let me know and I'll change it.",21Oct2020,1

Today i had my programming final and it went horribly, i dont know why, i aced the project but the exam is another story, i feel like i might fail and i have never felt this anxious and bad before, i have never failed a class before and dont know how to react, i am trying really hard to focus on classes this semester but i just cant. 

Online classes are affecting my grades more than they should and i hate it, i dont have any drive to move forward and my motivation is at an all time low, as of know me failing is not a certainty because the grade are not out yet, but i can feel it in my gut that i fucked up. I have always put minimal effort in school, i am smart so i was always able to get by without taking any notes and with minimal studying but now that i am in college just being smart is not enough anymore but i cant shake my old habits off, the problem is that as much as i hate my old habits i still have never failed and i mantain a high average to mantain a scholarship, so i hate to admit it but my bad habits have not had any bad consequences until now.

i kinda feel like failing this class will make me grow and might help me get rid of my old habits but that does not make it any better.

Usually I don’t like hanging with one because they always piss me off on how simplistic their minds are, like 80% they just want to act a certain way and the 20% are just followers. My dear friend invited me to a party, usually I don’t mind parties but what bothered me is how he really want to go because they’re serving alcohol. Fucking loser. No wonder his “Ex” left him, she probably wasn’t even into him and he kept on pushing it. He has really changed through the 3 years, I blame his buddy boys who steered him to some awkward yet childish phase. 

I swear he used to be a nice kid who doesn’t try acting like someone he’s not but recently he got underneath my skin and crawled around it by how arrogant he became. Sometimes I want to maybe drink some beers and just tell him straight up what I really think about his new attitude.

A few months later, husband decides that he’d quite like Renee to come, so invited her and she accepted (which is great for me too!).

They make electrolyte gels, toys, snacks, healthy nutrition plans, custom hideouts/houses for rats and monkeys and such; pretty much everything to keep lab animals healthy, happy, and as comfortable as possible.

Every year more regulations are placed on animal testing, so I'm sure this will be a business that eventually dies, but how soon? By my contributing to this business am I just extending it, or am I doing these animals a service who would already be in captivity without toys and snacks?

Sweethearts. I love them more than anything, but unfortunately in their old age, my pets are dropping like flies.
I'm dealing with it the best I can.
In a few days, my sweet old cocker will be uthenized due to his dwindling back, leg, and hip health. He can barely walk, he's not eating.

I'm upset that he has to go through this, but he's  lived a long happy life. I'm going to to miss his scrunch up lil nose, and how he'd wiggle his lil butt when his favorite human came home, and his big old puppy dog eyes,, but he he lived a long happy life I think. He was never lonely, and he's going out in the best way possible.

What I cannot get get over is the death of my old lab, Mark last November.
He was old, and by that point, it had been about five years he'd spent without his brother, Dale. He was one lonely dog.
He truly missed his old pal.
The worst part is, is that I didn't spend that I wish I could with him.
I wasn't a busy person, I just didn't go into the back yard too often, were he'd be, being an outside dog, unless the weather was bad.
Even building him a small tarped area for when it was cold.
I don't like the imagine how lonely he must've been.
He wanted to be an inside dog, but my Family wouldn't  let him stay inside, because he was too big, and the other dogs would try to fight him. So he stayed in the back.
Occasionally, I'd curl up with him in the laundry room, where he'd be when the weather was too much, but other than feeding him, and trying to keep him from succumbing to the wheather, he'd be alone out there. Probably taking naps, waiting for something to happen.
Well, he passed away after days of what I could imagine sore bones.
We were going to euthanize him, but he passed before we could.
Just like that, I woke up, and he was gone.

I know he's with his best pal, and I hope he welcomes his little brother Niki when he's no longer in this painful state.

The only thing I can do is make jokes and cry, but rhat will do absolutely nothing.

330,"Let me start off by saying, I really love my mom. I really do. I think she is super cool and fun, and every friend I've ever had has always complimented my mom, and most of my friends used to tell me I had an awesome mom. I did. However, there are some issues I can't get past. 

I am going to give as much as information as I can about my relationship with my mom, as I am seeking advice to know whether or not I am overreacting about how we treat each other. Despite my love for my mom, recently our relationship has gotten even more toxic than it already is, and I am in so much emotional pain over it.

Growing up, my mom was a regular mom, yet she was even more fun, and she loved my sister and I. I think she was really happy to have girls. She always told us, ""I prayed for two beautiful girls and I got just that"". I think that's sweet. I remember growing up she was always dressed to the max, she loved fashion and music, and she really loved her family. As I am writing this, I'm thinking of the good days, when I was around 5 years and the time frame where my sister was born. We were a happy-go-lucky family. Nothing could ever go wrong in our small little world.

I have a memory of the first time I was truly scared of my mom. It was before my sister was born, and I remember little details of this situation distinctly. I was sitting in front of the television watching an old early 2000s program on Treehouse (or something similar) about arts and crafts. My mom turned the volume of the television all the way up and as I was a five-year-old child, I had a normal reaction of yelling (because it was loud) for her to turn it down. She began to sing and laugh, and I got frustrated and started yelling some more. She suddenly switched from her happy attitude to a complete monster. She grabbed me by the hair and pulled me across the small apartment we were living in all the way into the bathroom. She pushed me inside without saying anything to me, and I stopped my yelling because I was suddenly afraid that I had upset or lost my mom. I couldn't recognize this behavior from her. She then proceeded to pull the door handle from the other side to keep it shut (there was no lock on the door) and left me in the washroom. I banged on the door and kicked and yelled for her to open it. I asked her, ""why did you put me in here?"". She didn't answer me. I even remember at one point I was stuck in the washroom for so long, I began to give up on believing that she would let me out. I slept on the cold floor, woke up, and I was still stuck in the washroom. I tried pulling the door, and I kid you not, she had been pulling the door handle to keep it shut for hours.

I believe this is toxic behavior from a mother. She, however, denies this ever happened and tells me to ""shut it"" whenever I bring it up. She even made me doubt my sanity- I wondered if it ever even happened. I think of my mom as a master manipulator, and I don't mean to diagnose her, but I think she is bipolar as well.

Years passed, and I grew, and everything was fine between my mom and me until we would get into fights. Our small fights would grow into a large situation that was filled with hatred. We would fight about nonsensical things- and the odd thing is, I remember so many times where we had the worst fights, and it keeps me up at night.

I believed that she was my mom, and we would fight, as a pre-teen. I remember one time I spoke to her and I told her that I had really bad anxiety and I had trouble in school because of it. She told me she didn't understand what I meant, and no matter how much I tried to explain (reminder: I am a pre-teen and I had limited knowledge on anxiety and mental illness) and I honestly think she didn't even want to educate herself on it.

My whole life I talked to her about my anxiety; I still think she believes that I am fine, despite the fact that I used to take Venlafaxine for my agoraphobia and panic attacks/anxiety. I remember when I was teenager, I would purposely ignore her calls and take a public bus to random places around the city because I didn't want to go home to her. She would call my boyfriend and friends at the time, and I would always tell them not to answer. I was afraid of my mom.

One time (TW: sexual content + Trigger Warning: suicide), I was ""sexting"" with my boyfriend, random things, and I remember I wasn't even sending pictures of myself, or touching myself, or doing anything outside of just sexting (I was a 16-year-old virgin &amp; a teenager; seems like normal behavior to me) and my mom HATED my boyfriend. So, she took my phone and forced me to give her my password. SHE READ THE SEXTS OUT LOUD. With my younger sister in the house. I REMEMBER EVERYTHING SHE READ OUT LOUD. I stood there in absolute shock that she was reading all of this out loud, and I remember crying and begging for forgiveness. She threatened to show the texts to my dad if I didn't break up with him right away. I was absolutely devestated that my own mom would treat me like she had that day. 

I continued staying with my boyfriend at the time (I didn't even want to be with him anymore) because I thought if I stayed and married him, or moved in with him someday, I will be away from my mom. (BTW my dad was a great dad, and now I live with him, but he was always working while all of these things had happened between my mom and I). I threatened to k\*ll myself so many times, and I remember one specific time, I told her that she was hurting me with her actions (we fought everyday, she would scream and yell and physically slap/abuse me almost EVERY DAY) and she told me that she was my mom and ""she could say whatever to me"". I told her that that night, I was going to off myself. She told me to DO IT. 

The first night I attempted and I had to save myself. No one was there for me. My mom didn't care. I wrote at least a thousand F\*CK YOU letters to my mom (suicide letters).

These are only a few of the harmful, toxic, abusive things my mom has done to me. She has taken away my door so many times (ages 16-19), she has checked my phone when I sleep, she has embarrassed me in front of my friends/partners, she has laughed in my face after doing said embarrassing things, has asked me for money and when I told her to stop spending so much from my debit card, to ""get back to work"". A lot of the times she tells me that I overreact, that there is so much worse that people go through every day. I don't doubt the abuse/toxicity that I went through with her, but I spent years ignoring it, and pretending like everything was okay.

I now am 23, run a successful business, and live with my dad. I talk to my sister (who lives with my mom). I do talk to my mom, but a couple of days ago we got into a really bad argument (she had started it and told me to make more money for her). I sent her an email apologizing and asking her not to message me because she had hurt me. She never once responded or spoke to me since we fought. 

What should I do? Should I attempt to have a meaningful relationship with my mom despite what has happened or should I just ignore her? I deep down don't want to be apart from my mom (family means a great deal to me) but I seriously cannot take the abuse and toxicity any longer. She tells me all the time that I ""exaggerate"" and ""overreact"" and my ""sensitivity"" gets in the way of everything.

334,"There’s this girl that I had a thing for in most of my classes. I’m in college and I got her snap and we basically exclusively talked about classwork and we didn’t talk at all over the summer. Earlier this month it was her birthday and we talked a little then, and then some about class a couple weeks ago. Then I followed her on Instagram and she followed back. Then today I decided that I needed to just ask her if she wanted to go get coffee and study sometime. But she left me on read. Then after a couple hours posted a story and either immediately blocked me from viewing stories or took it down. Like wtf I mean I would’ve totally been okay with her just saying no I’m not interested or anything... 

So I’m up thinking about this still it’s been like 5 hours and was thinking about saying this:
“I hope you don’t have any hard feelings after I asked that. I wouldn’t have been upset if you said no, I was just trying to be friendly.”

It’s becoming a daily thing for over a month now and it’s worrying me because she has young kids who I’ve met on multiple occasions.

I would like to have a more serious conversation with her and I feel like the only way she would take things seriously is if I brought up her kids and how they could be affected by this.

337,"(I posted this on r/askwomenadvice but there was no responses so I’ll try this subreddit: 


Back story: my friend has only had sex with one guy. Let’s just say she had to fake her orgasm every time they had sex. She doesn’t know what it feels like or has even reached that limit to know how it works and how it can open new doors for her (as in exploring kinks etc) 

We are both grown adult women in college. She gets really shy and just closes the conversation when it comes to her previous sex life with her ex, which I can understand... that’s literally embarrassing but just recently we started talking about masterbation. 

(Let it be known, I’m still a Virgin but I know what I like and what I dislike. Masterbating for me has made me feel very good about myself in many ways and I feel like every woman should know what to do and how to feel! Since I masterbate, I feel like I know what to do when the time comes when I lose my virginity)

ANYWAYS, when I suggested to her that she should maybe start masterbating and trying new things to pleasure herself, she says it’s disgusting and nasty and etc etc. I know many people feel awkward when they talk about this, but I just REALLY want her to explore more of her sexual side and HOW good it feels! 
How do I convince her to try it out?? Any advice or tips? 

Also - I’m not trying to pressure her into doing things she doesn’t want to do, but again as I stated in this post, she should have the opportunity to try new things. Also, masterbation is something to not be ashamed about. It’s very natural and everyone does it.",21Oct2020,1
338,"Hi. This is my first reddit post.

So I met my (23F) best friend (21F) just a year ago. She literally changed my life. I'm a foreigner in my university, so my entire uni life was pretty rough. I always felt isolated and stuck in toxic friendships. She was the only good thing to come out of my entire stay in this country, but now I'm beginning to reconsider our friendship because it hurts me too much.

We started hanging out because she kept asking me to go out. I was fascinated by her because of her extroversion. She's a huge social butterfly. She opened up a whole new world for me. I had never been so mesmerized by a person, or shocked at how much I liked someone's company. I opened up about my depression and BPD, and she was the first person to ever see my scars. At one point I was staying over at her place more often than my own, but she graduated faster than me and went back to her hometown far away. At one point all I could do was think about the dynamic of our friendship, because I'd gotten too emotionally attached to her. I have literally never loved and cared for anyone more (although it's completely platonic--I'm aro). I needed her more than she needed me, and that hurt. I felt like a charity case. Eventually she started taking up way too much space in my head (rent-free lmao) and she was all I could think about. During quarantine we called daily, and we'd gotten so close that it felt unhealthy. She would say one mean thing and I'd break down in tears. She would say something sweet and I'd chase after it like some kind of high. She one day on a whim uncharacteristically joined a dating app, where she discovered she was bi and met her now-girlfriend. She admitted that she had been questioning because of me. I know I'm supposed to feel happy for them, but it hurt. I felt replaced. I felt alone and depressed for months, but I tried to be as supportive as possible because of my extreme fear of being toxic.

Here is my problem. I'm currently living with her in her hometown because I recently graduated and she didn't think I had a reason to stay where I was, but living here has been difficult. It's been 2 weeks so far. It isn't just the discomfort of living with another family (although I'm cool with all of them), but I'm in constant pain seeing her spend soooo much time with her girlfriend texting and calling. I used to be special to her, and she used to reassure me that her getting a girlfriend doesn't in any way diminish our friendship, but that's just not true. She barely even talks to me or spends time with me anymore because she'd rather spend time with her girlfriend. Many of our conversations revolve around her girlfriend. We promised each other so many times that we would never leave each other, but for the past half a year or so all I've been feeling is absolute misery because of her (or rather, because of how I feel about her). I'm on antidepressants again. She's the greatest source of pain in my life, but I don't want to lose her. We used to have so many conversations about our feelings, but I don't think talking about it would help now. I don't know what to do. Is there any way to make this hurt less? Can it be that ending the friendship is the only solution? Am I being too sensitive?",21Oct2020,1
339,"Hello so my bf and I were drunk &amp; having foreplay and I decide to slap his cheek. I am usually the one that gets slapped. It is my kink. I was mentioning how he used hinge once during our break we took couple years ago. And before everyone goes crazy, it would arouse me thinking about this stuff so I decided to mention it instead of keeping it to myself. Pretty much him being on hinge was not something i was happy about but it did arouse me thinking others find him attractive. So anyways, he gets mad and hits me. Then I obviously Was unhappy about that and decided to argue about it. 1 hour later, we yelled, fought, got  more violently physical. Next day we spent the day watching TV and when I went to work he packed his stuff and left.. mind you I am head over heels for this man for past 4 years. We're each others best friends. I was shocked he did that, and now I'm becoming super upset and keep wanting to contact him. He won't reply to anything. This was all a misunderstanding about what my intentions were.

340,"I will start by saying that my life appears pretty normal. I’m 24 years old. I go to school and work a part time management job. I do fine in both of these things, live on my own, and also support myself for the most part. Life seems pretty normal and good from the outside. 

Except for the fact that I am hopelessly physically and mentally addicted to drugs and don’t know where to turn. I started drinking heavily after turning 21 and continued this every night for over a year. I started opening up about my alcohol use to friends and they were supportive. However I couldn’t find a way to stop. That’s when I found people online talking about an amazing solution to alcohol and mainly opioid addiction. Kratom. It was advertised to me as a natural remedy to addiction that was both safe and non addictive. I was down.

I drove 45 minutes to a headshop that sold it. No where that I knew of sold it other than the internet and I didn’t want to wait for it to be delivered. I tried it and I enjoyed it. I made an attempt to get off alcohol and it worked! Now the only thing I take is kratom which is amazing! It stopped my alcohol addiction in it’s tracks, isn’t harmful to the body, makes you feel really good and according to everyone it isn’t addictive which was really awesome until...

I tried to quit taking it.


The first thing I noticed was a runny nose and a lot of yawning which was weird but I didn’t think much of it. Then my eyes and mouth started watering and I felt no energy to do anything. This quickly turned into sweating, tremors, anxiety and the horrible feeing that I was freezing when the room wasn’t cold. The worst came next. Muscle pain and spasms, severe anxiety and that ‘cold’ feeing spreading deeper into my body. I could feel it in my bones. I have no idea what came next because I took kratom and that IMMEDIATELY made all of that go away.


The kratom community completely lied to me. Kratom is incredibly physically addictive. I wish I would have listened to those who told me to be wary. I thought it was drug propaganda like I had seen with other drugs but it wasn’t. Kratom withdrawal is awful. I have heard that a major difference with kratom and opioids is that you have to take kratom every day for longer to develop a physical addiction. I am not sure if this is true but I used it every day for about 6 months before I tried stopping my use:


It has fucked with my digestive system, my skin, my mental health as well as my hairline. It is like being addicted to heroin except you can’t accidentally overdose and die. 

A lot of people are going to say it’s not addictive, that I am lying and that people like me are going to get it banned. To be honest I hope it remains legal because it has saved a lot of people from heroin addiction, but it shouldn’t be taken by anyone else. My alcohol addiction was bad, but I feel like there were other options before diving headfirst into another addiction.

Anyone who says “I take it every day and am fine!” please stop lying to yourself and stop before it starts taking a toll on your health. 

I am posting here because I can’t afford to go to rehab. As in both “I can’t lose my job or drop out of school” and “I can’t financially afford it.” I am on my parents plan but It’s still expensive and they would end up paying that and I won’t let them. My life is not in any danger at this point but my mental health is suffering. What do you guys think I should do here? I really want to be free of this. I have been addicted for a couple years.



Tl;dr: Was a mild-moderate alcoholic. Kratom community lied to me about the drug and I was too dumb to look into it further. Got addicted to kratom and don’t know what to do. Rehab is not worth it imo. What do you guys suggest?",21Oct2020,1

Me and my ex had been together for two years, since I was 18. Was fantastic for awhile, until she wanted to try cocaine. I've been an addict since I was 14, forced to sell oxy and xans. I expressed my hesitation but she said that she would do it with her shitty friends anyway. My backwards way of thinking said that it'd be safer to do it with me, from my trusted salesmen.
So we did, and it became a problem fast. 
After that we moved from one substance to another till I was back on opiates and eventually benzos
That leads us to now, I had went to jail because I relapsed on xans and was blacked out for 4 days. 
Woke up in a solitary cell not remembering what happened
A week before my ex took a pregnancy test and it was positive. Now most people would call this a ""scare"" but it was hope for me. A reason to change and start something new. 
While I was in jail she cheated on me with two of my good friends and lost the child. I'm not sure if it was the drugs or a false positive but it's gone
Not even 24 hours into me being in jail she helped steal all my belongings and stole my debit card to buy a strapon to have a threesome with my best friend and his gf
Then she proceeded to have a lasting relationship with the kid who helped steal my belongings, also a good friend of mine
She said she was used and takin advantage of, fed drugs while she was in a mentally weak state. He called her fat and stopped talking to her soon after
I learned all of this after getting out of rehab and I've had a lot of trouble coping and coming to terms with it. 
Any advice possible? She won't message me now saying ""It is too unhealthy for the both of us""

350,"My father had an affair on my mom in the early 90s and they divorced and he ended up marrying my stepmom 6 months later. Not only did my Mom and Dad work in the same building, my now stepmom worked there also and my Mom had to deal with seeing them come on go together and even ride in the same elevator with them at times until they retired in 2010. My Mom was put through hell because of my father but she always stayed positive no matter what she was dealing with. My mom deserved better than that and it really pissed me off that he just didn't care about my Mom's feelings. My Mom never remarried after that. Throughout my teenage life I was full of resentment towards both my Dad and stepmom and I havent been as close to my father or stepmom because of it. We finally got to a better place over the last few years after my mother passed in 2017 due to complications after a surgery. It was unexpected and is still hard to get over. We buried her close to my sister house which is in a small town outside of DFW. But to this day we still never had that conversation to talk things out and try to get passed it. 

Fast forward to present. My stepmom just passed away after a long battle with cancer. They unfortunately didn't have a burial plot already planned out or her funeral arrangements. My sister referred them to the same funeral home that we used for my mother that also has the  cemetery. Still not sure wtf she was thinking. My Dad ended up buying 4 plots. One for my stepmom, my Dad and her 2 kids from  a previous marriage. I am literally losing my shit because I feel this is totally disrespectful to the highest degree. There are cemetery's literally every 5 miles why this one? My Mother is supposed be resting in peace and now I have to deal with going to a funeral to see my stepmom get buried in the same area as my Mother. When I go there I want to grieve for my Mother. I feel soo bad that my stepmom didn't have a choice in any of it and the fact that my Dad and sister thought that was a good idea is beyond crazy. It literally has put me back to the way I used to feel. I want to grieve for my stepmom but now I'm full of anger and it's not her fault and that bothers me also that they thought this was a good idea. I literally had to force the info out of my sister. They literally think I'm going to go see all this happen in front of my and I'm supposed to be ok. I would lose my shit. Now my Mother is going to be in the same place as my father and his other family. I have decided that I'm not going to the burial because they will see something from me that has never been seen before. Even if my Mother is dead she still deserves respect.

351,"Hi reddit,

I'm 22, recently got my first job in banking in Mumbai, India (Financial Hub of the country). My joining is next month. This is the second time I'm invited to the city. First time was 2 years back when I landed a seat in an ivy league business school in Mumbai which I rejected because I don't want to live in that city. 

I did my college in peace in an another school (less valued ivy school) near a beach. Now after passing out college this year my company has offered me a key entry level position in Mumbai. 

I have tried (still trying) my best to change my location or find a job elsewhere to skip the city but all my attempts keep failing. 

Now i hardly have 15 days remaining to move there and I don't even have a place to live. The city has the highest active COVID cases. 

Also following problems aren't letting me sleep for a week now and I'm going into serious depression :

1. No onwer wants to rent me a flat because of my caste. Or charge a premium.
2. No onwer wants to rent me a flat because of the xenophobia (extremists sometimes shave heads of the people or beat them mercilessly from my place)
3. Traffic, congestion and annual flooding.
4. Super high cost of living. Now I can support my self in my pay check but boy i don't want to pay 60%+ of my salary in my rent. When the average is around 10% or less in the rest of the country.
5. My values towards my family. My parents are too old (in their 70s) and I just want to spend more time with them. 

All I wanted from life was an easy country life. And the idea of living in these crowded toxiacated cities makes me wanna run for my life. I'm literally on my knees asking for advice. What would you do?",21Oct2020,1

353,"For starters, I'm (37F) posting this for my husband (40M). TL;DR at the bottom.

We've known 'Melvin' (37) for 18yrs. He's more husband's friend but I know him well enough too. My impression of Melvin was that of a rational and intelligent guy and he never caused drama.

Melvin had a decent career as a graphic artist for a company as well as having his own side-business. He met a nice enough woman, they were together 6ish years and on the verge of getting married. Then Melvin lost his job, he dumped his girl (it was a messy breakup) and moved back in with his parents . This was around 3 years ago. Since then Melvin has become more and more reclusive and kind of crazy.

Firstly, he couldn't find a job for almost a year until his bro hooked him up with a warehouse gig. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary; Melvin began dating again, was going out with co-workers and my husband and generally, was acting as someone who just needs some time to get back to themselves after a breakup.

We began noticing he was becoming strange maybe a year ago. Melvin stopped dating, hardly hung out with my husband or any other friends and seemed to be spending more time home alone eating edibles and tripping balls while watching B horror movies. He was endlessly spending money on collecting these rare B movies, board games (mostly ones that can be played with one player) and seemingly not being concerned that he lives with his parents or that -for example- his car was falling apart and he'd need a new(er) one soon. 

Then the pandemic hit and it was the tipping point. Melvin appeared to be falling down the rabbit hole. First he claimed (in Feb) that the government was covering up how bad Covid was. Within a couple of months, he did a 180 and began saying Covid wasn't real and -you guessed it- refused to wear a mask. Most recently is when things have gotten really crazy. His workplace finally made masks mandatory (I guess it took longer bc they didn't really deal with the public/many people on a daily basis) and Melvin decided his 'rights' were more important than an income so he quit.

It's now week 3 of Melvin having no job and I think he hasn't fully grasped that, based on his work background and what's currently going on, he will have a difficult time finding anything that pays above min wage. This past weekend, he went to a peaceful rally downtown which was protesting our province going back to 'phase 2' of shutdown. He sent a vid of himself and his mom in a crowd full of anti-maskers to my husband. It took my husband a while to even pick him out because Melvin was wearing big sunglasses and had his hood up. Husband joked and said 'well maybe if you weren't dressed as the [Unabomber](https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MTU3ODc5MDgzMjE0MDU1MTM1/image-placeholder-title.webp) I'd be able to see you.'

Melvin said 'I'm not even insulted, that man was one of the most intelligent people on this shithole planet'. Suffice it to say, husband is now alarmingly concerned and is wondering if he should be harshly blunt about Melvin's situation/mental state or just leave it alone. To be clear, I think Melvin is being an idiot but will not be saying anything nor trying to convince husband to say anything. The title was just for clarity.

**TL;DR** Husband's friend Melvin is seemingly losing his mind, living with his parents with no immediate plans to move out and husband doesn't know if he should tell him he's being an idiot or leave it alone.",21Oct2020,1

355,"I have an older sister and she's the typical smart kid. Aside from the high grades she loves reading. She reads whenever she has free time to do so and still wishes she could read some more. 

I used to compare myself a lot (including to her) so I quickly made reading a fix-idea for myself - I would try to ""catch up"" to her. I thought (and still somewhat think) that reading is inherently good and it doesn't matter if I like what I was reading, just as long as I was reading. But since the books I was trying to read weren't necessarily to my liking I'd struggle to get through them. It would take ages to finish them (partially because I got distracted and had to re-read a paragraph or two every so often).

Soon I started picking up shorter and shorter books, and at some point I just couldn't even start a book longer than 400 pages. 

The weird thing is that although I wasn't enjoying the process of reading the book, I liked looking back at it and feeling somewhat proud that I've read it. For the most part my appreciation for a book was mostly after looking back at it in hindsight.

So now I'm wondering if and how I can change the way I view books and stop reading them just for the sake of feeling proud that I've read them.",21Oct2020,1
356,"Before you make an assumption, no my student counselor is not an actual counselor for the university. She is a student and is 20, while I am 18. She is simply a student mentor of sorts, but she is not actually part of the school staff if that makes sense. 

**Here is some context, so if you wanna skip this part go ahead :)**

Anyways, during this covid stuff I have found life to be quite boring. All my classes are online, I live alone because my roommate never shows up. I work weekends, and that is basically the only time I get to interact with other people. It's funny because I thought I was an introvert, but now I am starting to think I am an insecure, shy extrovert. The isolation of all of this is making me go a bit crazy.  

I made a Tinder and Hinge account, and while I am getting matches, my texting game simply isn't as strong as I had hoped and unfortunately have gotten nowhere with anyone.

**So lets talk about this counselor.**

I am required to have 3 meetings with her. I have already had 2, so my last one is coming up in like 3ish weeks. For the most part, the meetings aren't really all that interesting. She's just doing her job, asking me questions about school, my classes, giving advice, etc,. 

So here is the thing though. We have zoomed once, I didn't have a webcam at the time, but she had hers on and she's pretty cute, ya know. Second time was phone call, and third time will probably be phone call too. She has never seen my face, which I am regretting now because if I ask her out without her actually knowing what I look like already puts me at a huge disadvantage. 

But when I am thinking of asking her out, I am not really thinking about it as a date type thing, but rather just a hang out type thing to see if there is any chemistry, interest to be had. 

What's the best way to go about this? At the end, she asks me if I have any final questions, should I just say in response ""Yeah I got one more. What are you doing Friday night?""?",21Oct2020,1

She says he used me and is really angry at him but I didn't want this, I really didn't want him to leave and now shes thinking about leaving him. I feel that this was my fault. She doesn't know how to contact the police about this and how to bring this up to him. I'm really scared because I dont want anything to happen to us like him attacking us. I feel its my fault for accidentally telling her in the first place because they are gonna break up after 3 years of marriage. I'm really worried about the house we have, I dont want to leave the house but he did own it first. I don't know if we will be able to get it or not, although I hope we do. My mom is upset and doesn't know what to do. What would be the best way of going about this, will we legally be able to keep the house? How should we bring this up to him and the police?

358,"My neighbor and I have known each other forever. We used to be close as little kids. Haven’t talked to him in a few years until a month ago. I asked him to hang out a few times because I was bored. 

A bit later I asked him out bc why not. We went on a date and it was kind of awkward and boring, it was my first date ever. Afterwords, no one said anything for a while until late that night I asked him if he wants to go out again and he said yes. 

We have almost talked every night on Snapchat since the day I asked him out. It was usually equal turns of starting a convo first but since end of last week he has only started the convo once and for the first time there’s been a few days where we don’t talk at all. I get breaks are needed but if he wanted to talk he would start a convo right? I feel like he’s thinking the same thing tho. 

It’s been 4-5 weeks of consistent talking. We were supposed to go out last week or this week but both of us kept having stuff come up. He isn’t a very assertive person. So I have to intimidate planning for everything. Now the second date has been moved back even more to next week. 

The talking dying off and him hitting me up less is stressing me out. Is he losing interest? Is he agreeing to everything out of boredom? After the second date should I ask him to be in a relationship? I don’t think it’s too early because I already know him, the dates r just compatibility tests at this point. And if he says no then I want to drop it before I get more feelings for him. I have to be the assertive one but does that mean he is uninterested?",21Oct2020,1
359,"So I think it´s fair to start this post off by saying that you shouldn't enroll in college if you are suffring from mental health issues (or if you aren´t seeking proper help for them) and I´m living proof of that.

I´m (18F) and ever since I can remember I´ve always had something going on upstairs that wasn´t really all too normal. It started out with intrusive thoughts and then it just kept on progressing to other things (that would be tooo much to get into right now), i have a pretty impressive record of self sabotage (maybe because that way I will have an excuse for my failures), have a lot of trouble making friends (as in actually keeping in contact with them and not thinking everybody hates me) and (since I started college) I´m actualy really dumb (like dumb dumb). Everyday I think I will have an oppurtunity to start fresh but not even one hour in and I already made a stupid mistake that beings me down again and (if we are in public) hummiliates me to no end. 

I´m currently in my second year of college and it´s not going too well. I came with a highschool friend of mine and it´s safe to say she is everything I wish to be and am not. She is confident, smart, fun and has a lot of hobbies and interests which leads me to think even less of myself. We are in the same major so we have the same group of friends and eventhough I get along really well with them I can´t help but to think that if it weren´t for her I wouldn´t even have a group of friends in the first place. My memory is trash, I´m not good with directions and I struggle with the simplest things. 

All of this leads me to think that it would be best for me to quit college (for now) or take a gap year. Now, this might be complicated because it might force me to take the high school exams again and I would obviusly have to break the news to everyone (which isn´t really something to look foward too tbh). Besides I can´t help but wonder how my parents would feel knowing how badly their daughter is doing when their other kids did just fine in life (neither of them went to college but they both work and are pretty well integrated people). My parents already know that I struggle with my mental health and even went as far as making and appointment with a well know therapist without me knowing. I just don´t want to worry them but I still want to get better. 

Feeling like a burden and like everything you say is dumb is not fun at all and seeing people do so much better than you honestly sucks. Does anyone have any advice for me? What shoul I do?",21Oct2020,1

Does my boyfriends ex seem thirsty as fuck?

IHe was talking to her for hours every week until we went out of town

They recently started taking every week for hours on the phone. He told her he was going on a trip to his family’s cabin alone and he finally told her that he is going with me after she asked him multiple times about going away alone for a month. 

Before he left she went to his house and visited with he and his family for hours the day before he left. 

When he left he texted her: “It was great seeing you and my family enjoyed seeing you too! Safe travels! I’ll miss you and I’ll hope to hear from you soon!”

She didn’t respond for a few weeks and then said: “I voted today and thought of you! Hope you’ve been having a good time on your trip!”


He responded: “Good:) makes me happy to hear! Breaking records already in Texas 😊 let’s turn Texas blue up and down the ballot! Wishful thinking but idc, we all could use some these days haha 

I am enjoying my time up here, it’s very nice:) I actually want to stay longer, like past the election, I don’t want to be in civilization during that clusterfuck haha  
I actually requested and was approved for my mail-in ballot a week ago or so and it looks like it’s already on its way here - which is very quick! The moment it gets here, I am filling it out and literally overnighting it the same day haha”


She said: “Yeah for real. Well that’s good to hear! I’m glad you’re enjoying it and still doing your duties as a citizen. Enjoy the rest of your time!”


He then sent this novel: “Thank you:)
Oh yes! I have to do my civic duty - we can’t afford anyone on the sidelines - arguably the most important thing I or anyone could do this year! 
I just checked the mail and my official ballot has come in - wow I can’t believe it’s actually working so far lol 
I am! I am enjoying the rugged beauty up here so far! I’ll come back home before it gets too cold or snowy though! 
I hope you enjoyed your recent travels, that you’re doing well, and work is treating you well - all things considered!”

364,"Serious responses only, and I do apologize for the length of this...

I'm kind of venting, but also looking perhaps for some help or advice, if anybody cares to share anything. Thank you so much, in advance.

I am almost 36 years old, female, and have such low confidence or self-esteem, it's virtually non-existant. As always, it's rooted in childhood. My parents always fought, I always fought with my sister. Dad was never around, and when he was, there was constant yelling, screaming, tension and chaos. We were poverty-level poor. Mom was often not around, having to make up for my father's lack of contribution financially- it was not uncommon for her to be working 2-3 jobs at a time. Though undiagnosed at the time, looking back I had severe anxiety as a child. I was diagnosed with ADHD at 9. Depression at 11. Epilepsy at 14. My father often made fun of how much I weighed, that I was stupid and lazy. In school friends were few and far between. I found I was popular if I brought in my allowance and bought things for people at the book fair or on ice cream day. It was nice in the moment... but the next day I'd be the kid everybody hates, once more. This continued through high school- not having any friends. My parents were alao not supportive. Personal expression was not allowed. There were never any ""I love you""s  or ""I'm proud of you""s. Everything I said or did was met with criticism or ridicule. Even recently, I was offered a promotion at work. I told my mom about it and how I wanted to negotiate a raise and her only reaction was, ""Just keep in mind you may not get the raise you're looking for"". No support. No ""I'm proud of you"". No ""Well if you think they'll go for it, all you can do is try/ask"". Nothing. Just- ""you may not get that raise"". I've been left feeling empty and hollow, like perhaps I'm not worthy of a raise. Like maybe I'm being greedy and ungrateful for wanting to make more than $14/hr.

While in college, I had a crush on a guy, while at the same time was being chased by somebody I wasn't interested in. One night, both guys ended up raping me. My trust in men from that point on has been non-existant. Over the years I've been working to try and be more trusting, but every time I let my guard down, 100% of the time, I get another knife in the back. So many times, people (usually coworkers, men &amp; women) tell me ""It's ok; you can trust me"", ""if you need anything I'm here"", ""I want to help you learn &amp; grow"", etc. I've had numerous co-workers try to purposely sabotage me. I once worked a job, 100+ hours a week. I was often knocked down to under 40 hours when my paycheck came in. But I never reported it because I was too scared to lose my job. I remained working there until new management took over and let all (old) employees go. My next job was working under a chef who constantly lied to me and used me as the scapegoat for her anger and incompetence as a chef. If she did anything wrong, it was my fault. If her food came out disgusting, it was my fault. All the shit work was put on me. Impossible tasks for somebody just starting out in the culinary world with no experience or culinary knowledge. When a new chef came along, he promised to take me under his wing. A few months later he tried getting me fired/re-assigned. I then developed a close friendship with the sous chef and she helped me to get a promotion, and once I was promoted, she turned her back on me. The support and trust I spent two years nurturing, gone. When I asked what I did or if I did anything wrong, I was always told no, no, no. This went on for 3 years and I constantly have tried to heal that relationship, but to no avail. I constantly feel like I am a burden to everyone- not in a suicidal way, but it just feels like there's something I'm not seeing or understanding about myself. I want to change and be a better person so people will like me and accept me as a person, but I don't know how. I don't see myself the way other people do so I'm not sure what I need to change. I do get told that I am very kind, supportive, smart, loyal, motivated, considerate... but if I'm such a good person, why does everybody dislike me so much? This is the story of my life. I get mixed messages from those around me. I was taught (raised) to believe the world existed in a certain way- for example, always be nice, don't lie or there's consequences, don't break the law, don't ever ask for help, do everything for yourself because nobody will help you, etc. I received so many of these mixed messages growing up, and still do and it causes so much pressure and anxiety in my brain. I often can't cope and I just break down in tears. I live on my own, so I have nobody to talk to. Nobody to vent to. Nobody to ask for help or advice. I'm so distrusting of people I don't allow anybody ""in"". Just last weekend I spent 3 days in tears wondering what it is I do so wrong in life. I have no doubts I'm needy and clingy. I have no doubts my anxiety, depression and anger drive people away. I need to fix myself and make changes, but I don't know how without a proper support system. People who believe in me and encourage me to reach for my goals. People who don't make me self-conscious or make me feel like I'm dumb or stupid for having an opinion. I'm constantly monitoring what I say, and how people react to it or to me. I've learned to read body language and understand non-verbal communication since I know I can't trust people to be honest- and it often drives me crazy that people say one thing but act/react in a ways that goes against their words.

As a result of everything, I tend to exist solely on my own. I wake up, go to work, immediately come home and stay inside my tiny studio apartment until it's time for work the next day. I go shopping one day a week. Do laundry one day a week. The rest of the time I'm just inside. If I'm not doing something specific, I'm usually sleeping.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm sick and tired of feeling like I'm always the problem. I'm sick and tired of people lying to me all the time. I don't want my ego massaged. I want truth. I want honesty. I want to be able to trust people. I want to feel better about myself- and that's the hardest thing. How can I feel better about myself if people are always thinking bad things about me? One of my worst fears is finally gaining some confidence only for people to be like, ""Look at her. Why is she so confident?"", ""Does she really think she looks good?"", etc. I know they must think these things because it's how they always talk about other people. So what makes me so different? (Kind of like little kids do- maybe your mom buys you some new sneakers and you really like them, so you wear them to school only for the other kids to make fun of you and tell you how ugly they are and only a stupid poor person would wear them.) Even more recently, my boss, she says things when she's venting. For example, with certain employees that cause her frustration, she won't fire them, but instead will say things like, ""I'm going to make (person)'s life so miserable they're going to want to quit!"". So, I often times feel or question... how do I know she doesn't feel that same way about me? If I feel as though she's distancing herself and she's not being supportive, is she just trying to make me miserable so I'll quit?

I just... I don't know what to do. I'm so lost and confused. I'm tired of feeling this way. I just want to be happy and confident.",21Oct2020,1

375,"Hi all, I am getting into my later 20s now and have still remained in touch over the years with a group of high school frieneds. Some time in my early 20s I started losing touch. I see them now and/or text them no more than once a year, probably a year and a half this time around. This year most of them didn't text me for my birthday when usually they do and I didn't text for theirs. It is obvious they invite me to important events because they feel like they have to not because they want to. That is fine with me because I don't want to stay in touch anymore. 

Anyway the dillema is there is one girl in the group who I caught up with more than the others who still texts me sometimes. It is her wedding coming up. It was supposed to be in december but due to Covid I don't know when it will be, I haven't spoken with this about her. Even with this girl, the last time we texted/caught up was probably at the start of the year. I don't feel close to her either and don't particularly feel the need to stay in touch. Is there a way I can finally cut ties with everyone before this girl's wedding whenever it may be? My fear is that if I go to her wedding, all the rest of the group will invite me to their weddings etc because they feel they have to when they have them but I don't want to go.

383,"Here’s some quick facts. I’m Male (20) and I’m living in Australia.

When I was born I had an abusive father. He disfigured my teeth and my mother left him. Throughout primary school and high school this caused me to be a big victim of bullying. Ontop of that my mother found a new man who became my stepfather, but he was also abusive.

Fast forward a few years and I finish school with not-so-good grades. My mother had plans to move to Australia with my stepfather and me though they were always unsure. I started college and was in a few courses, I also had a mediocre job at a fast food restaurant. Unfortunately for me I had to quit college halfway through along with my job at the age of 17, since we were moving to Australia. I had braces by this point.

Australia honestly sounded great, I mean sunny weather, cute animals, new start? Awesome!

Coming over here we found out that I couldn’t enroll in any colleges as all of the courses had already started. I had to wait a full YEAR until I could attend any of the colleges nearby. During that year I turned 18, continues braces treatment, started college and got a job. Unfortunately that year my stepdad went batshit crazy and abused me worse than I had ever had it. Having enough of it I broke down and told my mother that I would call the police on him, but he simply threatened to kick me out of the house leaving me homeless in a country I didn’t know anything about. I attempted suicide, got put into hospital, they found out about the abuse, he got restrained by the police. At this point he threatened to murder me so for MY safety the government moved myself and my mother away into a new state. This caused me to once again had me forced to quit college and my job, saying goodbye to all the friends I had made. I turned 19 while moving away.

Fast forward to now. I’ll be turning 20 soon. I still have my braces on though I’m not receiving treatment. I am not in a college and my mother doesn’t seem to plan on helping me enroll into one or help pay. I am new to this area so I know no one here. Due to Covid and generally not having many workplaces around it’s been extremely tough on getting a job.

I feel hopeless. I’m almost 20 and have been kicked out of college twice without choice, along with not having a job. I have no money since it was burnt away helping to pay for rent and such over here with my mother. She’s working now but expects me to suddenly get a job and pay for college expenses, dental expenses etc myself.

386,"My boyfriend and I have been separated since the beginning of the pandemic, being as i am Canadian and he is American. So it’s been a rough almost year, but our relationship has gone strong through gaming and spending time together on the phone. My boyfriends birthday is coming up very soon and I’m upset I won’t be able to spend the day with him in person, so instead I’d like to surprise him with something. I have already ordered him some gifts, which unfortunately he was able to weasel out of me and therefore it’s not a surprise. 

I was thinking of ordering him flowers or something, but flowers are more expensive and not really his style. Is there anything else I could possibly surprise him within a similar vain as flowers? He lives in a big city where most services would be available. He is quite the foodie, enjoys gaming and working out.",21Oct2020,1

Recently however they did this again with a liter jug of spoiled milk and some odd looking yellowish urine/oil colored liquid. The milk and the other liquid don't mix. We haven't touched it yet and don't plan to until we report it again and have someone take it away.

In the 2 years since i’ve been single i haven’t had any luck meeting new girls and my sex life is truly abysmal. I’ve gone to the gym and worked out for a month or two at a time before i lost my drive and forgot my goal (to lose weight).

391,"Throaway for obvious reasons.

First, let my start off by saying that at my company, the turnover rate is high and if you stay for more than 3 months, your likelihood of being promoted to a manager is about 50%. So, I don't consider myself a big shot, I've only been manager for about five months now. I never thought of her in any other way before she walked past me last week. She smells like roses and honeydew melon. Her hair is curly and she only lets it down sometimes. her skin is like burnt caramel and smooth and even. I can tell she wears mascara because sometimes her eleyashes are more pronounced than other days, but never in a negative way. I usually am hands-on but now I find myself calling on her just to say something to her, because she rarely talks to anyone at work and I otherwise probably wouldn't have been able to say anything. She's so quiet, but when anyone talks to her, she's happy to engage. She's fucking mysterious and and I want to know more about her. I can't seem to get her off my mind. One of my coworkers told me she rejected him, and I honestly feel bad for him, but it gives me hope and tells me that she doesn't like just anyone coming on to her. I want to know how to get to know someone so quiet without pushing her away. I know it's bad that she's under me so I slso want to know how to get rid of these intrusive thoughts. She's so elegant even in the way she walks, empathetic, physically strong, and beautiful. When she talks, it seems like all of that confidence goes away, because she avoids eye contact sometimes.
This post is descriptive but I hope it doesn't come across as creepy, I just wanted to kind of share how enchanting she is before asking advice. I honestly don't know what to do, and right now, all my mind is telling me is ""nothing, do nothing."" Because I feel like these situations never have a happy ending.",21Oct2020,1

394,"So I’ve been kinda lost. Idk. I guess I just needa get something off my chest.

So 3 months ago, my best friend of 15+ years was shot multiple times and killed. I was with him at 9 pm he was shot and killed at 10:50. Now here’s a little history to how close me and him were. We lived together, for years. Even when we were younger he moved into my parents house. I found my uncle dead from a .357 gunshot wound. Self inflicted. He walked to my house everyday, which is a 5+ mile walk, just to make sure I was good. I mean if you ever said anything bad about him around me I’d probably hit you faster then he would. I don’t have anyone else but him. My family is over religious and dot speak to me because of my tattoos and I smoke weed. I don’t have any other friends because what do I need fake friend ships for? I guess I have a few but none like him.  But back to what I need help with. So they caught 2 out of 3 people that killed my brother. It was a set up, which I knew from the jump. All because of a female basically. My brother was 26 years old man. He has 2 kids. 2 them are in jail. The shooter and the driver. But the fucked up thing is, the mastermind of the whole fucking situation, hasn’t been charged and he still out. Because they can’t get enough info on him. Because they set it up in person and the others haven’t snitched yet. How can I stop myself from hurting him?... when I see him it’s like a primal rage fills my body. He knows. He hides from me constantly ( I’m not a small guy and I know how to fight, boxed for years) and I know I shouldn’t. Cause if I do hit him I’m not gonna stop, I can feel it, I can feel the anger I have for him, and I know imma smash him if I get the chance. What can I do to channel this anger. Because honestly I’m scared of what imma do. My brother was like the angel to my devil. Always kept me level headed. And he’s gone now. Everyone in my life in real life, they know they can’t stop me. I don’t wanna do something I regret and go to jail. Or take him from his family even though he deserves it, his mother doesn’t. Can anyone help me? I just need advice man.

397,"Last summer, I was incredibly excited to go to college. I wasn’t looking forward to my classes as much as I was looking forward to being able to live with my two best friends. I was counting down the days before I’d finally get to live with them, but as everyone can guess....covid hit.
One of my roommates decided that he still wanted to move into the dorm, but the other one decided to just stay home with family. I do not blame him at all for this choice, it was incredibly justified as most of his family is at risk. After hearing about their decisions, I decided to move into the dorm with my friend but it wasn’t the same at all. We’ve been stuck in one room for a few months, and of course we keep in contact with our other friend but it’s just not the same in any way.
I quickly found out all my classes were asynchronous, ruining my plans of making friends in my classes. I have been on campus for 2 months and haven’t made a single new friend. I’m pretty extroverted so that doesn’t mix very well. I don’t really know why I’m typing this post up other than to just talk about it to someone. I don’t really want to talk to my roommate about it because i’m just not sure how to phrase it. If anyone has any ideas for how to make friends in this current climate or even if someone wants to just say hello, just let me know. Thank you.",21Oct2020,1
398," I was with her as far back as I can recall. She is my neighbor and was my best-friend till 2017, after which she moved to the near city for vocational courses. We went to the same school, the same tuition, and even shared the same bed once. I was never attracted to her whenever she used to be around. I was so comfortable with her that I've never paid attention to her outlook. Her gender never made a difference, she was just that 6-year-old girl for me I grew up with. But then She used the visit as little as possible when she moved for further studies. I used to miss her, and it was the same time I realize that she was too cute and pretty. But I curbed my thoughts and feelings since I never wanted any trouble in our smooth friendship.

Now, due to the pandemic, she has been staying at her home for 6 or more months. And, fortunately, I've got more time to spend with her. We always have easy conversations and cozy talks. But whenever she leans near to me, I get warmed-up and start talking slur and feel restless. Since then, I tried to talk by maintaining distance and understanding limits, so that I won't do anything wrong involuntarily. Due to that our conversation has started to feel unreal and lacks genuineness because I am always overly conscious near her. Also, I can sense she knows something ain't right. And we both are at a point where we're just talking outta formality so that we remain in contact and not lose each other.

This is ruining my social life. I even get nostalgic about the times we used to be so perfect friends. Not anymore. We're just two people familiar with each other since we live in the same locality.

I genuinely don't know what must be done. I mean, I don't wanna lose her at any cost, she's like my family. But our meetings are ruining our relationship further and further, due to this slight infatuation or maybe long-term crush.

Any advice will be highly appreciated!",21Oct2020,1
399,"Hi, I’m 19 years old and i’m looking to change my life for the better but just don’t know where to start. I’ve had a rough couple of years to say the least and have always found myself going back to drinking and smoking to deal with it. I’m not happy mentally or physically and have never wanted to change that more than now. i’m currently 5 days free of drinking and smoking and tend to keep it that way. 

I started running this morning (only 1.6km) and even though i thought i was gonna pass out by the end i never felt better. i’m looking to go for a run every 2/3 days and also try to workout 3 times a week, would this be a good start? I also look to gain weight as i weigh 57kg and i’m guessing i just have to take in a lot of protein but any tips on weight gain would be super helpful. 

Mentally is where the challenge is though. A healthy mindset is hard to maintain i’ve come to find out and it can be so draining sometimes. whether it be stuff coming back up from the past or being scared for the future, i’ve told myself to take it 1 day at a time which is hard to do but it’s working so far. 

Also I recently just got a job in retail after being unemployed for 7 month so that was a big boost. It’s only a weekend job but it’s a start.

I know this seems like a lot, I would talk to friends and family about this stuff but i can’t help feeling like a burden constantly. I just don’t want to go down that dark path again. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I hope to keep updating this through the weeks.

Thanks",21Oct2020,1

I work in sales and investing  I haven’t been in the company very long let alone in the career path for that long either a few years max.

I never studied I fell into my position because of someone I know (fell on my feet might I add)

I do well for myself am not the best salesman by a long shot but am definitely not bad.

I got a visit from the managing director who I happen to get on with very well, I got called into his office and he sat me down I was panicking That I’d g et fired but quite the opposite in fact we talked for at least 2 hours if not more about how he was very impressed with my work recently , praising me and saying he thinks I can go as far as I want in this company and maybe even further in the future! It made me week f**** even made my year! This is a man is worth millions and he’s saying all this!

Now the problem I have is I’m a class clown always have been... it’s just me no one ever takes me seriously but now is the time I need to shine and be seen as a serious businessman. I just can’t seem to grasp it no one takes me serious ... they think I’m a dummy they laugh when I suggest things I tried my hardest last week and everyone was telling me I was in a foul mood even my girlfriend said she didn’t want to be around me cause my attitude stunk! But I want to stop being the class clown... I want to be a strong minded straight to the point type of man! And I want my managing director to see this and know he’s made the right choice in saying what he’s said to me! 

Don’t get me wrong I know you can’t be friends with everyone and keep everyone happy but I’m tired of not being taken seriously... But I still want to be humble and approachable feel like I can’t do both though!

It was only a four hour shift so I got no break so I was just on the checkouts for the full thing. 
So about half way through my shift this man was buying something small, I can’t remember what but he wanted to use a 100 note to pay for it. He seemed so lovely and was smiling and laughing talking to me that I thought nothing of it. He then basically just distracted me so much by talking and laughing and making me uneasy that he scammed me into giving him more money back. I think it was about 150 euros maybe. I feel like such an IDIOT. Nothing like this has ever happened to me. I actually don’t even have an explanation for what happened maybe it was a mix of exhaustion, how busy it was, the fact I’m dyslexic?, and how he was distracting me. 
Yesterday the security guard showed me the footage and how the man tricked me. I’m so humiliated. I couldn’t even look the managers in the eyes for the rest of my 5- midnight shift. I’m a 19 year old female by the way, so I could just tell everyone thought I was so stupid.

My marraige got fixed in the lockdown. I spoke to the girl once before fixing the marriage and I said to the girl that I don't drink and smoke. Although I used to drink occasionally before, but I had decided earlier itself that once I'm married I won't indulge in it after that. 
I don't even get urges or have addiction of drinking, just occasionally I used to drink earlier, that too with friends. In this lockdown I never had any alcohol.

Now, with her latest message my pen pal hasn't responded in 45 days. They sent me two short messages in between saying that their bout of depression caused them to put off on the writing, so I understood (I have depression too), but when I look at their activity I can see that they talk regularly to other people!

I woke up and realised I was meaningless to her, she never really listened to me and she lied about several things to my face and over text, I was an option to her even after all I had done so I sent her a message about how I feel then again recently she tried messaging me so I explained all this and after she tried to fix it.

I thought it would be fun in the moment but now I’m realising how stupid of an idea it was. I didn’t show him anything but my butt (it was without clothing) but I’m still worrying that he took pictures of me. At first I was telling him “No.” but I guess the pressure got to me and I eventually caved? I kept asking if he did and he reassured me that he didn’t but honestly I have no idea if he was being true or not. I honestly can’t believe I was dumb enough to do this. 

The reason I’m so worried about it is because I’m a minor and I don’t want any of my friends or family to see it because they’ll immediately know it’s my room. Also, I can’t stop thinking about the guy who I showed my body to. I have no attraction to him at all, but everything I do or see or hear just reminds me of him. I know, sounds like the beginning to some cheesy romance novel, but I just can’t for some reason.

411,"I don't know if it's really my phone that's making me addicted or the lack of stuff I'm motivated to do.

It's embarrassing but I spend about 7 hours daily on my phone, if not more. I just got into university so I'm mostly at home due to online lessons. I'm also very introverted so it's easy for me to just stay home all day. But that's the problem. I don't really have any hobbies, except reading and writing, but I don't really do any of that regularly. Why? I just can't muster up the energy to do it, for some reason. I think because it's so easy to just look at your phone, it becomes way harder to do anything else that requires even a tiny bit more effort. I also like playing tennis, but I didn't get into any uni courses this semester.

I just wish I had some kind of hobby, but I really don't! I kinda like playing the. piano, but I didn't bring mine into the dorm lmao. I used to do a lot of sports on a regular basis, but because of a heavy knee injury 3 years ago that resulted in 4 surgeries and a lot of annoying physical therapy I 1) don't feel motivated to start any of that again and 2) am a bit restricted and can't do every sport.

Meeting friends from time to time is what I do, but it's not really a hobby per say in my opinion, and since I'm introverted, I don't like doing it all the time either.

Because of all that, I spend way too much time on my phone, scrolling through reddit, instagram and dating apps, desperately searching for dopamine to kick in. I'm not depressed (I kinda know the difference since I was diagnosed with depression at 13 and right now my life looks 100 times brighter), I'm not sad all the time or anything so at least that's good. But I'm not happy with how my life looks right now, I want to change something for real.

I have OCD as well, so that sucks. I feel like it's hindering me developing better habits, because I can't really hold onto ANY positive habit. I don't know if my OCD is the reason for that, though, or if that's just some kind of other issue of mine.

416,"I(23/f) haven't been okay mentally for a while. Just been getting through the days somehow. And I've had many instances where I decide that I want to get better and need to work on myself for someone else(boyfriend, family, friends, etc). 

Last night, I saw a movie 'the hours' about depression and suicide involving 3 women from different generations(including virginia woolf), it was a really difficult hard movie. But watching the movie was like watching my future. And it scared me. So much. I can't explain how much it scared. I don't want to end up like that. It made me re evaluate my entire life. I got so desperate to work on myself. Because I hate myself and I hate that I exist(but I'm not suicidal, just hate existing). It was like huge slap in the face. And it honestly scared the shit out of me. It was a really hard pill to swallow. To realize that this is the direction I'm headed in. You know the moment you realize the impact of your depression. A strange wake up call of sorts. And I got desperate to get better and work on myself. For once, it wasn't for someone else, it was for me. I wanted to get better for myself. I was so scared. I just knew I didn't want to be this way. The movie influenced me a lot, not in a bad way. Just realized that I don't want that to be my future. I'm just..so scared..

So I really sat down to reflect after the movie, and I felt that I needed to be on my own for sometime. The movie really highlighted how much their SO were also affected. So I decided to speak to my boyfriend(21/f) about it. And we decided the logical thing to do was break up. I didn't go to him with the intention of breaking up..I just wanted some time to myself. But it did make sense to break up, because I didn't know how long I needed. It was really difficult because I love him. But he was so understanding and sweet and supportive and encouraging..

I woke up this morning and the first thing I thought was that this was a huge mistake. I just threw away a wonderful relationship. We were very happy together, it wasn't a perfect relationship but it was a great one, had our ups and downs but we always communicated our way through it. I was so happy with him. It was only after getting together with him that I started wanting to work towards being the best version of myself. But...I still wasn't happy on my own or with myself. I still hated myself and that has nothing to do with him. He treated me wonderfully, but I didn't treat myself as well. I was only good to myself around him, he knew that and he hated that. I did remember that we broke up for a good reason. I didn't forget my main objective. I had issues I needed to work on.. And I need to be mentally stable before I think about other people. I care about him and I didn't want to drag him down with me. Yea, I will work on myself. But I really have no idea how long it will take, or how it will be. But I can't stop thinking if I could have worked on myself while being with him as well. I feel like I need him for this journey, and he will be as friend(eventually, hopefully), but I feel like I need all of him. I miss him. 

I'm not able to decide if I made a mistake or not. Now I feel shittier because not only do I have deal with working on myself but also go through a break up. I don't know if I'm an idiot for letting go off the only thing that made me happy. But I also know it's not fair to him either. I don't know what to do.   
I just wish I was mentally stable to be in a happy relationship with him. I feel like I have another reason to hate myself, not being stable. The only thing I know for sure is that tonight(he's probably working atm so I don't want to disturb him), I want send him a message telling him how much he meant to me and thanking him, I don't think he knows how much I appreciate him, I also want to make sure that he doesn't blame himself. I'm not really sure about what I'm asking for here.. But I would appreciate some perspective. Where do I even start from on loving myself? And working on myself? Did I make a mistake? Am I total idiot no matter what I do? Whenever I think of the reason I did this, I get scared all over again...I'm so lost..",21Oct2020,1
418,"Often I find myself in strange situations where people ask me for things that I don't want either to give or necessarily go that way. And I struggle to get things done my way. There is something really wrong.just:

A friend asked me money to pay her husband debt (third time, and she hadn't paid the last totally yet). Her husband is a piece of work and she continues to be beside him, paying his load crap of debts. She has asked for help and I feel obliged to help when in fact I should not, it's my money I can do what I want ( helping out her husband is not in my lists, I had planned to contribute to pay for painting part of my parents house).

Second example, I am leaving to my parents for a couple of months (I work from home). Another friend asked explicitly to have my appartment keys while I am gone. She said she needed a place to stay from time to time because she has heated arguments with husband. I know this 'friend' for the last year, don't have a lot of trust there still. Why would even someone ask this type of thing? 

So my question is how do I stop feeling that I must say yes?? I really feel like crap if I don't say yes and help, but the truth is that I don't want to!! There is definitely a problem with me on this type of situation, I often feel cornered.in both cases I feel that I am not helping even, the situation will get worse if I help as I am enabling them..",21Oct2020,1
419,"So there's this boy who cares about me so much, who accepts me for who I am or in short, a boy who loves me. We've been talking to each other for years, ever since we met but then we suddenly stopped talking to each other like.. 7 months ago.

I'm not that type of person who is good at approaching someone first or starting a conversation first and I think that he misunderstood things. He must've thought that I didn't want to talk to him anymore since he is always the one starting our conversation.

Yes, it sounds like it's my fault for not doing so but I am having a problem with 'starting the conversation first' thing. I always have the thought that I might waste his time if I tried talking to him now or the conversation wouldn't last long.. It also might be very awkward if I randomly say hi to him now after 7 months of avoiding each other.

424,"To preface - moving out is not an option. Financial and cultural issues are at play here, as well as not wanting to leave my dad and younger sister. Also this post may be a little all over the place but bear with me, I'll try to keep it short.

Basically the title. I'm in my early 20s. She and my dad are in there 50s. Her most recent case is because I put a lot of effort into shopping for a birthday present for my best friend. For context: for my 21st birthday, I didn't have a huge party and just did a small thing with family friends that my mum organised. My best friend couldn't make it because she was doing a program that was crucial to her degree. I didn't have any issues with this as she had a valid reason. My mother, however, has held a grudge against her for this since and gets upset with me for helping her boyfriend plan presents and surprise parties for her. She refuses to listen to my reasons, one of my main being the fact that her boyfriend puts in most of the effort and I'm mostly just a guide, and thinks I shouldn't be doing any of this and ""focusing on my studies"" instead (which she doesn't use as an excuse for the friends she approves of). Since her boyfriend dropped the present off at my house last Thursday, she hasn't been talking to me.

That is just one of the recent cases. She gives me silent treatments if I go out for dinner with friends or even if I go out for lunch. I got my hair dyed and she got angry at me for spending ""too much"" on that. She kept insisting I go to her hairdresser as she's cheap, but the first time I went to her she did such a horrible job that I ended up spending extra to get it fixed. The lady I went to this time charged $30 more (US$20) and did an awesome job. When I tried to explain this to her, she said ""I don't care"" and didn't talk to me for a day after.

My dad talked me into setting up a savings account that I wouldn't have access to as a way to force me to save my money, which I agreed to having had issues with spending in the past. When I recently asked for access to that account as I felt I was old enough to control myself, my dad said sure but my mum immediately began to protest; fortunately my dad and sister both defended me and overruled her.

In high school, her excuse for me not going out with friends was always that ""we didn't have the money"" (we were struggling financially so I understood then). By uni, I'd gotten my own job and she was still coming up with excuses, saying I had to focus on my studies and would still try to control my finances. I also had to take six months off uni for mental health reasons (which she still doesn't believe I have) and whenever I'd go out to parties or with friends, she would still make snarky comments and then, once again, give me silent treatments as a punishment. It was only at this point that I realised her issues weren't with money or me studying, they were entirely personal and she didn't want me leaving the house ""unnecessarily"". 

All of this has caused so many insane arguments over the years and they've only been getting worse. We'd been in family therapy recently. At our final session, the therapist sat me down alone and essentially said that my mother isn't capable of changing her attitudes. She says my mum believes that if I was to make my bed in the morning it would mean that I was no longer depressed, hence why she had been incessantly pushing me to make my bed to the point of verbal abuse, and even though the therapist had tried to explain that that isn't how it works, my mum is adamant in her ways as she ""read it somewhere on the internet."" 

She also consistently pulls the ""I don't remember saying that"" card whenever I bring up the abusive things she says in the past. I believe her when she says she doesn't remember it, but it just goes to show that she really does not realise what she says to me is harmful to the point of trauma and she fully considers it normal to say such things, once again proving the therapist right that she is incapable of changing.

These are all just a few examples of the many ways she hurts me, but my main point is that there are days when I can handle her silent treatments and there are days when they leave me curled up in the corner of my bedroom crying silently for 4 hours straight, like I did just now. I just want to know how I can handle this until I finally do move out. I don't want to get my sister and dad involved as the arguments I have with my mum have taken a serious toll on them too, not to mention my dad is dealing with health issues of his own and getting involved in the past had caused him so much stress he had to be hospitalised again. Therapy has helped me a bit and I'm in the process of getting medication, but for the time being I just want coping mechanisms, please.",21Oct2020,1

426,"Hi, a little background first. I'm 18M, close to 19 and had a ldr with a girl I knew from an erasmus for 9 months. When I visited her, I discovered she lost feelings a month earlier to me going and was also talking with another dude and she just wanted to see if we'd make out or something.

Well, here I am still broken after 2 months, and I'm pressuring and comparing myself to her a lot. I've never dated a girl in person, neither kissed or had sex. Honestly, I never cared to much about it, I'm a huge introvert, hate parties etc.

Thinking about how she has dated people before and gets a lot of attention from men while she has been the only girl interested on me, and how she's moving for uni next  year and will probably have a lot of fun and meet people while I'm on my 2nd uni year and made no friends kills me.

All of this pressures me to try to meet girls. Thing is; I'm not ready. I have massive social anxiety and self steem issues I need to fix first, and obviously right now isn't the best moment to meet people with covid. And honestly, I also do love being alone and don't feel the need to be on a relationship right now.

Usually he leaves us some spending money to buy breakfast and lunch supplies. He always did that and we always managed to buy it. But since he fought with my mom about petty stuff (bad jokes) I guess he decided to punish us by making us struggle to buy food.

440," We were a group of friends. From my friend group there was one friend. He loved a girl. And the other friend who is the main guy of this story we will call him Bob. Bob told the girl that my friend loves her, then he started talking trash and tried to hookup with her. My friend was furious and would've killed Bob. I calmed him down I thought that he just wanted to help and didn't know the full story at the time. Then Bob tried to hook up with abother friends girlfriend. Bob lied to my friends girlfriend that my friend is cheating and that his girlfriend should leave him and be with Bob. My friend was so pissed he attacked him and he started banging Bobs head on the ground. I was there for Bob and I pushed my friend away. Then everyone from my friend group started to push me and I started to fight with everyone just so save Bob. Bob left to go home and I was alone arguing with everyone that he will change. Everyone said to me that he will do the same for me and when he does I will regret saving him. A month has passed and I meet a girl that I really like. We will call her Despina. I was in love with her and I was getting ready to tell her. Then Bob my bestfriend had been trying to hook up behind my back and they got together. He was hiding that from me a whole month and wasnt planning on telling me. If I didnt tell her that I love her she wouldnt have told me that she is together with Bob. Then I asked Bob what the fuck why did he do that why he is hiding it from me. And he broke up with her and was forcing her to be in a relationship with me. I told him you can have her but next time I will beat you up so bad that you wont be able to go home. He did the same thing again and I didnt beat him up I just told him 3rd times the charm. Then there was Marija. I loved Marija more then any girl I loved. And my friend confessed to me that he loves her too. Everyone from my friend group attacked him that he should leave and not speak to her or they will all beat him up. I told him that nothing bad is going to happed if he just backs away. He didnt he started to cuddle with her and on the looks of it they were on the edge of a relation ship. One day it was just us. The friend group. No girls no nothing. I punched him in the face 5 times to show him that I wasnt joking when I said that I will beat him up until he cant walk home and never say hi to him every again and that he will lose his best friend. Next day we were at a birthday party. At the party we were play fighting with Bob. I was a little tipsy but I was fine. Then Bob punched me really good in the face. I was like why did you do that was it on accident? Bob said its him pointed to another friend. I said it cant be him he is far away. And he punched me again. I got really angry and beat him up. He started cryi ng and went home with marija. Then he told marija that he loves her that he loves her so much that he doesnt care if he loses me and wont ever give up on trying. And marija told him she liked him too because no guy has cried so much about loving her. And he told her that I love her too thats why we fought. Bob lied to marija and manipulated her to making me the bad guy and him beeing a good guy. The next day I didnt want to speak to him and Marija got us together trying to make peace. Then she asked me if I really like her. I told her yes and that I will beat up Bob about that. Marija left us alone and I beat him up so bad he couldnt walk and i carried him to marijas house in my arms. When he woke up we made peace and he said that he will back off. He backed off gave me space. But when I wasnt with them Bib would still do the same. I found out and got pissed and I told everyone while Bob is with them they shouldnt call me. And everyone said fuck Bob. Then marija asking whats found out that bob is an asshole. She confessed that she had feeling for him but not anymore and started crying. She got better and couldnt choose between me and him so she goes out once with him, once with me. She is more close with me more then ever. I have cried so much overthinking so much about why I am not good enough. Worrying about losing her. What should I do? I don't want to leave them or make peace with Bob.  
I want to show her how much I love her and change her mind about me.

TL;DR: Bob tried to hook up with bunch of my friends crushes and girlfriends. I defended him. Then he hooked up with 2 girls I loved. The 3rd I beat him up.

I’m sure they’ve always seen me as weird and they certainly don’t share my sense of humour, they’re the kind of people I need to censor myself around. Anyway, a while ago my mum sent me some pictures of them in the 70s which can only be described as hilarious. Honestly, absolute belters. My uncle with a huge afro, one of my aunts giving it Barb from Stranger Things, massive long shirt collars, pure comedy. So I posted it on Twitter. I don’t have a lot of followers, so I doubt many people even saw it. I wrote captions to accompany them to denote my incredulity at the images. I commented that my aunt looked like her son, my granddad was impossibly old considering this was 40-something years ago and he was still alive in the 90s and that my mum, having just got back from a holiday, looked like a handsome mixed race man. I thought nothing of it, forgot about it. Later, like several months later, I made a website for my freelance work. I sent the link to my mum and told her to send it to anyone and everyone, including her sisters. Shortly after, I received a call from my mum. She said she had got a confusing text from one of her sisters telling me to remove the family photos from the site. I had no idea what she was talking about. Mum talked to her sister and got back to me, reading the tweets I had posted months before. It then dawned on me that I had included a link to my Twitter account on my website, and that my aunt had followed it and found the thread. Shit. Both my aunt and my mum were absolutely livid and upset, fuming that I had posted what they viewed as private photos and disgusted at the comments which they deemed offensive. They thought I was mocking them, which I suppose I was, but it was in an affectionate way, about things that I would have thought they could laugh at too. I didn’t say they looked bad (apart from one of them, who I believe I said looked like a fucking nerd, but that was said with affection too), more that they looked hilariously 70s. They also thought that what I said about mum was racist, and that if a person of colour was to see it they would be extremely offended. I didn’t know what to say, I just apologised profusely, said I didn’t mean any offence and promised to take them down immediately, which I did. I also removed the Twitter link from my website. I tried to explain to my mum that other people wouldn’t see that as racist or offensive and that they would find it funny, but she vehemently disagreed. I tried to call my aunt to apologise but she said she was busy and would call me later. I’m now waiting nervously for that call.

445,"I'm  21 I turn 22 in january. I know for a lot of people that will sound like a long ass time but it's all happening so fast. 
This is the first year I escaped my abusive mother and I realized today once more I have no idea what I'm  doing. 
I have no idea what I want aside from my current project I am working on. 
Outside that I am miserable and full of regret. 
I have very few friends. I was supposed to be making more but ghosted the new one from anxiety. 
I escaped my mom and changed my name and I'm  seeing a therapist and should be better but like I don't  know why in this last week or two everything is just plummeting. 
My first holidays away from my siblings and mom. My birthday will be coming up and I only ever feel dread. I know everyone works at their own pace and also comparing myself to others will only make things worse but I can't  stop. 
I just keep feeling useless and helpless. And I do my best to make everyone happy all the time but anytime I snap at someone or need help I feel stupid, and like.. expendable. I have a best friend who I adore. She's  offered to help me in so many ways. But lately because I complain an BECAUSE she is helping me by sending food(Eating problems). I'm  worried I'll  just be a nuisance and she'll  see she doesn't  need or want me anymore (I know it's  probably unfounded she says she sees me like a sister and we talk like every day or so. But I guess part of me worries that's  incredibly annoying. Or she's  my friend out of pity even if I helped her in the past. I am aware this is reasurrances behavior anytime I impulsively ask to make sure otherwise and I'm  trying to learn to stop that. I'm  just so tired. 
Despite never getting a childhood (my days were spent in fear, harrassment, caring for all my siblings, appeasing my mother ect.. all until this year) sometimes I don't  feel like an adult, don't  get me wrong! I know I am one. I just feel really stupid compared to everyone else. The things I fear. My insecurities and interests . I never know what to do or say and despite everyone having their own stresses I always end up blaming myself for it or if I fail to fix someone else's problems no matter how big I just feel overwhelmed and stressed about it. Or if I do fix it then I end up having taken on too much and having no energy.
I've  been avoiding saying anything to my therapist because I don't  want to cry. It'll  make me feel weak and stupid. Even though I know it's  healthy to do so, especially in front of a therapist. 
I just feel like a burden. 
And despite my family trying out a new tradition I suggested for Halloween this year I feel so down. 
I think holidays just won't  hold the same appeal they did when I was very young. 
And even then they never got to be super happy. I feel like the best we go was relief from my mom occasionally.) 
I don't  know what to do. 
I'd  call this a rant except I am looking for advice genuinely. 

How do I tell when people are genuinely upset with me? When is asking friends for help too much? Should I just stop saying anything if anytime they help or show me attention I just feel guilty and replaceable? 

Is there anyway to ""regain"" the magic the holidays are supposed to have. Or am I just destined to quiet lonely holidays. 
It's  going to be so quiet this year. 
And it's  stressing me out. 
For anyone from healthy families what can be expected at holidays. I tried asking my friends but they only really said ""oh the family gathers and we watch TV and have so and so traditions"" 
I guess I just always imagined them more magical as a kid. All I had growing up was a) having to watch everyone's  kids to the point that sometimes I didn't  recognize them because my mom offered me up 2)lots o drunk adults 3) being ignored only after we were shown off like objects that sort of thing. 
Is there anyone who knows how to bring joy back to like holidays and birthdays? 
Cause as is despite knowing I'm  young the idea of another birthday where I trail behind all other adults my ages just kinda disgusts me as does the idea that I've  just lost all magic from the things I looked forward to as a child. 

My last bit of needed advice for now is this, is there anyone who never had a childhood who can explain how to come to terms with it? Like is there some magic way to just accept it or mini ways to replace it? Or is this just something I get to perpetually mourn until it goes away?

Does anyone have advice for learning to trust others again? Or does it always just boil down to rationalizing every single little thought? (I.e you have a thought one of you friends or family will turn against you either physically or socially. You then spend the next few hours attempting to argue as to why that wouldn't  happen.

Last year I call this person a ""he"" and no problem. I  look up this person, male name and look male.  I get confused and say ""but he refer to male, this person male"", people get mad. I apologise. Few week later, I accidentally say ""that person is a he"". I apologise, did not mean to offend.

Last week I say accidentally ""it"" about this person. Person starts crying on zoom call. Emailing me now that I need to get expelled and about contacting immigration . Other people too on twitter talking about me, calling me bigot and transphobic.  They say I do not try and am doing it on purpose. I try very hard to remember english grammar, but I am doing engineering and study hard maths. I am tired a lot of time and trying to remember english grammar become hard. Thinking of this makes me upset, I try very hard. Its an accident, I not do this on purpose.  This is so dumb to me, I do not care enough about this person life to do on purpose. I have better thing to do.

 I know my grammar in english is not the best. I speak three languages other than english. Most of my english skill is from media, but I can pronounce things OK.  In my native language past tense is not always used. Sometimes this confuse me in english. I have a problem with the pronouns of english, because in my native  language when you speak there is no difference between male and female.  Sometime by accident I might mix ""she"", ""he"" and ""it"". 

 I do not know what to do. I am mad and upset, I try very hard and they try to expel me now because I call someone a ""he"".  I do not want to fight people, I just want to do my study in peace. I am now scared to go on zoom because of these people.",21Oct2020,1
448,"For the past year we have been trying to sort out a will for my maternal grandmother. She is old and prone to becoming sick, somewhat senile. My mother was the one who was going to be receiving everything as she was her only child. My mother died about a year ago so we have been adjusting her will. When my mum died, a distant cousin came out from nowhere and became suddenly interested in my grandmas well-being, feelings etc and even READING a poem at my mothers funeral.

As a result, she felt the need to change her will so that my father is the executor and everything will be split 50/50 with my brother. THIS HAS BEEN THE PLAN SINCE WE STARTED.

Now, yesterday we went over so that we could set up a zoom call to finalise everything between her and the solicitor. We leave her with the phone in the room alone, but I’m just outside the door in case of any tech issues. Through the door, I hear her asking if she can place this distant cousin on the will.

After her call finishes, in a roundabout way I ask her about it and she denies making any changes at all, despite me hearing her request that specific one. This morning she has told us she has set up a further meeting to “finalise” things - which is already what we did. So it’s obvious something is up and I know she lied to my face.

What’s the best way to go about this?",21Oct2020,1
450,"21 year old male. For about 7 years I had a bad habit that I believed affected my confidence as I grew older. Wasn’t till April of this year I began to try to leave the bad habit behind. International student studying at a Uni. 

I underestimated myself because in my first two years at uni, I thought it was going to be incredibly hard for me so I put all my focus into studies and ignored the opportunities to build on friendships with people I met. Nothing could be further from the truth. I’ve done well but it’s come at a huge cost. Only have distant friends here and one real proper friend who I hardly see cause ironically this is the year where I should have really had eyes only on academics. 

Did a lot to work on myself over the summer. Literally everything you can name. Came to uni this year and it’s harder to make friends cause of COVID and busy with several modules as the university makes us fulfil credits for the sake of it and the options are not relevant. Busy applying for jobs as well and making a bit of progress there. Initially first few weeks was good with flatmates but I’ve found out the sort of people they are. I could bang on but I’m trying to summarise. It’s just unsustainable, and I’ve been depressed a lot to extents you won’t believe. I wish I knew things earlier. Cause I’ve missed out on so much since I joined this uni that if at the end I don’t get the ultimate goal not matter how good my final grades are, it’ll be a monumental failure and I don’t see any recovery from that. 

 Btw for months I’ve developed good morning habits, shifted the way I thought about things, stopped regretting, made effort to leave that bad habit behind but ultimately the past constantly comes back to haunt me. Even after doing everything right that I possibly could.",21Oct2020,1

453,"When I first started working with them, they seemed nice enough. I befriended one and soon found out they were a close knit group of friends. A pair of them were supposedly close friends for a long time because one of them had married the lifelong best friend of another. We had a lot in common and they kind of accepted me into their little group.
After a while I started to notice things that made me change my opinions about them. They started exhibiting behavior that you wouldn’t expect from great friends. They would talk to me separately and talk shit about the others. And it was about everything from life choices, finances, physical appearance, their relationships, to family members and their personal business and other coworkers. I didn’t like this at all because if they treat their best friend that way, I know for a fact they talk about me the same way. 
One of them is very confrontational, loud, and immature. Another is very sneaky, manipulative, and overly nice. The others in the group just seem to follow along and do the same type of stuff. 
I have always been a private, easy going type of person. Now that I know how these people are, I want to distance myself from them and associate with more mature people who don’t thrive on drama. I used to see them all every day, but our schedules got changed so we don’t  see each other until our shifts overlap or one of us works overtime. I still see them often and more than I would like. 
My initial reaction was to tell them exactly what I’ve already said here. But knowing them, I wouldn’t be able to give them the honest truth without dealing with some sort of backlash at my job. I don’t want to jeopardize my job, make it harder, or more stressful due to their pettiness and immaturity. But I also can’t associate with toxic people. I feel their behavior to be draining, and I’m scared it will somehow pull me in against my will and eventually make me resort to the same type of things just by being around it. I feel stuck and I need some solid advice.",21Oct2020,1
454,"TW // Suicide//death in the past(22 years ago).

She’s so passive aggressive, it drives me insane. Due to COVID she hasn’t been able to work and at her age, she doesn’t have to but it gets her out of the house and I can’t take her places all willy nilly because she’s a high risk.

Anyways, day before yesterday I spent the day moving furniture out of my house (couches, etc. real heavy stuff) by myself. She asked me about getting some letter stickers from the store, I said yes. The next day I was incredibly sore from all of the stuff I did the day before and I apologized and asked if I could do it the next day because I was super sore. She said ok.

Fast forward to today and she shoots me such a passive aggressive message (and it’s not the first time!! She does it all the time to my dad and I!) and basically says that she gives up on making decorations (probably because of the letter situation) and goes on to say she’s gonna sell everything because there’s no reason to have it (that’s what my dad says to her because she is a hoarder). And just goes on and on. She always does this. It’s always exhausting. My dad and I vent to each other about it. It’s gotten so bad that my dad ignores being at home unless it’s to sleep (she lives with him). I explained that’s not the answer and if he talked to her then it wouldn’t be so bad.

I understand she is going stir crazy from being at home. I totally understand how it can drive you crazy. But I can’t take her anywhere without worrying she’ll get sick and die. And I have to be cautious when seeing her because I work 6 days a week around hundreds of people. Technically I’m not even supposed to be seeing her because it puts her health in jeopardy but I try to see her as often as I can without it being when I’ve been around a lot of people to try to avoid these mood swings she has. 

It’s just really exhausting. I love her. But I hate arguing. I feel like it is toxic. Last time this happened, I went to see her and I was already having a bad day and she told me to go home because she didn’t need the company that day (being bitchy) and I blatantly said that I didn’t give a fuck because I was there to see my grandma. Not being disrespectful but I don’t have a lot of time to see her and I’m not going to NOT see her because we are not always promised tomorrow. And after like 4 hours of letting her vent to me, her attitude changed. She’s just so negative. All the time. I love her so much, she’s one of my favorite people on the entire world but I can’t stand the negativity. I already deal with being sad and anxious a lot of the time, and that just makes it worse. But I can’t tell her that because one of her sons committed suicide the year I was born and I don’t want to make her think of that or think that I will be doing that. I just try to be as considerate as possible of her feelings. And everyone else’s for that matter.

I just don’t know what to do. Please give me some advice. She’s an old lady and we don’t see head to head on everything but I try to ignore that just to be around her because after all, she is my grandma. I’m just tired.",21Oct2020,1
455,"Call me Ace. My family has a very bumpy history when it comes to school grades. Some excelled and some didn't perform nearly as well as they would have liked. I belong to the latter, with a small twist. I've never loved anything school related. my line of thinking is: why in the hell would I spend years of my life for a diploma, only to go into heavy debt to go to a decent college, being depressed and overworked until I get a job, and continue on barely slipping by for the rest of the rat race until I'm old and withered. Currently, I am in tenth grade and have looked for every option to get out of the cycle imaginable. Youtube, twitch, you name it. Then, I got an Xbox One. Yeah, I think you can see where this is going, but please don't click off just yet.

Then we played new super mario bros. wii, and I was FAR better than anyone else after about an hour. I always loved the idea of being a professional gamer, but it never really seemed like a possibility. that is, until a game you \*might\* have heard of came around called: Fortnite.

That's when I realized I have something I could really use to get paid. I did some research, and I'm told I can make $10,000 a week if I continue down the path I'm following. in my opinion, you'd have to be insane to decline a deal like that, especially if you are already highly skilled at the job. however, I am told by my mother I have to get good grades, and get a ""real job"" even though she knows I am very skilled, and would make more than anyone in the family ever had. she threatens to call my abusive grandfather if I don't do well, and it's getting me weary and very depressed.

456,"So here’s what happened less than 10 minutes ago. I was pulling out of a restaurant, I was waiting for cars to be clear so I can make a right turn on a busy road. Out of nowhere, this guy (it looked like he was in his phone can’t know for sure) rammed his bike into the side of my car while he left the sidewalk. I was at a complete stop and he had plenty of room to go straight to the next part of the side walk but he just swerved and hit me. Ialready checked and it left a decent scratch on my car. He called me as asshole, etc. I of course feel bad, not because i think it was my fault but because the guy was obviously pained. I pulled over immediately (same parking lot I was just in) I assumed he was following me because I made it obvious I was pulling over. I wanted to make sure he was ok. But I didn’t see him. I started following the side walk he was on and I saw him walking with the bike (he had a bit of a limp, not that bad) I called out to him, he looked back, saw me, and kept walking. I tried getting his attention two more times, following him for a good 2-3 minutes. He definitely saw me but completely ignored me. After a while I just decided to walk back to my car because I didn’t know what else I could do. I feel bad, but not too bad because I still think it was his fault, and I still tried to help. I’m worried about legal implications, I checked and there were no cameras, i don’t think he stopped and wrote down my license plate or anything. I just don’t want to get in trouble down the road, what should I do? I tried my best to help and he just didn’t care, he seemed fine enough but idk. Should I be worried about legal implications?

459,"Context

I'm 19 and in my first year of university.

Developed anxiety when I was 8-10 years old and PTSD when I was 16. My gp assessed my anxiety right now to be moderate but I've had much worse periods where I think I would've been assessed as having severe anxiety and it just feels like I'm about to go into a bad stage again. This is why this problem has come up

My mum only took me to the gp once for mental health when I was 15 and in one of my worst periods, despite being sent home from primary school with physical symptoms of anxiety and having my first panic attack at age 10. She also guilted me for going to counselling when no progress was being made.

I've had school counselling, CAMHS counselling, group therapy &amp; CBT for PTSD and tried all of the herbal remedies. None of these worked. 

After a long talk with my gp we decided that it was best that I tried antidepressants. Also making sure that it doesn't contradict with my current medication or have negative reactions with medication I might be moved onto instead (for a chronic condition I've had since childhood but my mum wouldn't take me to the gp for).

When phoning home and telling my mum, her first response was telling me that antidepressants are bad, they cause major highs and lows, and they make you loopy. (Luckily the call cut out and we resumed a normal conversation of her asking me if I'd met any cute boys despite dropping every hint possible that I'm lesbian)

I don't know how to explain to her that:

1- antidepressants help you, they don't make you worse (when things go right)

2- I have a problem, being convinced something will go wrong and end in my death isn't just a quirky personality trait that's alright to have a giggle about

3- telling me my self-harm scars make me unemployable or shouting at me for physical symptoms of anxiety/panic attacks doesn't help, and makes it worse.

The break up was sugar coated as it could get, we broke up due to her finding someone else and I spent my time telling myself how it isn't that bad, if I was honest with myself and her would have had huge fights, messy drama etc. So we kept it clean. 

Anyway at the beginning of September I needed time of no contact cause I was confused with how I felt (she wanted to be friends)I said I would be okay with contact when I feel better and moved on entirely. I'm now moving on with life, I've moved out of my grandmother's house and working on my degree. I feel much better and happy by myself to be honest. Thing is not too long ago I'm thinking about the questionable things that have been said and done (now i have reflected) for example at the beginning of no contact I checked my Google account login activity and saw she was signed in and using my account (I have my journal, calender, YouTube and messenger apps signed in with that account) I logged her out but I was mad she was invading in on my privacy I didn't message her about it though cause I wanted to keep to NC. 

Other things that make me raise a eyebrow now is, suggesting to send me nudes (at the beginning of her new relationship) she admitted she saw me as a back up option (this was all before NC) etc

We recently had phone calls with each other where she told me she was in a 8 year relationship and her and the guy didn't see eye to eye anymore so they ended it and she did enjoy being single and doing the casual hook up scene. Recently drugs came up in convo and she told me shes done a handful (cant list them all out because I dont know the names) mostly things you can find at a rave or festival. She even told me shes had sex on drugs with those random hook up people. I didn't ask about her past too much when it came to this stuff because it would get more stuck in my head. I wanted to ask if shes been in threesomes, but it could be personal and I didn't but even tho I didn't ask and don't know the actual answer, in my mind I go with the worse case and say yes. Even though she didn't tell me at all. This I know is dumb of me. 

I appreciate her telling me and we were able to have this open convo about it. It doesn't make me feel good because I'm someone who doesn't do drugs. Not even weed. And I've only been with 1 person vs her x amount. (I didn't want to know). I was talking to her about it because I felt weird not mad or super sad just had this feeling and she said is it disappointed. And now that I know of it.. it is. I thought it could be jealousy because I haven't lived my life as wild as her so shes had more fun in her life than me but I don't think thats it. 

So, now I don't know what to do. I'm still interested in her and she funny and we have good convos but idk how I can get over this in my mind. I'm sure its easy for people to get over which is why I'm asking reddit because maybe I can see it thru a different lens. I try to tell myself its just her past and she can't change it and shouldn't because that's her life and I'm not in charge. But it still makes me feel weird inside.

My grandparents, aunts, and uncles aren't doing the best (even before COVID), and several of them were college dropouts. As much as I want to succeed, I just don't feel like I have the genes. I'm really worried that I'll mess up and turn out to be a lazy slob, like many others in my family. I want to be a nurse, but I just don't think I'm smart enough to do that.

He is overweight and is very wrinkled, even though he's only 51. He looks like he's 80, and he has anger issues as well. When he's angry, he yells at me and stomps really hard.

Apart from that, my dad isn't very bright either. He can barely fix anything, and he always has to hire someone to come over and fix it. When he's not working, he just plays video games and watches TV. He never exercises or tries to work out, and he gains weight very rapidly.",21Oct2020,1
464,"some background:
i (16F) live in a small house with my mother, who is 36 years old. i just gave away my beloved dog, marx (don’t ask about the name), a few days ago, and i’m still so sad about it. we had to give him away because we couldn’t train him nor give him the space he needs — he’s a 5-month-old male golden retriever who’s hyper and likes being the alpha.

my mother and grandmother (who often visits) were scared of him because he’d pounce on them and try to play bite. i, being the tiny 5’0 child i am, couldn’t take control over him very well. it was the last straw for my mother when he bit me and drew blood.

we made sure that he was given away to a really good household, somewhere where he has a lot of space and an owner who could give him as much time as he needed to train. i’m sad, but i’m still so happy for him.

my question is, though, is there a chance for me to actually get a dog fit for the family? i was thinking of adopting this time instead of getting from a breeder so that i could help save a dog’s life and also know what kind of personality they have. the thing is, though, i’m not sure if i could give them enough time to play or even space in the house. the house is more fit for cats, but ever since we got marx, my mother and i slowly became dog people (though we still love cats very much).

i was also wondering if you guys had any tips or useful links if ever i still actually have a chance of getting a dog without risking their happiness due to the lack of space and time i could afford spending. if you have any questions, feel free to ask me. thanks in advance!!",21Oct2020,1

When Anna could finally contact Sarah, Sarah was like 'I was unwell, thank you for the assignment'. Anna had sent various texts asking Sarah if she's alright but Sarah didn't reply. Sarah has this habit of only replying after several days but her replies are not that useful.

Lately I've been getting to know a newer group of people outside my traditional friend group. These people are basically friends of a friend, but they are very nice people and I think I'm integrating nicely. However another one of my friends from my traditional friend group is also being introduced to them and seems to have made very quick bonds which I will be honest about I am kind of jealous of. On top of this they seem to be interacting more and more over time and more privately (I don't mean just texting idrc about that). When I ask about this I often get short hand answers or deflects but I know for a fact they and the rest of the group interact often. I have been invited and gone to what believe is all the times people have met up except for one, but now I'm having doubts about whether or not that is true. This is a good friend of mine so id hope its not true, and maybe its not and I'm just being overly paranoid cause I'm not thinking straight. But there is a sense of this person trying to get close with the group (or at least the people I'm closest with in the group) first to like secure a spot. So I don't know what to do if I'm right there is a good chance nobody else see's it and then I look kinda crazy which doesn't really help my situation and if I'm wrong I will both look crazy and hurt my friend potentially losing them in the process.

My mom then called me in class and I obviously couldn't talk to her, so I just declined the call. When school ended, I went behind the tree to get it back, but it had disappeared and now there were 2 backpacks laying there instead. Me and my friend opened them and found out who they were, because their names were written on some books of theirs. We talked to a teacher and he took their backpacks to the teachers' room.

472,"So today in school, when i was gonna lock my scooter, my locks code wasnt working. I realized i had taken my brother's lock instead! School was starting soon, so I tried calling my mom to ask my brother for the code, but she didn't pick up the phone, so I just hid the scooter behind a tree and went to class. My mom then called me in class and I obviously couldn't talk to her, so I just declined the call. When school ended, I went behind the tree to get it back, but it had disappeared and now there were 2 backpacks laying there instead. Me and my friend opened them and found out who they were, because their names were written on some books of theirs. We talked to a teacher and he took their backpacks to the teachers' room.

473,Recently my boyfriend transferred to a new college with a pretty big party environment. His roommates are all single and he’s constantly around other girls. The majority of his friends are girls and they’re always in and out of his and his roommates apartment. They do a lot of stuff together almost everyday. He tells me to trust him but usually doesn’t mention anything till i find out about it on my own. I don’t know what to do. I wake up and go to sleep anxious every night because I don’t know the things he’s doing and I want to trust him so bad but it’s hard when he doesn’t fully communicate and does a lot of things that make me so uncomfortable.

474,"Long story short straight away (and first time posting here): Italian, 35, male, software engineer. Spent the past 8 years in UK. During the first pandemic wave I decided to relocate back to Italy. Moved back mid July, found a job and flat here. Nothing checks out, nothing works, high levels of anxiety and depression. Family isn't really supportive (father understands, mother doesn't and is also always against me). I still feel like a clueless teenager around her and it hurts. I have now decided to re locate back and it's going to have to be ASAP due to c19 related risks and before brexit strikes (I have the right to remain though, and coming mid January will be able to apply for dual nationality). Mother is being really hard to talk with and it's making this decision difficult to take with serenity. I'm still convinced and will have to do whatever it takes to ensure my future is safe and stable.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering the above, the advice/question I'm asking is: in a situation like this, where she denies and deflects all attempts (while my father seems to be more responsive and, even though he might not agree, he understands me more) of conversation, how do you preserve your own mental well being and persevere with your plans? What's the best thing I can do, other than pack and leave (I will have / want to move back in with them for 1 or 2 weeks before packing my car and driving over)? I still want to spend some time with them and make it count, because if the move succeeds (and it has to), it might be a while before I see them again.

I'm really struggling, basically, between being a grown up with a goal in mind and a son that does not want to be disrespectful, regardless of age and independence.

I contacted T-Mobile recently and got the IMEI and they also told me it was unlocked on July 3. I also have been watching the router recently and there is a very weird device on it that doesn’t show up as a connected device but it being used with the router and I assume it’s the iPhone. I know she is using it when I am falling asleep because the router says it’s being used around midnight to 3 am. I don’t know how to catch her at this point but my marriage falls apart if I talk to her about it and she has been telling everyone a mixed up version of the story and now I’m getting phone calls that I’m an awful person and she needs to just leave me, so at this point I do want to prove my side but I also love her so I’m stuck.

482,"Should I see a therapist? 

Backstory: When I was a kid I was very sensitive to a lot of factors. I hated loud noises because they would interrupt my thoughts, I couldn't stand certain clothes because they would feel uncomfortable to my skin (I also hated those paper thingies that are on the inside of all clothes). I was and still am a maladaptive daydreamer. And I was also very sensitive emotionally, like I could sense others emotions based on their behaviour  and body image and I was also 'weak' emotionally and would cry really easily even as a teenager.  My mother said that when I was a kid she thought I was autistic. 

Luckily though I've grown out of most of the factors that  effected my childhood. But now still it's mostly noise and feelings that are troubling me.

Noise: It's much better now but sometimes when I'm at clubs I get disoriented and start to freak out when the music is just banging my eardrums. Usually I just go outside for about 15minutes and breathe a little fresh air and I can rejoin my friends at the club.

Feelings however is something I still really struggle with.  I'm highly empathetic and I feel like I'm obsessed with trying to solve  problems of other people. 
I used to be obsessed with trying to seek out problems that people were having and because I was easy to talk to people trusted me with their issues. I actively talked to people to find out what was troubling them and when I found that out I wanted solve the problem even though I wasn't even asked for help. 

Anyway I also left that behaviour behind me because I realized it's not up to me to solve peoples problems, especially if they didn't ask for my help.

But now yet again I stepped in a bucket that I knew was there. An  friend of mine who I knew was depressed and who I also tried to help about three years ago reached out to me. She said that everything was still bad and that she was feeling dead inside. I thought to myself 'fuck it I'll take  the challange (yes even though she didn't even ask anything of me and probably just wanted someone to listen to), I've evolved, I can help her'. All day thoughts about helping her crossed my mind even though I had other important things to do (but what could be more important than someones life?). My brain wasn't any help either since every time I tried to get my mind off her and do my own things I would make up these imaginary scenarios where I would see her doing something bad to herself (suicide). But now that I've tried helping her again I feel that I drove her away and nothing has really changed for her and now I feel bad because I wasn't able to help her again. Fuck I swear that I know that other peoples problems aren't my problems and that I can't help people who don't want to be helped but I keep stepping in the same bucket. 

Should I see a therapist based on this information? Why can't I help myself from trying to solve problems that aren't mine to solve? I've always tried to solve all of my issues myself and most of the time I'm happy and good, but some patterns I just can't get over.

484,"Hey there,

I recently was hired by a local car dealership as the appointment coordinator. I have NO background in cars and I am not expecting anyone who responds to be an expert on them either. They hired me for my extensive history with customer service. I've been in a variety of jobs that span from food to credit cards.

So with this in mind, I have a small amount of office setting knowledge, even less when it comes to setting appointments. It's been pretty simple up until this point in my career. 

""What do you want on your pizza?"" or ""I'll send off a ticket to see about having your interest waived,"" is much different in comparison to needing to check 3 places for an opening for an appointment to be made, running the cashier's desk, sending and receiving emails in regards to online appointment bookings and then also selling services on those same appointment calls.

I guess what I'm asking is, what should I do to improve faster? What should I focus on? I'm only 3 weeks in but I feel like I should have it down to a science and it still feels like I don't get it all.

485,"So, here’s more of an explanation. I don’t know where to write this, so I’m here. I’m confused as to the type of relationship my mother and I have. A lot of people have told me that she’s toxic and manipulative, but she doesn’t insult me or attack me. Here’s some examples of things she has said- 1) I can scream in your face and you have to sit down, shut up, and say yes ma’am. 2) Nope, I’m not going to let you manipulate me into getting what YOU want. 3) You’re just upset because [my name] isn’t getting what [my name] wants. 4) Respect is a given in this house. It is not earned. You will respect me. 5) You’re just throwing a tantrum like a child because you aren’t getting what you want. And she’s said more. If we argue and I bring up something or how I feel about something, she’ll say “Oh my god! Did you hear that [my dad's name]? SHE is telling ME what SHES gonna do! That is hilarious! The amount of disrespect you have is beyond me.” She’ll also say things like “[my name], you don’t have it as bad as you think. You make it out as if you’re being abused.” There’s so much more but those are the key points. I was talking to her about how I feel like she’s constantly tracking/watching me and breathing down my neck. I have diagnosed paranoia, but a lot of it is resulted from certain things she has told me in this past about how “she knows everything I do” and “I can’t do anything she doesn’t know about” and she “always finds out about things I do” and she has eyes on my. We have cameras all around the house. We have Life360. I have a dash cam inside my car that shows where I am (and has the option to allow audio). I told her that because of this and because of certain things she has said to me, it contributed to the amount of paranoia I have and I can’t trust her because I don’t know what she does and does not do. She’s never transparent with me. I told her that and she was telling me how she doesn’t care, and I HAVE to open up to her even if I can’t trust her- it’s one of her rules. Also, she got so butthurt and offended when I said I couldn’t trust her. She was going on and saying “I cannot believe you just said that.” and “Wow, that is so disrespectful I cannot believe that just came out of your mouth.” So I’ll tell her about how I feel and how things she does makes me feel, and she’ll say “[my name], you don’t live in an abusive household. Just because you don’t have all of these outrageous ‘privileges’ that other teens may have doesn’t mean you have it bad. You’re just mad you’re not getting what you want. My answers will not change, and you will respect me. You will do as I say.” I told her she never respects me as a human, and she made this big scene and gasped and said that she does respect me, but I’m just mad that I’m not getting my way. And she makes it very clear that she’s the parent and I am the child. She also makes it very clear that we are not equals, and she is above me when it comes to respect and authority (which I understand to a certain degree). But at the same time, she’ll do these absolutely insane thing, and she’ll micromanage everything I do so she can have strict, tight control over me. She has unresolved trauma, so she’s afraid to lose people. But she has such a tight grip on everything I do (there’s a lot I haven’t mentioned, but I’m not allowed to do much ‘because she said so’). So she’ll do these outrageous things that I literally cannot even understand how she found it rational, and she’ll justify it by saying “it’s just because I love you” and “I’m just afraid to lose you. You know my past.” And I tell her she’s taking her unresolved trauma out on me and how she might need therapy for that and other reasons not mentioned. And of course, she says “That is disrespectful! I’m doing just fine, thank you!” and “I’m not taking my trauma out on you. That’s just how you like to see it because you’re a TEENAGER and I’m the ADULT.” After we have a big argument (which we argue every day), she comes to me and apologizes and explains how she didn’t mean for it to come off a certain way and she’s sorry and it’s only because she loves me. So then I feel like I can’t be upset because she has a reason. But she’s not abusive because she doesn’t insult me or hit me. She’ll tell me how proud she is of me, how much she loves me, how she’s always there for me, and how she’s my #1 supporter, but it feels like otherwise. Can anyone tell me what’s going on? And am I in the wrong?",21Oct2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

okay i will put it shortly... i dont have anyone (anymore) who i fuck with on a closer level.. people i go out with, etc. its been like 2 years, maybe a bit more.. that drives me crazy.. mostly alone and isolated..

i had moments here and there too, when it was fun.. such as starting uni a year ago.. and for the first month it was actually very fun.. i talked to everyone, was very outgoing, and was initiative as hell... mainly cuz at first i was the only one that knew everyone at first...

but anyways.. i stopped for some reason.. like thats the worst part.. **for no reason** .. it was literally mixed of attention seeking, by stopping talking to them, in order to make them wander what i was up to and stuff, also i was kinda pissed off and tired of them denying to go out sometimes and plus i didn't feel like anyone's first choice at times.. anyways.. I ACTED IMMATURE ASF AND FUCKED UP

anyways... i dont fuck with anyone anymore.. and it fucks me up... i mean at least before corona, despite not being my old self, i still talked to people and chemistry was still there.. but now. after february, to september, going back to uni, for a week, i realized that it was all gone.. i didn't even talk to them thru social media, group chats and shit..

i dont know what to do..

cuz of my immaturity, i had my school close friends cut me off too, right before graduating, the year before.. so its like, i've been like this for a while.. no one i fuck with.. no one close.. and its mentally exhausting..

now, online shit too... the thought of me being isolated and rotting at home, since february cuz of corona FUCKS ME UP TONSSSS... i dont even know how to explain it.. its just beyond everything. won't be able to express it thru words.. and also, it was worse thinking that others are having good time, and me rotting alone...

i dont know what to do anymore... like... i dont wanna waste my time like this.. this week im turning 19, and i dont wanna waste 

&amp;#x200B;

i mean.. i wouldn't mind online stuff if i had people i'd go out with, and if uni wasn't the only social place for me.. and top of that, i also kinda like someone. and cant even see them anymore.. **ITS BEEN 8 MONTHS..** thats actually one of the main reasons why im going insane too..

499,"Hi everyone, I am very conflicted about the possibility of adopting a certain dog. My partner and I almost decided we should do it yesterday, but then we talked about it and agreed that it wouldn’t be fair to the dog. However, I feel terrible about our decision even though it makes sense. To explain, we found these two dogs wandering outside our apartment two nights ago (it’s a pretty common occurrence where we live — dogs escape from wherever they live and wander and most owners don’t do that much about it, or they’re strays/dumped dogs to begin with). We grabbed them and gave them food/water, and held onto them while I posted in some facebook groups to try to see if their owner was looking for them. Unfortunately all of the leads I was given didn’t pan out, and we weren’t able to hold onto them for the night because dogs technically aren’t allowed in our apartment (plus the animal shelter was closed and no one in the groups offered to hold them for the night). Luckily we ran into one of them again the next day, so we grabbed him again, gave him more food and water, and took him for a walk around the neighborhood in the hopes he would lead us home or we would run into someone who would recognize him. No luck! We took him to the vet to check for a microchip, but no luck their either. Even though he’s some kind of pitbull mix, he’s the sweetest ham of a dog I’ve ever met. We decided to break the rules and take him inside our apartment to give him a bath (he handled it really well despite seeming kind of afraid — he didn’t growl or anything and let us pick him up, put him in the tub, and hold him there while we washed him). I gave him a name, Zeus, which was probably a mistake because it created an stronger attachment of sorts. It might’ve been because he was exhausted, but he was super chill. Once we sat down, he laid down as well and napped. Aside from putting his front paws up on the counter, he didn’t try to jump on the couch or eat any of the stuff in our apartment. He wasn’t food aggressive — he didn’t growl or anything if I took his food away, and he didn’t care about being man-handled (picked up, ears examined, gums examined). The only thing we noticed is that whenever he saw an animal or dog on our walks, he would bolt at it. But he got along really well with the dog he was with and we think he’s pretty young (1-2 years?) so maybe that’s something that could be addressed with training. Anyways, we ultimately decided that if we did want to adopt him, we should do it legally. So we found his friend via facebook, picked him up, and took them both to the local animal shelter with the intent of going back after his 72 hours was up to adopt him. But like I said, my partner and I have kind of decided not to do that anymore, and maybe just try to find him a good home? The shelter will likely have a hard time doing it here. Because my partner is gone 13 hours a day, and while I’m home right now, if I get the job I’m applying to, I could be gone 11-13 hours a day too. Plus we’d probably have to have him registered as an emotional support animal so that he’d be allowed in our apartment (though we should be moving to a house by spring of 2021). [I do actually qualify for an emotional support animal.] And because he’s some kind of pitbull mix, that comes with a whole host of preconceived notions and stigmas from other people and even cities, even though when you go to let him he literally just flops right over on his back and hams it up. So this was a really long post, but I just need advice: are we making the right decision? We could give him a really loving home but there might be a period of like 4-5 months where he’s alone for a long time for 3 days straight. Is a few months of an unideal situation better than being in a shelter? Maybe his owners will claim him from the shelter, but if we don’t adopt him, he might stay in that really sad place for a while because of his breed, and maybe even be euthanized because apparently rescues don’t take pit bulls. We could try and contact a pitbull rescue and see if they’ll help (I left a message for one), but I don’t know how likely that is. So many variables. What should we do?

TLDR: We decided not to adopt this sweet pitbull mix we found on the streets. but I feel terrible about the decision because he’s sitting in the shelter and if not claimed or adopted, might eventually be euthanized. We will both likely be working long hours, so he might have to be home alone if we did adopt him, and we would have to deal with all the pitbull stigma that comes with the breed even though he’s mixed. What should we do?",21Oct2020,1

502,"(I recommend you read my latest post here before reading this, it's like 2 or 3 posts down my profile)
So, I've been hanging out with some people my age that I wanted to for sooo long, but not anything special, I'd just go with them and we'd have a lot of fun. Now keep in my mind, when I would be with them, they'd always SCREAM LIKE 5 YEAR OLDS WHEN WATCHING HORROR MOVIE, while I'd be rather quiet. They'd be talking about who they want to date etc and I'd still not do much cause I'm not into dating.

So yesterday, I called one of them (the girl I talked about in my previous post) and asked them if they'd hang out today. She said that one of the friends was at her house but they wouldn't do anything, they'd just sit there and they wouldn't invite anyone. I accepted this and moved on, until I saw that she was doing a live on Instagram. It was her and another 2 of them doing silly stuff, and I asked if I could go with them. She said ok, and as I was ready to walk out of my door, she called me and said that one of them is leaving and the other one would be leaving soon. I sighed and said ok, and again I sat down at the sofa browsing YouTube, Instagram etc.

After like an hour, I saw one of her stories, and she was at her house, WITH ALL OF THEM IN. I couldn't just ignore this (also, the story was in close friends, and a couple of days ago, she said that she removed me from her close friends, and when I asked why she said idk, it was obviously to lie about them not hanging out) and I started a conversation, it went like this:

Me: For God's sake. You said you wouldn't hang out
*the story got deleted and then she started typing*
Her: Oh no no that's just a video that *a person in the group* had taken before (even though she was the one recording the video)
Me: That doesn't make any sense. You are recording the video and more people are there. How do you explain that?
Her: I took it earlier, before doing the live
Me: look, if you don't want me in the group, just tell me cause I ASKED if I could join
Her: look, I don't want you to feel lonely, but I don't think you can come with us as often (I only went with them 5 times in less than a month)

You'll better understand how I was feeling after that if you read my previous post I made here. Now I'm stuck with friends that I only see at school and always have ""homework"" to do.

Is there anything I can seriously do at this point? I really wasn't being annoying and they know they can trust me. I don't have the same interests as them, but I really don't think that's the problem. I just don't know what to do or feel at this point",21Oct2020,1

i’m not ready to come out to my parents, maybe i will be before i graduate, but even then, my home city is mildly homophobic and transphobic so i wouldn’t feel quite safe here. 

i would like to just go to university right away, but i don’t do any extra curricular activities because i have such bad anxiety and i worry so much. my grades are fairly decent, on the higher end, but my mom says i won’t be able to get in on grades alone. so she said i should get a college diploma in my home city and do post graduate abroad, which also opens up my scholarship choices and i can go so much farther in my career. i like this idea, i think its great, i would love to do it... but that means repressing my sexuality and gender identity for another 4(ish) years. 

i can’t do that again. i’ve become extremely depressed over being closeted, i feel like i can never truly be who i am while im at home. and i don’t want to miss out on being young and out, i can never get my youth back if i spend more of it pretending to be heterosexual and cisgender.

505,"I can admit I am paranoid. But at the beginning of this year I asked him to stop talking to this girl because they had a really close relationship (which they formed after I left for basic training-military) they were super close when I came back and I dealt with it for a while even tho I saw some red flags. Then the final straw happened and I didn’t know what to do and  so at the beginning of this year I asked him to stop talking to her. Fast forward, (he’s also in the military) he left for two months for training and when he came back he was acting kinda off. And I told myself I was being paranoid, I was thinking he was still talking to this girl but I told myself to give him the benefit of the doubt. He’s been getting angry at me for small things and stuff so I couldn’t shake it off something was wrong. And he’s been really possessive of his phone which is kinda unusual for him. 

So he went to work to today and I logged into Facebook on my computer and he’s logged in there and behold the girl I asked him not to talk to is in his messenger. I know this is bad and toxic, but he always says that I can look at his stuff whenever I want and I try not to because I know it’s bad. Her and him were talking about the date she went on and how she has a huge crush on this dude she’s dating. And he told her how she’s being really cute crushing over this dude. 

What do I do. Please help me. I want to confront him when he comes home. I’m not the confrontational person so idk how to handle this.   I don’t what to do. I’m freaking out, I love him but I don’t want to end things. I had a bad feeling and it was true. I don’t want to cry while I’m confronting him.

""Sure"" I replied, so I started to build a spawn and some other stuff that took me 3 hours. So then I left the server to go on a walk or something.

The next day *ping* at 6am in the morning Bob ask if I could ""build him a house and could you make it like super cool with redstone ok thx"".

Second of all, I want your honest advice/opinion, so please don't censor yourself and comment whatever you think. Last but not least, if you need more information, don't be afraid to ask. Thanks a lot!

Like 7 years ago I went to school with the most beautiful girl I know. We got very close within a short time and when she was in my proximity I didn't think about what happend to me in the past or how the hell I should survive something called ""life"". Anyway, after some time she started to hold my hand in the breaks. As more time passed, she waited for me right before school and kinda refused to go to our classmates, wasted her time so she could send me poems or creative stuff she made only for me, dragged me into the bus so we could have a couple more minutes together and she even bit me but in a playful way. One day she asked me what i would do if she was gay and instead of telling her how i actually feel, I told her ""What should I do? Nothing"" only because I wanted to protect myself. And since I have Asperger (Autism) I can't ""read"" people's face as easy as you would. At that point I couldn't tell if she was sad, angry or even happy. Now I think she was disappointed because she looked away and we didn't talk for like a minute. Around that time we slowly but surely lost touch. Today she's in a relationship with a guy I can't stand and even if it still hurts since I got those news, I wish her nothing but the best.

So after ages of not being in touch, we hung out in April this year. Everytime we talked about our time in the past, it got sentimental but none of us ever spoke a word about how we felt at that moment. When I brought her home she asked me if we would see us again and I told her that I'd be pleased. I texted her 4 months later after the last time we met and got no reply. 2 months later she texted me back and apologized that she didn't reply because she has a lot of things going on currently and what day I was thinking of to hang out. I can related to that so I was like ""all good, I think it's easier if you pick a day which fits you the most“ and now 2 weeks later she still hasn't answered. 

The reason why I want to see her again is because I'm finally brave enough to tell her that I had/still have feelings for her since the day we first met. I came out as trans last month and I'm going to transition in the next few months and I want to tell her as the person she got to know, so it doesn't feel foreign if that makes sense.

My question now is what should I do next? Should I wait? Should I send her another message? Should I show up at her house? Or should i text her on her birthday which is in a few weeks and just wish her happy birthday?

I'm so sorry for this long post but I don't have anyone to talk about that. Thanks again.

TL;DR: I had/have feelings for the most beautiful girl I know. After a very long time, we hung out together and were looking forward to meet again. 4 months later I asked her out and got no reply. 2 month after i texted her she answered with an apology and asked which day we should go out. Told her it's all good and she should pick a day since she has a lot going on currently. Now 2 weeks later she still hasn't answered and I really want to see her again because I want to tell her what i feel for her. What should I do next? Wait?

512,"I’ll keep this short. We’re both in 11th grade and in the same APUSH class. We’ve been friends since 9th grade and in most of the same classes so we’ve occasionally let each other copy the other’s work (although it’s usually me who’s letting her copy). Last week we spent 3 full days learning how to do a DBQ (short essay on the AP exam) with the teacher presenting notes we were supposed to copy. The notes were in columns and there really weren’t too many of them so it was really more boring than hard. On Monday when the notes were due, my friend tells me she was confused about what we were supposed to do so she ended up playing Minecraft for the whole 3 days. She asked me if she could copy my notes and even though I really didn’t want to I gave them anyway cause she’s my friend. Today we had to watch 2 crash course videos and take notes on them which she’s now also asking me for. I really don’t want to because 1. She should’ve done the work and 2. I’m worried the teacher will realize she copied and we’ll both get in trouble

515,"I broke up with my ex last year and I still feel horrible about the situation. Some days I feel justified, some days I question myself, but most days I still miss the relationship dearly.

When we first started dating she was still in contact with her ex unknown to me, they had been FWB for a while and I don't know if this was still ongoing while we were still unofficial. I just know that at minimum they were still texting and he was trying to win her back as either a FWB or girlfriend, it looked like she was keeping him around as plan B. This stopped around the time I asked her out officially.

Their texting resumed about a year into our relationship, which she kept secret from me for about a month. The guy was being shady, asking if i was staying over while her parents were away, inviting her over to see his new house, texting often and having alot of banter/light flirting to clearly try and win her back. I found out about this by snooping because she had been distant lately and I now knew why, this is also how I found out about their prior texting.

I was upset for a few days but tried to put it behind us as she promised to stop talking to him and she blocked him on FB/deleted his number at my request. About a month later while searching up a page on her facebook his name popped up in her search bar, turns out she unblocked him and was looking through photos of an old date they went on to a zoo that he still had on his page.

I tried to approach things calmly this time but she got defensive, she said that he was only being friendly and that she thinks she should be able to talk to him, but wouldn't only because it made me upset. She really didn't show any remorse about talking to the guy in secret and wouldn't believe me that he was up to no good, so I ended it a couple days later. I was just constantly paranoid now about her true feelings for me and the possibility of her running back to him if we ever hit a rough patch.

It didn't help that she was unaffectionate, she wouldn't ever initiate kissing/cuddling/sex which meant I had to initiate every time, making me feel like she didn't even want me. Which confused me because she would sometimes talk about how I was above her league, and how she  feels like she wasn't good enough for me looks wise. So I tried my best to tell her she was beautiful often and didn't mind initiating most of the time, I just wanted her to do it some of the times but it literally never happened unless I initiated.

I'm not experienced with relationships so I need help understanding if I was justified, I feel like that's the main thing preventing me moving on. I never wanted to breakup with her, but how she acted was really hurtful but she didn't seem interested in how it made me feel. Part of me wishes she'd contact me and ask for another chance, but I know that kind of thinking is just holding me back.",21Oct2020,1

520,"  Context: I'm a 19M that has moved out to my dad's house last January because of lots of issues with my birth mom. Never drank, never smoked, had pretty good grades throughout school, did what I was told, never had any legal issues except a speeding ticket that was swiftly dealt with. Also had visitation between my birth mom and dad (saw dad every other weekend) 

  My birth mom doesn't seem like she will ever change, especially being 41 years old now. As long as I can remember, she's tried to turn me against my dad and reject him by telling me nasty things about him that I've come to find out aren't entirely true or are complete lies. She has said nasty things about other family members, i.e. my cousin was responsible for my uncle's suicide and she should've been there for him. I found out from her (cousin) that they had a very good relationship about a year and a half before he died. Anyway, I moved out because she would argue about things I thought were silly, or blow things badly out of proportion. Our last argument before I moved out was about a music video she wanted to watch with me (Headlights by Eminem for anyone wondering), but it was at 10:00 at night and I had to get up for work at 4:30 next morning. So I declined and said why, and went back to my room. A buddy at the time was staying over had asked for another pillow, so I had to go back out, then she argued and screamed at me for up until give or take 11-11:30. She said things like if she were my gf, I wouldn't abandon her, and that I was sh*tting on her for not watching the video, etc. She also tried getting my buddy to side with her, and when he tried getting my side and I must've said something she didn't like cause she told me to shut the f*ck up. Half hour later, I finally got to bed. This is one of countless arguments/scoldings over the course of about 10 years, and she's even gone as far as threatening me with suicide and saying it would be my fault multiple times (first time was when I was about 10). She's also said things like I don't care about her side of the family (because I house sat for my dad) and that if I don't care about her side, I can take her dead brother off my neck (inherited a necklace from grandma that had my uncle's ashes in it). I feel like she's super manipulative and that she won't change, and I'm not even entirely sure I want her in my life. I've thought about things like ""if I had kids one day, what would she say to them or talk to them about?"", or if there's anything else I can do to as far as her changing her ways. I told her about how I used to feel in my last year and a half of school, and I was miserable. I felt like I had no real friends and that my family was dying off, and my birth mom was telling me all these nasty things and being extremely hurtful. Told her about an attempt at suicide, and she responded by praising me, but it felt like empty words, especially when she told me that she wasn't going to get much sleep that night after hearing that. I feel I'm at my wit's end with her, and don't know what I can do, or even if there's anything I can do. If she wasn't my birth mom, I would've cut her off a long time ago. She doesn't feel like my mom anymore, and hasn't for a long time. I wanted to ask other, more reasonable parents if this is normal and should I be understanding this (she said I was a spoiled brat acting out and that I'd understand all this when I have kids) when I become a parent?

527,"To explain, i'm a person that easily gets involved in debates i just sometimes can't help myself even if it's just a stranger on twitter if they're saying something that's just completely wrong or something i disagree with i tend to argue, i know myself this is stupid and it's just wasting time but sometimes i'm just diving in there without fully thinking. 

This is also something that it's trouble outside of strangers, i have a group of friends and one of them will always post comments because he knows it will wind me up and get a reaction out of me, sometimes i can just think to myself ok whatever ignore it and carry on, but then i find myself thinking about it like 30 minutes later etc and it annoys me that it's still taking up space in my thoughts. 

Weird one i know, but i just want to know if there is any advice someone could give me other than ""just try to forget about it"" because that seems to not be working.

529,"My family and I are completely divided over politics. I'm actually quite literally the only one in my immediate family voting for one particular candidate; the rest of them think that people like me are ""the problem"" with the U.S (direct quote) and are voting the other way.

It's become increasingly more difficult to discuss even the most bland of topics. I can barely talk about the weather, as we disagree vehemently on climate change and its legitimacy. It seems like no matter what we talk about, it gets drawn back to something political and a subsequent argument.

Even putting this massive problem aside, there were a handful of other events and problems over the last few years which have very much damaged my relationship with my family, and perhaps irreparably. I've arranged for a ""pre-thanksgiving"" dinner to be held next week, not only to accommodate a new job, but also to avoid fallout after the election, as I believe no matter who wins, I will be split from the rest of them. I am trying very hard (probably harder than I should) to keep the peace and demonstrate my love for them as people. I promise you, they are making it close to impossible. For now, I just have to get through the 3rd of November.

532,"So i follow this beautiful instagram art page and i ordered a piece of art for $45. I paid in an invoice sent to me and they told me it would be about 2 weeks. This was August 13th. 

So about three weeks after the original order (I know packages take longer than 2 weeks sometimes especially internationally so i gave her a grace period) I start asking her, I asked for the tracking info and such and was left on read. She tells me she'll send me the info (She was supposed to from the very beginning) and never does. She tells me she knows she shipped it. I finally lay it down and say ""listen, how do i get a refund? I never got what i paid for."" Immediately I get a response ""oh my gosh I'm sorry i thought I sent it, i'm a one woman company, etc"" 

At this point i'm like okay i'm not an unreasonable person. She told me she was sending it priority. (1-3 days usually) Now it's two weeks later and nothing, not even the tracking number.

I know other people have ordered here and received their product, i see the comments (I even combed through them to see if anyone else had my issue)

533,"A pitbull jumped its fence and started running toward my me and my dog. I panicked. I didn't run, but I was screaming. I screamed so hard I gave myself an asthma attack. Somebody got the pitbull right before it got to me. My dog had pulled himself out of his collar and ran off. I got the fuck out of there. I was able to find my dog. 

I'm trying to figure out if I should call animal control.

There are extenuating circumstances.

One is that I got attacked by a dog earlier this year. It took 14 stitches to patch me up. So when I saw that pitbull, I was terrified.

But now that I'm home, I can't really say that the pitbull was definitely going to attack me. Maybe it just wanted to meet my dog and I overreacted.

The other extenuating circumstance is that I live in a very nice apartment right on the edge of gentrification. The street behind me is knocking down low income houses to build apartments like mine.

I am very aware that I am part of the problem.

If I call Animal Control, then I'm going to be a white lady with money calling the police about my Black neighbors because I got scared.

On the other hand, it's a pitbull that jumped its fence and ran at me.

534,"For the past 7 months I've noticed that I have anxiety attacks at least once a day when I think about going to work. I thought the issue was all the chaos at my old restaurant so I left that one and got hired at a more upscale one.

But now I can't even think about going to work without having an anxiety attack. The stress of the shift and all the usual chaos let alone the actual mistakes that happen is terrifying me.

535,"Okay, so this is going to likely be a very long post, so feel free to jump out now. Burner account obviously.

I'm 21M and live in the south of England. I've reached a point where I'm terrified I'm throwing away the best years of my life, and may have already done so.

Throughout my school life I was always relatively okay, primary school I felt like I was friends with everyone, Secondary school was still good. I had a good close nit group of mates, and wasn't ever bullied. Then College (High School) hit and before I knew it, I started falling into the social abyss. I've always been quite an anxious person, and always have really judged myself at the bottom of the pile looks wise. Girls, I never had the courage to speak too, because ""why would the want to speak to me"" and I've never had sensed anything from them to say otherwise. Anytime things like who would you rather go out with etc as jokes or anything, I'd always be the ""eww not \*\*\*\*"" guy, and although that doesn't sound much, it does slowly but surely wear down your self worth lol. I've never had a GF etc, and to be honest the thought of ever putting my self on the line to ask someone out, or heck even talk to them, makes my stomach literally screw into a ball of fear and anxiety. I always felt like girls saw through me, and as I was too shy or confident enough to ever to try get them to notice me, due to not wanting the rejection, nothing ever did happen. Self fulfilling prophecy hey?

I literally hate my self at this point, any photo situation I avoid like the plague, and If I ever get forced into one, I spend the day stressing about it. Profile Pictures on social media are an absolute nope. The fear of throwing one up and getting any rejection, I just can't deal with. To be honest I avoid anything like Facebook, Instagram &amp; Snapchat and just stick to sites like Twitter and Reddit.

I think this is really was my Achilles heel, and it really showed in college. All my mates starting going to the gym etc and for some reason or another I felt like I got sidelined. Then in the College cafeteria's they'd of course be meeting new groups of people etc like they should, and I felt completely out in the cold like no one wanted to know who I was, I was just that weird kid lingering about. Instead of fighting this and getting stuck in with them, I just took the easy option of spending free periods walking through the local village alone, and then when I had nothing in for the rest of the day, I'd get an earlier bus home to avoid having to feel alone on the campus. As soon as I could drive, I would turn up for lessons, when I actually bothered, and came straight home.

Then the second year of college comes, everyone is turning 18 going out to the pubs etc and again I run from this as the thought putting myself in that situation feels like a knife through my stomach. I eventually first went out with my mates roughly 8 months after turning 18, and even then with them constantly getting on my back to come out, I still felt like I didn't belong. They were all jacked up from the gym, girls all over them, and I just felt like that insignificant person no one apart from my close mates knows what i'm doing there. Know one really want's to know me, and I feel like I almost get backed out of the conversations. So that put an end to that. A year of being 18 years old. 1 night out in a local shoddy pub. I try it again about 6 months later for Christmas and the same feeling prevails. 2 nights out, at 21 years old. Yikes. Let's not forget through out all this, my mates constantly message me to come out, but this does get less and less frequent, the more I ignore them / make excuses. I literally feel so little and small when I go out, and I just have decided to run from it. I'm not physically big or small, just an average 6ft, but I don't really don't have any muscle, and I know this is mostly all in my head, but I just feel like when it comes to girls and even other guys to talk too, they see through me because of this.

There was a girl in my economics class during college, and I was infatuated with her. But she hung around with guys, who I felt could kick my ass and where better looking at me, so what's even the point off trying? I didn't even want to look her in the eye. One day, there's like 5 of us in class waiting for it to start, and she deadass decides to sit down next to me. Right next to me on a table of two, and I could tell she was looking at me to start a conversation. What do I do? S\*\*t my pants. My stomach turns, palms sweat and I don't look this poor girl in the eye for 60 minutes, maybe muttering a few words back to questions, but head down waiting for this to be over.The next lesson she does the exact same, actually tries holding a conversation with me, and I abruptly send that back to no-ville. Why? god knows why, I hated myself for doing it. Don't get me wrong I know this didn't mean she was even interested me, but I'm trying to show you an example of how I just nope out of any situations where I feel like I may be shut down. 

Of course I didn't even bother with Uni, which I massively regret, and just basically run to this easy option of a little local office job, which is basically just a bunch of 40 year old men. I get on with them okay, but literally go to work, and get home.

Now I'm 21, and quite frankly sh\*\*\*\*\*g myself. My home life is surprisingly good. Good relationship with my family, so when It comes to that, I feel pretty secure and to be honest as much as I miss my mates, and wish I had a relationship, I wouldn't even say I was that lonely. Guess I've perfected enjoying my own company. The reason I feel f\*\*\*\*\*g terrified is because I'm now 21 nearly 22 and I've barely ever held a conversation with a girl, let alone have any form of relationship, I never go out to clubbing or pubs because quite frankly I don't enjoy how it makes me feel, and I'm slowly but surely cutting off my closest mates by avoiding them. I feel like anxiety and complete lack of confidence is stealing away the best years of my life, and before I know it I'm going to be 30 in a dead end job, no relationship skills or friends and just be isolated. 

To be completely honest, I'm posting this now as yesterday I had a crushing realisation of how far I'd fallen. My Dad asked my to go pick up some fast food, and the thought of going into that place to pick it up put the fear of good through me. I don't know why I'm even posting this here. I just needed to get it out in words, and sent it off to a corner of the internet. For anyone that managed to read through this entry of self pity, congratulations, I hope you don't feel too depressed!",21Oct2020,1
536,"Long story short, I was best friends with my ex for about 6 months before we officially started dating. Two months after we got in a relationship we moved in together (only because we already had plans to move in together with another friend and we had no idea at the time either of us liked each other). We ended up being in a relationship for 11 months. To this day, it has been so far the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. But he broke up with me last September out of no where. Said he wasn’t sure why he felt off about our relationship and just wanted to go back to being best friends for the moment. Which I tried doing, but it was too painful so I cut contact. I was heartbroken and it took a long time for me to heal. The break up wasn’t messy. It was just hard considering I lived in our apartment for a few months alone until the lease was up and was hopeful we’d get back together. He ended up talking to other people a month after he left me. I stayed single for about 6 months to get myself together, doing therapy, focusing on work, realizing my worth, etc. I haven’t seen him physically since December and he randomly messaged me last week after 8 months of no contact (it wasn’t as pleasant of a conversation I thought it’d be). I know he’s going through a rough time right now (but I don’t have specifics) and I’m battling to reach out as a friend to him. I’m over us not being together but I do miss having him in my life and being my best friend. Should I try reaching out to him? 

TL;DR I’m battling whether or not to reach out to my ex",21Oct2020,1
537,"The title pretty much speaks for itself as a ""too long didn't read.""
On Thursday I found out that my dog had terminal carcinoma and by Friday night we had to rush her to an emergency that because she was in too much pain to go on. It was the most heartbreaking and difficult thing I've ever done in my life. Needless to say I'm completely destroyed and it's been hard to do anything outside of the very basics of my job and feed myself. I work from home all day and seeing how empty the house is now has been agonizing. 
My boss has been incredibly supportive during this whole thing. We're pretty tight and he's called to check on me and give his condolences. He also covered my ass when I left abruptly to be with her for her last few days. Aside from that we've become pretty good friends.

Here's where the dilemma comes in. 
I'm feeling a lot of guilt right now. Before her diagnosis I had several phone interviews and just received an offer for a new position at a company that's closer to my house. They're offering more money and better benefits, which at the moment after being completely drained by vet bills is very tempting. It's also tempting to take this job surely for the opportunity to get myself out of this house and distract myself from this crippling grief I feel.
However I feel so guilty at the idea of leaving and having to tell my boss that I have a better offer. I think I made the mistake of becoming good friends with him and I've let that get in the way. 

How do I set that aside to do this? Should I try to use this offer to get more money at my current job to stay? I'm really conflicted and I feel like I'm not in the right state of mind to think this through in a way that benefits me. I'm open to any suggestions.",21Oct2020,1

544,"I have this problem of not keeping things simple enough. If I had just one idea of what to do, I would do it simply, swiftly, and enjoy the rest of my time on this earth.

But my problem is, I see hundreds of possibilities. I could be a great big banker. I could be a detective. I could be a comedian. I could be a famous actor. I could be a music producer. I could be a copywriter. I could be a construction worker. 

I am a jack of all trades and a master of none. That is my strength and it is my greatest weakness. I start a million paths and finish none. I don't become skilled enough in any path because I lose faith in myself.

I hate my job, it's just boring to me. I've been making music since I was 12. I gave up music because I have no time for it. I have no time because I have work and school. Why am I even in school? For finance. I hate finance. But finance can get me a better corporate job. Do I even like anything about finance? No. I want to be an actor or a musician or a comedian. But I need to pay my bills. So I need a good job. I could be a starving artist. But that sucks.

So I went to school so I can get a better day job. But school is really hard, especially when learning about topics I am not interested in or even good at. But I have to get a ""good"" degree otherwise the degree is pointless right? I can't major in mongolian dance theory. 

I have to pay for my apartment and all that, so I need a job right? How do actors or comedians even pay for rent?

Not to mention I figured it's better to live with a girlfriend than a random roommate, so I moved in with a current girlfriend. That was almost 4 years ago. I'm not even sure I want to be in a  relationship right now anymore. Yet here we are with a big apartment, but no furniture because I can't save any money after rent. And now there are cats.

546,"So there’s this guy I really liked that I met at a party that hit me up last summer asking how I’d been etc and we talked a bit on and off (he would always reply quickly or at least within 1-2 hours) and this month he finally asked and planned to hangout last weekend (it was mostly him pushing for it). 

We had a lot of common interests to talk (sports, Tv shows, video games, music, partying), we opened up to eachother a lot and we hooked up for a bit. While I was definitely much less experienced, he understood I wasn’t ready to go all the way just yet and at the end he said it was great seeing me and that he’d text me later. 

Me being anxious to know how he felt I texted him later that night first saying I was sorry for being a bit nervous but that I had a good time and I was hoping we could hang again soon. He replied the next morning saying sure he’d be down. 

Then yesterday morning I asked if he wanted to hangout next weekend and he replied back almost instantly saying he’d find out if he’s free. I responded back giving him a time but now it’s been over a day and he didn’t even open it (on snap). While I know it seems stalkerish I saw him post on Instagram and that he was active on snap, so I know he’s had access to his phone. Pain. 

But who knows, maybe he got busy (it is his first year in college afterall) maybe he just forgot to reply, maybe my text got buried in other messages (he is a popular guy), or maybe I’m just making bs excuses since I can’t handle the fact that he’s not interested because at the end of the day if he was he wouldn’t have just forgotten to reply just like that. 

This is especially painful because after years of only being liked by guys I don’t want and always being rejected by the ones I actually do, I really thought I might finally catch a break and had a good thing going on here. But nooo for all I know I probably got ghosted because he’s too afraid to reject me and hurt my feelings because that’s just my horrible luck in dating. 

I have no idea what to do. Should I double text because of course there’s always that small chance he didn’t see it or got busy, though I don’t know what else to say without seeming like a desperate loser especially if it turns out he isn’t interested after-all. At this point I rather just have answers but it’s gonna be much more painful if I send a follow up and he ignores that one too. Or should I just wait it out and go about my life and see if he’ll eventually reply which he probably won’t if the message really did get lost in his inbox. Or maybe I really did get ghosted and he found someone better just like that, though if he really wasn’t interested why couldn’t he just tell me he didn’t want to see me again after the text I sent after the first date. 

I don’t know what the hell happened here or what to do. Even worse, what if he somehow sees this post and recognizes it because I really don’t like bothering the same friends for advice for things like this. Help",21Oct2020,1

549,"Firstly I'd like to say I think I'm writing this because I need to vent and I needed to get it off my chest otherwise it'll drive me crazy but I don't know, maybe the answer I seek will be here. I can only try.

In June time I  (25m) started talking to this girl (25f) from work (bad idea I know this, will never happen again) and at first it was friendly because she had a boyfriend (40m) who she had been with for nearly 2 years and although I started to like her I never acted on it because of that. Over time it became obvious that she liked me and I liked her back, over the next two weeks we got worse and worse, eventually were we kissed. This was the first red flag, I shouldn't have gone done it, that was definitely my mistake and I tried owning up to it by breaking it off because she had a boyfriend (he's abusive, so I tried justifying it in my head because of that which was wrong of me), but after a week of not talking she messaged me and we both admitted that we missed each other like crazy. 

At that point we started seeing each other in secret, I would always push for her to break up with him. The caviet of that is that they live in the same block of flats, he would've most likely killed her or at the very least beat the shit out of her (I have never met this man but I have heard him down the phone before and he's certainly not a gentleman). She made it difficult on herself by not moving out, she wanted bigger and better (which I don't fault but she can't support that as of yet) and I was encouraging her to find a place anywhere else if not for her child who is only 4 and doesn't need this shit in her life. 

Eventually she finally did it though not long after her child had given away the fact that we started seeing each other and he went absolutely ape shit. She moved out and moved in with her mum so that made it easier but unfortunately that's still in the same block of flats.

It all cooled down and we started actually being happy, we would do everything together. I'd take her on walks, we'd drive all over and I was doing my best to encourage her to go for the best life. She wanted to be a psychiatrist in a prison as it's close to home for her (well more her brother) and I was so supportive of this, I pushed to basically make the best of her life and her daughters life. She had come round and had a meal with my mum which is not something I've done before, there were so many funny moments and I loved the way she was.  We spoke for hours, in depth and I made it a point to be as trusting as possible because that's how things work out in the end. End of the day I did my best for her, I never got angry, I never was upset and I always put logic before emotions. 

She eventually told me she loved me and I said it back. She was the first person I'd fallen in love with.

**Everything** ***was*** **perfect.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Then one night she supposedly went over to her friends for a night of drinking, I was like sure have fun. The only problem was that something was off, she had acted funny with me all night and I barely spoke to her which is odd considering we were constantly talking. Anyway I wake up to find out that her ex was out on my street looking for me and the reason for this is because she spent time with him the night before (apparently with her friend too but I honestly don't know now) and he saw the messages that we had sent (fuck knows how at this point, she says he asked to look at the messages and she was okay with it?) and he saw the more than suggestive messages we had together. Anyway I called police because the fact that this man apparently tracked me down by my car (I know reckon she gave my address cause it's too weird).   


That entire day was a nightmare, I was worried of what he'd do to me, what he'd do to her, her child. 

Tensions were high, everyone was arguing but ultimately all I could do was sit on the sidelines and wait for news to see if everything was okay.   


The next day she ended things saying it wasn't fair on me which I had reminded her a million times that it's not her choice to make. After that point we stopped speaking and I didn't get full closure because I had tried contacting her after that because she had stopped talking to all her friends and two reached out to me out of worry (so me being me I assumed the worst and wanted to make sure she was alive). Her mum reassured me saying everything was okay, eventually I get a message saying she's removed herself off of social media and needed a break from it all and will message me when she's ready. 

  
Well 2 weeks later I see her online on work and realise she's not messaging me or anything so today I just decided fuck it if anything I want a video game back that I lent her (Assassin's Creed: Origins, I actually like that game and fuck spending another tenner or more for it) and that I felt she was avoiding me.  She said she hadn't been she just needed time but then I said to her I want closure at least as I'm losing sleep over it. 

  
Eventually I got this message and I will be typing it word for word so errors are intentional:  

*""look me and (ex's name) have decided to try again, he knows everything (my name) and i made a mistake by getting you involved it is my fault totally and the guilt is eating me up cos u didnt deserve it tbh. its not easy to let go of loving someone who you have loved continuously for years, he is a dick ye hes hurt me but yano what people can change and if im wrong then im wrong it on my head but the last few weeks with him have been so much better, imkeeping to myself cos my actions have consequences (something ive never thought about)im selfish and impulsive, my moods are getting worse and to very very honest with you knew i still loved him deep down and i couldnt drag u down any longer..*

So while we were talking and not dating my boyfriend went out on one date with this girl he knew a couple years ago and was used to be friends with. That doesn’t really bother me because i went on other dates too. But I found out that he hangs out with her still. There were other people there.

What makes this tricky is that we dated for almost a year and broke up for few months with no contact and then recently started dating/ moving really slow again. We broke up because I graduated and was going to move away for a job and he still had a year of school left. After that job fell through, I ended up getting a job here though so being permanently apart was no longer an issue. Overall I still feel really good about moving forward- which I why I don’t want this to be an issue for me.

I never felt jealousy in the relationship before so this is very new to me. I also want to say that I haven’t talked to him about hanging out with the girl at all yet and I only found out a couple days ago- he was the one to mention it to me.

The things that are keeping me awake at night though seem irrational but here they are: 
I felt real hurt and jealous when I found out. It definitely stung. Why would he be just friends with her now even though they haven’t hung out in years prior to this? Why would he have gone on a date if there was nothing there?

So what should I do!?",21Oct2020,1
553,"Hi I am 21 year old male soon to be 22 and I feel like last 1,5 year just passed by and what I mean by this is literally just passed. Nothing really happened during that time. I tried to try to start something again with my ex gf but thst Just turned into a disaster and completely messed me up.


I have always been decently social and had a lot of friends with so much fun to do especially in high school. You know things like Just dicking around or trying smth with girls from school etc. There was always something to do. Well after high school moved to a bigger city that is far away from my hometown. I am currently at Uni and because of covid nobody currently lives in this city. Like every student didnt even bother to rent anything because they dont have to but whats even worse is that nobody on that uni was really that social. We had classes from monday to wednesday and literally on wednesday 70% of people were Going back home. I was very surprised how little everyone tried to do anything (like if they Just didnt like me I would realise something is wrong with me but they dont like each other as well lmao). So now I Just sit there and see days pass by while nothing significant happens.


What the hell do I do? I dont really look for friends and i dont want to find new ones by forcing myself into some additional classes or whatever. I need a nice group of people thst i can hang out with and Just have some fun from time to time.",21Oct2020,1
554,"im 19. i have to move out of my parent's house in two days. not because my parents are forcing me. not because my parents arent kind and understanding. im moving out because im a horrible failure, and i cant do it anymore. i cant live here while being like this. i failed college, for the second time. for no good reason. money wasted. my dad is helping me pay what financial aid doesnt cover. he doesnt even have a job anymore, he should be keeping what little money he has left for his retirement. but he thought i would be studying hard for a better future.

as of right now my parents dont know that im failing again. i knew i wouldnt be able to pass since around the 10th of this month. so it's been a couple weeks, and in this time ive found an apartment, signed a lease, taken a loan on a car, and im going to move in on friday. i was going to leave a note explaining everything, saying im sorry, and that i hope they will forgive me one day and allow me to visit often. i want to continue my education, i dont want to keep working in fast food for the rest of my life, but i cant allow my dad to help me pay for it anymore, and i cant stay with my parents for the rest of the time that i try to complete college. im so ashamed. so i was going to leave in secret, but i cant anymore. a couple days ago after work i drove to boston, for no specific reason, i just wanted to see the harbor, and then i drove back home. my parents were worried because i usually come back around 3, and i was back at around 8. i dont have any friends or anything, so for me to come home late worried them. i also have told them in the past that i wanted to kill myself, which is why i said i failed and took a semester off college originally, but now ive done it a second time, so i dont know, maybe i just convinced myself i was suicidal because that would be a better alternative to facing the fact that im actually an inherently lazy selfish liar.

so they were concerned, and now theyre suspicious of me for staying at work later, or going anywhere at all. im moving in two days, and i still need to do some logistical things, like pick up my aparment keys, and register my car. so i lied to them. i said i had made a friend, and that was the reason i will be coming home late after work. no one in my family believed me, because i havent had any friends for about 7 years, but i looked her in the eyes and told her it was the truth. she asked me if i was alright, if im depressed again because ive been acting weird. she just said she's worried about me, just to tell her where i am if im home late and stuff. and i looked her in the eyes and i said okay, i will tell you, im not lying to you. i know this sounds ridiculous, but it means a lot to me. whenever she wants to make sure im telling the truth, she asks me to swear on my cat's life. ive never lied before on her life, but now i did. so im a real liar now. im going to break her trust. im going to be a real failure now.

i just want to leave on good terms with her, but i cant tell her before i register my new car, because she will hide the keys or something to the other one i share with my brother so that im unable to pick it up. what else can i do to apologize to my family, besides telling them im sorry and not letting them waste their money on me anymore?",21Oct2020,1

558,"So my family is facing one serious problem right now which is my aunt.  Meaning, she doesnt clean her house in the slightest, she is not appreciative of her family and her siblings (for example, my grandfather once woke up and saw my aunt choking him, if it wasnt for uncle who is also living with both of them my grandfather would have beaten my aunt) but above all else, it appears my aunt is having some sort of an illness and she does not want to visit a doctor. At this rate she is not going to survive this winter, especially with this epidemic thats going on.

Until now, my little brother also started doing something but the thing is my father also tried doing that same thing which is going to the authorities and on top of all that my little brother doesnt even try to listen to anyone just because he thinks he is right, so thats going to get him nowhere fast.

And i dont know if i can help in a way that wont make this entire situation worse.  The obvious way is for my grandfather to sign a paper or document which says 'The individual in question will be locked up for his/her own safety' or something very similar.  However, he listens to no one whatsoever.  My parents tried talking to both my aunt and grandfather but it was a complete waste of time as my grandfather listens to no one and my aunt's situation is worsening.  Basically i dont think anything i can do right now will make a difference because i assume my parents already tried everything.

Now there is some common ground regarding my mothers other siblings (my aunt is related on my mothers side) but as i've already seen, thats simply not enough.

560,"I am not religious, but my family is.
Recently my mom has been getting really involved with Christianity when I told her I wasn't religious.
I am no way a horrible person, I consider myself polite and try to refrain from judging people. I haven't done anything wrong or given into peer pressure. I surround myself with the kindest people I can find. But my mom thinks there is something wrong with me.
Recently I had come out as Nonbinary to her (which I think she completely forgot or ignored) but she continued to call me how she liked so I gave up. She keeps asking me if there is something wrong with me because I ""had a complete personality switch."" (I only wanted to cut my hair short as I wasn't allowed years prior, My mom refused to open her eyes to the fact I haven't been 'girly' in years.).  My sister, a personal suck up lap dog for my mom, has made sure she reports every small action I do with my dad to my mom. I got yelled at by my mom for holding my dad's hand after he bought me sweets, she tried to guilt trip me into thinking I love my dad more than her (On the contrary, I don't, my dad is just family to me, and over the years I learn family means a little bit of nothing.). I hate being touched by people unless I initiate the action first (pretty common but my mom thinks i'm loony.), and she has been putting her hands on me during prayer, I don't like it, I always move away from her hand or brush it off, she knows I don't like it but will still scream at me for being disrespectful, to which I would respond that you don't need to touch someone to pray. But last night she took it too far, she had a metal cross and put it to my forehead to pray, I hated it (She even asked me if it burned?). I wish I could say that was the beginning of it, but it isn't. Whenever she finds a cross or bible card she puts it in my room. 
She doesn't trust me either, she always checks my phone more than my sisters and always thinks i'm doing something bad (I once got yelled at for reading a post by someone with 'Lesbian' in their user name. She used that as ammunition for months after.).
It's not a lot to go on, but I do feel as if she sees me as a possessed devil child.",21Oct2020,1

562," 

Hey guys,

First time posting/lurking on this sub Reddit. I am usually not too indecisive when it comes to decision making but I thought by writing out a post it could help point me in the right direction. I am based in Ireland and the winter is soon approaching.

So I have three options here that I may have a choice from over the next two weeks.

**Option 1:** Pretty basic option. Its technical support at this small company that has just been acquired by a big eCommerce company. Room for growth. Starting Salary of €28000, usual cooperate perks. New laptop, pension contribution, gym membership etc. Pretty secure for this current global climate as it is a work from home position. Standard 8am-5pm role. Two days off per week.

**Option 2:** Move to France to work at a ski resort. Work as a Chalet Host, normal hours are from 7:30am -11am then off to ski until 5pm and finished at 9pm. Job would include preparing meals for guests and keeping the place clean and tidy. 2 days off per week, ski pass/rental and accommodation included with meals. Low weekly salary, probably €150/ week. Good opportunity to improve my French ( girlfriend is from the region). 5 month contract

**Option 3:** Begin a surf instructors/ beach lifeguard course. Course is 6 months long, students are paid €270 per week for attending. In a beautiful part of Ireland, however it is also the grimiest part of the year. (November-May). Qualified instructor by the end of it with a job that would role into summer.

I guess some background information could be helpful. I just completed an Outdoor education course, quite broke at the moment which would have drawn me more to the technical support role( I have worked in a similar position previously). I do love being outdoors but most of my favorite sports have a costly equipment barrier.

The surf course would be cool and it would be pretty chill but I could easily just pay for a week long surf instructors course in the future.

The job in France would be amazing but I would definitely continue being broke, also unsure with the current pandemic situation how stable this would be/ how much new rules and regulations at the slopes.

Also it would mean I could not surf/windsurf for 6 months but would vastly improve my skiing which I love. My French would improve greatly too and I would meet a lot of new people.

The remote working job would allow me to move anywhere I wanted in Ireland and I could easily live beside a surf beach while earning a decent wage for the area. Would also allow me to visit France for a few weeks and continue to work/ ski on the weekends.

Tough choice but I would appreciate any advice. My initial thoughts were to take the technical support job, move somewhere cool in Ireland to surf and save up a shit load of cash. Then go for the ski season next year once my bank account was a little healthier. I could continue to surf/windsurf for the winter and could finish a surf instructors course by myself in a week. Then I would continue on a sun/snow season rotation for a few years.

Great to have options but let me know what you think!

Much appreciated X",21Oct2020,1

im sorry its a long story, all of this involves 5 people, me(20F), swati(19F), mahesh(19M), banda(19F), and sam(19F). sam and banda go to the same college(women's college), rest of us go to different colleges, we girls were in the same school together. so, sam was in a relationship with mahesh last year, and she got into a lot of trouble because of that.( we are not allowed to date, so if parents or teachers find out, it will have bad consequences). her college had a ""no going out policy"" but she went out with him, and her parents found out, they both asked me to help them by telling their mum that she was with my, but it didn't work out, so she's not allowed to go to college anymore. this, guy mahesh, as banda heard, has dated many girls before lying to everyone of them that he hasn't dated anyone, and that he truly loves her. immediately after sam, he started dating swati, who of course he lied to that sam and he are cousins and that sam was after him since childhood, and swati believed him thinking this is true love. later she realised that he was an asshole and was ready to dump him, but then he started threatening her, that he will tell her parents about her previous boyfriend ( this can have very serious consequences in some households, like marrying them off to someone else, not sending to college anymore, hitting the person etc.,) , so she does everything he asks. one day, she put his picture as her instagram story, and i happen to see it, immediately texted asked her asking her to be careful, because sam got into lot of trouble, but what i didn't know was he handles all of her social media accounts, he immediately called me, and of course he was swearing. swati didn't see any of my texts because he deleted them, and blocked me in all of her social media. she called me when he told her not to text me anymore, i told her everything about sam, to which she was shocked and told me he makes her do many things she doesn't want to by threatening her. i have been in a call with them, he verbally abuses her everytime she doesn't want to do what he asks. and i want to help her. 

so how can she get rid of him, without her parents knowing all of this?

I’m not ready to ride again, but my parents are forcing me to go tomorrow.

567,"A little bit of context: I’m (17F) at a sports camp and they put people in based on age and skill level. I’m kind of perpetually behind the people my age because I started late skill-wise

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, grouping has remained a little weird since there’s less people. For the first two days I was put in with a group of 14-15 year olds and even though I was a bit older I didn’t mind too much because I was still able to talk them all to at least some level, about the sport or about Among Us or about *whatever*

Today, however, a new coach came in and so the camp reorganized some groups, mainly mine. The rest of the group went with the new coach but I was put with a group of adults (all men, I’m the only girl if that matters). I mean, I’m two months away from turning 18 but now I’m in a group where I’m pretty sure the youngest person is 24-25, and everyone else looks older. 

At first I was fine because everyone wears a lot of gear and I already knew the 24-25 year old a bit so we chatted a lot and I was able to talk with one other person. I’m not a fan of the signature gossipy-stuff either so it was nice to get a break from that. I improved (hopefully) today and I do like my coach. What really hit me was when I saw someone other than the 24-25 year old without their gear. After that, I started to wonder if I am really out of place.

A bit more context: Yesterday someone in my “original” group was moved in to a group with more people MY age (15-16M, moved with more girls 16-17F). He’s good at the sport (developmentally better than me), and I have a feeling that those girls in the group are likely better than me (I know one of the girls in that group from a previous camp, she’s super good at the sport).

We’ve been talking a lot so I know he (the 15-16M) likes his new group, but part of me wishes that he could have stayed with our original group (we were in the same group on the first day) and I was put in with the 16-17F girls. I feel a little socially isolated and I feel like if the 24-25M person wasn’t there I would have already said something to my Dad about the new group arrangement 

I’m honestly not sure what to do. My gut feeling is that somethings gotta changed but before all this hit me I already declared to my Dad that “I’m fine with the group, the lack of gossipy-stuff was refreshing”.

One more thing to add— due to the COVID-19 there really aren’t any chances for people outside their groups to interact with one another.

Is this something I should worry about? Should I focus more on my own improvement or try to see if I can make a switch? If so, how should I do that— we’re more than halfway done this week

Also— sorry if I sound mean or offensive or anything like that. I just was really hoping maybe I could talk to people more my age I guess and maybe I’m just surprised it’s not quite like that so far. I heard the groups are going to change next week anyway",21Oct2020,1

570,"Hi. My(18) mom (53) is having some drinking issues. This is going to be long so bear with me. 
My father died of cancer ten years ago and since then, my mom started smoking, which I completely understand. I can't judge how she chose to cope with having to raise three kids on her own. We have lots of grapes and stuff and we usually make wine this time of the year, usually in September. The wine isn't even done yet since it needs a period of time for fermentation, but my mom is drinking it. And she has done this last year too and we had a very big fight where I told her that she's drunk and that she should face that. It didn't work, as expected. It just made matters worse and she became more passive agressive about things. I also hurt her feelings. 

This week, whenever I'd come home from school, she would be a bit drunk. When she is, she has these stages. She can get mad really easily or be very mellow, in a way. It is a problem. For her health and for our relationship. My elder brothers are not home right now, they're both at universities. And they weren't here last year either. So they're telling me to talk to her and try not to get in fights with her and it's making me frustrated because they're not here and they have no idea how it is to go through one of mom's drinking crises alone. I'm also actually very calm and have worked on my anger issues during the summer so I don't raise my voice when she does and if she tries to get me to argue with her. 
I haven't talked to her about it at all when she was sober. Because other than this period, she usually doesn't drink, except if we already have alcohol in our house. I know that this time is harder for her because my dad died at the end of November and she's probably relieving everything and this might help somehow. But this is also ruining her health. 

And she's so chaotic when she's like this. She leaves things unattended, trips over stuff, last year she fell of a ladder and I wasn't even home. I love her and I don't know how to make it better. No one except for my brothers knows about this situation. She never went to therapy or anything and she would definitely push that option down. I do think that she has mental issues that she doesn't want to go through, which is making it all worse. Especially with the current situation. From what I've noticed, she also feels lonely a lot, but I don't know how I could help with that. I'm at school six hours a day, and I get home around 3 pm, then I have lessons to do and learn. I spend an hour or so with her watching documentaries in the evening, but that's about the longest period of time. I just want her to be okay. And healthy, mentally and physically. I've already lost a parent. I don't want to lose her too.

I have a lot of trauma that I went through when I was younger that I won’t get into but I acquired very bad coping mechanisms that have come back to bite me. So now, I’m not in the best spot mentally. For the past months, I have been hallucinating weird things, at one point my cousin told me that I told him that I was convinced I was some sort of immortal being (I have no recollection), and I also don’t feel like living anymore. The last time I went to my nana to confide to her I was about nine and I told her I was depressed which she then told me, “what about me, huh? I’m depressed too, what about me?” So, all I took from that was to never tell her my feelings and try to be strong for her and now years later I don’t think I can do it. I confined to her once more that I don’t feel safe and that my body feels like it’s on fire and I’m seeing and hearing things that aren’t there. Before I could even get it all out she tells me she also hears things that aren’t there that it is normal. She told me when she lays in bed at night she hears voices that tell her to kill herself. I tried to tell her that yeah, the voices tell me to off myself too but sometimes I will have full conversations with them before I realize they aren’t real (usually from the help of my cousin(15)).

She told me that she is afraid to take me to the doctor and I jokingly said that she was right, my insurance probably wouldn’t cover it but then she looked me in the eye and said, “no, I don’t want them to take you away from me.” I am unsure how to process that. I thought about reaching out to my school counselor but what if my nana is right and they do take me away from her. It isn’t a healthy household at all and I would love to get away but I don’t want my nana to be upset. My nana also said what I was going through was hormonal and it will sort itself out on its own.

581,"Was talking to a a distant family member a few days ago. I expressed to him that one of my friends deals with a borderline abusive parent (who hit her with a belt for hanging out with someone he didn’t like) and I considered that abuse. They also told me about how the parent emotionally abusive. 

Well I expressed this to the distant family member. He responded with “I got beaten for way worse than that.” I was like okay, yes... but it was sad to me that this was like a competition to him. He kept trying to prove to me that my friend’s situation was better off than his because he got abused for way worse. It made me kind of mad that he was invalidating others. I understand that he may of gotten abused for smaller things but that doesn’t mean by friend isn’t getting abused. It doesn’t mean her experiences are better. 

He’s done this multiple times where he has to compete to “have it worse” than anyone else... he claims he has multiple mental illnesses and even autism. He doesn’t have a formal diagnosis, just says he has it. I know he struggles with mental illness. I’m not invalidating that’s.

""My partner (21f) and I (22m) were having sex yesterday and she seemed to having a good time., but as I was close to finishing she told me to stop and I did stop moving for a moment and just said that I was really close and asked if it was ok to finish. She started like squirming so I took that as a go ahead. After she told me to stop, it took me about 3 mins to finish just because her telling me to stop took me out of the mood. She was squirming and kept cringing, but didn't say anything so I figured she was ok. After I finished, I noticed she was bleeding a lot, but I don't really know what was wrong because she just got her period last week. She was upset afterwards. She wasn'ttalking and seemed little out of it. I got mad with her because she didn't tell me I was hurting her and just let me do it so I told her that she needs to tell me if I'm hurting her. It got pretty heated and she wasn't talking to me (very mature) and eventually she shut down and slept on the couch.""

Looking back, I have come to realize my mistakes and I feel awful for it. I know I didn't rape her and that it was just a misunderstanding, but I don't know if she realizes that too. Now I don't know how to make it better. I have apologized so many times. She promised not to tell anyone. She still seems not all there, she won't sleep in our bed, and she barely talks to me. I initiated last night and she didn't really seem into it so I stopped and asked if she was ok. She said yes, but I stopped because it was clear she didn't want it. I then asked her bluntly what I could do to make this better and she said she didn't know. Well, I don't know either!!

602,"I finally got around to cleaning my garden but started finding severed kittens heads.

Turned out that in the bushes were some cats which I wasn't initially a fan of but I got them neutered and kept on cleaning. 

The cats are great fun and hunt mice and rats like crazy so they were a great addition and most of my other neighbors like them also.

Over time they became a part of the family with my two dogs.

The reason I have been cleaning my garden for years is because I live next to Irish settled traveller who are truly terrible people.

When the grass grew high in my garden for a few years they literally turned it into a dump site with everything being thrown in from used nappies, random junk, broken kids toys, broken bottles to stolen safes.

Yes they steal. A lot.

Their mess has taken me years to clean and my dog even tore her foot on a broken bottle one time which cost a lot of money and stress.

I have been politely arguing my case with them for years and have even been threatened but I don't scare easily.

Also, on occasion they take in stray animals who either end up dead from running out on to our main road or I take them and rehome them before it happens again.

When I call in to ask if I could rehome them they always just say 'yeah sure' and are always stupid drunk.

So Ignore and avoid them whenever possible, but recently they sent one of their kids in to ask if I can stop the cats from shitting in their garden.

Not good.

I went in to their garden and there was two cats shits in their garden.

I apologised and asked if putting some repellant on the walls would help or if there was anything I could do to help to stop in happening in future and all I got was pure attitude.

The mother said the I should keep them in doors but I explained that they were strays I saved and I'm not doing it intentionally.

They weren't accepting anything I offered and said if they catch them they will move them on. But I just think they will poison them.

These are people who I could have reported to the police multiple over some of the shit that has arrived in my garden, and also the risk of their broken bottles and used nappies to my family was completely disregarded.

614,"Long post, please bear with me as there’s a lot going on here. 

I have a severe phobia of insects and started seeing fleas a few weeks ago. I tried to tell my family but no one believed me until I showed them the bites on my arms and legs. 
They very begrudgingly washed the fabrics in the house (or told me they did), used a salt/baking soda combo and vacuuming, and put our dog on Advantage and our cats on another topical medication (the dog is the only one we’ve seen itching and the only one I’ve seen fleas on). I have drowned my room in flea spray. They’re still here. 

I go to a friend’s house for a few hours every weekend for DnD night, and they have two cats. My mother claims that I must have brought the fleas back from them and only have them in my room, because she hasn’t seen anything or been bitten (despite the fact that I have seen them downstairs). My friends have checked both their cats and have seen nothing, and say they haven’t had any problem with fleas. I suspect my very judgemental mom just wants to blame the long-haired retail worker, but whatever. 

I get maybe four hours sleep every night because I’m up most of the night jumping at every single thing that touches me. I spend most of the day hiding in the bathroom where there’s no carpeting and fighting the urge to cut my hair off. I am terrified to go near any of our animals. Right now I’m just sitting here in the bath crying. Absolutely zero sympathy from my mother. 

My mother will not help me because she either doesn’t believe the fleas are still real, or she simply doesn’t care as long as it doesn’t effect her, so I’m fighting a war in a two-story house with three pets on my own, with a limited budget. 
I am starting to have severe mental health issues from the infestation and lack of sleep; I constantly second-guess myself over whether I may be hallucinating and I feel like this neverending nightmare is now my life. 

Can anyone recommend any foolproof flea treatments? We have tried spray, baking soda/salt, vacuuming, and washing fabrics. Animals have been (very expensively, on my dime) treated, but I’m too frightened of going near my dog to check him for fleas to see if it’s worked. 
It may be worth noting that the dog cannot leave the house, he is a very traumatised and aggressive rescue, so taking him to the vet or fogging the house and evacuating isn’t really an option. 
I could also really use some advice on how to manage my mental health through all this. I’m disabled and can’t drive so I can’t leave the house, I’m just stuck here being eaten alive while my mom tells me it’s my friends’ fault.",21Oct2020,1

My friend knows that I was secretly living with my bf because my parents are very strict and they would not allow me due to being Asian and the culture. By this time my friend has met my bf multiple times and she has been to my place a few times as well. 3 months after dating the guy, my friend decided to live him and they did (they broke up shortly after a year dating due to the guy being a POS). Throughout the year of the program I have noticed that my friend has been copping the things I said I want to do/buy. I told her and my other friend that I wanted to color my hair balayage but I have saved up for it as I have other important bills. A few days after I said it, my friend came to class with one. I have also said that I wanted to buy a teddy bear jacket but I have to save for it because the one I wanted was from this expensive brand. After a few days, she came in to class wearing a teddy jacket not the one from the store I wanted cause it is very expensive but still. I have graduated from the diploma and I am currently in a diploma for a very specific degree that I have always dreamt of doing. She keeps asking me about it, and I don't want to be rude or mean so I answer her questions after all anyone can do it the only problem is if they can get in and it is a very stressful field. After asking me questions about it she is now wanting to apply for the program. I have given her other options similar to my program but less stressful and in line with what she wants to do more than what I am in now. I thought she has decided to do the program that I suggested but no, she is back to asking me questions again about my degree. I feel so frustrated and I try my best to be a friend for her and go above and beyond for her, but I feel like what she is doing robbing me off myself and my identity. Am I just overreacting and over thinking or is there something  wrong with it?",21Oct2020,1

618,"   I just got into 9th grade (which is considered the start of high school in my country) and I'm almost two months in.

    I cannot understand math anymore...at all. I used to love math before. I even got a 10 (out of 10) grade at the math exam, but now I just... I'm completely lost. The teacher we have doesn't explain things well but I got assured that by the end of 9th grade I'll be able to understand. Frankly, I don't believe it. Before I could ask about something we're already passing on to another new lesson and we're always ""on the run"" with our lessons. It's too fast to actually learn anything, plus we get exercises we haven't done before as homework and we never solve them.

   And it's not just me, the whole class says the same, but nothing was done about it.

    I know I could pay a teacher to come and teach me but my parents can't afford that, so what I'm asking for- does anyone know any good sites or anything where I could learn math from and understand it properly? I just feel so stupid, even though I shouldn't.",21Oct2020,1

Our shower was not giving hot water and he came after I told them we needed it to be able to wash our selves appropriately with hot water since we work at a hospital and covid. Idk if it does much but it gives us peace of mind having a hot shower.

623,"So I use to go to a college where I knew this teacher who often said how nice I was along with the other staff, well because I stayed all day unlike some of her other students we kinda to start to bond.

I would even do minor things to help at the end of the day like help shut down the computers and she would often take 5 mins out of her lunch break for a private session nothing personal.

Well one day we were alone and we started talking about each others personal lives and we kinda clicked like laughing and joking like best friends, and it ended up me saying I was going to ask her out suggestively because I used that as an example for something.
 And she seemed happy even though it was meant for something else. 

And I said ""I would but I don't want to risk falling out with you or  risk damaging your career"" which she understood.

628,"So, for starters I’m 28 working at a grocery store and since March there has been this girl(21) that started in the same department as me. She used to come to the fuel center (where I work) before she started and I always thought she was cute. She got hired and I trained her  and helped her with everything since she started and we have become close friends over the last half year.
I’m starting to get actual feelings for her is the problem. She has a boyfriend who works in the pharmacy and they have been dating for the past 4 years. The thing is there’s kind of a weird tension between us that we never talk about. We’re very close and confide in one another with our problems. She always vents to me about her Boyfriend and how he isn’t taking steps to take their relationship to the next level. She wants him to move in but he refuses.

629,"Hello, I'm a 16 y/o gay male and I need some insight to help navigate a situation.   


Next year, around March, my school will be having an event equivalent to prom. I want to attend it whilst wearing a dress and this is the root of the issue.  


I've thought about it for many months now. I mentioned this to my sister who promised to help me if this is something I truly want to do. We agreed that when I bring it up (at dinner) she'll be there to support my case.   
So at dinner, I brought it up and my sister did just that. Unfortunately, my mother wasn't so keen. She was pretty shocked and dismissive of what I was saying. It's worth noting that she's known about my sexual orientation for more than 2 years now. She then proceeded to make the assumption that I'm a transvestite, (which I'm not), to which my sister challenged on my behalf, saying that wanting to cross-dress once in a while doesn't equal transvestitism - which is true.  


I've never known my mom to be a close-minded person. She's been accepting of who I am up until now. Whilst discussing, she stated that me, wearing a dress, is not what she ""envisioned"" and she continued to crudely describe some hope she had of taking me to get a nice suit fitted. Though I don't see why getting a dress fitted would be much different?  


She also displayed concern as to what others would think. I, myself, have considered this extensively. I would never do something that would put me in danger or at risk, obviously. On the hull, my classmates are generally LGBT+ supportive, I see no reason why I'd experience backlash from them, nor would I care. A few of my teachers may also display some apprehension, but, again, that's not of my concern.   


With all of the above in mind, what do you think I could do to help sway her opinion? What are your honest thoughts on the matter? What would you do if you were in my mother's position?  


Thank you for reading all that; any help will be much appreciated &lt;3",21Oct2020,1

We dated for almost a year exactly and had been my only serious girlfriend. but at the end of the relationship she broke up with me and then I found out that the very next day she had hooked up with at the time my best friend. It was a complete blindside he was a childhood friend we spent every weekend hanging out and hungout after school. I know I’m young and still in highschool but even after all that I still have feelings for her when I know I shouldn’t. I think about what happened everyday and I just want advice to know how to move on. It’s been about 3 months since that happened and everything’s just been getting worse.  My ex best friend talked shit about me to all my other friends and spread rumors and lies causing me to lose just about anyone close to me. If I try to defend myself to people they just say “yah he told us you would say that stuff isn’t true” or I just have friends who decided to pick their side and decided I was the worse option they didn’t want to be friends with the guy who just got dumped and left for his friend. It’s been extremely lonely and I’m having family issues causing us not to get along it’s hard to find someone to talk to about this.

633,"Apologies in advance for this being long. TLDR at the bottom. This is something I have struggled with for a while, ever since I first found out about the issue a few years ago. My cousin, who is also my roommate, is dating a local city councilman, we’ll call him CM. A few years ago, before CM was appointed to the council to fill a suddenly vacant seat, my cousin confided in me that CM had an addiction to meth and would occasionally go on binges where he would be MIA for days or even weeks at a time. I was shocked, and saw that this took a big toll on my cousin every time it happened. CM would always beg for forgiveness and promise to get help, only to go on another binge a few months later. CM’s family and our extended family all know about this now. 
About a year ago, CM was approached by head hunters who wanted him to run for the state legislature. I had made up my mind that if he did run, I would go to the local paper and anonymously spill what I knew. I didn’t think I could live with myself if he was elected to such an important position while having such a serious drug problem. He ended up going on another binge and chose not to run, so I kept my mouth shut. Although I still didn’t like the idea of him being on city council, I figured that as long as he didn’t go any higher in government, I wouldn’t out him, even though it still bothered me. 
Fast forward to this weekend, and CM is currently running for re-election to the same city council seat, just two weeks out from Election Day. My cousin’s father has a massive heart attack and dies suddenly. CM is very supportive and helpful to all of us grieving the loss. Then the night before the funeral, he goes on a binge and disappears. Just like that, my cousin’s biggest support system is gone on the day of her father’s funeral. I’m livid, our whole family is livid, and my cousin is heartbroken. I am now seriously considering going to the press with this. The only thing holding me back is how it will affect my cousin, who is dealing with the loss of her father and a shitty boyfriend with a drug problem. But he needs to go to rehab and has no place on city council in my opinion. Should I leak this even though it may hurt my cousin even more? Thank you for any and all advice you can give me. 

TLDR: my cousin’s boyfriend, who is a city councilman and up for re-election in two weeks, has a meth addiction, went on a binge the night before my cousin’s father’s funeral, and was MIA for two days. Should I leak this to the press even though it may hurt my cousin even more?",21Oct2020,1

639,"Quick summary: I moved from my country few months ago and I'm now looking for a job in Gamedev where I'm living now. 

It's really hard but in the meantime the time alone + covid make me confront myself a lot and I think more and more about what I want or not want to do, but overall it's still cloudy in my head: I don't even know if I want to keep doing gamedev. 

Anyway I have a very close friend who is working in the industry and he mannages to find me a position in the company he works for. I politly decline saying that the position does not match my skills and he pressures his boss to interview me for a position that fits me. 

Factually I really need a job: I owe money to my parents and I have a to pay for food, for the rent, etc....

But this jobs seems to represents everything I hate about being a gamedev: it's 0% creativity 100% follow order, I don't want to work with my friend (I just really don't like working with close friends or family), and I would have to move (in the same country but still) and I don't really want to. 

Also, I feel that if I accept this job I'm going to be stuck in a job that make me really unhappy and since it's a really tricky industry and It's a big companie, I would have to justify myself if I stop working for them.

I'm going to do the interview anyway it's always a good experience and I could be surprised by the company values (But I know big companies values and they oftenly don't match mines). 

If after the interview they offer me a job (and It is ikely that they do) I don't know what to do: I could try it even if I probably don't want to, or I could say no but I have to handle money and my friends who put a lot of effort for finding me this job (and I hate when people helps me like, I feel like that give them a advantage over me and I owe them, abnd actually I want to prove myself I'm able to find a Job alone) 

I'm allso thinking about failing the interview on purpous but that seems like a very bad Idea for a whole lot of reasons. 

It's a golden opportunitie a good position with a very good salary and it would be a super hilight on my CV but I just don't want to and I know that if I turn down the job I'm going to have to explain myself to a lot of people and without another job in line this will be very difficult.

640,"Hi!! Just wanted to preface this by saying that I hope everyone is having a good day. Ok, anyways.

(The NSFW tag was kinda thrown on just in case? There are vague references to a suggestive post, but that's about all!!!)

So I'm in this Discord sever (already a bad start, I know I know) that's really chill, a place where fans of some series can just like talk or whatever. It's very nice, I think it's a great space especially bc I used to be in another server that generally made me uncomfortable, etc. etc. It's got a range of age groups, but generally everyone tends to get along well!

Unfortunately, I exist.

Hi, that's me. I turned 18 a lil while back, but ever since I've been super aware of my actions on a server that is supposed to be for all ages. I don't participate if others start making dirty jokes, and I try to treat everyone with the utmost respect. 

Recently, a mod (in their twenties I think?) referenced an NSFW joke pic, one that was basically more suggestive than anything (*weird* comparison, but I'd put it on par with maybe Lemon Demon's ""Two Trucks,"" in the sense that it doesn't refer to any *specific* acts or parts, you know?).  It's really hard to reference the post/pic bc I guess it's weirdly niche? Idk how to explain it but like yeah :/. That description makes it sound messed up but it ain't, take my word for it, ig? Two or three 18+ folks are going back and forth about it being funny or whatever. 

 Someone, around maybe early teens??? 13? 14? asks about what's being discussed (I wasn't in on the discussion @ this point, although I had now seen the referenced pic, which was posted elsewhere). Someone else (18+) says something about it being NSFW, etc. etc. The kid asks if the people in the pic have clothes on or something, I finally ***talk*** and I tell them they're shirtless?? The kid is basically like ""Oh"" and I immediately apologize, and the person who mentioned the pic in the first place adds in as well. I say I don't ever want to make anyone feel uncomfortable, sincerely apologize again, and the mod deletes all discussion of the post. The kid tells us not to worry about it, they apologize for some reason????? Mod makes it clear there is no need for them to apologize. Mod then takes the blame for the situation. 

So I immediately feel horrible, like really terrible. I know I literally said like half a sentence's worth of words, but I know I shouldn't have been involved in the conversation in the first place? First of all, it really wasn't my place to talk?? I have a tendency to want to be ""helpful,"" usually manifesting in the worst ways, notably jumping to answer any question thrown out there. But regardless, I know what it's like to be made uncomfortable by older folks online, and the feeling is genuinely horrible. I feel like I've endangered youth, becoming the same terrible kind of person I left my old server to avoid? I have a tendency to overreact as well, so deletion is pending for my discord account. I think there are some really great folks there, but I don't know how to cope with what I've done. I would love to go back and continue on like nothing's happened, but I also never want to do anything like that ever again. It's consumed my thoughts for almost a full day now, and I'm just disgusted w/ myself u feel?? I also can't look at anything relating to the series the server is about without getting very upset so that's a bonus feeling I guess :(.

So like yeah, I feel horribly guilty, idk if the guilt is justified (it seems like everyone moved on without giving it another thought?) or if the situation has already *been* remedied and my brain refuses to believe it. Any help for this old(not really) fool would be so greatly appreciated! Also, pointers about how to *not* be selfish and make everything about myself would be great hhhh.

Also omg if u somehow know who I or the other people involved are please don't tell a soul about this post!!! I don't think many people saw this whole thing happen and the issue here is more me and my brain not working than anything. 

Final points! Idk if the NSFW tag is needed but if it isn't let me know??? Additionally, if I need to edit or re-post this to more effectively fit the rules, please let me know. Thanks!

Thank you to anyone who reads this, even if you don't have any advice! Sorry for wasting your time!",21Oct2020,1
641,"So since I got into grammar school my life changed from heaven to hell and it changed me completely. A little Background Information. I'm currently 16 and almost 17 and not that popular but have a gorgeous and supporting girlfriend, to who I've also talked about it. I came from a primary school where all people were very nice and I was probably the most popular but then coming into grammar school somehow I've managed to get into 2 different bad classes.
I have no motivation at all to wake up in the morning because I hate it there but I can't switch schools. So I made a friend 4 years ago and things have been going great for about 3 years until I got into the new class. There was a girl, that I was changing my personality for and so my friend did and started to become kinda clout Chasing. And because he's just following what the popular kids do he's getting more and more popular and all the other kids prefer him to me. The thing is I'm trying to be the best version of myself that I can be meaning doing sports, studying a lot, talking to friends and helping them, reading books, be friendly to everybody. But for some reason my friend is still getting preferred although he is very lazy. I'm currently working with him on a school project and I have to do everything and had to do everything the 5 or 6 projects before because people of my class are only coming to me for school answers. So he is very lazy and I have to do everything while he gets all the credit.
The other thing is that I lost a dare and instead of him defending me he even agrred with all the others not to lose any of his reputation.
I don't know what to do. I have a best friend from primary school who I'm keeping in touch with and he is great. How do I overcome all of this, it feels like I'm doing all of this for nothing and I'm feeling like I'm looking into the inside from the outside.

645,"
Long post incoming. So I decided to take this independent research in Physics lab that’s worth two credits. Initially going into college, I wanted to be in engineering. Turns out though I hate programming and other engineering components such as the Calculus. Plus I don’t want to put all of my energy into studying. I want to be able to socialize and be involved in campus a lot more. (I do realize that I will have to do some studying, but I don’t want it to the degree that engineering majors have to) So I decided that next semester I’m going to change my major to business so I can get into accounting/finance. I’m doing this because I took a business class in high school and I enjoyed it. Plus my dad has connections in accounting and wants to start his own firm. I would personally rather work for my family and if all fails, then I always have an accounting degree. 

Anyways I decided this and I’m not doing well in my research class. I haven’t done anything if I’m being honest because I’m just so lost. I don’t even have anything done like I’ve only spent about 8 hours in total on the project (this is a 2 credit class). I was supposed to use an Arduino to do research, but I never was able to work it out. I thought I could work it out but turns out I was never able to figure it out. Plus it just turns me off and I don’t want to do it. I think I bit off more than I can chew. Our project is going to shown this Saturday and I have nothing to show for it. I talked with my professor about this and they said it’s okay and that it’s normal. She even said I would still get credit and pass. However she wanted to give me an Arduino for next semester so I can work on it. She set up a date for me to meet her but on short notice I told her I just couldn’t take the Arduino. 

I decided that I couldn’t take the Arduino because I wasn’t truly invested in it. It wouldn’t sit well if I took the Arduino, not sign up for next semester, and just take it without ever coming back. So I told my professor how I felt. I told her I was switching my major and I wasn’t returning for next semester and that I couldn’t take the Arduino.

Now that I had her this semester though it seems like she never responds to me anymore.

Now I’m afraid that she’ll use this against me and fail me (class is P/F). She would have a decent reason to since like I said, I haven’t done much. I’ve been so stressed with this because I don’t know if I should drop the class or wait for her email to see how things play out.

652,"So I(16NB) have recently been having a hard time dealing with trauma. Recently, I've been figuring myself out. My recent character arc was accepting myself for who I was. I came to grips with my autism, being aroace and identifying as non binary. A nice ending, right? Wrong!! For some reason the shows creator is like ""okay let's do trauma next.""
Me: B-but i have school and-
""we're doing trauma!"" 
Me: well shi*. 


I'll start from the beginning. Since I was about 11 I've been having these different people in my head. It started off with one person. When I was 13, I realised that some of my own thoughts weren't my own. I assumed i had developed an imaginary friends and that imaginary friend could sometimes take over me. A year later more appeared. 4 in total. Now I'm 16 and I have 7. I found it kinda cool. I even created a house for everyone to stay here and a massive city with NPC people. I assumed it was my imagination and fantasies. I would also imagine things differently irl too. An example of this is viewing things like either it's a TV show or a video game. Sometimes I'll play things back in my head as if it's a cartoon. So I wsd telling someone about this and they were like ""that's OSDD""
I had a look into it and well... I didn't really want to believe it. But the more I kept looking it up, the more I realised that it described a lot of a things perfectly. I know it's dangerous letting a few health sites diagnose you but 1) I'm planning on finding a professional I'm just a little... Scared.
2) I'm 100% sure the people in my head are real people. They talk to me and I'm like entirely sure that that's what they are:  a defensive mechanism. Whenever I'm in trouble, i can let them front and they can take over. I've got to grips with having a system, the
Only problem is... This only forms from trauma. I thought: pffft i don't have trauma. Sure my childhood was....
And then I remembered 7 years of emotional abuse my brain tried to cover up and its all just hit me. I'm still living in an emotionally abusive place so whenever I see the person/people who hurt me-
It's my mom and step dad... I said it.. I remember years of emotional abuse, manipulation, threats, screaming, in some rare cases physical violence, i remember feeling scared, i remember feeling unsafe. I hate it. Now it's even worse. My trauma has made me feel really sad and on edge. I keep flinching whenever I stumble back into reality (which has happened at least over 50 times today )... I feel extremely alone and I have no idea how to deal with it. I have school work to do as well but I just can't do it. And i really don't want this to continue at school either because I don't want people to start being jerks to me because of the flinching or screaming if i feel like someones going to hurt me all of a sudden. I need some help and yes I know i shouldn't be asking people on reddit for help, especially since this is more of a touchy subject but if anyone has anything i can do to get better, please do share. I'd really appreciate it :)",21Oct2020,1

i didn't think this would pose as a problem at all since i was told several times i could leave whenever  
when i asked the questioned however, my manager snapped and repeatedly said 'You SAID you were going to work until 4pm, that's what you SAID, you SAID THAT' i said several times i could work until then if she would prefer but i was told that i could leave at any time  
she then fully turned her back to me and said 'fine go whatever' and flicked her wrist in the direction of the door. i asked if she was sure and i could do the extra few hours, once again saying that i was told that i could leave whenever several times and she said to leave again

655,"I'm almost done with my masters and I already decided I want to pursue a PhD. I've been thinking that it would be a good idea to do it in a foreign country (I'm not from the US) to force myself out of my comfort zone and learn to be independent, specially since I still live with my parents.

There's this one researcher that is an expert in the same field I'm interested in. He's from Brazil and he's a professor at an university there. I've started to entertain the crazy idea that I could try to get into a PhD program there with him as my advisor. I gradually grew more excited about it and ended up mailing him to show my interest and ask for input, even though it's still early and I obviously don't even have a project yet. His replies seemed positive, but he mentioned that PhD candidates have to first spend a 6 month internship at the university to see if they can adapt to working there - and with no scholarship either.

Suddenly I realize things are moving and getting real, and my excitement is turning into fear. I'm scared about going to live on my own for the first time, in a foreign non-first world country from another continent no less. I'm scared about the huge responsibility that will be put on me, specially since my parents would have to aid me financially and they will surely not like this idea of me moving to Brazil at all. And I'm scared that I'm simply not good enough to do all this. I can see me making a fool of myself there, an incompetent who obviously doesn't have the stuff necessary, maybe even get kicked out. I worry that I'll just end up cracking under the pressure and break.

What do I do now? More than wanting, I feel like I HAVE to do this, but I also can't see this ending well. What will I do when I'm there all alone, more than 7000km away from family and friends, desperate to give up and go back?",21Oct2020,1

It has been 3 years of no contact since then..
The problem now is.. over the years he has tried to add me on several platforms using his real account (and possibly other fake accounts).
Also..
At the time of my exposing him I found out he was married and cheating on his wife.
I had just been cheated on and left for the other woman after 10 years of marriage. 
I have had no contact with him since the day we parted ways. 

I don't really want to get anymore involved but it occurred to me that my silence may have contributed to something bad.

In my class there was one other kid who used a wheelchair, she was unable to walk and had used it her whole life. Multiple times my mom told me to bring presents to my teacher and would give them to me to give to her. I always felt weird about doing this and would say no but my mom would kinda force me into it and put it in my back pack. She'd say she was giving me all these presents for my teacher because she felt bad for her that she had two kids in wheelchairs that she had to take care of.

One is in home security, which pays very well and is great for a highly sensitive introvert like myself because I have my own space... only thing is, it's Mon-Fri 8-5 or nothing.

The other job is a local bakery, the pay is not nearly as good, the work seems a bit worrisome for me because I'm around people a lot, but they are more flexible with hours, and they really need the help: the owner was really trying to work with me and I could tell she's desperate for help.

My current school pros:
• I know everyone here and everyone knows me
• Teachers give more attention to each student
• easy transport

My current school cons:
• I know everyone here and everyone knows me (monotone)
• I'm the best in the school, which means I have potential to go to a much better school
• ranked 96th in the city and 1291th in the country
• no one got into the course and college I want to go to ever

The other school pros:
• ranked 5th in the city and 34th in the country
• everyone is new and everyone is similar to me (academically), which is good to motivate me and I have a chance to make new friends
• at least 10 students get into the college and course I want to go every year

The other school cons:
• out of my comfort zone, I will need to get to meet everyone, learn how this school works etc
• transport is difficult and long, and as I have extreme fatigue due medical conditions it will tire me at lot; besides being a little dangerous
• although teachers are amazing they don't care much about each student individually

Both schools are significantly good schools and have good teachers.

662,"I (26F) need some help with ideally an excuse to tell my friend (25F) not to come to a party early as I don't want her help.

I'll start by saying that things haven't been as good as normal between my friend and I for a couple of weeks due to unrelated reasons, that has no influence on me wanting her help, it just might make it harder to say no.

Anyways onto the situation I need help with.

I really enjoy organising and planning events and parties for my friends and being a fab hostess when they come over. I also really really love cooking and baking.

Whenever our group of girls get together my friend always likes to put herself in charge of all food etc... and although she doesn't refuse help or advice, I can tell she doesn't like it. Also whenever we try to plan any event she always wants to run it and doesn't like it if one of us wants to do it, even if it was our idea.

Tomorrow I'm having my friends over for a goodbye dinner (following all Covid rules in our area) as one of our other friends is moving to Singapore for work next week.  The friend this is for has had a really tough year, cancelled wedding, hen do, holidays, quarabtine birthday etc... so I really want this to be perfect for her. I have been planning this for ages and have a great vision of how I want it to be. I have everything organised and ready to go down to all the small details. 

Then today she's messaged asking to come over early to sort the present (which we do need to do) and so she can help with the cooking. 

I am really grateful for the offer and that she wants to help, However she knows what I'm cooking and that it doesn't require any help. Also if she comes over I'll feel obligated to let her do it, so will take away my enjoyment, or I will get awkward or stressed trying to tone down my level of control/perfectionism trying to get everything ready. 

I need advice on how to tell her not to come over until just before everyone else as I don't want to have to tell her I don't want her help as I know she'll get upset by that.

I know this might make me sound like a control freak which I am a bit and I am trying hard to let go, I just want everything perfect for my friends last night with us.",21Oct2020,1
663,"Hello,

Last June I graduated HS. During the holidays I was busy finding out which course I wanted to attend at university (starts after HS). I was deciding between history (The thing I love most in my life, and which I am pretty good at learning) and law, which also interests me but less. I eventually chose law because with a history degree there would be a really small chance that I will get a job in the history branch, and my grandfather always wanted someone in the family to study something law-related and he’s my greatest inspiration.

At this moment, I’ve been following the course for a month now, and I really don’t feel comfortable/good in this situation. I am interested in law and politics, but not really in the way we get taught here. Also, the classes go superfast and I am behind on the course by a lot. I have a feeling I made the wrong choice, with the course but also the location, university, etc. I looked up a few things online and came to the conclusion that it’s possible for me to still switch.

The problem is that everything has to be paid for again, except the registration fee. But the books, the course, and some other things, which would cost a lot. I am lucky that my parents paid for most things (around 3/4) and I don’t want to tell them they did it for nothing and I’m ungrateful. Although I know for sure they would just accept it, I just can’t think of the feeling I’ll have, and what my family might think, since I told most people everything is going fine (which was at first).

Although I know people can’t make this decision for me, I’d like some advice from you guys. I already asked my friends but none of them gave an answer and this chose is tearing me up. I have no clue what I’m doing and what I should do.

Thanks for reading this, 

Sincerely,

T.",21Oct2020,1

I admitted my wrongdoing and we spent about a month apart keeping in touch slightly. I started going to therapy in that time to understand my actions more because i didnt truly know why i had done it. I have had a tendency to thibk about just dating other women casually even before i cheated on her. She ended up giving me a secong chance and ive been trying to better myself and i know that she loves me by her actions. I can be a very avoidant person and have noticed that i try to push people away when they get really close to me. But she has stood her ground saying that shes here for me through my struggles. My therapist says these are the kind of people i should want in my life considering my abandonment/trust issues.

669,"Hello Reddit. My friends are having a real tough time with their son. He is a really high functioning autistic Male late 20s. I have always known him to be very reserved and quiet with only 1 or 2 real IRL friends. And his parents are turning 70 living a modest life but making ends meet.

     Now here is were the trouble starts. Son has an online friend who he has been sending money to, about 14k within the last year. Son recently got a job about 1hr away and moved in with a family member of mine who lives near his work. Son adds mom to his bank account just in case something happens to him or he needs help managing money. Mom sees that he has almost nothing in his account and his son never spends anything on himself. Well she sees thinks perhaps he has paid off his student loan, nope. Mom asks him who is Anon and why have you sent him 14k? Son says that he is just a friend in need. Mom is obviously upset since she had given up her own car and money to help him settle in his new life. Mom asks him to stop sending Online friend money or she will take back her car, he agrees. 
   Well one week later mom checks bank account and son has sent his friend more money ( a lot) When he goes home she takes back the car and his cell phone service since he did not hold up his end of the agreement. This causes son to cry and go online to his friend. After about an hr of talking to his friend he comes out to confront mother really aggressively calling her bad words. she says he has never seen him this way before and gets scared. Son took an Uber and bought a prepaid phone on his friends advice and they haven’t spoken since.

Mom is really concerned that his online friend is taking advantage of her son and leaving him out to dry financially. I have no idea how to help them out. At least my family member can keep an eye out for him in the mean time. Is there any way we can convince him to stop sending this man money? I want to ask him to stop sending him money and see if this “friend” will stick around.",21Oct2020,1

So i understand that there are people crazy about COVID, but me and my friends arent as worried about it as other people. 

The other day my parents told me that my bio teacher was quitting, because she is pregnant and deathly afraid of COVID. This teacher is super young and hasn't even been married a year.  My parents had told me not to tell anyone about it, but as it was probably going to get around. 

So yesterday when i was in class,  I asked my friend if she had heard about that teacher.And she said she hadn't, but she asked what was up and then i kinda blurted it out on accident. And my other friend had asked about too. In the room i was in it was a shared class, so another teacher had her off period. And other friend was sitting kinda close to her, i guess when i whispered in her ear it was too loud. The other teacher gave me a kinda bitchy comment, ""I heard that too, thats not something I would be spreading around."" And maybe i should've waited until after school but again, it was an accident. When i told  the first friend it was completely an accident. 

When I went to that teachers class, she acted like everything was fine, like nothing was about to happen. When i mentioned that to my dad when i got home, he told me that legally she probably wasn't allowed to say anything. Since i told people could that be an issue?

When my mom got home i asked her where she heard about it, My mom works with the president of my schools wife so she said that she heard it from her.

and my brother is good at physically defending himself so if it ever got physical, which in some cases it did because whenever he would try and rationalise/use logic the kids would get stuck for words and resort to violence; and in those cases he could hold his ground and has told me about those occasions, but has never been a full on fight maybe a few pushes and a punch or two

but today he's come and told me about something thats happened today that has honestly shocked me to the core, i can't believe he would ever do this, and i screamed at him rightfully so (i think so anyway), 

these two girls (who from how hes described them to me seem like stuck up typical popular girls, and he said their friendship group is notorious for being horrible to everyone else), were kicking his friend, hard, and my brother told them to stop, and instead of stopping, they kicked my brother too, and they kicked him in the balls, and he punched both of them in the face, causing them to have bloody noses, to what extent i dont know i didnt ask details, i just go so angry hearing that he even touched another girl intended for physical harm, regardless if they had kicked him in the balls or not, and told him what he did was very wrong and he said he knows and feels very ashamed but got caught up in his anger and i told him this wasnt an excuse,

and he started to tear up out of shame, and he told me how everyone in their highschool pick on his friend group coz they think theyre weak/easy to pick on, and he hates it because his friends come home crying and miss out on school because of this,

and i told him these experiences shouldn't be making him more kinder rather than violent and horrible, because he knows how it feels to be the underdog, 

i know it's painful and i hate seeing him like this/go through this, and i know the culture at his high school is toxic, which means there really isnt room for change, whether it be from the teachers/students,

we can't talk to his school about this because they'll brush it under the rug/won't take proper action,

from my own secondary school (not the same as his school)  experiences it's never gotten to this extent(physical), and some of high school was peaceful, but i learnt a lot from my experiences, i learnt how to deal with the 'beef' or problems people had with me for whatever reasons, 

but i dont know what to do, hearing him do this is the last straw, but i'm still hoping that over the years it'll just stop/the other kids will mature and understand what they did was horrible, because thats what happened with me but my high school was better (still not good) but their antibullying measures were much better and issues were often sorted and both of our situations were different so i know he needs to do something different/we need to do something different

btw, he's hard of hearing and wears hearing aids so i feel this is what fuels the kids to pick on him more, and i hate it, because i wear hearing aids myself but i have the privilege of no-one seeing them and actually getting to know me before thinking anything stereotypical/ being bothered because of this, and maybe i just got lucky with the people around me but i know its probably because of his hearing aids that he seems like an 'easy victim'

i wanted to hear other people's perspective on this issue, so people of reddit, what do you think of this?

btw i may have missed out any details but if you have any questions let me know",21Oct2020,1

680,"I’ll preface this with some background information first: in the summer of 2019, my family moved to California. I decided to stay here in Texas and rent an apartment instead because I felt comfortable here and wanted to move out. In January of 2020, my family flew my boyfriend and I out for a “faux Christmas” because we weren’t able to get time off during actual Christmas. They paid for our plane tickets, let us stay with them in their house and we were there for roughly a week. This upcoming year for January 2021, they want to fly us out again. The issue is that, its a pandemic and I don’t feel comfortable flying and visiting family. It seems reckless to me to do so. My job would have me quarantine myself for 2 weeks afterwards, so I would be missing 3 weeks of work in total. I only get 5 paid time off days a year, and we would be in a really bad position financially. I don’t know how to tell them that my boyfriend and I won’t be attending this next year without starting an argument.

In short, I’m shocked. I don’t know what to do. It’s like I have no privacy. Do I move out? Do I stop journaling? I really don’t know. Am I being dramatic? Am I making this bigger than it really is?",21Oct2020,1
682," 

I started therapy with a psychologist earlier this year. He looked very good and really helped me find a job, I was not confident that i would find it and helped me with some difficulties that I had in terms of self-steem. Then I ended up leaving the service because of the price charged. Then he made me wait and said he didn't have a schedule and I waited 8 months for assistance. So far so good, maybe he was indeed really busy.

Then I came back from the service and he called me on the month and on the day of the service that would have a holiday. I did not know that the holiday would be charged, as it was not clear. Then he decided to change the date of attendance, and I thought it was a holiday replacement. But then on the day of the appointment, he said that he was going to attend the appointment at my time. I was a little confused because I thought it had been replaced and ended up arguing with him about it. also, he wanted me to pay for his holiday, doing everything to manipulate saying that today was the deadline, and I don't know what.

Furthermore, in the therapy, he keeps changing what he says. He says something and then say something else. When I argued with him about it, he was very exalted, which indicates that he could be lying. Anyway, he asked for our conversation to remain in attendance and no longer on whatssap, since he helped me sometimes on whatssap when i needed. I don't know if i should trust him anymore, my gusts tell me that i shouldn't, that he is a really crafty lier, but he did indeed help me before and i do have trust issues. Should i trust him or not? Should i keep seeing him?",21Oct2020,1

She screams and cries and has full-on panic attacks at the thought of getting in the shower. She also refuses to talk to her therapist about it because it’s “too embarrassing,” even after I explained that’s what a therapist is for.

My mom refuses to address it as an actual psychological issue and brushes it off as “just her making a big deal.” Mom yells at her and freaks out over it and just makes it worse. My sister has never been scared of our mom, but when it comes to the shower, she’s terrified because she knows mom is going to overreact and freak out. I offered to try and help her shower but nothing worked. No matter what I did, she wouldn’t calm down.

689,"I'm new to Reddit, so Im not sure if this the best place to post this, but I'm desperate.

Also, in order to keep this concise, I'm going to have to cut a lot of info out. The last ten years have been bonkers is the best I can say.

Two and a half years ago, I moved out of my childhood home, leaving my father and twin sister. Father had been an alcoholic and suffered from a stroke, but he was at least okay enough to take care of my twin and the house. My twin was born with cognitive disabilities and epilepsy, but she was okay enough to at least take care of my dad and the house. Neither's disability should have really impaired their ability to tend to chores, as they both could walk and use reason pretty well. 

After I moved, my dad had another stroke while driving and ended up in an accident. He was eventually moved to a rehab facility to regain motor functions, but at this point he was definitely different. He remains in the facility to this present day was he has no intention of walking again, but he also can't seem to wrap his head around the fact that he'll be there the rest of his life.

During this time, my twin completely let herself and the house go. No matter how much support she received from me, family, and professionals, she just couldn't grasp that she had to be responsible for cleaning and maintaining the house to the best of her abilities. This came to a head last September, when the town condemned her house, had animal control take her dogs, and she ended up in the same facility as my dad. 

My dad has decided that the house is now entirely my responsibility. Despite the fact that I live an hour away and only make enough to cover bills, be expects me to come out and clean/do yard work/fix the fence/do all the things required to appease the township for free. Over the summer, I completely emptied my twin's yard, removed a bunch of trees and tore down an old shed. Last summer, I cleared out the house of all it's garbage, only for twin to mess it up again. 

The points are:

1) My dad seriously does not understand the extent of the serious shit he's in. He fully expects that the house can be easily taken out of condemnation, and he and my twin can go home and live there once it's better. This cannot happen as he can't walk and twin is going to be sent to a long-term care home, but he keeps ignoring that.

2) Because of [[INSERT WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON]], I'm seriously broke and cannot afford to, or have the ability to, go down every week to fix the place up. Also, honestly?? I'm sick of it. As implied before, I have been expected to do everything for my twin, who became increasingly lazy because of it. My dad always took her side, and basically groomed her to be as nasty as him (no offense but.. the house is condemned, you can imagine). When I suggested they get a cleaning and landscaping company in, they were like 'great, go find one', then ghosted me for a month. I guess I'm supposed to find a company AND pay for it.

3) My dad randomly called me while I was at work yesterday after a month of silence. He immediately gave me a list of demands, including taking a day off work so I can let a representative in the property to evaluate. Of course, nothing has been done by this point, so there's little reason to even bother, but meh. He claims that she's been trying to get a hold of me (a lie), and later my other sister interjected that the only reason she is trying to reach out to me if because she can't get a hold of him. He completely defected all of this, and questions as to what he's actually done about the situation were ignored. It's probably wilful, but the way he just somehow remains so blissfully oblivious makes me feel like his brain is actually broken. He still somehow just expects me to do all this, even after I refused. 

I'm at a complete loss. I don't know what to do. I know the best course is to just go in, grab anything good, and sell the house to one of those 'as-is' buyers; however, my dad remains the owner, so I cannot move forward with anything without him given the permission. He still expects to be able to go home, so I'm expected to waste time, energy, and money on his pipe dream. On the other, if I just leave him to his own devices... What then? I can totally just drop the issue entirely, but I'm honestly so anxious about imagined repercussions that I feel stuck.

So, if you've stuck around, is there a way to help my dad and family move forward?",21Oct2020,1

695,"so basically the past few years i've been going from place to place trying to live a normal life, but unable to because crazy people have forced me to move out.

it eventually culminated to a point where i talked to my parents about how stupid my life has been, that i cannot get on my feet for fucking nothing and whatever. so my mom gets my an apartment, says she'll help me out for a year to help me get on my feet again.

along with this comes my brother, whose an overweight, digusting, depressed-pathetic type. my brother's been in his own whirlwind of mental mayhem the past few years as well. he's the kind of person who complains he's depressed because of x or y, when he literally creates x or y problem. the kind of shit he does is just repulsive. he's nasty, leaves messes, this that the other, you name it. everytime he uses the bathroom there's a 50% chance he'll be in there for over an hour. he was recently diagnosed diabetic, and just last night i found a bag of fuckin nutter butters on the counter that he clearly sat down and ate 11 servings of (like 150g's of sugar or some shit). this is after he tries to converse with me these passing by conversations of how ""the doctor put me on this diet""

or what he did a few days before that, said he's going to ""make a quit calendar and not smoke or drink soda for 30 days"" and literally 6 hours later buys a pack of marlboro menthols

so now you have an idea of what kind of person my brother is, now let's get to my principle problem: i've spoken to him extensively, extensively. i've tried to help but now its to the point of extreme anger on my part. i get super pissed and argue with him about how his bullshit affects me. the bathroom always reeks. i literally can't even trust him to drive, because there's been many times where i can see he has a mental fog the next morning because of all the sugar he ate the night before. there's just a ton of problems that bleed out to other people because of his habits.

everytime i try to talk to him its just a waste of time. i tell him about the bathroom, or how one of his problems affects me, he fixes it for a day and then stops doing it. every word i put into his head evaporates like alcohol on a fuckin open surface.

i'm to the point where i'm about to just beat his ass to shit, but i don't wanna do that. i've been dealin with this nonsense my whole life with him, and while i sit here day in and day out looking for a job, going to 4-5 interviews a week, i don't want to clean up his bullshit or smell his foulness.",21Oct2020,1

Currently I am in training for a quite demanding job and I need to be able to give 100% everyday or at least most of the days. Lately I've started struggling with sleep problems, anxiety and panic attacks and symptoms of depression. Due to that I have been struggling in my job as well, which makes me feel even worse.

Additional to my current struggles has my father (56M) been diagnosed with ADHD a couple months ago and pushing me to get checkef out as well, since I seem to have lots of symptoms as well.

Right now I am barely capable of doing everyday tasks such as showering or eating. My day consists of working, crying, distracting myself with netflix and very little sleep. My work performance is getting worse and I don't see any way out of this place right now. Summarized; I feel awful. All. The. Time.

 It's gotten so bad to the point where I'm not even happy at home anymore And I can't even trust my own dad. Just the way my dad talks to me a lot though it just makes me feel like I'm a horrible person and that I'm the issue.

Then, I emailed his administrator. No response. Then I emailed his counselor. I was told they (staff and faculty) can only respond to parents and guardians. She did not respond to my following email. My father has put m in charge of my siblings and frankly does have time to be writing all these emails and keeping up with everyone's schoolwork. Like I said my mother and I do not talk and even if we did I would not tell her about my bother's grades because he would beat him until he scarred. Not even exaggerating.

So then I emailed his princials and got a wishy washy response. Eventually he said he would set up a zoom meeting with my brother and his teacher. FINALLY. Days pass and no email from his teacher. I followed up with his principal and he said my brother's teacher should've emailed my brother with the information. He did not. When I emailed his principal from my brother's school email telling him this and got no response from his principal.

At this point I'm not even mad about the grades anymore. It's about how these people are handling the distance learning. You would think they would have enough sense to respond to concerned families' and students' emails BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PHYSICALLY IN SCHOOL!!! Furthermore, not every parent cares about their child's performance in school. My mother sure as hell doesn't. She's going through a fucking midlife fucking crisis before she's even fourty!!! If a concerned family member email's a child's teacher you would think they would have the decency to fucking respond!!!!",21Oct2020,1
709,"I worked with this company for 2 years, and at that time I had 2 bosses, S and F. Everything was fine at first, but things escalated when after a year, S started to bug me to do work until 3-4 AM every day and on weekends, with no extra pay. I did it at first out of respect and because he said it was urgent, but after a few months, i told S that he can't keep doing this anymore, and to please respect my off day. Our work relationship suffers after that and i decided to quit. S and I stopped talking to each other. 

F kept me as a freelance, and now I've been helping him with some tasks related to S department. Today I found out that they've been knowingly skimming off payments to clients (including me), paying us less than what they should've. I confronted F, asking for clarifications, just trying to understand, and he said it is not a big deal, all the other clients never questioned them about their payments, and it seems like working with me gives him so many issues (?? don't know where this is coming from) and i am being difficult to work with and that's why S doesn't want to work with me full time anymore, and that he's been trying very hard to prove to S to hire me back so i need to stop questioning them so much. His words that piss me off the most is ""don't prove them right."" Insinuating that S was right and I am difficult.

A month after we broke up, she texted me saying that she wants to be friends, but on that same night she told me that she still loves me. At that point I had somewhat gotten over her and I said I’m not interested.

718,"My whole story started 3 years ago, I was visiting my cousins country with my family

2 of my cousins there kept annoying me and hitting me and calling me bad things, so on the last day that I was there, I had a break down, and I got into a big fight with my cousins.

And then I left and came back home, in the year I came back home, one of my friends who we will call Abby, began accusing me of stealing money from me, and he contacted my parents somehow.

So I told my parents that he is lying and my parents believed me and I blocked Abby.

the following year, my friend, who we will call Aurora, invited me to his birthday, and when I was at his birthday at Dave and Busters, he accused me of stealing stuff from him, and I left after his mom forced me to say that I stole stuff from him.

In that year, someone at school also began accusing me of assaulting her, and I became part of drama that I really didn't want to be in.

The next year my friend, who we will call Jeff, began demanding for me to buy him stuff on his birthday, so i just blocked him.

This year, I decided to unblock Jeff, but I blocked him again 2 weeks ago when I realized he hasn't changed.

Also this year, my friend who I'll refer to as Veronica, kept telling me to join his school google meets and troll, so I wasn't thinking in the moment and I just did it, and I got into trouble for that, so I just blocked Veronica.

This week I unblocked my cousin and we were having fun playing games like CS GO, but yesterday my cousin sent my sister a screenshot in our chat where I called him a ""pussy"" as a joke after he mentioned that a word in his language which I accidentally said meant ""pussy""

And my sister came into my room, laughing that I called him a ""pussy""

and just to clarify, me and my cousin always insult each other during games when we lose to the other person, because its in our nature

&amp;#x200B;

And today my mom came into my room telling me to talk nicely with my cousin and for him to talk nicely with me, because he haven't talked in  years.

So I was kind off pissed off, so I just told my cousin to not insult me and what my mom told me to tell him.

So I began playing Minecraft with my cousin, and in the game my cousin began insulting me because I killed him after he attacked me, and then I told him to not insult me, but he then said ""fuck you"" after a while, claiming that he said it to a zombie.

So I began interrogating him later, and he said that he sent screenshots of me calling him a ""pussy"" because he thought it was funny, so I began telling him things like

\-Would you like it if I sent your parents a screenshot of you calling me bad things, and Ill just say ""its funny""

\-Why did you only send my sister a screenshot of me saying something bad to you?

&amp;#x200B;

(Note to people reading, everything written below happened after I began writing the part of this post thats above)

&amp;#x200B;

And yea, but then my cousin brought up what happened a few years ago, and I explained to him how it was his fault and how I felt

So then he said "" so lets be friends and nevermind this"" these are his exact words

So i replied by saying that he shouldn't say bad words anymore, and he agreed.

So he told me to get on later so we can play.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am left questioning my own friends and family, I have heard stories of cousins, making them seem like only another person, rather than family.

And also I have no idea wtf went on between him and my sister or why he was sending her screenshots of my chat, at first I thought he sent her screenshots of my chat because she asked him to, but now my cousin said he sent her screenshots of my chat because ""its funny"".

My main question now is: how do i know if i can trust someone?",21Oct2020,1

721,"Hey all, so me and my girlfriend (both 19 almost 20) are considering moving out within the next few months here. 

we are both in school as well as working. I make a bit more since I only have class a couple days a week, plus they’re in the evenings so I’m able to work full time. 

we bring in about $2300 per month combined. 
The average amount of rent in my area is $600 give or take. 

So with that being said, we’ve came up with a budget list to figure out our expenses and what not, here’s what it looks like. 

Again this is both of our incomes and expenses combined.

Rent - $550 - $750. (May be more depending upon parking cost and if utilities are included). 
Food - $250 - $300. 
Toiletries - $50.
My car payment + insurance - $230.
Gas - $150 - $200.
Phone - $40. (both of us are on our parents plans). 

Neither of us have any health or other insurance costs (besides car) as we’re still in our parents plans. My girlfriend already paid fully for school so no debt there, and I have paid for my first year fully so only have a little to pay on student loans which doesn’t start until summer (will be about $50 per month). 

So that leaves us with roughly $1000 per month.

As it is, I've basically posted nothing this year at all lol other than when I updated my profile picture a few days ago. It never used to be this way either - just recently, all of a sudden people are unfriending me.

Some of the people who have done it I don't really care all that much about. In fact, there are some people that are so unimportant I can't even figure out who they are.

Yet, at the same time, I've had a number of my cousins unfriend me (which I thought was kinda odd given that they are family). 

There was also this girl that I used to have a crush on (although I kinda got over it and accepted the fact that we had different interests and things probably wouldn't work out, and she doesn't know that I ever had a crush on her). We used to be coworkers and got on well, however the last time we spoke to each other was in February (my social skills are abysmal so I never kept up contact after she quit the job).

728,"Hi all,

I’m having a bit of an issue that I’m not sure how to navigate, so I’m hoping someone here might have a good POV to share. 

I’m male, my roommate is female. We share a very tiny space with one bathroom. Lately, every time she’s on her monthly cycle, my entire apartment smells very strongly of it. Being a gay male, this is not something I’m used to. It makes me gag and feel really sick, but I’m not sure how to bring it up to her. 

I’ve tried using candles, air fresheners, and diffusers to mask the scent. However, she’s very sensitive to strong smells and she asks me to stop using them (also, they don’t really get rid of the smell). I’ve not yet explained to her why I’ve been spraying them, because I don’t really know how to tell her. I’ve been trying to open windows, too, but that’s not enough, either (plus she’s shutting them, since it’s getting colder out). 

Is this something I can even bring up to her? If so, what’s a good way to do so? Or should I just leave it alone? 

I don’t want to hurt her feelings or shame her for a biological function that she doesn’t control... especially since I’m not sure if there’s actually a solution to reduce the smell??? I’ve never dealt with this before, so I’m hoping someone has some tips to share.

738,"Hi, I just started ""highschool"" - not the american kind, but an equivalent. I'm the only girl in my class, because it's a technical school, I suppose. This means I have to always be kind of on guard. A lot of my classmates are also quite a bit older than me, which can sometimes make me even more uncomfortable in situations where certain types of comments are made.

At the start of the year, I tried to be as friendly as possible and make friends, without seeming flirtatious. I wanted to feel at ease in the environment, without encouraging crushes on me.

I'm pretty well liked as far as I can tell, which is fine. However, I'm very much an introvert, and I don't want to be with people all the time...And I do feel like someone is always trying to talk to me. I try not to start too many conversations, and only answer if they ask me something. I sit with my headphones on, and read my book - but that doesn't seem to be enough. 

There's this one guy, who is almost 5 years older than me, who keeps being near me, walking up to me, and talking to me. And I'm fine talking to him once in a while, but I don't want to all the time...and I don't know how to tell him that. Sometimes he makes comments like ""my kind of girl"" or ""that's cute"" - or he comments on my looks. I'm not sure what to make of it, and I don't want to overreact. But it makes me uncomfortable, and I'm not sure how I should take these comments. He also has the same interests as me, and has joined the same extracurriculars. I'm not going to quit them, because I really like doing them, but I'm also really tired of him talking to me.

1) Contact Amazon and tell them that I found the items that were “missing” and that I want to return them.

2) Sell the items and donate all the money to a charity from the country were I was raised.

I like music and listen to it every day (I have never told anyone this I know it's stupid)

I want to make money (they think I just want to sit home all day doing nothing like I have been for seventeen years but I can't do it anymore)

I don't want to go to high school for a fifth year (I have high functioning autism and they can send me back to school if they want to so I can learn how to do take care of myself while living alone in the real world)

747,"I was born in 1991 to poor Jewish parents in Cary, North Carolina. My parents were already distant and unloving, but were too poor to spend time with me as they were always at work. They never told them I was their precious girl or hugged me. My sister was always partying, so I hardly saw her.

In 1998, my school counselor labeled me gifted, and I skipped second, third, fifth, and eleventh grade. I was always younger than my classmates, which, mixed with my Asperger's, made it near-impossible to male friends as a kid. My parents never got me social skills classes, so that didn't help.

I remember a time in sixth grade - it must have been April 2000 or so, I was walking to the bathroom after English class and saw these three friends playfully teasing eachother. I tried to join in, and they just said ""Go cum about helium and convection again you pathetic friendless geek,"" and I felt like sobbing.

I entered college at 15 in Seltember 2006, and studied accounting, personal finance, and microeconomics. I had one friend, but they were older than me and could never spend time with me because they were always caring for their grandmother with Alzheimer's. When she died in 2007, he had to move to Iowa do to financial troubles. I was friendless again.

I graduated in June of 2010. The following month, I got a job at a local financial firm, and by started saving up money. In March of 2011, I had enough money to buy my own home. The following month, I made the decision to recreate my lost childhood.

Ever since I've cuddled stuffies, eaten ""childish"" foods like mac n cheese, chicken nuggets, pop tarts, apple juice, and cotton candy, watched cartoons like Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and We Bare Bears,and jumped around on hopper balls and in bouncy houses.

I have some friends who engage in this stuff with me, but other than that, I'm loathed by my community. They tell their kids to not end up like me, think I'm a pedophile, and treat me like garbage. Last year I was jumping around my yard on my favorite hopper ball and one of them opped it with a knife, telling me to grow up.

751,I’ve been unemployed since March and after applying to hundreds of positions and having countless interviews this week I have been offered two positions. One is a 10 minutes drive from my home as an office assistant at the hospital and pays $16 an hour. The other is essentially the same position but at a high school and is salaried at 38K. It would be an extra 400 take home a month however it is an hour commute each way.

I initially went into her dms with the intention of trying to talk her out of it but got scared and pretended to entertain her ideas to avoid hurting her feelings. If you don't know already adrenochrome is the conspiracy theory that many elite members of society, celebrities and politicians mostly, get together semi-regularly to do satanic rituals on children to scare them and get them to release adrenochrom (not even a real hormone) and then drain the kids' blood and inject it into themselves because they think it makes them look younger ( I know it sounds cool but don't try it).

765,"Hi Reddit. I need some advice, it’s been ten months since my best friend, who I had known since I was 5, died. We had both turned 25. He had just got his first girlfriend ever and we were excited to see how adulthood would be for the two of us, we had a lot of plans to travel and go on trips whenever we both had time off of work. He was extremely close to my family and I considered him as a brother. Suddenly one morning he was gone forever. I was so devastated  that I completely shut down all emotions just to deal with it. The only way I could deal with it was to pretend all of it never existed and all the time and memories with him was merely a “dream”, not reality. It sounds horrible but I didn’t have the strength to deal with reality head on. Over the past ten months I have avoided thinking about it much, some days when I thought about it I would have no emotions and some days I would break down crying. I thought something was wrong with me....how could I have strong emotions one day and the next day I didn’t even shed a tear? It’s now been ten months since his passing and I still feel like I haven’t properly mourned his death. I frankly don’t have any remaining “close” friends that know me on a deep level that I can vent too and I choose to avoid talking with my family about it because I feel embarrassed to show raw emotions to them since I come from a very career driven, high expectations Swiss family - we are close but not the type of family that talks about each other’s feelings. I guess I just need advice from anyone how can I go about properly grieving? I have pushed it off for ten months but I do know that eventually I need to...it eats away at me. I was thinking about joining a support group that I can simply walk in and sit down in the back and eventually get the courage to talk in front of everyone.

I’ve decided to leave my job at a small construction company. The reasons are numerous, low pay, cash flow issues at the company, unsteady hours, etc. the main reason though is that my boss takes every opportunity to call me (and 1 or 2 others) morons, idiots, and other vulgar names/insults at every opportunity. He also enjoyed slapping things out of hands and throwing objects in anger. I’d go on more about his conduct, but this post would never end. It is a hostile work environment to say the least.

I live in an at-will state and signed no other contracts besides a w-4. What I’m wondering is what is the best way to avoid confrontation with him. I’m paid up as of today, but I still have a few things in my possession that he’d probably want back. Can anyone think of a way to navigate this safely and smartly? It’s entirely possible I’m overthinking this as well.

775,"I'm new to posting on reddit, but I thought I'd try it out for some advice. I've posted this to another sub as well. My story is unique, but not all that interesting. Suffice it ti say, I am 25 years old, almost 26, just started at a new job, and have never dated. Allow me to explain. I was a nervous wreck throughout high school. My first night at college was petrifying. I went to a few clubs and was even in student government. I made my first real friends there, and still talk and hang out with most of them. That's when things changed again. I never got rid of my anxiety and depression, but I got better at managing it. I also take antidepressants. But anyway, After my sophomore year, I had to take a semester off to get enough money for tuition. When I went back to school, I couldn't live on campus and had to commute. At night, I worked washing dishes til 11 to pay for tuition, books, and gas. I was working 25 hours a week minimum, weekends included. I never had time for anything else, because when I wasn't at work, I was studying, writing papers, or doing one of the few things I like to do to relax. I graduated late because I had to reduce my credit hours to afford tuition, so got my degree in 2018. Didn't attend the ceremony because I had to work. In that time, some of my anxiety came back, and I was nervous about approaching people again. I only joined Facebook to keep in touch with my new friends, some of whom live elsewhere in the state. I didn't put anything on it because it was mainly for communication. After I graduated, I got a job not washing dishes and stayed there for 2 years. In that time I bought a used car (a pretty nice one, if I do say so myself), joined some meetups (didn't go to many because I felt intimidated by people who were living on their own) and tried to put myself out there. Since I'm living at home, I've been able to save a substantial amount of money that I'm going to use to refinance and hopefully move in with my college roommate. He has a house and he offered to let me live there for reasonable rent. I've also been helping my younger siblings pay for their schooling and gave my parents money so they could refinance the house due to the current low interest rates. So that's my situation, now for my obstacles.

As previously mentioned, I have anxiety. I don't think I'm very attractive. I have never been overweight thanks to an insane metabolism (but still prone to heart problems) but I've been scrawny, and I think my face is shaped weird. Not to mention wearing a mask in public is bringing back my acne because of the sweat. A close female friend of mine from college (she's married, so please don't suggest her) said I'm cute, but she also knows that I'm a kind, caring person. I think that may be coloring her perception of me. I don't have recent photos of me with my friends, so not a lot for a dating profile. I'm always clean shaven, and recently got into exercise. I walk 2 miles a day. I have a multitude of interests, but the only activities I ever had time for were solo ones, so I can't exactly bond over that. I sort of had a thing with a girl, but this post is already pretty long, so if you want details about anything in it, ask and you shall receive. I can talk about literally anything. My motto is anything can be interesting if you keep asking questions and listen. If I had a superpower, it would be imperviousness to boredom. I'm honest, funny (unless I try to be) and pretty open-minded. I wouldn't be opposed to doing anything on a date. I've been told I give good advice on many topics, even, ironically, interpersonal relationships. To summarize, I don't have a lot to put on a dating profile in terms of experiences and hobbies, I don't think I'm attractive, and I can't initiate. Once I'm in with somebody in a conversation or a friendship, I'm good. Getting there is the obstacles. Thank you for reading this far. Please give me any advice you can and if you need details, please ask. Any help would be appreciated. (Ooh wait, forgot to mention I also like writing).",21Oct2020,1

Quick backstory: My family and I have been going to this boba shop since I was like 13, and immediately I developed a crush on this worker there, and I would see him almost every week bc we went to that boba shop almost every Friday. When I was 16, we somehow found each other on Instagram and you can only guess how excited I was. We would message and even FaceTime often. 

But then I realized, why is he talking to a minor??? I was naive but once I made that connection I felt a little weird even though he is super sweet and nice. I remember he told me he can wait for me to turn 18, because he really likes me. So he did, he waited two year and I turned 18 just a few days ago. Today he texted me he would love to take me out to dinner this Friday. WHAT DO I DO?! Is it weird for him to ask a new 18 year old this, or is it okay since it’s technically legal? I don’t know how to respond at all. I’m very flattered and it did put a smile on my face when I received that text but I’m worried I’ll regret accepting his offer. Help me please.

779,"I've tried posting this to r/retail but all it says is that I'm not allowed to post there

I've been wanting to leave forever pretty much ever since some friends of mine left and I don't speak with them anymore. Had some problems at work a few years ago around that time and ever since I've just HATED my job. I work at Walmart in Washington I won't say where cuz I know some of my co-workers browse Reddit so just in case I don't want to say my store probably (shouldn't anyway).

When I was working in pets last year before I got hurt I was doing not only pets but also paper/chem. And every single day the workers on cap 2 would f*** up EVERYTHING the top stock they would stack s*** on top of each other that shouldn't be stacked on top each other s*** just thrown up there cat food on the dog aisle in the top stock everything's just plugged to hell bags. They don't always take the plastic off and they just put it on the shelf they overstock things that can actually go out. And they plug this s*** out of everything.

They also used to put hazmats on the pallets and bring them out because they didn't want to do it which is also an ""automatic""firing. Sometimes they stock s*** in the area thats not even in the area. a few months ago I was working in the freezer which is also a usual area of mine that was originally where I started. They stock the deli stuff everywhere they blatantly plugged everything over filled a bunch of s*** and I just hate the team.

Okay so in the past year or so I have noticed a lot of improvements and everybody seems to congratulate them or tell them good job but they still do a lot of this s***. Everyone says oh they're they've gotten so much faster and there's so much better now but yet when I stock an area that they've been stocking in I still find stuff in the plastic Stocked in the wrong or the right home but they didn't take the plastic off home shit plugged all over the place. I have come to the conclusion that just because they're not as bad as they used to be and they don't do these things as frequent that just doesn't matter to me. Point is that they're still doing it they're just getting faster at doing. I've tried talking to my overnight manager and the supports but they don't do a damn thing. Or if they do they'll say oh we don't know who's doing this like bullshit yes you do. Or they say oh well just fix it. Even though it's to the point where I feel like if I just keep fixing the plugging and everything else I instigate it because I fix it..... Like they know that oh well they're just going to fix it so I'm just going to be a fuck up.

There was this black kid that was on the team who was the worst of them all he gave no shits about anything. I know it was him doing a lot of the f**k ups  because cuz I had to work with them a few times and there are things that I down stacked and he just blatantly plugged the s*** out of a bunch of stuff. And when I told people about it I'm pretty sure they didn't do anything about it because he was black and they were afraid that he would pull the black card. That's just being honest..... Not a racist....  Ever since he went to another shift I've noticed a huge difference.

I'm tired of people saying that the overnighters don't do their jobs even though I think we do it better than anybody else in the f****** store. Everybody talks s***** about each other. I'm also really done with my coworkers with everyone's f****** attitudes and the way they talk to me or to other people.


Past few years we've gone through two-store managers that are nitpicky as hell. I understand they want their store to look nice I really do but but they're just so f******. I would admit I could do a little bit of a better job zoning but I think I usually do pretty good job zoning. I heard from somebody that apparently one of the supports had to fix the lunchables even though they were already zoned. Also if you have a case out and if you lay the front ones flat you can fit more on the shelf and I think as long as you can get that full case out by doing that I don't think there should be any problem at all it's going to sell down anyway why take that extra box to the back when you don't need to.

Anyway I asked that support manager to overlook my zone and he started pointing out things. Some of those argento and great value slice packets of cheese have fallen over but they're going to anyway because it's not a full case and trying to get them to stand up is a little irritating and I don't see a point because they're just going to keep falling over. The shift after it says we don't do our jobs but they plug the s*** out of everything and if they partial they just stick it in Holes and I notice that today and I try to put in the home but it was completely full so I just put them on the bottom on top of some lunch meat that I think that looks awful to just stick it in a hole or plug it in the wrong spot.

He's like what is this what is that well the home is full and the boy needs to go to the back then I was like well it's not going to sell in the back dude I'm just going to put it back where I found it and I shoved it back in the hole and he got irritated and mad. I was like that's exactly where I was to start with is what they did I've been noticing they do that a lot he's like okay that's what they do that's not what WE do! I told him that it literally doesn't matter. It's not going to sew in the back it's going to sell out here. 

My support manager pointed out the shit that was laid flat and was saying that they won't sell that way. The customers won't buy them like that and I told them that's b******* because they do it everyday and there shouldn't be an issue with that because it gets more out what does it matter anyway in a few hours it's going to be shocked and then it fixes itself. even was trying to tell me that that never happens I told him that's b******* cuz it happens literally every day because me and my partner do that exact thing everyday and they sell fine. Me and this manager have been butting heads recently I will admit I've had a bit of an attitude but I'm just so done with everything here and there's a lot more I want to put but I'm tired of typing this 🤦🤭",21Oct2020,1

Well others have this problem too. They would prefer gaming over working. Or travelling over working. Or maybe they just work as much as they have to do to survive and then they spent the rest of their time with their family. 

But I have no interest in anything of that either.

It was a necessary breakup and I know I am certain with my decision, I don't really want to get into that. The problem is, I love her deeply and we are currently living together. I am living in a state where I have virtually no support system. My family lives in California and I am far from them. My ex is my only person here, and we have a life here that I don't necessarily want to leave. I love where we live and Im not ready to part with her as well. We have had lengthy conversations about what's to come, but we're both not completely sure what we should do. In a typical situation, the answer is always to have space and be apart to heal. Which I could do. I could move back to california and completely restart. But the pain that would bring is something I can't even imagine. I know that is probably best but just imagining packing up our apartment and leaving my ex who is my best friend seems impossible. I don't know what to do and our lease is up in 2 months.

Now I cannot go out and meet her because of the lockdown and she might also go off socials and even not pickup calls.

Something really bad has happened otherwise she rarely does this.

She said she doesn't WANT to talk about it but i have a feeling even if she wants to she CAN'T because it would be disrespectful of other people's privacy and my friend is a person of her principles. She would never ever do this.

Since she cannot tell me, I shall not go poking my nose around into matters that don't concern me. Until I find out, she or someone else tells me about it, I cannot do anything about the matter.

What I think I can do is distract her... I have my ways however a few tips on that would be appreciated as well...

So i want your advice on how to deal with the situation.

Our friendship is not ordinary, more often than not I find him really annoying and I can't stand him but at the same time I miss him when I haven't seen him in a few days. We hear the joke about being a married couple on a daily basis and all the time people are asking if we are dating. We are not, but it got complicated last summer. I threw a party, we got drunk and he ended up spending the night. 

After that, we had to decide whether or not we wanted to see if there was more than just our friendship. I truly didn't know what I felt or wanted so after a few days of hesitation from both sides, he claimed that it was just a drunk mistake. The second he said that, I felt a pain in my chest. I slowly began to realise that I had loved him for at least the past three years. Two weeks later I admitted my feelings because I wanted to be comletely honest with him and myself. He didn't really respond and went home. We didn't talk about it for a month but last week I couldn't handle the situation any longer. We talked again, I told him that I still have feelings for him but that I respect his choice. He said that we probably wouldn't last longer than two months and that he didn't want to risk our friendship. I tried to hide how much that hurt because I don't believe him. He never said that he doesn't have feelings for me, he just makes excuses why we shouldn't try it. That's okay, I don't want to be with someone who doesn't want me but I don't know how to get rid of these feelings? I accepted them, I was honest with the boy and I still feel horrible.

797,"I'm seeking advice on the best way to start a conversation about this issue with my roommate, as well as advice on what to say if my roommate doesn't want to ask this person to leave

Some background: I found an apartment earlier this year that I was planning on move into. I wouldn't have any roommates. Upon telling my sisters, who is my current roommate, about this, she begged me to consider moving in with her. Two of the things she promised me were that she would be clean and also that she wouldn't have many people over if we lived together.

We ended up moving in together. Since then, I've slowly begun to feel to feel that I'm not at all a consideration in her mind as a roommate. This plays out in not cleaning up messes, not doing chores around the apartment, hoarding dinnerware and cleaning supplies, ""borrowing"" other things and never returning them unless asked, walking around a brand new white rug with her boots on after returning from a hiking trip. To give you an idea. There are other things I would like to mention, as they also highlight the lack of consideration/respect, but they are more personal. I've had several talks with my sisters about some of the issues, but otherwise have been very patient, and have given her days to clean up her messes, throw away rotting/moldy food in the fridge, etc.

Anyway, my sister met someone from a dating app a few months ago. They started meeting up. Eventually that person would come over to our apartment every few days. At some point, every day. And... more recently I realized that this person is just living here now. Which, I found out through talking to that person. They made a comment that this is their apartment.

At no point was I ever asked if it was okay if this person moved in. I wasn't even told by my sister that this is the case or was going to happen. Again, found out through the person she's dating that that person considers this their apartment now. 

So now I find myself in an awkward and unfair position.  Unfair in that I didn't sign up to live with two other people. I only agreed to live with her. Awkward in that I feel like saying anything is going to cause tension, and I feel like that tension would last until the end of our lease.

The person she's dating is friendly and quiet. It's not that I don't like this person. But, I also don't feel comfortable that they're always around. Not only that, but this person doesn't have a job (so... always around). I have a feeling that if I ask my sister to have this person leave, I'll be told that the person doesn't have anywhere to go to as they're a part of the LGBT community, which I think will also be a reason given for why the person doesn't have a job either.

I've written out a list of my complaints, along with this particular one as well. I want to have this conversation with my sister in person, and I want the end result to be that this person moves out. I just don't know the best way to begin this conversation or what to say if she tells me no (to the person moving out). I've been overthinking it for a while. I don't want to cause tension. I don't want the point to be lost on her. I don't want the person she's dating to think it's because I have something against them.",21Oct2020,1
798,"I honestly have no-one in real life I can be truly open with about this - it's just too deep - so I'm going to post it here anonymously and see if any of you can offer me advice....

I have the privilege of attending an above-average college, where I get fine grades and genuinely enjoy my studies, even when stressed out; I have amazingly supportive parents who push me hard and care about me even more, even though we sometimes fight; I have enough acquaintances, and five *best* friends who I can really, truly depend on and see often. My life is, objectively, pretty good.

But I have literally never experienced anything romantic. I've had my first kiss, and a handful of kisses after. Done the drunken hookups, and have had many, many crushes on guys of which nothing has come. I'm watching all my friends fall in love, experience break ups, hookup with the guys they're interested in, move in with boyfriends, etc. I've literally never had sex. I'm 20! I know in the grand scheme of things, this really isn't something to complain about; that love will probably come someday, and even if it doesn't - my life is fulfilling enough without it.

But to be honest: it's really becoming overwhelming for me. I desire to explore a romantic relationship very much. I've read romance novels since I was like 13, and have always idealized romance in my private, inner world. I'm beginning to feel lonely without it, as I watch my friends receive all the things I've always hoped for. I want to kiss a boy that I'm genuinely interested in! I want to experience the attention and passion of falling in love - or even just interacting romantically with someone for whom I have feelings.

I feel like I'm getting jipped of experiencing the whole of life. And its hard not to internalize my lack of action on the romantic front. I'm overweight, but I'm not obese. I've been hitting the gym, but its a process, and I feel confident in myself anyway. I just find it hard to explain the reason I can't make any romantic connections with my weight. There are many people who aren't entirely conventionally gorgeous finding love everyday!

What do I do? I hate, hate the feeling of knowing I desire something and doing nothing to actively achieve that for myself. I'm beginning to feel that I'm just never going to be able to have romance in my life. Its scaring me, and its making it difficult for me to be present in my life. I feel like I'm waiting for this part of my life to fall into place. Does anyone else feel like this? Does it get better? I'm already 20, and I've never had sex - not for lack of wanting to. I've never even hooked up with a guy I've had a crush on. How can I actively change this situation? Anyone, someone - advice?",21Oct2020,1

I don't exactly despise it. But I dread going to class and working on assignments. In fact, if I'm honest, I just don't go to class. (lectures are online this semester so I can go watch them later if I need.)  I'm terrified of a life built on this major. 

But I'm more terrified of changing majors. I'm really lucky and I've had financial aid, so I'm not in debt. But if I change majors, I'm looking at 2-3 more years of college. I would be doing something I actually like, so I don't think the length of time would be the problem. 

The main problem is the major I would like to be: music, specifically composition. I'm worried that I'm basically giving up on getting good jobs if I switch to being a composition major. Can music majors get jobs? What kind of jobs could I get? 

I'm also so far into my major already... I know my family thinks it is ridiculous to change at this point. I'm just worried my life will stay the same forever if I stay with computer science. And my life's not terrible; I just want more. I want to wake up and want to be awake! To be excited for the possibilities of the day. Is that just naive of me? Does no one actually enjoy their job?

I work at a congrgate living facility where were provide services for individuals to help them get into housing. 

I strongly believe our lead is having an intimate relationship with a client

In the recent weeks she has been staying way over her regualry scheduled time frequently and night staff mentioned her spending time with that client specifically and was getting that vibe. At the time I told him he should tell our supervisor but begged me not to mention anything. 

Recently he noted again that she had stayed way over and finally I got fed up and asked my other coworker who works with her on the weekend if she was having some troubles at home or something I was not aware of, anything to better explain why she may be spending all this extra time at work. Turns out, she had been suspcious of the same thing. 

This morning I told night staff that our coworker was seeing the same things as we have and he dropped a bombshell that last week he saw both of them getting out of her car, which is a huge huge no no. 

I'm so torn on what to do. The chances of us all three being wrong after getting the same vibe is not likely. It is really a hard situation to navigate. I know our supervioser needs to be aware of this. I'm scared for it not being true, and also scared of it being true and how it would look on me to keep a secret like this. 

Also she is so passionate about the work we do and I woud hate to see her lose her job. Any advice would help.

815,"Hey r/Advice, I never thought I’d be writing in here. 
I like to believe I’m self-sufficient, but honestly, I’m kind of incapable of making wise and productive decisions for myself, and I just... I dunno, have no one else to talk to about this, I guess. This is going to be a bit of an infodump, and there’s a lot to address—don’t feel obligated to solve every problem. Also, if I break any rules, please let me know.

I’m a college freshman at a school out of state. I’m part of a pretty selective program within my university (1% acceptance rate) and my professors are, frankly, brilliant. The talent I’m surrounded by is terrifying, but also really inspiring and cool to watch. However, some social, internal, and situational dilemmas are causing me to fall behind in my classes, feel ostracized from the rest of the program, and fall into a cycle of poor decision-making.

For starters, at the moment, I say that I don’t identify with a sexuality label. I make the claim that I just “like who I like and I’m okay with that.” However, historically, all of my experiences, thoughts, crushes, etc. have been (with, about, on) guys. I think there’s a good chance that I’m just gay, but I have some inherent, built in stigma against that possibility. (It wouldn’t shock me, because I was publicly bullied by my first crush for being effeminate/not like other guys in like, fifth grade.) 

The other bit of exposition is that I grew up in a helicopter household. I still have Life360, and it’s checked very regularly. Before college, my parents knew where I was, who I was with, and what I was doing at all times. Thus, I’ve had a bit of a boomerang in the opposite direction since the liberation I’ve gained from moving away. I’ve bought a sex toy, utilized hookup apps—I have one set up every night this week—experimented with weed in questionable and unfamiliar circumstances, and been drunk at gatherings with strangers which have led to me kissing multiple people throughout the night.

One such time happened last week when I went home for a bit. I went up to a college campus that my best friend (J, who’s so smart, deep, and sarcastic) goes to, and hung out with her and her friends. We know each other through a summer program we did together, and we have a mutual (D—who I’m also friends with) that goes there too. The two of them are close. J and I FaceTime all the time (I don’t really have friends up here and she hangs out with hers all the time), and all of her friends besides D know me through her. J and I swap music and talk in depth about it, watch shows with each other at 3 AM, play among us together... etc.

There’s been some underlying, subtextual tension between me and D (the mutual, who’s one of the most chill and creative people I know) for a few years now. We both have seemed interested, but it also seems like we avoid talking to each other. I think we’re both avoiding causing any problems with other people (we’re both closer to J than we are to each other) and I think we both have a hunch it wouldn’t work out. 

At this gathering, I met many of J’s friends in person for the first time. Throughout the night, me and one of the boys there (who’s kind of flaming, but also has the coolest personality, we’ll call him R) were winking at each other, making testy comments at each other, and just otherwise flirting. After the main event of the party was over, some of us decided to drink, and I ended up in a pretty drunken state—not enough to not remember, but enough to not care about my decisions. As we were talking to some of J’s neighbors, R and I were getting physically closer. An elbow on the shoulder turned into a wrapped arm, then we were kinda both holding onto each other, and eventually, we were kissing. I also kissed a girl that was there platonically, because all of us were kinda at the same level and we were joking around. Then, I went inside.

I spoke with D and the group’s “mom friend” about what just happened and then asked about a vibe I’ve picked up from J for a while. It came out (while J was gone) that she has a massive thing for me, and that she isn’t comfortable with me knowing. J knows about my experiences and feelings towards guys, and I think that’s part of why she doesn’t pursue anything—besides a fear of ruining our close friendship. We also addressed whatever’s going on between me and D and laid the cards out on the table there, leading to an experimental kiss outside, some cuddling, and falling asleep together inside. It wasn’t unpleasant, but I didn’t feel much of anything. I wanted to want her so, so bad.

I feel pretty terrible all-around. I don’t know how to continue with J after knowing she wants me romantically. I’ve apologized to her about some ghosting, and also said I was genuinely sorry for focusing on everyone else at the party but her, when I was there to see her. I haven’t opened her response. D has texted me late at night twice now, and I’ve left them on delivered. I tried texting a bit with R, because when I left, I realized the kiss with him was the one I was thinking about after that night, but he’s very casual about flirtation and I’m sure he didn’t mean anything by it. I also have someone from a hookup that I’ve been kind of leading on, because I’m uncomfortable with hurting feelings, and he fell for me hard. After talking to my mom about the party situation, we had a conversation and it came out that I’m not a virgin, and now that relationship is terse too. 

Meanwhile, I’m isolating myself in my dorm room, eating minimally, sleeping through classes, and overthinking. I’m in this perpetual state of procrastination on everything—relationships, friendships, schoolwork, everything. It feels like I’m filling voids. I have a history with depression and social anxiety, and I’m very different from most of the people in my program (many of them are preppy, and that’s just not me).

817,"Hey r/Advice, I never thought I’d be writing in here. 
I like to believe I’m self-sufficient, but honestly, I’m kind of incapable of making wise and productive decisions for myself, and I just... I dunno, have no one else to talk to about this, I guess. This is going to be a bit of an infodump, and there’s a lot to address—don’t feel obligated to solve every problem. Also, if I break any rules, please let me know.

I’m a college freshman at a school out of state. I’m part of a pretty selective program within my university (1% acceptance rate) and my professors are, frankly, brilliant. The talent I’m surrounded by is terrifying, but also really inspiring and cool to watch. However, some social, internal, and situational dilemmas are causing me to fall behind in my classes, feel ostracized from the rest of the program, and fall into a cycle of poor decision-making.

For starters, at the moment, I say that I don’t identify with a sexuality label. I make the claim that I just “like who I like and I’m okay with that.” However, historically, all of my experiences, thoughts, crushes, etc. have been (with, about, on) guys. I think there’s a good chance that I’m just gay, but I have some inherent, built in stigma against that possibility. (It wouldn’t shock me, because I was publicly bullied by my first crush for being effeminate/not like other guys in like, fifth grade.) 

The other bit of exposition is that I grew up in a helicopter household. I still have Life360, and it’s checked very regularly. Before college, my parents knew where I was, who I was with, and what I was doing at all times. Thus, I’ve had a bit of a boomerang in the opposite direction since the liberation I’ve gained from moving away. I’ve bought a sex toy, have fallen into bad fetish habits, utilized hookup apps—I have one set up every night this week—experimented with weed in questionable and unfamiliar circumstances, and been drunk at gatherings with strangers which have led to me kissing multiple people throughout the night.

821,"My parents and my sister had a deal where they would jointly pay for a car every month, and then the car would eventually become my sister's. My mom made a promise. Both sides have already put a lot of money towards the car. My mom apparently also was the one originally paying for car insurance, which apparently my sister can't do because she doesn't own the title.

My mom, who is suffering from some kind of delusional disorder (believes she has chip implants in her brains, believes that people are following her everywhere, etc.), has decided that the car has been ""hacked"" and doesn't want my sister to use it anymore. She canceled the insurance and refuses to hand the title over. Also, my sister lives in Georgia, and my parents and I are in Illinois. My sister, my dad, and I all try to convince my mom to re-instate the insurance. My dad doesn't want to do any sneaky things behind my mom's back, as a general principal, in addition to that it might further my mom's general paranoia she already has towards everyone, including my sister, my dad, and I.   


Right now, the car is in Georgia, essentially rotting away. The car is worth, I don't know, at least $30,000, both side have already contributed money towards it. But, it is just sitting there, and my sister and spends a bunch of money on Ubers or arranges carpools to get to places, instead of simply using a car that she used to be able to use.

825,"I will keep this short and simple. I have worked at my current job for 5 years. I enjoy my coworkers, and the job itself. But for the last 2 years, I have been wrongfully demoted, promoted again only to be completely exploited by upper management for less pay than before (essentially under duress, the threat being “you’re replaceable”). I have watched blatant favoritism, gross incompetence in middle and lower management, structural inefficiency which fucks over everyone, and little no no fucks given about employee complaints/feedback. 

Basically, I have been bent over for far too long. I want to blow up on my boss when I quit. The amount of stress, anxiety, and fear I have experienced for the last 2 years has resulted in loss of sleep, anxiety issues, and relationship issues. I am so frustrated that I feel like I will actually scream at them when they ask me why.

I know this is a bad idea. How can I possibly explain to them why (which will probably completely blindside them, because I have been a hard worker and have retained a positive demeanor despite my feelings) without letting the anger finally vent.

so recently i started up with nicotine again (i know it's bad, please don't get angry at me for that shits hard to get over) and one of the draws is that nicotine makes me lose weight (that's one of the reasons the original eating disorder started, i didn't know nicotine had an appetite suppressant effect and i got rly skinny and then i stopped eating for fear i would get ""fat"" again even though i've always been on the lower side of the healthy weight spectrum).   
my problem is, even though i know logically i'm losing weight (i weigh myself) and that i'm technically underweight (only by a tiny tiny bit, about 2 lbs under the minimum healthy weight for my age/height) i still view myself as fat and i have to suck in my stomach if i'm in public or if i want to look in the mirror. anyone have any tips on better body image and self esteem? pls help because i know logically i'm not but my eyes don't see it that way, unfortunately

Usually, as it is now, she is dating some mysterious dude that hear antidotes of here and there. Even if I was a homewreaker, which I principly am apposed to, there doesnt seem like anything is wrong which is even more reason not to meddle. 

I’ve known I want to marry this girl for awhile. Hell to this day we talk about moving to a different country and living together and I’m always pushing her to apply to my college or ones in the area. Hell she knows and I know that her relationship won’t last through Highschool none do. 

I’ve always been straight up for better or worse when talking to girls I’ve developed feelings for, wether it be to clear the air or try something intended to be romantic. And even with this girl I’ve told her I simp for her and she’s fine with that because I don’t think she knows to what extent that’s true. Cause it’s so fucking true. She perfect for me, we share the same music, we share the same views, both have similar goals, etc. hell we both say we love each other.

So here are certain excerpts of when he talked about being just out of a relationship and was wondering this could be a red flag:

Me: (after he asked if I wanted to see him) Where do you live?

Him: In X city but following a breakup I might have something in Y city

Other exchange: 

Him: (After he invited me to his place and I told him I prefered a public place) I’m just out of a 7 years relationship so I’m not good with dating

Me: No big deal ahah I haven’t dated in months so I’m a bit rusted too, but you can tell me you’d prefer to take some time to process your breakup

Him: No stress, I missed seducing and being seduced


So these are the only times we spoke about this (in 3 days of talking) but I’m just not sure we’re on the same page.. I took a year without dating to work on myself and heal and he just broke up (from what I understand) and he wants to ""seduce""

Another aspect I’m not sure of is that he’s says I’m cute all the time but it makes me feel like it’s the most appealing about me.. I’m honestly and without bragging really above average looks wise and I hate when I feel like what I have to say doesn’t matter that much because pretty face&gt;&gt;&gt; the rest... 

He asked me for a picture of me last night before going to bed, so no makeup etc and when I sent it he said ""Okay so your beauty is natural"".. Is it normal that a guy feels the need to check if you really are pretty?

Last thing is he sent me a picture of a convo he had with his friend where he jokes because I take long to respond (I work and he’s not because of covid) but right before there’s a text where he says that he gives me 3/4 strikes because I’m cute.. I ask him about that and apparently it’s a joke because I appear to be a bit ""lady"" which I don’t really get what he meant by that except maybe because I live a pretty « adult » life.. but that he gives me 3/4 strikes because I’m cute... like he texted me first he’s the one who should have chances..

But other than that he’s cute and seems interesting and everytime someone shows interest in me I go kinda crazy and make bad decisions so I do need some advice on this one..

Today, I logged into the account on a VPN, and I got in. Now I realized what an idiot I am. My laptop is on the devices page on her account, and I'm assuming she got a notification that someone logged into her account. I started panicking that she was going to call the cops or  something.

I then signed out on both devices using 2 hands, and I thought I was safe until an her email got a new notification saying a device signed out from her account.

And one of the reasons why she's not perfect is because she just talks WAY too much. I mean as in what was supposed to be 5 min talks ends up taking more than an hour. And we have to deal with it. She just starts talking about a thing and A: keeps trying to prove her point over and over again, giving endless examples of the same situation, or B: Jump from point to point with no conclusion in sight.

But It's tiring and it honestly sucks. After a while I totally loose my interest and sometimes she starts talking about things I have no idea how to respond, so I just keep nodding. Also, there has been hundreds of times where I've lost so much time that I wish I was doing something else but I couldn't because I since I didn't want to just ignore her and make her sad, I had to stay still, listening to her. Sometimes I stop answering and kinda ignore her and start to look at my phone, but she just keeps going and going. 

It annoys me to a point where one of my main points of wanting to go live by myself is that I won't have to lister her drag the subject for so long.

Now, I... Kinda understand why she does it. She doesn't really have friends and she's divorced, so we (my family) are basically the only people she has to talk with. I get that she might feel lonely and talking probably helps her not feel that way, but... It's just too much.

We had some fights because of that, where I was sad or mad or just bored and I wasn't feeling like listening to her for hours, and these fights usually end up with her saying something like ""Okay, so you don't like talking to me"", which is not true, I just can't stand hear she talk about the same thing over and over again when I already understood her point.

845,"So almost a year ago I went on a date with this girl (we are both female btw)

She is the one that asked me to meet, the date went great. She decided to hold my hand as we were bar hopping, even kissed me goodbye. Our date lasted 6-7 hours.

She went to a different city for university and said she was focusing on studies which was fine, and we went our separate ways.

I recently matched with her again since she’s back home, and her replies are kind of dry. But even the first time we messaged last year, her replies were kind of dry/cold.

I gave her a song suggestion yesterday and told her to let me know what she thinks. Still no response. 

Do I let it go or ask to meet up? Idk, I’m only giving her the benefit of the doubt because of last time and how she is different online and in real life",21Oct2020,1

I have a charger installed at my home. 

Although I put an order in for the Y, I’ve been thinking about cancelling and paying another $100 to order the S due to the 400+ mile range and also how long it’s been  in production so I feel like it would have less quality issues than the Y.

847,"My dad had anger issues growing up.  For a long time I just remembered him yelling at me a lot over some ridiculous stuff, which hurt a lot at the time, but I figured, ""whatever, he's an asshole"" and havent thought much about it since.  And since leaving home my relationship with him has actually gotten a lot better- I think he's done some soul searching and that he regrets the way he treated me.

I've also started going to therapy, which has helped me a lot, partly because it has made me able to come to terms with some memories that I suppressed.  Some of those were times when my dad did a little *more* than just yell.  He never full-on beat me up, but occasionally hed get so mad or frustrated that he'd grab me aggressively and throw me around, sock me in the arm, or the like.  It would always just be one thing, and never left any marks or bruises, but he always had express intention of hurting me physically, to punish me for ""acting out.""  I remember one time he grabbed my knee and started squeezing it for this reason.  He ignored my cries of pain.  I dont remember what happened after.

My perspective on things is obviously kind of warped so I dont know if this technically counts as ""abuse"" or if this is normal.  I do believe my dad is sorry.  But all this stuff still happened.  I'm only just starting to dig these memories back up and I dont know what to do with them.  I do know that I'm suddenly scared to bring any future kids I might have around him.  I know that I dont want them to be treated that way.

I dont want to ignore how I'm feeling, but I dont want to just bring this up out of the blue either.  I do plan to talk to my therapist about this but I wanted to get a gauge of what exactly I experienced first.",21Oct2020,1

 when I was 20-21 about i told my mum she said that I should enjoy my life first and wait until I'm in my 30s says she doesn't think someone with brain damage and autism should have a baby she got pissed and called me dumb. 

 I  don't think she throught I was serious about it until she saw me looking at baby stuff and how happy I'd be with babies and children around me. 

I think the nail in the coffin of realising for her was when she saw me cry at shows like one born every minute and when I'd get so pissed at news stories about parents/babysitters abandoning/hurting kids i started talking more and more about it and my mum actually supports me with it now and gave me her blessings (yay).

857,"I (20F) very recently began babysitting a pair of siblings. Two boys, B (3) and M (9).

M is super easy and often helps me out with a few things, like their normal routines. We’ll get back to him though.

B is very sweet, but he is definitely testing my boundaries. Pulling my hair, attacking me (playfully, but painfully), refusing to do what I’m asking him to, throwing tempter tantrums etc etc. Now I only babysit them for like 3 hours twice a month unless it’s on the weekend which it rarely is. I don’t see the point in necessarily disciplining him? I took away his iPad last time because he was being a royal pain in the butt but that’s about it. I also brought him downstairs cause he kept ruining M’s Lego tower on purpose. That sort of thing. When he threw his tempter tantrums I basically just let him cry and push chairs around, completely ignoring him. Is that fine? I’m testing out how much I need to raise my voice with him at the moment. Any tips for when he begins getting naughty? I try to explain why I’m taking away his iPad etc.

M is as I said very easy. He does like to backseat parent though. It isn’t necessarily bad, B seems to listen to him and not mind too much. It’s when I’m trying to ignore B cause he’s obviously looking for attention that it becomes a problem. M will constantly go “no B!” cause he’ll be throwing stuff or something. I tried to say “just ignore him” but it didn’t really work.

M began spanking B while I turned my back? He wears a diaper so it doesn’t hurt but that’s like never the way? He accidentally grabbed B’s stomach too tightly too, so he began crying. I was a little lost, cuz B was crying and M was upset cause apparently B had hit him first...

Ok, so this is my first post. Sorry if I don’t do this correctly. Anyways.... I’m wondering if I’m pulling myself into too many directions. I know I’m really the only one that knows how to gauge that but I want to see if you guys/gals believe I am doing too much.

Here’s my regular schedule: * I have 5 college classes that I generally study 3-4 hour a week each.

Since what I want to do after college is software development/something techy I spend 1-2hours over the weekend learning extra things outside of my classes.

I am trying to learn Japanese because I really want a new and fresh perspective in life. Currently I’m studying Japanese for 1-2 hours on the weekend. Possibly planning to do it 1 hour every weekday. (Depending on how you guys react to my schedule)

I workout on every other weekday for about 1-2 hours

I really love drawing so I try to draw whenever I have time.

I have a dog that I have to care for. (I won’t stop that)

I clean religiously (I won’t stop that)

I try to read when I have time (I won’t stop that)

I really want to learn the piano

I don’t really have a social life but I might start trying to do things with people (after this whole COVID thing of course)

And I love video games (I might have to stop playing them so much)

*And then like every other human I have about a thousand appointments a month.

(I’m 19 about to turn 20. I do all of these things because I am constantly focused on bettering myself. I plan on constantly working all of my 20’s and I don’t really see a need for a girlfriend)

So, I [18M] made a post semi-recently asking for advice about having trouble finding the motivation to go to work, and one person suggested I look into a trade. Somewhere along me looking through trade programs and mentorship offers, I started thinking about engineering. (Specifically made a joke to a friend about how I could be an engineer, but I do drawing instead.)

It made me think about going to school for it, specifically chemical engineering, because it’s something I always thought about doing in school. Except, y’know, I fucking sucked at school and failed College-prep Chemistry sophomore year, but I always loved algebra and complex equations. I always saw it as a big puzzle. 

I asked a friend about the field because they’d recently changed majors from ChE, and they said it was really elitist and hard. I want to try it, or really any engineering job, but at the same time I’m worried if it’s really not for me and I’ll be wasting my time.

863," 

So since Monday I have a new routine. When I finish school (usually 4 or 5 pm) I go to the library and just sit there until the building closes (7 pm). The first day I was really dizzy but its gets better. I mostly do stuff for school. I also think ahead in the morning what I want to take to the library from the subjects I don't have that day. The most amazing thing is to walk out and its already dark.

You were really productive and a fine meal is waiting for you at home. You finish the plate and are a bit tired. You go to your room and grab your phone. ""I deserve this, just five minutes."" Those five minutes suddenly become a few hours and its already 10 past. Time to get ready for bed but you still have stuff to do. So you either cut sleep or you risk bad marks.

Yap. The moment I step into my house all the productivity that was there just disappears. Maybe I just have to get used to the new time schedule I made myself, because I just cant afford those ""few hours on the phone"" when I get home as I dont have 5-7 FREAKING HOURS until bedtime anymore. And maybe I really cant focus at home, as the desk in my room is a recreational one as well.

My father always told me relationships are diffent with your friends when you become an adult and people you thought were going to be in your life forever are going to drift apart, like a know it all teen I ignored him but now..now I get it and it fuckin hurts like hell. 

Anyway we have been so tight like her family became my family and vice versa, we were very close but in the past 5 years things have changed sooo drastically. Talking to her now is emotionally exhausting, she is always in crisis mode and most of the time its because of her own decisions. Hanging out with her is always drama and I feel so uncomfortable. For years for her I was the shoulder you can cry on friend, I try to give advice to the best to my knowledge, be there for her and her children but Im not getting the same from her.

I do have the tendency to bottle things up, I can admit that im emotionally distant and most of the shit I go thru I keep to myself but I trust her enough to open up about some things because she can relate but she turns it all around to make it about her her so I shut down. Her mother called me and told me that she was worried about me and that she needs someone (this was after my  friend got arrested for beating up her cheating husbands ex girlfriend) I told her mom that I love her but I have to love her from a distance for a moment and this is why....she kept coming to me for advice all for me to give it to her and she ignores it, she loves drama, and she lied to me about a large amount of money I let her borrow. Around this time I was diagnosed with severe depression and was pretty fucked up mentally. I got tired of getting calls from various people telling me that my friend is on social media threatening to kill herself and her calling me every day telling me she wants to kill herself. I felt like a selfish asshole but I was so exhausted between going thru something like depression which I did not understand and a stressful job. 

I told her that I was sorry she was going thru that but I have to distance myself for a moment for my own sanity. She claimed she understood but I dont think she did. Things havent been the same since, Ive been questioning am I a good friend or is she. She told me something back in freshman year of college that stuck with me, she called me out and said I make everything about me and yet hear she is doing the same, she has shown alot of hypocritical behavior over the years but I ignored it because I love her. She has gotten into conflicts with all of our mutual friends, I was often in the middle trying to be peacemaker. They wont even talk to her anymore.

I turned 30 in Feb and I told her what my plans were to hang out she told me she was going out to eat with someone else but I should come to her sons sleepover. That really hurt. My cousin died very young back in March and it fucked me up a bit, I held her in my arms when she was a baby and after her funeral I had a terrible migraine my friend texts and I told her what I was going thru, my guard was down and I just wanted someone to listen. She told me "" well if it makes you feel any better Im having the worst cramps"" it didnt but ok...I didnt know how to take that but I also didnt want to talk anymore either. 

Over quarantine I began to have anxiety attacks, my depression was kicking my ass to the point where I was questioning my existence. Its just been fucked up, anyway Her birthday came around she invited me to her house to go swimming, I told her I been having some really bad days but I will try, cant make any promises  all she had to say was "" I hope you ok, I need to see you I need you"" It makes me feel like what Im going thru means nothing to her. That made me not even show up, I got drunk and cried that night. I wanted to yell at her like where are you when I need you!!  I mean am I being to hard on her, its alot of guilt on my part and I cant understand why. I feel like our friendship is over and I have been in relationships where I have been deep in love and broken up with them and it didnt hurt half as much as this does. I dont know how to go forward, I tried talking to her to get her to understand but she doesnt, I dont know what to do or if Im being selfish or if I should be more open with my emotions.

I’ve been working at home on my own for the past few years and to all of a sudden have such a change of pace/full time job seems daunting. I also feel so much pressure when I think about the interview; I feel like everything is riding on it and I don’t want to get in my own way. I have been working with a therapist on social anxiety for the past year and a half, so I’m trying to go into this with a good mindset and not let my anxiety take over and freeze me up. 

The great thing is that I know I want to do this, and I’m excited to have a future in real estate. I just need to get over the short term anxiety so would love to hear how people handle that pressure and maintain their composure through interviewing and big career shifts. Thanks everyone!",21Oct2020,1
886,"title kinda explains it, but i’ll go more in depth. i recently had a landlord-tenant argument with the management of my apartment about wanting to move out and i’m having trouble trying to maintain and pay the rent, etc. but they told me i have to pay a ridiculous fee and take a hit to my credit/background check to terminate my lease, and i don’t want to oblige to their settlement so i’m just kinda stuck living there until my lease is over. 

i just recently bought a hoodie because it’s my birthday soon and i wanted to buy myself something special. my apartment complex collects mail in the lobby and you have to go to the front desk and collect your package so it doesn’t get stolen, liability reasons, etc. 

Most of the workers there reads every email they get sent, and that included my hefty emails about wanting to terminate my lease and basically calling them liars and predatory company, a lot of personal animosity i have with the management.

How do I not make it awkward to collect my package from the front desk because they know who i am and the lengthy chain of emails i send to their management team for the apartment. Should I just keep things civil and just collect my package and go? 

This seems like a really stupid thing to ask advice for but i have this irrational worry about shit like this. my anxiety usually keeps me worried for days and i ruminate on stupid situations like this. 

Any advice given is much appreciated. Thank you",21Oct2020,1
887,Hello. I’m moving out of state later in the week and I’m seeing my grandpa one last time before I leave. This will probably be the last time I see him alive. I’ve been hanging out with him a couple hours each week in his nursing home. Sometimes we sit in silence for 30 minutes out of the two hour stay. Any questions I should ask him or anything I could say? He’s been pretty miserable since going into assisted living. I’m kinda awkward/anxious when it comes to saying goodbye and stuff like that… any pointers or unique questions would be lovely. Thanks in advance.,21Oct2020,1

889,"(English is not my native language, so sorry if this isnt written great)

so during the start of october I asked my boss if I could take some days off of work in November to see some family before the christmas rush begins. (I work in a restaurant) I said a little more than one week would be fine, and told him he could decide the date if it made it easier for him to schedule. He asked if maybe 10 days would be fine, and I said that would be perfect.

Now, I got the schedule for November yesterday, and realized he gave me 5 days off. It might not be far away from the 7+ days I asked for, but since two of those days are gonna be spent travelling with busses + plane rides that only leaves 3 days. my family lives nearby each other but not in the same cities so now I have to decide on either spending half a day with each of them (there are 3 I was planning on visiting) or choosing between one of them to visit for 3 days. Spending 140$ to spend half a day with family isnt really what I had in mind when I asked for a vacation.

I'm super upset about this, as I was planning on spending some time with my sister and her kids, my grandma and my brother during this trip. I havent seen them since christmas last year, and if I dont visit before christmas, I probably wont see them until next summer. This is the first time in the 1 1/2 years ive worked at the restaurant I've asked for any sort of vacation. I might be seriously overreacting because of my dissapointment, but this is honestly kinda making me secondguess working there. 

Now that the work schedule is set, its gonna be a pain for anyone to change it. people make plans around it, and I've already been rejected by two coworkers when asking to switch shifts on the days i work before this ""vacation"". 

I kinda wanna confront my boss about this, but IDK if I might be in the wrong if I do so. I mean, although I kinda expected 10 days after he mentioned that, I did originally ask for 7 days or more, and 5 days arent that far away from it I guess. I also don't know how many days my coworkers usually take off, so I dont wanna make a scene only to find out I've gotten away with a good break...",21Oct2020,1

894,"I won't go into too much detail, but basically I've worked at this place since December 2019. Furloughed through lockdown, then came back in June when pubs opened up again. The problem was, lockdown had a massive impact on me emotionally, I had to wean off of my antidepressant that I'd been taking with no issue for three years, and start the whole trial and error process of trying out medications again. I'm now on the highest dose of Mirtazapine, 45mg, and I'm not feeling any better. So I'm now going to have to come wean off THIS one and try with another drug.

Anyway, this, among other things that happened in my personal life, lead to me calling in sick way too many times. It got to the point where I called in sick one day, and my manager got mad at me, I then panicked and said okay I'll put my notice in, which was a f-ing ridiculous thing to do and I regretted it immediately. I then spoke to my manager in person and sorted things out. 

But things feel very sour now, I feel as if I'm walking on egg shells and I don't know if its my anxiety or if its actually happening. I keep telling myself they've had worse people than me working there and didn't fire them...so maybe it will all be okay? I also missed the memo about a meeting everyone had to attend about the new Covid rules a few weeks ago, it was on the group chat but I just didn't see it until it was pointed out to me afterwards. My fault for not checking the chat, but there's so rarely anything important on there its easy to forget about. Either way I'm keeping my eyes open for new job opportunities and sending off as many applications as I can, because I don't feel secure with this job anymore. Again I don't know if this is a reasonable worry to have, or if my mind is twisting things to make me worry. Those with anxiety will get where I'm coming from. I know for a fact that I royally fucked up, there's no doubting that and I've been kicking myself ever since. 

I think my overall question is, am I right to be worried? Or do you think these are problems that can be improved with time if I just keep my head down and do extra where I can??",21Oct2020,1

It was stuff like lining up objects by shape or color, nail biting or hair pulling, depression and anxiety, somewhat obsessive in their interests, complications forming relationships (platonic and romantic), and not understanding social cues. I'm not trying to diagnose myself or anything along those lines, but it would explain a lot of things about myself that I couldn't previously understand.

900,"For me, I have no clue at 28 I’m trying to do visualizations to grow/get to where I want to be but all I see is the end... kind of.

•	⁠I know I’m going to make a lot of money, billions 😉
•	⁠I know I will travel for work
•	⁠I know I will work as a mediator of sorts.
•	⁠I thought it would be in the holistic field but none of my startups have worked with this focus.

I’m trying to get over this sense of failure and basic knowledge. I know I’m capable. I’ve come so far. I grew up in small town Christian cult in mid-America &amp;went to Jesus school. What I wanted to do as a kid is no-where-near any sort of reality 😂 But I have done startups (admittedly failed.) I’ve lived in major cities, and other countries. I have worked in nearly every field but specialized in none. I have faked it because I didn’t have a choice. Surprisingly I still produced some impressive results. Until I didn’t. My attention span is so short; most times at the end of the sentence before you get to the middle of it, totally getting the gist, however not knowing how we got there. I’m finally being treated for adhd again and am eager to dive into something, but is hard... I don’t know what I want to do and now realize this is why my startups hasn’t worked out...

Growing up, I wasn’t allowed sports or anything the kids do. Only school &amp; Christian books + the Bible was all we were allowed to read. It was very intense. But now I’m free. With out the shackles. I keep trying to go back to the spiritual path as I feel it’s my purpose. But even a shaman isn’t a shaman 24/day. Also... Am I trying to get into the holistic field due to me growing up spiritually and I feel ‘empty’ without some deity? Maybe because it’s what I wanted to do as a kid... which wasn’t healthy...

Lol anyway, I just lost my job, totally out of money and I’ve just been asked (not the first time) if I could do anything in the world what would I want to do? and I’ve never been able to answer this question so if you have any guidance whatsoever on how to figure this out I’d be most appreciative",21Oct2020,1
901,"A few months ago I, M21, found out, or better I was told in connection to a fight between my parents that I have a different father than my 2 brothers. Whenever my parents had a fight and my father became too emotional he always pulled the card of my mother having cheated on him 21 years ago. Neither wanted me to know and my father is scared I would not see him as my father no more I said AND MEANT that I don‘t want to meet my real father at the time I found out because he is and will be my one and only father. 
But ever since it happened I feel like I have distanced myself from my family a bit by bit. And currently my mother is all the time complaining how I always hang out at my best friends house. I know her since what feels like forever and she is like a sister to me and I can talk to her about, well, anything in my life but this. And the reason for that seems at least to me because any second I am „at home“ and see my parents I think about this even though I don‘t want to so I try and get away from it.
I was never the big family person but I still enjoyed time with them when we got the chance. Over the time I feel like I did want to meet my biological father but since my parents are fighting ever since the incident and the said topic is coming up more frequently and I feel like asking to meet him would destroy their marriage and I just don‘t know what I am supposed to do.
I have been suppressing all of my feelings my whole life. I never had a problem with that either which is why it did not bother me when I started to think about maybe I do want to meet him and just thought to myself: „No you don‘t you have ONE father and thats what will stay forever!!“

And at the moment for the first time in 21 years I actually cry and am sad on a regular basis. Even though I can still act through it most of my time but when it is time to sleep I break down 5/7 nights sleep very bad and have great trouble starting my day.

And I have no one to talk to about it because I feel like talking to my parents about wanting to meet him I will destroy their marriage.
And even though my parents haven‘t been the happiest couple of all time and they still like each other this topic which happened 21 years ago seems to be their „Red thread“.

After the internship ended I moved to the city where the firm was to start law school. After settling in to law school I reached out and asked if she would like to get coffee and catch up. She agreed on a time and date. But not a location. She said we can go to a place as long as there was outdoor seating and it was in a certain part of the city. I asked if there is any place that she wanted to go and she said no and left it up to me to find the place. Problem was I had only been to the area for the month and the location stated was not near me so I wasn't familiar with it. Due to COVID Google is not very accurate about what places are open, what their hours are, and the seating availability. So I had to go to any prospective location and confirmed that they were in the right area, open and had outdoor seating. It took a week to find a place because the week was extremely hectic so it was hard to get to locations during opening hours. I emailed her a few days before the meet up with the location.  She responded that she was to busy with a case to meet up so we could have a call and she asked what time I was available. I told her I understood and offered to reschedule because in my mind it wasn't urgent and I didn't want to stress her out by trying to squeeze me into her schedule. I did tell her what time I was available but in hindsight it might have read that I wanted to reschedule for the same day. I didn't get a response but didn't want to bother her about it because she expressed she was busy. I sent another email a month later asking again for coffee on a different email train and I haven't heard anything back and it has been 2 weeks.

Now fast forward to March 2020, we are having a virtual sleepover with about 5 girls (Shylie wasn’t there) and we are all spilling our guts and whatever and Bitchie decides it’s a good idea to tell us all that her and Shylie were dating and JUST BROKE IT OFF. She then proceeded to tell us about a Halloween party where they were kissing in the bathroom, and how they had only just broken up because Shylie’s parents are homophobic (they are really nice people just very Christian and old-fashioned). Bitchie told us they got back together this summer, but then Shylie’s parents found out again, and Shylie wrote a really mean text about how she never really loved her, and that she was just lonely and wanted attention. (Everybody in our friend group knows this, nobody has told Shylie and she thinks we all are oblivious and don’t know any of this). Bitchie has sworn us all to secrecy, but I feel horrible.

She didn't add a single thing to a 21 page study guide and the whole time we've been in school she hasn't added anything to anyone else's study guides, just piggybacked off of them. There's been a time where she asked me (3) times if I had made a study guide yet for one of our classes.

Today we had an exam and a study guide was sent out last week. It was in the beginning of its works and wasn't really filled out yet. Someone in my class asked me if there's a study guide. I told her no. (I lied, but at the same time there was nothing really on it. I didn't even think I would use it). A few days pass and more people in our class have access to it and it starts getting filled out. I add to it as well. The girl asks in our group chat if there is a study guide. No one replies. I still don't say anything or send it to her, but I end up sending her another quizlet that might be helpful to study. Again, I feel weird sending out someone's else's study guide.

The night before the exam I go on the google doc and see she has access which means she can see who has previously edited it. (I'm on there). I feel like a bad person for not sending it to her and lying but at the same time I don't send other people's stuff out.

Am I overreacting? Should I just give someone the guide if they ask for it, even if its not mine? Even if other people in the class have it?  What if it's someone who doesn't really reciprocate or help?

Sometimes I wonder if this is more just me caring what others think too much, but I don't know. I would appreciate some insight.",21Oct2020,1

921,"\[Apologies in advance, this is super long. As a side note, if you're going to leave your judgements about me or my wife in the comments, don't bother. We're really trying our best here and I do not put any blame on my wife for our current situation. We have tried talking to her doctor about this, which I mention at the end. I'm not looking for medical advice, I'm just looking for advice with how to cope with everything until she can see her OB/GYN.\]

My wife (28F) and I (32M) are spiraling and I just really, really have no idea how to help. I can feel her starting to resent me and our son. She's stopped holding him, changing him, or interacting with him unless she's nursing him. We've tried getting him to bottle feed the milk she pumps but it's just doesn't seem possible. We tried the special bottles and having her leave for a while and all that and eventually my wife just gets frustrated and does it herself. In a way, I am kind of glad this is happening. I have a suspicion that if she stopped nursing him, she would stop interacting with him entirely. This really scares me. We have no idea how this is going to play out when she needs to go back to work in 3 months.

All she wants to do is housework. Everything needs to be done by her or it's not good enough. I wash the dishes, she finds something wrong with them, then takes ALL the dishes from the cabinet and washes all of them. I change the sheets on the bed, she says she doesn't like this set of sheets, washes the ones I just removed, and makes the bed again. Even clothes, I fold a basket, she takes them all out and folds them again. She even does these things when she does the work. She'll fold baskets of clothes 3-4 times before putting them away. She mopped the floor last weekend 3 times in a day. She'll take 45 minutes to vacuum a single room of the house.

She's exhausting herself with these mundane tasks that have never bothered her before. I tell her to go lay down or ask her to come and watch a movie with me, but she refuses. After feeding him the other day, we had a friend come over and watch him while we went to vote and I took her out for coffee and it was a really great time because it felt like her again. Then when we got back home and it felt like she was still a bit happier than she usually is now.

It's exhausting for me too, because I don't only have to worry about the baby, I have to worry about her too. It concerns me even more now that I have to go back to work (half days/working from home twice a week) and leave her and our child alone together for at least 4 hours a day. This worries me especially because I went to the store while the baby was napping over the weekend and I was gone for maybe 1 1/2 hours. By the time I got back, both her and the baby were crying. He was inconsolable and she couldn't figure out what was wrong and got frustrated. I only made it worse when it only took me a total of 5 minutes to get him settled. The absolute look of devastation on her face when I tried to console her after getting the baby settled was heartbreaking. I was kind of hoping that forcing her to be alone with him would help her in a roundabout way, but there is no way I can do that anymore after what happened.

My first thought was to get someone to stay with them while I'm at work, but my mother has always been extremely critical of my wife even before the baby as I came from a very traditional household. Her parents live about 3 hours away and I'm sure they would come if we asked, but she doesn't want to talk to them about this. I was going to ask my SIL because she's a stay at home mom, but when we had her over the other night, my wife tried talking to her (at my request) about the problems she's having and all my wife received was judgement. I want to get a nanny or someone that can come in and help her care for the baby and teach her how to do things, but I don't know how to bring up the topic without further bringing her down.

I sat her down a week ago and brought up my concerns and tried to be as supportive as possible. She kept saying that I was judging her and I kept trying to tell her I wasn't, but she just won't listen.

I just don't know what else I can here. I feel so alone and I love them both so much,  but I'm constantly feeling like I have to choose between my wife and my kid. I was going to bring it up at her 12 week check up, but the clinic has asked to reschedule it twice now, despite us explaining it's kind of urgent. It all just feels like we're not the top priority and I understand that there are a lot of people with a lot of problems, but we have problems too and it feels unfair that we're just being brushed off.

At this point, I'm at a loss. If I try to talk to my wife, I'm being judgemental. If I look for help online, all I receive is judgment that I'm not doing enough or that my wife is a terrible mother. If I try to get her help, we're brushed off. I don't know what to do.",21Oct2020,1
922,"Okay, so lemme explain a bit of my history with this person and what led to me posting this.
About 4 months ago I met this person, and I found out about 3 months later they are a diagnosed narcissist. They have loads of trauma and I once helped them during a dissociation episode. However, they tend to be mean as hell, and all though they have their moments of kindness and fun; they're overwhelmingly rude. And today they joined a group I'm in and immediately started being rude to other people in a ""playful"" way that was truly just blatantly them being a prick. 

I've been feeling bad for disliking them however, because it's not necessarily their fault for being this way. And I feel like a dick because I'd be ""dropping someone for a mental illness they cant control"". 

So I guess I just wanna know, is it wrong for me to drop them, and should I go through with it.",21Oct2020,1
923,"Hello reddit. Thank you to whoever reads and replies. 
My issue is with my SO and how she gets very defensive about my tone with my 3 1/2 year old son. He is very inquisitive and at times can be kinda rude. He likes to talk when adults are talking and also when you are on the phone. I on many occasions have just slightly raised my voice and spoken to him in a stern tone. There are times when he just will not listen and I have yelled. I do not spank or physically discipline him at this point but do yell at times, not very often but I do. When I  give him a stern talk, my wife jumps in and says I'm being very rude and she says she doesn't like for me to yell at him. 
We have spoken before about how one of the parents is usually the disciplinarian and one is usually softer. Of course I have to be the hard one, but when I  discipline him in my way (stern voice, sometimes yell) she gets really defensive and tell me I shouldn't talk to him like that and so on. It really began to drive me up the wall when she does this as I feel as I'm giving the discipline that is missing from his development. 
How can I  move forward and get her to understand my position without her defending the rude actions of our child. Halp pleeese.",21Oct2020,1

She told me she was doing it (but didn't explcitly tell me her username or anything like that) and showed me (a dude) a non-nude picture of her in lingerie that she posted. She told me not to mention seeing the photo to her boyfriend because he would be really pissed that she showed me (he does know that she does onlyfans though and is okay with it.) I complimented the picture and told her it was cool that she was making money and that it would be cool if I could do it too, especially to earn extra money for the holidays to buy my kid nice presents. I expressed reluctance that someone I knew might see me. She said it wasn't likely and that she would help me promote if I didnit, and told me a specific subreddit to post in, which indicated to me that she had posted in that subreddit. Curious, I scrolled through the subreddit and found a picture of her and her profile, which includes nude photos. Is it wrong of me to view these photos, and should I not look at new ones in the future? I don't want to be a creep, but it kinda seemed to me like she didn't mind if I found her pictures.

930,"So I told the first person I developed feelings for at the age of 22 I had some feelings for her. I had these feelings all bottled up for some years. Lots of sexuality anxiety and confusion. I finally came out to my mother fe years back, all went well. 
I was really close to my friend for a while and I loved her, could never get her off my mind. 
She really  broke my heart when she decided to stay with a crack head over me. 
I felt like I wasn't enough. Shed tell me she doesnt keep in contact with many people as I would gt upset with her for not keeping in contact with me much. 
This was before I confessed my feelings! 
I know she contacted her nan ever day almost do if she has the capacity to talk to her nan daily, why not me? The one she claimed to love nd be so glad she had in her life.
In the end after losing her out of my life as not only a friend but potential lover, I developed an anxiety disorder.

933,"Long story short, it's a girl I've known for like 10 years and have always been good friends with, we've helped eachother out on many occasions and know we can truly trust one a other. 

She gets out of a couple year old relationship with a guy with zero motivation, plain boring, no perspective but she truly loved him and was pretty much his mother the whole time. The dude wasn't a douche, didn't cheat, didn't lie, he was just absolutely neutral on any given topic. 

They break up, she's healed and I start doing my sexual tension tricks and almost everything goes as planned. She perfectly knows I'm calm, contained, know what I'm doing with my life, and knows how happy she can be with me, I can pretty much provide anything she may need. She has seen how I behave in a relationship with my two previous girlfriends for that period of time and there's nothing to complain about my behaviour or masculine frame. Both of my previous girfriends wanted to marry me but they were problematic so I had to end it. 

One night after a few days of sexual tension, she asks me if I want a relationship with her and I dont answer, of course. I wanted to smash. Just leaned in and kissed her. Couple days of amazing sex. She was really open with me on any topic we talk about.

 A few days later she says that she can't have a relationship with me because she doesn't love-love me. And by that she means that to be in a relationship she must feel very deeply in love to be involved in such a thing, which I know is the actual case with her and I'm not putting blame on that.I'm more on the pragmatic opinion that love can be cultivated with kind gestures and consistency. 

So we have a talk about it, she tells me she cant have a relationship but still wants to be friends and I told her that can't happen. If you're truly bad at programming and/or computer science you don't go and try to get a degree just because you love it. She said she has had emotions and an attachment to me for the last month in which I was applying my magical pressure, but it's not enough for her to be in a relationship. 

I didn't even want a relationship with her but when I heard that, something in me just went boom. She was the first to ask about a relationship and without having and answer, she says she doesnt want it. 

Anyways, told her we can't be friends anymore after such a thing. I don't get how you would like to be in a bad relationship but madly in love, rather than a more than decent relationship where everything blooms naturally. Her natural instinct was to not be in a realtionship because of her understandings about love. My natural instinct is to keep my distance after such a talk. She went on to talk about our friendship and if I need distance she would understand. 

The main problem is, when I saw her way of thinking about that topic, it wasn't even about ""giving me a chance"" and it didn't matter. Problem is she isn't giving herself a chance with me, which is why something inside me snapped.I didn't show it. So I just calmly told her that we can't be friends but if I ever suddenly snap, I'll get rid of her instinct and make her feel true happiness and just left things like that. She knows I'm bold with my words and actions, so it's not anything shocking that I wouldn't normally say. 

Now I feel too strange to know what to do, I can't keep contact with her after this, even though we've actually been really good and reliable friends for a long time, so that's a friendship down the drain. But I also don't want to see her self-destruct with her way of thinking and riun her love life. She's like one of the two decent girls I know that truly deserve to be happy. She definitely knows she can be happy with me. 

What should I do?",21Oct2020,1

935,"Hi Reddit!  
I need a place where I can express both sides of the story since I know that trying to get pity IRL isn't cool of me. Within the past two months, I made a discord server for a franchise I really like since people who followed my art account online wanted a place for all of us to talk and stuff! I have never modded a discord before so this was all really new to me and I have learned a lot over the last two months. Like. A lot.

But unfortunately, this learning has come from bad mistakes, and I feel like a horrible person. I am not typically one to make huge mistakes. I have a good reputation. People trust me and feel comfortable opening up to me. One of the other admins started talking to me a lot, and I have a habit of oversharing (which I am now aware of) as does she. She vented to me a lot and I didn't realize how reliant she was on me and she said stuff like ""thank you for letting me speak to you about this"" and I thought she was just being kind but I really was the only person she was venting to. I didnt realize.   In her status, she often put things that made me concerned for her life and wellbeing. I messaged her about it and had to talk her out of suicide. She then played it like I was like... her savior and that made me uncomfortable. The next day I sent a really poorly worded message saying that I had to back away. I'm writing an apology now for wording the message badly and making it seem like I could be a close friend and stuff, but I feel like a bad person.  I encouraged this unstable friendship too much. She would do so many things for me and I just let her, I guess because I felt nice having someone do nice things for me but I didnt intentionally want to exploit her kindness. She probably feels abandoned.   


What is the right way to deal with this? I can't leave the server since I own it. I don't want to take her out of the server because of my mistakes. I want to send her this apology but I don't want to reopen any wounds but she deserves the apology.

936,"A little background on the dog first: 
I rescued a Husky-German Shepard mix from a shelter at the end of August with the hopes to train him as a therapy dog to assist with my anxiety attacks. I was fully prepared to work with a rescue dog but was originally looking for a smaller breed when the rescue suggested I meet their newest tenant. They informed me that he was about 2.5 years old and was turned in to the rescue because the family had a small child and he had too much energy for them to handle. 
While at the shelter, I saw only one other dog and was pressured to make a decision between the two of them in order to not stay beyond my 1 hour appointment. I decided to adopt him, paid the fee and was finalizing paperwork when I was informed he was actually 4 years old and had only been at the shelter a couple days (so they did not know his temper at all). Lacking confidence, I did not speak up at the time and brought the dog home with me regardless of my gut telling me something was off. 
On the way home that day, he nipped at my hand but I brushed it off as him being nervous. About two weeks later, he broke skin on my finger while trying to get trash away from him. Yesterday, he snapped at me (and missed) when I tried to bring him inside and away from a delivery person. Then later in the evening while I was cleaning his paw, he snapped and made contact with my upper lip to the point I needed to go to the ER and get stitches. 

The help I need: 
I want to first acknowledge that I am not afraid of him and I have no problem approaching him and continuing to work with him within my own home. I love animals and have spent most of my life with dogs without issue. However, I do not have confidence in him around other people and he is very selective about which other dogs he likes. He doesn't seem to be angry (doesn't latch on) nor scared (he doesn't bark before biting, just snaps). 
I'm debating asking the shelter to put him back on their website for adoption while I continue to foster him; Returning him forthright to the rescue; or pushing on with training. For the last option, what type of training would be most beneficial? I want what is best for him but don't feel that he is the best fit of dog for me. 

TLDR; I have been bit multiple times by my rescue dog (4yo; 2months with me), the latest being on my lip and I needed stitches. I love him and want what is best for him but he is not best for me. What would you do?",21Oct2020,1
937,"My mom, sister, newborn nephew and me (19m) moved to the city a month ago. Our third floor neighbor and her husband are the ones who got us the apartment because she knew my sister from work.

Now tonight a random crack head started arguing with my mom on the side walk and she pushed him to get him away. He ended up punching her in the face twice and elbowed her in the face. The 3rd floor husband saw this and ran downstairs to defend my mom. The wife was right behind him to check on my mom and see if she was okay. 

My sister was inside freaking out because she has a newborn and she knew that the husband from the 3rd floor owned a gun. I immediately panic and start recording everything, including the wife and the husband even though they were technically only there to protect my mother. But just the idea that the guy could have had a gun... idk I just started recording.

At one point the wife from the 3rd floor freaked out and told me to get my phone out of her face. I wasnt about to stop recording so I just ignored her. She then looked at my mom and said ""if you dont tell your kid to stop recording me I will smash that fucking phone."" My mom was pissed at me and told me to put the fucking phone away and kept asking me why I was being an asshole and recording our neighbors who were there trying to help her. I still ignored them.

Now at one point the husband made a hand motion while trying to get the crack head away from my mom and I honestly didnt know if it was his gun or not but it looked like it so I screamed ""he has his gun"" pretty loud. It was an immediate reaction. The cops were there and there were easily 10 bystanders and they all heard. The cops pulled their gun on the 3rd floors husband. This caused the wife to go ballistic and of course I'm still recording and just happened to turn in her direction and focused on her face. She lost her mind and started walking towards me screaming about me not recording her. My mom was apologizing to her and I'm just recording her at this point because shes acting fucking crazy. 

After it was all over and done with my mom tried apologizing to the wife and the wife said ""Sorry but in no way will we ever fucking help you people again. Not after that stupid fuck feels the need to record me after I told him multiple times not to. We were fucking helping you guys and this is how we are repaid? Never again."" I'm still recording. She screams ""I WILL FUCKING SMASH IT BOY! TEST ME."" So I told her I will smash her fucking face in if she keeps threatening me.

943,"So a little backstory. I know why I am insecure, I'm pretty self aware, but I can't stop it. 

My ex would never touch me. Our relationship started normal and sexual but towards the middle, we just stopped having sex. It was never on my part, I'm always ready. A little while after we stopped having sex often, I found out he was watching porn and looking at other girls. I never had an issue with porn because I honestly watch it too, but it was like the porn won over me. 

I'm in a different relationship now, 5 years in and it honestly started great. I didn't bring too much of my previous baggage to this new relationship but I was honest with him and let him know my past. Again, I was okay with porn and nudity and the such. Well not even 1/2 a year into our relationship we stopped having sex. Every time I would approach the subject it was always some sort of excuse. I bought it for a while but not even being together that long and not being that sexual with your partner, it was weird to me. It was too early to be burnt out. We would watch shows with nudity with no problem the beginning of the relationship. I'm bisexual so I was definitely okay with seeing some hot chicks naked until we stopped having sex. At times we'd be watching a show like game of thrones, a lot of nudity, and he would try to touch me. Now most times I'd try to initiate sex, he would reject me with an excuse. To me it seemed like he wasn't attracted to me but only would try to touch me when he saw another girl. 

I know some people are into that but I honestly felt sick and less than. Am I not good enough? Was he not attracted to me? Granted I am on the heavier side but any time I would approach the subject, he would always reassure me that he only has eyes for me, he loves me, he is attracted to me and so on. 

It got to the point that I didn't feel comfortable watching those shows with him anymore. I dont want him to look at other girls how he should look at me. I know it is selfish but I dont know if it is honestly just me and all in my head or am I right in assuming he really isn't attracted to me? If that's the case, why is he with me?? 

So we recently got married. It took 5 days after our marriage to consumate it. We recently bought a house and we are still moving stuff in but he just brought his computer over. We've been married for 11 days and we have had sex twice in that time. That is more often than normal so I was happy!!

I caught him watching porn last night and it honestly hurts. I just spoke to him 2 days prior about how the whole porn and naked girl situation makes me feel and he goes and watches porn so soon? 

Before I found out he was watching vr porn and that one hit hard. He is literally imagining himself having sex with another girl. After I had confronted him about it and explained why I wasn't okay with it, he promised not to watch it again but yeah.. he did again. 


Am I crazy for not being okay with him seeing other girls naked? Am I justified for feeling that way considering what has happened? How do I change my feelings? I don't want to be overbearing but at the same time I dont want to be a fool and think this is normal if it isn't.",21Oct2020,1

953,"This is the third post in the ""canon"" that is my advice posts, from reading all three posts ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ik7xof/im_13_i_dont_go_to_school_i_have_no_friends_and_a/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/iz8857/all_my_joy_is_gone_i_have_nothing_left_i_cannot/).) You should have a pretty decent understanding on how I feel and the metaphorical hole I am trapped in. As the title suggests, this post will be a bit different to my first 2 posts here, this post will contain some of the newer updates of my situation, along with some newer issues I have ran into. as implied at the beginning of this paragraph, you should read the first 2 posts I linked, or you will have no idea what I am talking about, so without further rambling, here we go.

So, as I outlined in my last 2 posts, I don't go to school, I rarely go outside, and I have no real life friends, along with abusive parents to top it all off, I am in a bit of a bad situation, but I have some updates and new issues I need some advice on, lets start off with the recent changes in my situation first. So I recently had my birthday, I turned 14 years old, but not much has changed, I still feel awful, just with slightly more material items. I also recently have taken an interest in the religion of ""Hinduism"" (this will be important later), I unfortunately no longer speak too the old friend I spoke to in my last posts, I have made some new friends online, but this has not made that much of a positive impact on my life as you may have thought when reading at first, I constantly fear for them, and I even question if they like me or not. Needless to say, my life has barely improved since I wrote the last 2 posts.

Now that we have spoken on my general changes in life, lets get to the details. This paragraph will be about my new friends, so, as I said in the paragraph above, I no longer speak to the friend mentioned in the previous posts, so I have put together a new ""friend group"". The only problem is, I don't think I am very liked, I believe I am viewed as ""annoying"" or just a general scumbag, why you may ask? Well, long story, basically I got invited to a Discord chat with my friend group, things went on as normal, until people saw my face, then I got bombarded with comments on how I should ""cut my hair"" and do loads of other crazy stuff, such as condition my skin and do things like that, I didn't want to, until I got into a massive argument over a small piece of advice, it basically just became chaos, I don't know why people were so interested in making me look better, I did not want to condition myself, as that would increase my ego, which is bad, but they said feeling good about my appearance was a ""good thing"",  I disagreed, I was asked if I was suicidal, and using my quick and awful judgement, in the heat of the moment, I replied ""I wish."" This must have hit a nerve and dug up some past trauma, because one of my friends seemed to really take that to heart, and I am truly not a good man for saying that. I later felt really awful for what I said, Eventually they gave up, knowing that I would refuse to take their advice. Admittedly, I felt really bad after that, I basically dismissed the only people trying to help me, they had good intentions after all, and basically I knew why the got angry, and it was justified why they got angry. I prayed and gave offerings to my idol of Lord Ganesh, I felt better after that, and I decided to say I would take their advice, because at the time, I thought I could, all I wanted was to make them happy, and to take away their anger, so I said I would, but then I realised I could not do all of this, I have no desire to cut my hair, although I agreed to comb it, I also had no desire of throwing chemicals in my face to increase my ego about my appearance, anyway, it's not like I go outside anyway, I have not spoken to anyone around my age irl in basically 3 years, I cannot leave the house and talk to anyone due to my abusive parents, what would even be the point? But so make them feel better, I decided to go along with it, and I still plan on increasing my hygiene anyway, it's the least I can do. Fast forward to the next day, I got a message from a user I did not know, saying one word, ""warning"", with screenshots of a lot of people in the group making fun of me and mocking me after I said I read the mentions of me in the server logs. This was not the first time this has happened, either, but the last time was a false alarm, and less severe, these messages were the nail in the coffin for me, one of the messages involved the fact that one of my best friends left, and that one of them was going to clown on me by pretending to be her. When I heard the news that one of my only friends, one of the ones I truly looked up too and really value, left, it hit me, I completely lost everything, I know it sounds pathetic that something as small as someone leaving a server sound would lead me to a crisis, but you need to understand, this really is my only joy in life, I have nothing besides a few online friends, from the moment I wake up, to the moment I go to bed, I think about them, they are my everything. Anyways, this moment I heard the news that she left, I cried at the feet of my statue of Lord Ganesh, asking for mercy, asking for happiness, but it never came, I soon after collapsed, knowing that the last reason to live had gone away, just like that, I begged at the feet of Lord Ganesh, ""why is this happening?"" I asked. Pretty pathetic of me, huh? No wonder no one likes me, I would avoid myself if I was not myself. Then, later, she returned, I calmed down and kept a low profile, but I also heard one of my friends making a joke about suicide, who also happened to be the same one that didn't like my suicide comment I mentioned earlier, I, did not feel comfortable after hearing this joke, it is self-explanatory why, but I am no person to police speech, so I decided to ignore it, I know that I am very liked as a ""friend"", as I originally thought, I don't blame them, either. I have an annoying personality, I moan and vent too much, i'm a pushover, who leaves groups when my feelings are hurt and i'm just in general not a ""likeable figure"". One person in particular, I am especially sad over, I always thought what a good friend she was, and I genuinely looked up to her, even me, writing this, only feels like I will prove further, that I am not very liked, because it sounds like this is full of self pity rants, and I am trying to make people feel bad for me, but trust me, this is really not the case. It just feels so bad, knowing that after loosing one of your only friends, you make a new one, only to realise that they don't really like you either.  Online friends, really are the only thing worth anything in my life, I have lost everything besides that, they are the only thing thing making me have the motivation to get out of bed in the morning, from the moment I wake up, to the moment I sleep, I am always thinking of them, I don't have much of a life, but I would say my life revolves around my online friends, the only reason why I didn't leave the server after she left was because I didn't want to look even more pathetic than I already was.

Now lets talk about my psychological/metaphorical mask I put on when talking sometimes, before everything in the paragraph above went down, I started acting out of character, you see, I have these ""moodswings"", where I act very affectionate towards my friends, the reason for this I am sure comes from my parents and lifestyle, because I have no real friends, and my parents rarely show affection, I tend to channel the bottled up compliments and affection into the only people I can - my friends. I get in a very annoying clingy mood, but at the time, somehow, I was completely unaware that I was being annoying, somehow, but since then I have learned my lesson, and I will try to no longer have these ""emotional outbursts"".

This concludes the third edition to my advice posts, if you have read all of them, you have a pretty good image of my problem, Does anyone have any ideas on how I can get out of this massive situation that took 3 posts to describe it fully, any ideas or advice?",21Oct2020,1
954,"So I live on a college campus, and we have whiteboards outside of our rooms. As this is a fairly liberal campus, most of the boards, at least on my floor read 'Black Lives Matter'. Though, my side of the building dont have many. 

I recently wrote BLM on our board because I was inspired by the others who did. However, the 'black' has been erased 3 times now in the past 2 days. The first time it happened I wrote it off as a dumb joke or an accident, thinking a backpack hit it or whatever. But after the 3rd time, I let my RAs know about it, mainly to keep them informed about it, in case this somehow escalates. 

I asked my roommates to keep an eye out and let me know anything, and told them that I told our RAs. Their immediate reaction was ""what do you think they're going to do about it"" and ""its just a petty way for them to annoy us, it's not a big enough deal to let you get upset about"".

Now, I'm white but this repeated action is making me feel pretty unsafe. Its not my value being diminished with this action, but I just really don't think it's okay. A hateful action is still hateful, no matter how small it is. If I wrote 'LGBTQ Lives Matter' and it got erased, I'd still be upset because I'm Bi. 

I'm just wondering if maybe I'm overreacting to this. The room across from us wrote BLM on their board as well, and it hasn't been touched, so I don't know how to feel. I know my friends/roommates aren't quite as left as I am, but I don't know how to interpret their lack of a reaction.",21Oct2020,1

961,"Hello all,

My beautiful grandfather was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer last year. He has trouble with comprehension and memory and recent MRI scans revealed growing masses in his brain. We love our grandpa very much and when he was first diagnosed last year, my dad knew that he was an avid music listener and being into records himself, immediately went out to buy my grandfather a pair of expensive speakers. In this past year, I ***know*** that these speakers have been giving my grandfather a lot of joy and comfort. Every evening, my grandfather would set aside time after dinner to listen to music and whenever our family would FaceTime him, he would always drown out our conversation with music.

Unfortunately, unbeknownst to us, during the midst of this current pandemic, my grandfather began trading his stereo equipment, in pursuit of a better listening experience. He would invite a stranger to come in person to his house to trade and my grandmother was complicit in letting them do this. When we visited my grandparents for the first time, I caught wind of this and begged him to stop. I told my grandfather that he is elderly, sick, and therefore the most vulnerable to COVID and that during the pandemic, he should not be contacting people, especially strangers. He was adamant that they followed the proper safety protocols – wearing masks etc – and waved me off. I asked him about his new equipment and was stunned to hear how he had traded a couple pieces of equipment for $1000 speaker cables, or some other outlandish trade. I told my dad that I was afraid that in addition to endangering himself and my grandmother, my grandfather was being taken advantage of. My dad shrugged it off, saying that he was sure they were being safe and that expensive equipment (even just speaker cables) was not uncommon. In hindsight, I should have been more persistent in telling my grandfather stop because my grandfather did not heed my warning and continued trading, eventually getting scammed into trading away the crown jewel of his audio equipment, the stereos my dad bought him.

When we visited, I was so shocked to hear how poorly the system sounded and even more shocked to find that he had traded away the speakers. I asked my grandfather why he did that, and he said the guy who he was trading with suggested these speakers and that my grandfather tested the speakers by listening to a recording of the speakers on YouTube. Yes, my grandfather listened to his iPhone to “***test***” the speakers. When the man told him that these speakers were a direct upgrade to his current speakers and would require him to trade in more items, my grandfather did not even consult the internet or my father and took the man at his word. I relayed this back to my parents and at this point, my dad realized we had made a mistake in letting him trade. We staged a family intervention, telling my grandparents to not let any strangers into the house until the pandemic was over. We are also looking to move my grandparents in with us (we have been self-isolating since the pandemic and my parents work from home) so that we can keep a closer eye on them.

Internally, my grandfather realized he was scammed and recently, he asked me if I could help him make the system sound better. He is too stubborn to admit that he was scammed but is distressed to hear how with every trade, his system got worse and worse. Is there anything I can do in terms of legal action? My parents think it is a lost cause and that the guy that he traded his stereos to would probably say that he already sold the equipment etc. I am so angry knowing that someone took advantage of my grandfather, knowing full well that he is not all mentally there. I just want to make my grandfather comfortable for the remainder of his time and want to do everything in my power to protect him.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe during this pandemic. If you need more details, please let me know.",21Oct2020,1
962,"I need some advice for healing after my first real heartbreak.

Growing up, I was completely sheltered so I didn’t get to explore relationships or romance much, and I feel like this has hindered my development quite a bit. Due to this, I don’t know how to deal with this. A few months back, I had my first serious “relationship” with a guy that I connected well to. 

Things progressed super fast, but after a stressful pregnancy scare and workload with college, he told me that he couldn’t do it anymore due to stress. I feel like it was my fault for why things ended, and I beat myself up for it so much. I feel like if I would have just done things a little differently, then we would still be together. I should note that maybe the reason why I got so attached is because I lost my virginity to him, and afterwards, things ended fast. I was so devastated after things ended, but we kept each others numbers. I know that I need to get myself together and probably just move on, but I find myself still crying about it and thinking about him a month later. I know I shouldn’t have, but I reached out to him a few days ago just to see what’s up, and we texted back and forth a little bit but that’s it. I feel like he’s not interested anymore, but idk why I tried to reach out. 
I realized that I have almost started to grow this unhealthy dependency towards him, and I don’t like it one bit. I still find myself looking for hope that we could have a relationship again, but I know that I shouldn’t. He was just a really amazing and unique guy, and I feel like I’ve missed out on a lifetime opportunity. How do I get pass these feelings? I don’t want to be the irl equivalent of the clown makeup meme. 

Also, is it okay to text him every so often to see what’s up? (Like maybe once a month or so, and if he doesn’t reciprocate then I’ll back off permanently) I want to stay friends but I don’t want to over cross boundaries, or seem weird.",21Oct2020,1

I was wrong and I'm really sorry. I hope you've been alright.""

i don’t have any friends, and it really bothers me that i’m too socially anxious and inept to make any. i see my classmates going to festivals, partying, or just enjoying simpler things such as shopping trips, and i get so jealous. i wish i was normal and wasn’t such an outcast. even online, i can’t fit into any groups. i used to think that even if i was a loner in real life, i’d have a chance to meet people with the same interests as me by joining communities online, but i really can’t seem to make a bond with anyone.

i’m just so tired of feeling envy and hatred towards people everyday because they have something that i don’t. truly, i don’t want to be this bitter. i know i sound like an angsty teen, and, yeah, you’re right, but i want to know why i’m so different, and why i’m going to look back at what are supposed to be the best years of anyone’s life and realise that i spent it wasting away in my bedroom. is there any point of trying to savour what is left of it?",21Oct2020,1
969,"My roommate hasn't been living here and just bounces back and forth from his girlfriend's to here. He's on leases with both places and has been struggling the whole time trying to pay both. Last month I found out that he hadn't paid anything for the last 6 months and has been coming up with all sorts of excuses and lies to cover his ass.

I got on his case about it once I found out and his first excuse was the records are wrong. I got a print out of the records and the only name that appears from May until now is mine. Over the past month and a half, I have been doing everything I can to exonerate myself from the debt and put it on him. His mother is even on my side with this and I also had the bishop of my church speaking on my behalf.

We have been friends for 15 years and for him to put me in this position was completely uncalled for. I've been homeless before and I never want to be again. The management is on my side as well after the bishop spoke to them and are planning to work with me with a downgrade to a studio apartment. My oldest sister is going to help me financially so I can keep my place until the lease is up. My roommate has absolutely no knowledge of what I have put in motion.

Here is the problem. Today, after I got all my affairs in order, he decides to move back. He comes in with this sob story of how he told his girlfriend that he was going to come back here for a few days and deal with the situation and she pulled a hissy fit about him abandoning her. So he shows up with some of his stuff and I don't even say anything to him. I gave him the complete silent treatment. I don't care about his excuses anymore and I want him to sign off the lease.

My gf was crying her eyes out obviously at this point. Her mom continued to say I get joy out of hurting her, (which I don’t) that’s why I’m getting help because I do hurt her. Her mom threghtned to come to my house and kill me, go kill my father and said that she will go to jail she dosnt care. Then the father came in.... he said “I will kill this mother fucking scum bag if you don’t stop talking to him, I can kill a person with one hand” then he said “I’ll give this mother fucker a chance to prove him self but you can’t talk to him for at least 6 weeks” then he said how he wanted her to text me in front of him telling her that we’re done. I’m not scared of him doing anything but I’m scared that they are going to hurt her physically and or mentally even more. I’m scared there going to convince her that I don’t love her when I do or I wouldn’t even be here. There’s obviously a lot more to this story so feel free to ask. Her mom started crying to quilt trip her.. What do I do? Lay low and wait for her to message me and see what happens? I think months from now I will be able to win her parents back if I change. But when her mom was sitting there calling me abusive, controlling and Manipulative all I could think was “you’re describing your self”. I’m not calling the police, because then for sure I will not get to win them back. Plus they will know I was on the call and get mad at her. (I don’t have proof anyways I didn’t record it and I should of) 

now it’s been about 5 hours and I haven’t heard on work from her, maybe her mom took her phone? She’s done it before.. her mom pays for it. 

I’m overthinking at this point but could this possibly be a setup? She planned on her mom coming in saying theses things? I had a 9 hour convo with her hours before this and gave her 5 chances to just leave, I told her it would be as painless as possible, I won’t harass her or anything. She said no all 5 times. So if she wanted to leave she would of, idk though. As you can tell I’m kinda just going crazy right now!",21Oct2020,1
979,"So I’m 26, never went to college. But got hired at a 6 figure job as a Mortgage Loan Originator. They are spending two and a half weeks preparing us to take the national SAFE exam to become a licensed. 
Some might not think MLOs don’t make that much but I have two friends who do this and both make well over that. 

The entire learning program if via Zoom with a class of over 100. The test has a 55% passing rate. It’s very scenario based and hard as hell. I’m on day three of training and I’m only comprehending about half the material. Not that I can’t understand it, it’s just SO much information to retain plus I have ADD so if I close focus for a second I miss a crucial piece of information l that makes the next 5 mins of training confusing. 

Luckily, the trainer has recorded all the lessons she does live for us so we can go back and watch them again.

My entire well being being depends on passing this exam. I lost my job 3 months ago due to covid and finally got lucky and got the job I’ve wanted for years but I’m out of money completely. 

If I fail the test, they will have to let me go. 

I’ve never been this stressed and overwhelmed in my life and I feel so burnt out already.

And college students or anyone who holds professional licenses have any advice on how to approach this and retain all this information without getting burnt out?",21Oct2020,1

Ive had a couple of girlfriends and shit like that but that shit ended fast. I just dont know what to do with my life, im not motivated to do school, the most im motivated to do is write music, and put my thoughts on a paper.

983,"Hey! So I’m 19, male and from small town Wisconsin. For a variety of very stupid personal reasons, I ended up not attending most of my senior year of high school and ended up being unenrolled. Today I finally completed enough at home work for my former high school and earned my diploma! So now naturally with be being a (former?) dropout, community colleges are the one option I really have for any form of higher education. So I have a handful of questions.


Is it true that regardless of my academic performance in high school that I’ll be able to apply and most likely be accepted into majority of community/tech schools?

What fields would you suggest looking into and being the most valuable if I’m looking to relocate to a large city (NYC, LA, Nashville, Chicago, Boston, Dallas, Seattle etc) after graduating and getting a year or two of experience? 
(Side note: I tend to do just fine in any science, history/civics or english class but struggle heavily in Mathematics, what fields should I avoid due to that?)

Would applying to start during second semester this year put me in an awkward or hard to adjust to start compared to beginning my higher education in September of next year?


Thank you! Literally any and all advice is appreciated.",21Oct2020,1

986,"Hiya so I’ve (23M) been chatting with my girlfriend and her brother and talking about Christmas presents. And I said that I was planning something special and personal (which I am) but not like overly expensive. But then her brother comes in with the “right let’s get a nice new sound system for your car, it’s worth a grand”. I have nothing against nice Christmas presents or anything like that for others but it did make me feel very insecure that I am somehow not putting enough effort in financially for Christmas.
Admittedly I do have a dog and other ongoing expenses which restrict me from absolutely overflowing with funds but I do try to make my best effort to give meaningful and thoughtful gifts, but this time round I feel so insecure about it. This has nothing to do with my girlfriend personally or her brother it’s just I’m feeling very insecure about it. Any advice to conquer this?",21Oct2020,1
987,"I (F15) have the opportunity to go to school physically during this pandemic. The school takes major precautions to ensure our safety, but I believe I am a liability to the environment.  I am completely unvaccinated, aside from the necessary at-birth ones. In the past, I have gotten chickenpox and many other contagious illnesses. I have an un-needed medical exemption to mask-wearing as well as vaccines. The exemption is essentially my mother claiming, ""NO MASK/SHOT it's for religious reasons.""

I  live in the state of California, and I'm aware SB277 applies to Cali's residents. I don't know if this is true, but my mother says this law doesn't apply to me because I have an IEP.

I want to know if this is okay for me to do or what I should do to ensure my peer's safety.",21Oct2020,1
988,"Hey guys!
I’m a 17F 
I weigh 60KGs at a height of 5’1FT

I’ve been going to the gym since I was 14 and I’ve been dieting since the 8th grade. 
I’ve lost 12, kgs in a year and then gained it all back the next year. 

My body weight shifts way too much, I gain and lose weight too fast and this is so demotivating.

I’m so tired of this. And I know I can’t use I’m so young as an excuse because I want to reach my ideal body for my satisfaction. But sometimes it jut gets so upsetting knowing that people my age don’t workout and eat whatever they want without having to think again. 

I hate having to be careful about what I do because I wanna stay fit. 

I really know body positivity is important but I can’t seem to feel positive about my body. 

I’ve scaled from 53-62 these past 4 years so many times, each 6 months I look different.

It’s becoming so upsetting and I just wanna stay healthy. Corona made me become fitter and then unfit again and it’s just idk what to do anymore.

I really don’t wanna give up but I can’t seem to get there. It feels so useless and I hate it.",21Oct2020,1

It will be obvious I’m not going to work. 

So what should I tell them (besides the truth)? Should I tell them I’m doing volunteer work tomorrow? Should I tell them I’m going to have time to myself.

990,"I’ve always been one to self sabotage; Especially when it was an extremely great moment, thing or person I had in my life. 

Recently, the perfect partner (perfect for me) came into my life and managed to teach me how to feel emotions and create my own meaning of love. 
Considering how unexpected receiving this good thing was, I’ve been highly suspicious of their intentions. 
After several instances where they proved themselves with no fuss, I managed to enjoy this to a point where I began to think of all the horrible things and decided to bring an end this it. 

They convinced me to stay the first time but when I tried it again 4 months later, it was sour and after a constant back and forth, they managed to choose to stay with me under one condition...I don’t hurt them in ways that reached the same magnitude of today again. 

This seems simple. But it’s complex 

By now you’ve already realised that I am toxic and 100% accept the hate I shall receive. But in all honesty, I don’t want to lose them again and need help with stopping myself from self sabotaging my last chance.",21Oct2020,1
991,"93M, difficulty w self care (bilateral rotator cuff), weak heart so stairs are almost impossible for him. Hates being dependent on anyone. Purple Heart USMC infantry WW2 Okinawa invasion, everybody loves him, his nurses all dote on him. Cute old guy, super friendly. He had CHF from renal failure but LAsix helped a LOT, he's not swelling anymore. He went in the hospital asking for euthanasia (they refused his request) and now is being sent home w Hospice referral because he is going to refuse all meds, he just wants to go.

However, since the Lasix worked so well, he is feeling so much brighter, wants to see Trump re-elected, and is looking forward to having a house full of children and grand and great grand children.

First question: What strategies work to maintain momentum in a case like this ?

Is it wise to say to to hell with the lockdown and let the kids climb all over him and let him enjoy them? That's what he wants but the family is reluctant, no body wants to be the one who carried the virus to him- but he wants to go anyway

Second question - so what can we say to the family members who (even though they know he wants to see them and doesn't care if he gets sick as long as he can live life while he has it ) are reluctant to visit?

third question: what questions should I be asking/ what issues am I not seeing ? What would you all do in a case like this?",21Oct2020,1

I have been considering dorming at my college because I really want to make friends (all of my high school friends besides one are away right now). It looks like a lot of people in the dorms are making friends. I also have no motivation to do my work at home (which isn't normal for me), and I feel like if I was in an academic setting I would have more motivation. Also, my home life has a lot of ups and downs, so I'd like to get away for a while. I'm going to a state school, and I'm getting scholarships and financial aid, but I still don't want to waste my money on dorming if it would be a bad idea (I wouldn't dorm for all four years though btw). Also, I will only dorm if COVID cases improve (through they aren't bad in my state or region at all). Should I dorm next semester?

999,"[19M, USA]   So, I'm in a situation where I think it's time to try mental health therapy, and to do that I first need to find out my health insurance information. I know absolutely nothing about health insurance and if I even have it. 

I am currently living with my father, who has been the sort of parent to ""do everything for me"" without explaining or helping me understand so I'm not prepared for life and legalities and formalities. I can't just simply ask him what health insurance we have and I can't go to him for help with the therapy stuff, mostly because he's VERY against the notion that mental health as a concept even exists and if I told him I wanted to take therapy then he'd be pissed and try to get me to to fix everything myself and he'd make the problems worse.

Because of this, I decided to call up a local therapy center place thing and set up an appointment to discuss finances and all that for enrolling in therapy, and they're going to ask about health insurance and I have none of that information. Is there any way at all for me to find out:

&gt;If I have health insurance
