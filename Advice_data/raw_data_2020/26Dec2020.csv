0,"We have known each other for years.. ever since sophomore year of high school. I have grown really strong and intense feelings for her, but she has a fiancé now. She didn’t when I met her. She told me a few months ago, that had I told her sooner, she would have loved to go out with me. She told me she just wants to be faithful to him. Though things seem to be pretty rocky between her and her fiancé at the moment. I don’t know what to do. I’ve told her how I felt and I don’t know what other to approach to take. A few months ago I was actually with someone else who couldn’t get pregnant. So she asked me to look for someone to carry. Of course you know who I asked. She was in awe and told me she would’ve loved to carry for us as long as it was ok with her man. I wish she knew the full extent of how I feel about her.. what she truly means to me. She was there when no one else was. I always get picked on because I had an IEP and also because my eyes move on their own. She was one of 2 people who welcomed me to the school with open arms. I asked her to the prom junior year and she said yes! I don’t know where to go from here though.. what do I do?",26Dec2020,1
1,"So last year I(30 m) had a health scare that made me come to terms with my own mortality, which has caused me a lot of health anxiety. And through this pandemic, that anxiety has now broadened to include my parents who are both high risk. That, coupled with the fact that my 21 year old brother lives with them and works in a place that doesn't take the virus seriously has me constantly on edge.

I cant go a day without running these scenarios through my head and its causing me a lot of stress.  My therapist is okay, but she hasn't really been able to help me stop having these thoughts.

I know that eventually I will lose them, but I dont want to spend every minute leading up to that point worrying about it. Has anyone else dealt with similar fears? And how did you work through them?",26Dec2020,1
2,"My (22f) sister will screw people over, including me, to please other people, especially my brother- yet talk about him behind his back. She's also a compulsive liar, so if I call her out on it she'll just lie. She gets jealous over dumb things, even if she has something better. She also makes everything about herself if someone talks about something. No surprise she doesnt have any friends.",26Dec2020,1
3,"I had discussed doing a zoom call with my family for several days now. My mom had confirmed they would be available all day and would be up to do it whenever. When time comes around for the zoom call to happen, they disappear. I ask my mom if everything is okay, and eventually she texts me that they were busy online and trimming the cats fur (???) so they can't do a zoom call anymore. Not my dad, mom, or sister cared enough to get on a zoom call with me on Christmas. But going to church inside for Christmas in the middle of a pandemic? They have time for that.

And this isn't the first time they've done something like this. It's pretty often. Tried to call them on my birthday and that was a fail too. I have been trying to get closer with my family, or at least my mom, for a while now but they just don't give a fuck I guess.

I want to confront them. But I'm not sure what to say. I don't care about changing their mind, I just want them to know how much they've hurt me and how much I wish I had a family that cared about me like other people do. Obviously a lot of it will have to come from me but I need advice on how to approach it or like a jumping off point.",26Dec2020,1

6,"So I (17m) have been having most of my classes with this girl (18f) that I have liked for over three years now. I sometimes talk to her in class, but it’s always about some school stuff and I am unsure if she likes me back, but that is not even the biggest hesitation. The main reason why I never made a move is because I have almost all of my classes with her and if I were to somehow get into a relationship, we would see eachother way too often. So I thought that maybe if I waited until the end of the year (I’m in my final year) things would go better.

11,"TW: S*lf H*rm, S*icide, Anorexia + Calorie Counting



Before our relationship, my partner used to be very depressed and therefore would s*lf harm, they used to see their body as disgusting and fat. They were involved in a cult-like group chat, exchanging images of s*lf h*rm - with one main older male member who would encourage the others (incl. My partner) to go deeper and eat 350 calories a week, etc.

Eventually his (the male member) account was deleted and my partner had no contact with him.

Not long ago, my partner received a package in the mail with a fatal pill. Attached was a note from this man describing how the pill was ""good for them"" and would ""end the pain"", etc.

This caused a mental relapse for my partner and it took a while for me to be able to take this pill and dispose of it, even if it wasn't lethal it could have had anything in it.

Anyways, now he's made a new account and is contacting my partner again - who I've managed to convince to tell him they want to recover and not harm themselves anymore.

I want my partner to block him, but they say he can always find them again - even in person. I said if he contacts them after being blocked again then I will go to the police no matter how they feel about it.

Am I doing the right thing, is there anything else I should do or keep on mind?",26Dec2020,1

14,"I live with my dad whose been supporting me for my entire life. I haven’t been the best daughter the entire time but I do what he asks when it comes to school. I’ll admit I don’t clean like I should or help that much around the house. Reflecting back on how I act doesn’t make me proud. I’m owning up to not being as helpful as I should be.

I recently began dating this guy and we’ve only been together for 3 months. He made it known he wanted to be a father some day and I also wanted a baby. I wasn’t thinking and I’m not now either but I agreed to try. Two months pass without anything happening and the third month I receive a positive. I’m happy because I was thinking there was something wrong with me or I couldn’t get pregnant. I’m also happy at
the thought of having a baby.

I’m an unemployed college student totally reliant on her dad for support. What I’ve done isn’t ideal. It’s what parents warn you against and tell you not to do. I knew early on I couldn’t tell my dad because he’d either kick me out or demand I have an abortion. Which at this point maybe I should accept the consequences of my actions. 

To many this is a mistake and yeah I got impatient wanting a baby so I jumped the gun. And I haven’t done a great job at hiding it as my pregnancy tests are not well hidden. At least the instructions aren’t. My dad hasn’t outright said anything but he was in my room because I come home to his “gift” which is $20. Idk maybe I’m being paranoid but then I see the instructions to the pregnancy test right underneath my calculator. Can’t remember how it got there but he’d have to have seen it when putting the money on my computer.

The stress is getting to me I just want to come clean because right now I hate this grey area of not knowing what’s going to happen or waiting for the ball to drop. I tried giving him a chance to say something when I knocked on his door but he didn’t also $20 is the amount of money I paid for my doctor’s appointment confirming I’m pregnant.

I stopped going to class bc I was scared of men, and I stopped taking my antidepressants. My grades suffered so bad and I didn’t join any extra curricular activities. I was able to get out of academic probation due to online school, and started taking my meds again but I’m in my last year now and I just feel like I woke up again.

20,"My mother always was a bit difficult to deal with, but she's ok overall. She can even be really nice - except when my sister is around. Then she's absolutely horrible. My sister is incredibly entitled and it's either her way or no way. I have no problem standing up to her, but my mother never does. When she is around my mother always tells the rest of the family that we're such bad people for not accommodating my sister and her ill-behaved children (pretty sure one of them is developing a mental illness as he keeps banging his head against things once something doesn't work the way he wants it to work...which is sad to see, but what do I know?). 

Anyway, I'm really not sure what to do. My mother even is aware of it, but still invites us all at the same time (we live several hours away, so we need to stay overnight), claiming that things are better now and that my sister is more laid-back now. And I've reached a point where I decided that I won't visit anymore if my sister is here. Sadly, she visits quite frequently, so I suppose this was my last Christmas/New Year with my family. 

When we're alone, my mother is quite easy-going for the most part. 
I don't want to cut her off, but I'm contemplating it. It quite hurts to see how she treats my brother and dad too, so it's not just me. My brother is extremely annoyed too, our dad... he's too good of a person to say anything. 

I told my mother before (And so did my aunt and probably many other family members too), and she is aware of it, but she doesn't change a thing. 

So, any advice?

This was very disrespectful but I held it in for a week until I confronted him about it. He started to tickle me as a way to make me laugh and forget about it but I struck him back in the sack. I told him we are even and he agreed. 

Even though we are even, he still touches me sometimes. It would go as far as tickling me. I don't want to tell him to stop because that would go against my submissive nature and would me make fun of me for being weird for not taking it. Now all I think about is how poorly he treats me and how I have to see him everyday and how this treatment will never stop. I think all I have to do now to give myself a piece of mind is tell him we can't be friends anymore. But then it would be awkward when I see him at home.

My dilemma is that most of this pain comes from my girlfriend. I love her so much that the things she’s said in the past that unintentionally hurt me or disgusted me drives me crazy. And I have a lot of self doubt and trust issues. When we first met, she described her ideal man, he wasn’t me. She told me her life goals, they weren’t mine, she told me about reckless behavior, etc, and now it’s all changed and im “perfect” and she all of a sudden wants what I want. Issues like that are what bug me.

My ultimate problem is that if I tried leaving her or she left me, I know I’d kill myself

If I tell her how I’m feeling, she may leave me. Especially if I told her why I’m depressed/suicidal. 

I feel like this is a phase, and that in 2 weeks when we reunite after the holidays I’ll be fine. I just struggle now and I’ll be better later, I’m always better when I’m with her. Or I tell her this stuff, I potentially scare her off, or guilt her if she knew I’d kill myself without her.

&amp;#x200B;

Our relationship has changed a lot over the time we've been friends but about three years ago it got flirty with both of us outright saying we would start a relationship if our situations ever aligned. 

Spoiler -- they didn't align and look unlikely to ever align. But that doesn't stop me day dreaming about possibilities. 

Realising things were not lining up, the flirty talks died off after about six months of it, and since then we've been firmly back in the \~just friends category\~ which honestly was a very comfortable place to be, and I was ok to go on like that (although still vaguely day dreaming) until my friend got into a relationship. 

At first it just bothered me a little, I wasn't happy with it, but I accepted it was just something I would need to deal with, so we continued on with our friendship. 

But now my friend's relationship is getting more serious I am shocked by how much that bothers me.  

I'm very upset, and I have zero rights to be.  

Even if they broke up today, we couldn't be together (complicated) and the likelihood is that we'll never be able to get together. And my friend is happy, so I want them to keep dating. But my heart *hurts. I feel wrong.*

I can't believe how much time and money I used to waste on commuting. I have no desire whatsoever to return to the old way.

31,"My cousin (27, M) is in a toxic relationship with a disabled woman who is nothing but a leech on his life and an awful influence. When they got together, she was a bit of a withdrawn person, but not destructive; also she wasn't disabled. About a year into the relationship she got cancer and he took care of her through everything, including her amputation. And she has been abusing that generosity since then (which was about 2013). She doesn't work, literally doesn't do anything for the household, is an alcoholic, she lies all the time to get her way, and they are mutually violent. My cousin was none of these things before her. Oh, and they live with my aunt and uncle because they are poor (since they blow my cousin's money on booze, fast food, etc.). Well, at least they both did live there until recently, when one of their huge arguments overflowed into the neighborhood parking lot, and my aunt and uncle were threatened with eviction. So she was forbid to come back. I could go on about her and how awful she is to him and his parents, but that was the boiling point. And yet, my cousin has been mad at his parents for ""being mean and unwelcoming to her"" as if it is somehow their fault. Did I mention that nobody likes her and her BS? I don't mean that to be mean, but she doesn't even have a good relationship with her mom or ""friends,"" so literally nobody will take her in to stay with. Nobody.

&amp;#x200B;

That all said, my cousin has been battling depression and anxiety, increasingly so, especially as of recent to the point where he admitted himself to the hospital, both for the depression and alcoholism. He got ""fixed"" and got out and went right back to her. Drinking ensued and an altercation occurred. Police issued a protective order. He went back to the hospital. Got out, and was doing even better than before. We talked, sometimes at extreme length, as he has always been willing to listen to me since I've essentially been his mentor and one of the only family members he talks to, and he understands how bad she is for him. Whenever we talk it seems like he is over it all. But that doesn't last. Christmas Eve, he lies to his parents about going to see a friend, goes to her, partially to get her a hotel room with the money he doesn't have since she has nowhere to go, and drinking ensues yet again. For whatever reason he decides to drives and ""gets distracted,"" (according to his words to his parents) which likely means she started hitting him, and he hits a snowbank and smashes an electrical box, taking out the power for many businesses of the main road of the town. Car is also totaled (which is his mother's). Now he is being held in the town prison because 1) DUI and 2) violating the protective order, even though she has been the instigator in seeing him this whole time. And who did he call this morning for his phone call? Her. Even the police officer told me ""boy she has a personality. She was telling him 'I am your wife, you need to take care of me!'"" First of all, they aren't even engaged and two, she doesn't even seem to care about the trouble he is in, only that she now has nowhere to go or anyone to do her bidding.

&amp;#x200B;

His parents and I have literally no idea how to help him. He does quite well when he is apart from her (doesn't drink or smoke, works diligently, cleans up after himself, etc.), but the moment she is back in the picture, it all goes to hell. Even if we cancel this phone, there is literally no way we can get the two to stop talking. He keeps making these decisions, essentially like he is obsessed with her, even though she brings absolutely nothing to the relationship but trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

And now my cousin is temporarily behind bars until the court decides his fate next week. If they charge him with a felony for violating the protective charge, his job will be lost.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, I just had to get that off my chest. He is a really good and smart kid, and we are watching him destroy his life for whatever reason, for someone who doesn't and wouldn't do squat to help him at all in return.

&amp;#x200B;

32,"      A little Backstory: I have phobia called Haphephobia (self diagnosed from research) where I hate the idea of people touching me, but I never was sexually harassed and I hate showing affecting. Which included, saying or texting I love you,. I also have a mild case of Agroaphobia where I hate going outside during the day, it makes me very anxious to even step outside and. My brother (17M) does suffer from depression and other issues. 

      Some issues I have had: These have been accusing ever since my fear of being touched started to rise around 10 or 11. At first, I have confused why it repulsed to be hugged by my family. I began asking them to please not touch me or hug me because it makes me feel trapped and scared. They always ignored me and continued to forcefully hug me saying, “It’s just a hug we are your family.” over the years have gained a very deep hatred for them with the lack of them even trying to understand. There have been many screaming matches and me running away for a couple of hours to calm myself down. My mom (39F) always tells me I’m overreacting and I should open up more because the fear of being touched isn’t supposed to hold up for family, even though I have expressed it does. I especially hate being hugged by my brother because when I began trying to get them to stop, my mom made him to hug me more as a “joke”. My family now says, “giving him hug will help him calm down when he has anxiety attacks so get over it to help him.” Recently, with my fear of going outside they again don’t give a shit about that. 

     First incident that made me write this: 

  Yesterday, my mom told me to open up the present we wanted to open of Christmas Eve every year I would have to walk my dog that minute. It was still late afternoon so the sun was out which freaked me out. I said a stern no and explained why. My siblings began begging me whilst I kept denying. My brother then looking me in the eye and called me pathetic. I got up and stormed off to my room to blow some stem. 
   On the way to my room, they kept calling out to me so I told them to fuck off. I hid under my blanket silently crying from fear and hurt. My mom then came in and sat down. She began telling me how I need to stop overreacting and to get over it. I told to leave me alone because who wouldn’t feel hurt when you mom didn’t defend you? She walked back to the living room and they began laughing  about the situation.

   The second situation: 

 Today, they wanted to take a picture and told us to stand next to each other. I didn’t want to put an arm around my brother or sister (19F). They began telling me to just do it because it was just a picture and my began trying to force his hand around my shoulder. I flinched back scared and my mom said never mind. I said to just accept I hate being touch.

This story is long as fuck, I'll try to get to the point as fast as I can.

I'll call myself Castor, And I had a girlfriend that I'll call Donna, Now she's in a different school and she met me though Instagram and we massaged each other all day on the phone in the first quarantine, mainly in the night hours, 2 - 5 AM, and we got together in the end of may, but the thing is, I was such a fucking hot head back then, every little thing she did annoyed me like putting a hand on someone who isn't me, and she really loved me, but that relationship was really toxic, because of me, everyone in my friends group was involved in it, we broke up in September, and to be honest, I really didn't give a single fuck, I stopped talking to her, and in November I decided to stop hang out with most of my friends because they were hanging out with people that I wasn't really connecting with, including Donna, but 3 days ago, I decided that I don't want to live that way anymore, and told everyone I'm opening a new page with everyone, including myself, I talked to Donna and she said everything is alright and she's happy that I opened a new page, I'm now a very open person, and I'm really nice to everyone, and I'm hanging with everyone, and my friends told me they're really proud of me, and today at 3 am, I talked to Donna, and I remembered all the good times, we shared memories from those times, She said that I'm returning to the Castor she loved, and when I talked to her yesterday I just fucking cried, fucking waterworks, I've bottled up these emotions from September and only now I'm releasing them, and then I understood I still love her, I want to tell her that but I know nothing will come out of it, and I just need to tell that to somebody, that's why I'm writing all of this here, yeah I changed for good, but yet I feel lost, I still love my ex, and I don't what she feels back, we both know that we got smarter with the time, I don't even think that she thinks that I still feel something for her, what do I do?",26Dec2020,1

As paradox as it may seem this year started pretty decent. For about the first 4 months of the year I had the strongest happy phase I had since a long time, then a few personal things happened and I was at an all time low. Since a few months ago I found myself to be happy again, but sometimes at night I get the feeling, that I want to cry for no particular reason.
I know this ""non-existent reason"" stands in conflict with my personal things but I am sure these aren't the reason for my desire to cry. In fact before 2020 happened I used to cry sometimes to vent some build up feelings but now there seems nothing to be building up and I still get the desire

For context, I’m basically a vegetarian. My diet pretty much consists of oats, quinoa, nuts/seeds, rice, pasta, potatoes, and hell of vegetables. I’m a big tea person, too. So, fairly heart healthy diet. 

I picked up a pack of Italian sausages today because I’m staying at a friend’s place, house sitting, and they left some eggs for me, so I made a sausage and mushroom frittata. I ate the second sausage for lunch with some kale and onions. 

Man, that stuff is so good, I kinda just wanna fry up the remaining two and knock em back. 

I’m just worried, is this the kind of thing that will give someone a heart attack? I’m not worried about long-term health risks, as I pretty much never eat this stuff, but are there any acute health concerns I should be worried about if I eat those remaining two?

Bonus points: I’ve got some kimchi in the fridge, and some carrot greens. Do you think those would go well with the sausages if I were to go ahead and eat them?

My mom put a lot of effort into Xmas.

48,"I'm 22 (F) and to make a long story short I don't know how to handle my dad. My dad has had a history of a short temper, saying aweful things, and has a very big physical disability on top of things from an incident in 2012. So, for a long time, he would take his anger out on everyone around him (as he does) but we would just think, he went through a lot ya know? Poor thing is stuck in the house. Depressed. Sad. Can't do anything he used to. Whole life changed. So obviously, it was put under the rug whenever he had an outburst. 
Now, almost 9 years later, he's so mean. He has severe Bipolar that he refuses to acknowledge but he does take anti depressants (frequently skips medication). He is the type to walk in, tell me he's proud of me, I drop something, he calls me a r*tard and goes off on a tangent. Little things. I'm now 22 and deciding I don't want to go to college anymore, and I really can't stay home. Every little thing I do comes with a mean comment or him yelling. I have too many examples to count just from this week. It's to the point where I am crying, typing this, on Christmas in my room. 
I know I need to move out and get a full time job. It's hard right now because I'm just beginning my credit journey and trying to apply to full time jobs. I don't want to continue college, he doesn't know that yet. I want to move out, he doesn't know that. I want a full time job, he doesn't like that for whatever reason and does everything he can to steer me away from working. No idea why, just does. 
What do I do about my living situation? 
Do I ignore him entirely and just realize he's never going to change and go about my day while ignoring him? This will be extremely difficult but I could try. It's just we live in the same house, lol. 
Do I stick up for myself and tell him as long as he doesn't respect me I won't have any for him? 
Do I continue to do what my mom &amp; I have been doing for years, letting everything go once it's said and done and acting like nothing happens? 
Do I wait until he yells at me again and decide to fight back and let him know how I really feel?

49,"   My partner (17, myself 18, 10 month relationship) recently had a cat die, and we haven't been able to talk a lot of the week. We did on Christmas eve at least and planned to watch some movies today over zoom, just chat box since we both felt like messes today and it'sjust a chill thing to do before really talking for today. They offered to watch a muppet movie since I watch them as a fun distraction a lot, and we decided on The Muppet Christmas Carol as the first one to watch today. Ya'll probabaly know it, it's the one with the story of the three ghost and scrooge so most folk know what happens. My partner always cries pretty easily during movies, either happy or sad tears, and that's okay. It happens no matter what movie we watch and I love their empathy with it.

 During one scene traveling to the future, ""Tiny Tim"" dies, and they asked for a moment. When the character was introduced and they got attached I gave a heads up about the ""death"" that doesn't actually happen. I told them it's okay and to take their time when they asked for a moment, I thought it was just the normal crying during movies. Again, no cameras, so I couldn't yell really read them too well here. They said they were okay and I could unpause. Again, I know I'm a dork about muppet movies, and they're always a bit quieter during movies since they just express through body language and jerk reactions more. I love them for it and that's okay, most comments they give are just what they find funny or surprising. After that moment the movie was about over (character that died also came back to life in present) and I sent one or two comments, and when it started to roll credits I was really worried about them not talking. I asked if they're okay, they just said they think we should watch the rest of the movies tomorrow. I agreed since it got later then we thought anyway and they left the zoom, when I texted asking if they're okay I got ignored.

   I'm really really worried, their cat only died 5 days ago, I didn't even consider it until now but did it just end making them mourn more again?? I know it can be hard to tell digitally but I feel like a dick and in 10 months there just hasn't been a time I've ever seriously upset them, I'm really concerned that since I'm more oblivious to grieving that I did something wrong without thinking and I'm not sure how to help them.

I met someone online over two years ago and we instantly clicked. We have been close ever since. We had a sexual relationship throughout this time and we both kept our friendship secret. I saw them go through multiple partners throughout the years all well maintaining our secret thing we had going on.

In the past few months it got very intense and personal and it’s at the point where we spend basically every moment talking and we tell each other shit no one else knows. Our friendship is still a secret to everyone in our lives.

My problem is that I’ve been lying to them the entire time.

We met on an app where I used a fake name, location, and age (but not by much of a difference). I don’t want to make it a woah is me thing but I think this might have been a way for me to separate this idea of me from my actual self? I’m not sure why I did it and I know it’s weird as hell.
Plus, I’ve been in a relationship for a long time now and never told them when it started, they still believe I am single. They recently left their partner and we have been very close since that moment. 

I never told them about it and now we are so far along that I can’t just turn it around.
I don’t want to lose this person as a friend but I’m well aware that our entire friendship is based around my lies.

My partner lost his job during the pandemic and is a full time dad while I’ve been the working parent. He is a GREAT dad and it’s so hard being a stay at home parent. He has worked his whole life up until this last year and I think being a stay-at-home parent takes a toll on him mentally. I don’t see him as any less of a man because he’s the stay at home parent but I think, in a way, he does. I try to assure him that he’s contributing to our household equally but I know that he just doesn’t feel like he’s a man if he can’t contribute financially. He’s taken up video games, which aren’t inherently bad, but I think he uses them as an extreme escapism. When I get home from work, I take our child for the rest of the night so he can get a rest from being a full time dad but all I see him do is play video games.

It wasn’t an easy decision at all but I reasoned ultimately that I can’t have a relationship with him without having one with her, and she negatively effects my mental health far too much. I effectively disowned her as my sister when I made the decision to cut contact. This year for Christmas she sent me a present to my family’s address as she doesn’t have mine.

I worked in so many different sectors, and a lot of sectors, I didn't continue with it. Because for one, the hours were cut or not enough. And some of them was too conniving. 

But, I actually had fun selling, even those were the downfall of being in the retail industry. I got to, open up to customers, met some nice and kind associates. And this one company before this whole virus hit the world, was willing to pay me to stay safe. A part of feel like I owe it to myself, and at least try it out before I decide to pack up retail for good. When my friend saw me volunteering there, (yes, I got too bored and went back to my old job, just to sell there and talk to the associates there) she saw me in my zone, telling her facts about the products, and was educating her. She saw me having fun.  I was honestly having fun. I get into my zone, and forget all my life problems, and just be there. A lot of my friends even told me saying that I sell stuff to them even though I am not even trying to, because the way that I talk. 

School, I haven't been there for 5yrs, I don't even know if I can make it through it. I dont even know if school is right for me, and if retail is actually just wrong for me. I know I can't do retail for life, because of the pay, holidays. And everyone looks down on retail and you can NEVER book days off. Or even my own birthday off. My birthday is in November. So November, January, is retail black out month!!!! I get so turned off by reading these days, and math and anything that has to do numbers. I even thought of doing school full time, and work full time as well, because at least I have 5yrs to finish school, and work, if I end up hating on the company that did pay me money to stay safe, at least I have school to fall back on. (I don't know if that sounds stupid at all) 

I even feel sad when I heard that small businesses was going bankrupt during this time of year... thats how wrapped up I am in the business industry.

My ex stepdad has been in my life for the past five years now, he started dating my mom a few weeks after my parents separated. They never lived together but he was often at our home and I would go to his house a couple times a month. I know his children, his family, we were really close. 

I don’t have a great relationship with my dad and I considered my ex stepdad as one of the most important male figure in my life. My mom and him were on and off for a while and then became just friends for the last year and half approximately but even if I saw him less he was still a part of our life. 

Two years ago I think he told us that he a cancer, then he got better and three month ago he told us that his cancer had got back but this time it was worse and that nothing could be done about it. He told us that he was going to die. He was supposedly living and working five hours away from where we live and because of the pandemic we could not go see him. 

Two days ago I learned that he had lied about everything that happened in the last two years. He never had cancer, he was never hospitalised at the hospital he said he was. He never lived and worked where he said he did. Basically he created himself a life that he would tell us about. 

He did much more than what I just wrote about but it’s the most important lies. I’m just shocked and sort of scared. I realise that i don’t know him at all. He straight up lied about cancer, about everything in his life to emotionally manipulate my mom. Every time she tried to detach herself from him he would create something so that she couldn’t cut contact with him like she wanted many time.

The next day they messaged me ""I was out with a group sorry I should have invited you, you would have known some if them"". After that I felt really upset because i really wanted to spend time with people that evening and knowing I could have been invite really got to me. I know this wouldn't have been intentional.

I confinded in this person I was trying to work on building friendships because 2 close friends have moved out the country and I needed expand and be more social because of the break up etc so they knew about that. 

They knew my best friend was away on holiday. 

Every time we see each other socially they're like omg we should hang out I feel like I haven't seen you etc

My phone's always on but at least I'm at home now instead of standing on the line! 

The main issue I'm running into here is two-fold:

**Turning off:** I know it's mostly new job jitters and wanting to do well. I'm having a really hard time getting out of my own way on that one, the only one who expects me to work non-stop is myself.

**Who Am I?** I kind of forgot what I enjoyed doing. It's been so long since I've had time to actually **DO** stuff. For 14 years it's been grinding physically all day doing something that I really enjoyed. I got out because I just couldn't keep missing out on time with my family, I have a 3 year old that my main interaction with was dropping her off at daycare and then coming home when she was going to bed. Being home now, is awesome but I can't help but feel a little bit lost. 

I think that's the main part, I'm in my early 30's and I just feel like I abandoned my identity when I was 20 and became 'the cook' and just let it absorb me. I've been telling my old college buddies and people I've worked with that it's just ridiculous, I have no idea what I used to do for fun!

79,"A little over a year ago, i bought a notebook for myself and BF to share, basically like a journal we passed back and forth. We didn’t really see each other often anyways because of work and school, but i also had some personal stuff going on with my family, so we’d only see each other once every week or two. We’d treat it like letters to rant or talk about our day or whatever. obviously we could text this, but we felt that this helped get all our thoughts out. Plus, we could read them over when we missed each other. Just some sentimental bullshit. 

However, after quarantine, we kinda stopped using the journal because we began seeing each other regularly. The last person who had it was BF, so to be honest i had kind of forgotten about it. 

Until a few days ago, he told me he had a surprise. he was obviously really excited. i went over to his house, he sat me down, and had me hold my hands open. What I got was the notebook. I was surprised. I began flipping through it, reading the passages. I thought it was a little cringy but sweet of course. I just don’t think i’m very good at writing sometimes. 

I was reading through one of my letters and my heart sank. I was writing about how excited i was to spend time with A, who would later go on to sexually assault me. I felt so sick. It was so uncomfortable to read how much i looked up to this person as a friend, so blissfully unaware of what would happen. 

I instantly shut the book and tried to bring BFs focus to something new. 

I feel terrible. He wants to start writing letters again but I don’t want to. I’ve been thinking of options. I could “lose” it. I could rip out the parts that mention A, but that would also rip out other parts i want to keep, and BF would notice. I could just scribble out the parts i don’t like. i don’t know. i feel terrible. i don’t want to tell BF how i feel because i don’t want to ruin something he was so excited about. He knows about A, and i already have felt like he doesn’t understand how significant the damage is,
especially because A was once someone i would consider my friend. i’m worried BF just wouldn’t understand why i’m upset.

83,"I'm looking for advice from teenage boys but I appreciate any advice

I never saw him in any romantic way until around this time last year. I hadn't been able to stop thinking about him for a couple of weeks and whenever I was laying on my bed at night it finally hit me that Iiked him and I freaked out. I've never liked anyone else before and have absolutely no clue what to do. He's two grades ahead of me. We were best friends as little kids but haven't seen each other in a bit due to quarantine and conflicting schedules but our moms plan on getting together over winter break.

My friends try and tell me that he likes me and that I should just tell him but I can't. We're close and I couldn't do that to our friendship, especially without knowing how he would react. He's incredibly sweet so I doubt he would be angry with me but there's nothing stopping the relationship from becoming awkward. I don't want to ruin our friendship, especially considering that our families are both close as well and the fact that we both have a mutual friend or two that could make things a bit awkward.

I'm very shy about messaging him. I constantly feel like I'm bothering him even though he doesn't seem to mind it. I'm a bit insecure about my personality and hobbies and anytime I bring it up he's very quick to assure me that whatever I'm thinking isn't true and that he bets the complete opposite. I get shy about reaching out but whenever we do talk our conversations can last for days and he always makes sure to tell me he misses me and wants to see me again at the end of it. The last time I saw him my mom brought up being nervous about me getting hurt by someone (I can't remember the subject) and he immediately went to say that he could protect me.

I know for a fact that he's single, I'm friends with his best friend and he told me that offhandedly while we were talking about something else. The best friend does not know that I like my crush since I have a feeling that he'll probably end up telling him. One time I was with my friend and the best friend and he was messaging my crush. He didn't let us see the phone but kept looking over at me and then looking down at the phone to message him. My friend brought up the idea of his best friend liking me but that would be impossible since he recently got together with a girl who he's talked about non-stop for a while.

A part of me really wants to tell him but another doesn't see a reason to, at least for now. I'm only an 8th grader and there isn't any pressure for me to tell him since I don't really think there's any competition as far as I'm concerned. I want him to know, but I don't want him to until it's the right time if that makes any sense. I go to the same school as he does next year but we won't be in the same building until the year after that. That doesn't bother me too much though since everything else is in the same place (sports, theatre, etc) and I'll still see him. I want to tell him how I feel but I also don't and want to wait for the right time if that makes any sense lol.

Anyways, thank you for reading and any advice is appreciated!",26Dec2020,1
84,"Honest perspective needed on something that I’ve questioned for a long time

Hi all 
I’m looking for an honest opinion or view on this. I’ve always had a nearly nonexistent relationship with my father. He lives in the next country over so even if he was a good father it still would’ve been difficult. There’s a lot of erratic and aggressive behaviours he’s had mainly towards my mum through my life, but I would only witness them when he would visit me. I think up to 11 hrs old I remember him visiting me max 7 times which is generous. On a few occasions he did things that never sat right with me. He was basically a stranger who I knew was my dad. One occasion we were in a field and I told him I had sports day coming up which I hated, so he then went into a bossy tone and told me to practice run up and down this bit of field. So I did whilst he sat on the grass to watch. After that we sat under a tree, then he was all of a sudden on top of me. He pinned my ankles with his feet and held my wrists. I was only about 8/9 I think. He’s a shorter overweight guy, so I was trapped. He was laughing finding it funny, maybe at the beginning I was awkwardly laughing along but saying can you get off me... because I felt awkward and I was a polite quiet child. But he wouldn’t get off me, panic set in I was struggling trying to free my legs and getting louder telling him to get off me! But he wouldn’t. You would’ve clearly been able to see on a child’s face when they’re  scared and panicked. Anyway I managed to free my one legs and I think I kneed him and he finally got off me. I then ran back to his car as fast as I could and waited till he caught up, then crying told him to take me home. I remember he was trying to calm me and was trying to come over to me from the other side of the car. But I would run found the other side. From what I remember, he seemed puzzled like he didn’t think he had done anything wrong at all. I don’t think I saw he for a while after that, but my family I’ve grown up with always encouraged me to give him another chance. So the next time he came down he had brought me some clothes... he said he wanted to see them on me for me to do a fashion show for him. He then started towards me and was pulling my skirt down to undress me. I was at the age where I could dress myself I think I was about 10/11. I told him no I will do it myself whilst holding the skirt up, but he persisted and said he wants to help. I think I then lost it and told him to get out of the bedroom. When he did I locked the door and rang a family member cry Uk he saying to come back to the house I was scared. Not sure if I told my family of these incidents after they happened... because nothing would ever happen after I don’t think. Anyway I from 11 refused to have contact with him until I saw him again when I was 19, that was a brief reconnection because o cut him out again. Until I had a breakdown when I was 24. I did the whole therapy thing and before I knew I called him only to get off my chest what I thought of him and my memories, how it effected me. To my surprise he was accepting of everything and apologised, it threw me because he was never like this. He always lashed out and blamed others. So I stupidly believed he changed. We got on great and I finally felt like I knew what it was like to have a dad. So the next step was me travelling to see him and stay for a night or two. I felt comfortable enough to do this because of how we were on the phone. So I went up there to actually get to know my dad, I stayed at his place I opted to sleep on the sofa because get more comfortable. We talked we drank we ate it was lovely. I was always in maxi dresses and fell asleep in one this night but no underwear on. I had a duvet and I was sleeping on my side facing the back of the sofa. My dad had already gone to bed. I was drifting off to sleep when I heard him come out of his bedroom and come into the living room. He didn’t say anything, but seemed like he was looking for something... then I felt him over me he then lifted up my duvet..,. It was then I realised that my maxi dress had ridden up over my bare ass. I froze. He obviously say my naked ass but he didn’t drop the cover straight away like I would think you would. He kept it up for a few seconds longer than was necessary. Like 10-15 seconds. I just kept my eyes closed frozen because I was shocked embarrassed and didn’t want to embarrass him either. He then dropped the cover and went back to bed. He didn’t find the thing he was looking for by the sounds. I still can’t figure out why he came in or if he was looking for something, he had already gone to bed. 
Anyway I didn’t mention this to anyone or him because It was going to well our reconciliation i rationalised it. Like he must’ve been looking for the remote and looked there, he didn’t mean it he just new to being a father etc. He when I first arrived at the flat he wanted to do my feet. Because it runs in the family crusty feet. Lol o think he wanted to do it as a nice thing he said he wanted to spoil me and look after me. I let him do it because he had gone to the trouble. 
Sorry this is so long but I thought I would give you the most prominent memories that haven’t sat right with me. I need to know do you think this behaviour is weird? Or is this what fathers are like when they rarely see their kids. Is this normal and am I just making something out of nothing?
It’s weird I always said to my mum when I decided to cut contact with him at 11, if I ever see him again don’t let me be alone with him. I always was worried about when I’m grown up and am woman, that I defo shouldn’t be alone with him. Is that irrational to think that way from these incidents?",26Dec2020,1

90,"I live alone since I was kicked out from my parents house, the main reason was my older brother (26 at that time). We are not in the same page since forever, we had pretty ugly physical fights when we were growing up. The reason I was kick out, was because when I was 19 years old I couldn't help my family financially and he kicked me out, my mother was just looking at me during our arguing and I could see in her eyes she agreed with what he was saying. After understanding the situation I left the house, with my backpack (12 days before Christmas)

For my lucky I had an internship at the time and a 100% scholarship for my college. I slept for two weeks in the company which I was doing my internship for almost 1 year. My boss schedule a meeting from nowhere and in the title was ""Performance review"". I was so afraid, but some angel or something else took care of me that time, I had the perfect news for that difficult time and they hired me in the third week which I was ""homeless"" by the end of that week all the papers were done, I was so happy and made sure my boss knew that. He didn't even know, but he saved my life. I could finally rent my own place and didn't need to sleep / hide anymore in the building stairs.

I'll cut some of the details, to not make this too long. But after that, I graduated in the next year, I was promoted two times since I was hired.

After all that, I have trouble trusting anyone enough to share my personal life. I can't get into any relationship, every time someone is getting closer to me I push them away. For 5 years I spend Christmas and New Year's evening alone. Every year when Christmas comes, all those memories comes back.

This year with all the pandemic problems, living alone without being able to see any of my friends. I built some terrible bad habits ... the only joy I have now is eating. I gained almost 80 pounds this year. I'm overweight now, very unhealthy and I can't stop eating .. I tried multiple times this year and failed. I don't do any exercises anymore.

I think I'm depressed, all that shit in the past comes to my mind more often. I work almost 10 hours per day, sleep for 4/5/6 hours, drink 2 liters of diet coca-cola and eat everything I can every single day.

I'm not suicidal at all, I never was even in the hardest time ... I never thought about giving up.

96,"So my Dad got me some strange gundam model thing and my wife got me a ring that is too small and a watch. She's known me 15 years and I never wear watches. 

I got her something she really wanted and work really hard to make holidays great for everyone else. Get the kids exactly what they want and give thoughtful gifts to everyone else. 

My grandparents just send money which is great. I can pay some bills with that and get the kids some presents.

I'd really rather get nothing then be given stuff I'm just going to throw away. It's bad for the environment.

Or something off my wish list on Amazon. 

I just don't like holidays. My birthday is two days after Christmas. People always gave ""combined"" presents, meaning they forgot my birthday .

At work everyone is given a happy birthday and a lunch is scheduled, but mine is always missed because of the Christmas break. 

My mom died 35 years ago just before Christmas.

I'd just rather skip holidays. I can buy what I want when I want it. Holidays are wasteful and stupid.

I'm invisible.

Father has just slapped my sister

Hello Reddit this is my first post and I really need some advice on what to do.

Here’s a background: my sister and her boyfriend are 19, I’m 16. Our parents( by our I mean just me and my sisters) are really strict and verbally abusive, we make one mistake and they get really stubborn about it and gaslight us this has taken a toll on me and my sister and I suffer from severe depression and anxiety because of how they treat us.

So today,
My sister’s boyfriend came over today and when he left, my mom noticed a hickey on my sister’s neck. She ended up telling our dad about it and he got really upset. My sister was really fed up so she locked herself in our room ( we share a room). I was confused why she had locked the door, then I hear my dad banging on the door telling her to unlock it, then he yells for me to unlock it. I’m sitting there confused and don’t know what I should do. My sister then goes “you have to protect me” and that sentence makes my heart drop to my stomach, our parents have never laid their hands on us and haven’t whooped/spanked us since we were younger so I didn’t know what to expect. Our dad ends up unlocking the door and dashes towards my sister telling her “why do you have a hickey?” “Cmon let’s talk”,  in a very furious and angry tone, he then grabs her by the arm and she frees herself and jumps on my bed. He follows her and then slaps her across the face. I stood there in shock for a second and yell at him to stop “that’s enough!” I laid on top of her for a second as a shield, and he shoved me off. He then goes on top of her and does a motion to slap her a second time, but doesn’t. My sister yells for our mom, and when she walks in she told her our dad slapped her. All our mom did was say that when parents hit their kids that means they love them and that she shouldn’t be so upset. My sister starts sobbing and our dad scolds her and tells her to stop crying. My sister tells our mom she’s gonna move out and she’s gonna call her boyfriend, and our mom just says don’t you dare tell anyone about this. In the end my sister decides not to call her boyfriend because our dad has a lot of knives and he would be the type to fight her boyfriend too. So here we are now sitting in our room just me and my sister in shock of what just happened and don’t have a clue what to do next.

TL;DR : dad finds out sister has a hickey and slaps her",26Dec2020,1
102,"My family and my neighbors next door have lived next to each other since before I was born, and we have always been friendly. I would help weed their garden when I was younger, they would help plow to path to our door when it snowed, etc. We would always give each other gifts at Christmastime.
About a year ago, my mom got into a heated argument with one neighbor (who I will call N for convenience), and the two of them haven't been on friendly speaking terms ever since. She has been polite to everyone at that house except N. My dad and I didn't expect any gifts from N's family this year, so we didn't get any in return (and my mom would be pissed if we went over her head).
I went outside later after dinner and found a bag of gifts placed halfway down the path to our door. Inside were several gifts, wrapped but unlabeled, and a card simply labeled Merry Christmas signed N and her husband.
I don't know what this means, as I don't really understand the argument that ended my mom's and N's friendship, and there was no apology or meaningful words anywhere in the card. My mom has made no attempts to patch things up with N or vice versa. I don't know if this is N's husband's idea and N isn't involved at all, or if this is just neighbors being neighborly and sending gifts on Christmas. 
I'm hiding the bag of gifts for now until I know what to do. If my mom sees, she'll probably react badly, getting angry at N. I don't know whether to return them unopened (the card is the only thing opened), or keep them and send a thank you card regardless of what my mom thinks.
Any advice?",26Dec2020,1
103,"Friend of mine says ""hey, did you know x has an onlyfans?"" X is a person I knew for a few years, but haven't talked to in a long time. My friend found out because she added him on instagram or something - he used to have a crush on her and she knows it.

We're both curious so I subscribe to check it out. Very average overall, just a few softcore nudes. Very few likes and no comments on any posts.

Thing is, she has a *lot* of cut/self harm marks. Across both legs and arms. A few look fresh. My friend doesn't know, he didn't want to see the pictures since he's committed to a relationship.

I don't know what to do. This is a person who I used to know, saw each other regularly, etc. On the other hand, we haven't talked for the last 4 years at least. Do I ignore and move on? Do I try to help her? Do I reach out IRL? Is it her life, and none of my business? Truth be told, I have no idea where she is in life and what led up to this.

What should I do?",26Dec2020,1

106,"II live alone since I was kicked out from my parents house, the main reason was my older brother (26 at that time). We are not in the same page since forever, we had pretty ugly physical fights when we were growing up. The reason I was kick out, was because when I was 19 years old I couldn't help my family financially and he kicked me out, my mother was just looking at me during our arguing and I could see in her eyes she agreed with what he was saying. After understanding the situation I left the house, with my backpack (12 days before Christmas)

For my lucky I had an internship at the time and a 100% scholarship for my college. I slept for two weeks in the company which I was doing my internship for almost 1 year. My boss schedule a meeting from nowhere and in the title was ""Performance review"". I was so afraid, but some angel or something else took care of me that time, I had the perfect news for that difficult time and they hired me in the third week which I was ""homeless"" by the end of that week all the papers were done, I was so happy and made sure my boss knew that. He didn't even know, but he saved my life. I could finally rent my own place and didn't need to sleep / hide anymore in the building stairs.

I'll cut some of the details, to not make this too long. But after that I graduated in the next year and promoted two times since I was hired.

After all that, I have trouble trusting anyone enough to share my personal life. I can't get into any relationship, every time someone is getting closer to me I push them away. For 5 years I spend Christmas and New Year's evening alone. Every year when Christmas comes, all those memories comes back... my worst bad habit.

This year with all the pandemic problems, living alone without being able to see any of my friends. I built some new terrible bad habits  ... the only joy I have now is eating. I gained almost 80 pounds this year. I'm overweight now, very unhealthy and I can't stop eating. I tried to stop multiple times this year and failed and I don't do any exercises anymore.

I think I'm depressed, all that shit in the past comes to my mind more often. I work almost 10 hours per day, sleep for 4/5/6 hours, drink 2 liters of diet soda and eat everything I can every single day.

I'm not suicidal at all. I never was even in the hardest time ... I never thought about giving up.

I just really don't know all the meaning of this shit and what I can do to help myself.

I really would appreciate some advice.

Thanks, sorry for the long text ...",26Dec2020,1

108,"I'm only 16, but I feel like my life is passing me by. Everyday goes way too fast, it seems I turned 14 just a month or so ago. I've been sad a lot recently thinking about it, my life wasting away right in front of my eyes. This sadness is starting to get to me, in my family, friends, school, I got my first ""D"" in a class in my whole life this past semester. I feel so unmotivated. I don't have a drive or passion for anything besides being alone. I don't know why I'm like this, it's not like there's been a traumatic incident that forever changed me, it's just as I age I think about things other than my present moment. I'm scared for my future and that the decisions I make now as a sophomore will drastically impact my future, and depending on weather I can get my shit together or not, that impact could be positive or negative. I'm so scared that that change is going to be really, really negative. When I get sad, and maybe a little depressed about life, I go back to the same place. I won't put it here but I think of it as my happy place, and I know that for it to be happy, I have to try. Any effort, any studying, trying to do something, and I can't. As I said earlier, I'm so unmotivated and undriven for anything. So my question for advice is two parts: I'm asking anyone, at least out of high school or older, what did you do right, or what did you do wrong? What did or did you not do in high school you are extremely proud of that put you in a better position as a person and student, or what did you not do that you really regret, and the second one is what motivates you to get out of bed and get to work or study everyday. I just feel like these are the defining years that will set the stage for my future, and I really want it to be different than it currently is. Any advice is greatly appreciated &lt;3",26Dec2020,1
110,"My husband works at a cell phone store where they have a regular customer. She isn't a problem (annoyance maybe) but she has had more and more concerning behaviors that from my second hand view seems like the early stages of dementia. 

She will call or come in multiple times (much more than 5 times a day) with the same question, having forgotten that this question has already been answered, but what's really concerning is that she backed into a parked car in their parking lot a month or so ago and didn't realize it. She was going to drive away until my husband ran out to stop her. There was a good amount of damage done to both cars. 

I am really worried about this woman in general. My husband and his coworkers know a lot about her from all her visits. She lives alone, has no husband, children, or family. She can be rather rude so I'm not sure about if she has friends. 

I'm looking to help her in some way because it seems like she is getting close to being a danger to herself and others. Should I try to find someone that knows her and speak with them? Would a welfare check do anything in this situation? Or any other ideas would greatly be appreciated!",26Dec2020,1

Whom I love deeply. Anyway, today was Christmas. And my brother and my dad got into a little fight, and he was upset, but my brothers girlfriend decided it was okay to attack my father and call him a bad person. I immediately reacted. I told her that she needs to get out if she talks to my father that way. This girl immediately started saying awful things to me. Calling me a pathetic grown ass woman, whose gross for being suicidal and telling my family, and she doesnt care about me, and I should kiss her ass. She called me an ugly racist. And I just looked at my brother waiting for him to stop her. She didn’t. My parents had to ask her to leave. My brother took this girls side after she did this.

I am a bit of unique situation...I am 19M and currently deciding whether to return to my four year, 60k a year university in the Spring(I took this semester off to go to community college to save some money on online learning).

I would like to go back because I have lots of friends there and I enjoy it, but I don’t want to spend the money and am worried I might not be able to do the school work since I really don’t care much about the actual work. 

I feel my mental health would be better served at my four year as well.

I gave my boyfriends mom one last year and apparently she never used it. And my boyfriend told her off about it, telling them I was getting them it again this year and they better use it since I’m unemployed.

He was getting, well, handsy. His hand would rest on the small of her back at first which is whatever. But then he repetitively placed it on her upper thigh close enough to her crotch, the sides of her hips which was basically her ass, and high enough on her thigh for his thumb to be in the space between her hips and stomach as she was crouching as if holding her hip bone.

I was uncomfortable. If it were another man, a stranger, friend, whoever, I’d be pissed and step in. This isn’t the first time I’ve been made to feel uncomfortable, but this I felt was blatant in front of me. Again, he was very drunk.

A few weeks back, I noticed my upper right had a small break, no idea when it happened.  As I was fiddling with it trying to assess the damage, more broke off.  Surprisingly it didn't hurt, I didn't feel any pain from it for about a week.

Now for the tough spot.. I was unemployed when it all started, in no way could I afford an appointment.  I found a job with a call center, have been training the last couple of weeks and I officially start tomorrow, for their busiest couple of the weeks of the year, mostly twelve hour shifts.

Now, of course, yesterday is when the pain set in.  Wasn't terrible, didn't even need any acetaminophen or anything.  I have a strong pain tolerance, but I woke up today and it's like someone is digging a screwdriver into my gums, 500mg acetaminophen gives me about 20 minutes of relief and it comes right back.

Pretext: I am 15, my brother is 23. He was narcissistic, abusive (physical, threw into walls, hit, slammed doors  hands and feet knowingly), and thought he was the second coming of Jesus (not jokingly, my mom almost got a priest). Oh yeah, and starved me with the excuse “I am big, you are small” then claimed it was in my best interest when he lived with us (3 years ago he moved out, prior to that he lived with me my whole life). He was very close with my uncle, who raped me repeatedly from ages 6-9 (please don’t laugh, I get nightmares already). After figuring out the man was a child molester, he screamed and spat at me in front of my mom until she joined in saying “you are lying! You are a liar! Stop lying!” Then faking a police call so I’d admit I’m “lying”. I did admit I was “lying”, then refused to answer those questions they’d ask ever again. He then FOLLOWING THAT made me sit in dark rooms with the child molester, encouraging me to listen to him who wanted me to sit in his (uncles) lap. He refused to acknowledge it till years later, where he preformed the whole “your a liar” when I told him yes, it did happen please stop asking. He moved out, I got therapy and meds for ptsd. 

Today for us is Christmas (but happy holidays to everyone with other celebrations/religious beliefs!), and he’s here for his yearly visit. He’s been here sense late Thursday night, to which I awkwardly just showed him memes and he proceeded his “oh I haha my humor is better :)” act. We decided to drive to the Smokey mountains for Christmas, fun! It was a 6 hour drive. 

The car ride was very tedious, he genuinely believes he is the smartest in the room, and narrates everything he does. He does not have mental issues, or a disability or anything that would warrant it (I know a friend with horrible tics, and I have similar ones, I don’t want to be offensive!). He is just an self important asshole. Mostly part of the trip has been fine, I had headphones the whole drive. We eat, we have family time as a whole, we just ignore eachothers existence (to my mothers request to him, every time I see him without fail I WILL cry or breakdown). We get to our rented cabin, it snows so much the power goes out completely and the temp of the house goes to maybe 30 degrees because of the freezing snow. It doesn’t return.

Now everything is fine till today. We all slept terrible, expect for him (I think?), but we embraced the opportunity to act as a family. We all opened gifts, I enjoyed mine, he enjoys his, my mom does her happy claps and smiles (she doesn’t get both her kids in one place often, let alone happy Christmas time). My stepdad enjoys his too but is freezing because of his low blood sugar (it’s something blood related) and he’s much older. We all decide to keep warm we are gonna go explore Gatlinburg. It’s snowed over everywhere, everything’s either closed or packed but we find seafood and munch down, it’s dope. Everyone leaves but me and him and I look at my brother and say “look, we don’t have to like each other. But for moms sake, let’s just act like we get along, she needs this. She’s stressed, she’s tired, she wants her kids not stress.” And we agree to just play along. 

After, we drive around for a few hours, I pop headphones in to drown out my brothers noise and overall enjoy the ride a ton. We get home to the cabin, but He decides that we can’t do this with the power out and it getting lower and lower in temperature every minute, and rents us a hotel. We get driving, and they go to talk to the hotel staff and leave me and my brother outside. 

I decide, time to casual convo to just make it less akward even with the resentment. I say think one guy is flirting with me, talk about him. My brother decided it was time to talk about girls who like him but only after he’s in college, I make a half assed comment about something something “they didn’t like you in high school? Actually nah I can see it *chuckles and jokingly smiles*”. He proceeds to talk about how of course they didn’t because he was bullied, and I give him a big eyebrow up like , ‘:(.  He gets annoyed and says “well you should pity me, I mean you were bullied as a child after all, so you’d understand” and I’m getting aggravated at his pride in being oh so pretentious. So I go “I don’t have pity for you being bullied, or even in general. You were an accomplice to a child molester  for years” which SETS HIM *off*. He proceeds to scream in my face he wasn’t, and how dare I. I scoff and say “yeah sure” and go back to scrolling on my phone. He begins to ROCK THE FUCKING CAR throwing a fit screaming at me while I’m just sitting there trying to find something to do instead of listen to his insesent bitching defending his shitty acts.

I get sick of the screaming and snap. I begin to say something back for his every maybe 3 sentences. He says I’m a bitch and just don’t understand him or what he goes through. How “he copes”, and how much he’s hurt over the rape situation. Goes on to say he blames himself worse then I suffer because of it, and that I “just don’t understand that”. I at some point go “I will never *ever* give a shit about “how you cope”. Imagine how much worse it is for me. I’ve been on 30 meds and 2 years of therapy to widel it down to 3 nightmares a week.” To which he changes subject entirely. He then also goes on to blame me for several thinks to which I smile this forced smile and go “I will never accept he monster you were, and obviously still are” TO WHICH THIS MAN GRINS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER LIKE HE STRUCK GOLD. He then proceeds to state he was never the monster, I made it up, and that *i* was the monster. That *i* need to *just think about*. He continues to then taunt and scream at me. I’m sick of his shit, he gets really close and actually spits (like the drops when someone’s screaming BAD) in my face scream just like he used to and fear runs in my body. He only yelled like that before he beat me as a child. I block it out, look out the window, my parents return after he finishes shaking the fucking car as he throws his tantrum. I try to not cry as sudden I am 8 again. I try not to cry as all I see is my childhood house. I try not to cry when I feel an inch tall and I’m at my brother old door again. My lip quivers, im back there all over again. I have the worst ptsd attack ever, and proceed to lose it trying to crying silently. We stop at a gas station, everyone gets out but not me. I begin to really let loose and cry as all these visions in front of me play out of old memories and I feel as though I’m in them all over again. My mom finds me and tries to comfort me, but I’m edging into the worst of it. She leaves, and the real wave hits. 

I’m suddenly thrown into the room, the house, the hallway. I’m a tiny child maybe 3 ft again. My hands are tiny. I can faintly see the real me, my big hands when I look down, and it feels so wrong. I’m there, I’m in the fray. I’m in the screaming, I’m in the raping all over again. I’m being touched all over sexually. I see my brother smile, I’m thrown into a wall. I begin to scream. I kick open the door to throw up, nothing comes up but I choke on my own spit trying. A stranger tried to help me but all I could say was a hysteric “please don’t touch me”. I absent mindedly call a friend, I scream like I’m being murdered, this is the part I don’t remember. I turn the phone off, I feel hands and cry, I see it all on replay over and over and I’m sure everyone outside can hear. I’m afraid. I’m not big, I can’t defend myself like I can now. I’m tiny, I’m frail, I’m prey. I scream and scream and cry fat tears onto my jeans, shirt, and hands. My face is soaked till there is no tears. 

My stepdad comes out, and I’m afraid he’ll say get out stop being a baby, but he doesn’t. He hugs me and holds me and I become even more hysterical. The only things I can say is “I’m tiny” “I’m 8” “don’t make me go back please” “I don’t want to be in there again” and “make it stop, please make it stop”. He does his best to calm me down, and tells me they are getting tator tots just for me and isn’t that cool? And it makes me calm down a bit. He leaves to go back inside, and later on tells me he told my brother “you say one more thing to her and I’ll punch the shit out of you”. 

They all come out at once a few minutes later and I’m still shattered and crying. I see them and crumble and go into the fetal position in the back of the car and all I can say is “please don’t touch me please stop please don’t” over and over and over. He sits next to me like usual which makes it worse. Doesn’t say a word. Puts his good up so he doesn’t have to look. 

We get to the hotel, my mom and brother take the bags up stairs while my stepdad tries to get me to stand, which eventually works. I grab my pillow stuffie and new stuffie I got for Christmas, along with my puppy bag (I like cute shit, it’s comforting okay?) and we sit down in the lobby as he tries to prepare me for going upstairs. He says he can’t change the past but he damn sure won’t let it happen in the present or future ever. And it’s strange because usually this man hates me, but I accept the comfort and latch onto him while he lets me know I’m not a failure for this, and I’m not ruining anything. 

We go upstairs, they are in a corner and won’t look at us. We are up there 15 minutes till my stepdad checks for his bag, it’s missing. Turns out they left the bag on our open tailgate, which we didnt see in the mist of my hysteria. He gets pissed, tells them off and I go with him to get it out of fear my mom and brother will reject me as family for this. When we leave the room he’s nice to me and doesn’t show an ounce of hostility. I’m kinda high at this point from my mom getting me my anxiety meds and extra but also the crying and episode gave me adrenaline I couldn’t handle. We get the stuff and go upstairs. They are still in the corner. We take turns showering, when my stepdad goes they begin to talk about us ‘quietly’. My brother says “I didn’t wanna come anyway, I only came for you mommy :) ❤️” and I pretend to not notice.

Stepdad is still pissed, my moms upset, and my brother seems to blame this on me. I feel caught in the fray but it’s my fucking fault so I’m not allowed to complain. Am I the asshole for entertaining my brothers petty argument?


TLDR my brother gives me a ptsd episode because I egged him on (I’m not gonna downplay that, I started it.). This causes my family to go into Chaos, pretty much ruining Christmas. My stepdad who is usually mean has taken my side, and my mom and brother have taken there’s but I don’t know their stance. They are all now in disarray, and it is my fault. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Was it even my fault? How the fuck do I make the rest of this trip work good for my mom?",26Dec2020,1
123,"So I was babysitting my niece since my cousin was helping out her brother. A week later, her brother is showing symptoms of flu/corona (not sure of the specifics). He didn’t get a covid Test.

I have had no contact with him in the last 3-4 weeks. However, my cousin did help him out with a few things and came to my house to chat for a bit, pick up her daughter, and left. So if he does have corona, I could have been exposed through her.

Now my only question is, how long should I quarantine for? I looked on the CDC site but it doesn’t say anything about possible exposure, just mentions if you have covid or exposed to someone who’s positive for covid. I think 2 weeks just to be safe but what are your thoughts?

Thanks guys :/

125,"In spring 2019, my first and only relationship was ended when my boyfriend broke up with me due to the advice of his mom. I was living with an emotionally abusive roommate at the time who was very intrusive into my relationship. My easily influenced boyfriend took the advice of his mom, overwhelmed by the absolute chaos my roommate had caused and broke up with me. The worst part is that he told me he never liked me and convinced himself that was true in order to let go. Flash forward a few months, and I see him at our university with a new girlfriend. They ended up staying together for like 10 months and he sorta pushed her into his family because his parents didn't want him to make a ""mistake"" again. Essentially, she was a rebound that lasted way too long and got way too serious because he never coped with our breakup. 
A few months after he figured out she wasn't right for him, he and I reconciled and ended up getting back together. Coping with his last relationship has been pretty hard on me, as his homeschooling, super religious, controlling parents continue to bring her up and tell him he's not ready to be in a relationship again, although he is 21. They got ridiculously close to the other girl and shoved marriage down my boyfriend's throat when it came to her, which has led to a lot of hurt for me. 
I feel a lot of insecurity about it, like he chose her over me for a while, and it makes me feel bad knowing how serious they got. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this situation, and I just need some advice. How do I get over the girl he dated in between dating me and all the baggage that comes with that? Am I crazy for letting it hurt me?",26Dec2020,1

134,"So I'm 30 and have been through the toughest year of my life and for complicated reasons it has been important to meet up
and converse with my twin brother,
to build trust.

We're not close, yet he has told me I'm the most important person in his life.

 Anyways, we met up in September and spent the day together and everything went great. We talked about the topics I wanted to, to hear where he's coming from and it was beneficial.

I also suggested that we meet up again and he agreed. All was great between us.

A few things since then happened to have things be quite rocky between us; he visited a family get together in October, and I asked him to talk and he and i drove around in his car and talked about anything on my heart for 30 minutes...

i had other things to address yet he was pushing me to leave because he apparently had work to do, I was crying and I felt he was being insensitive and then I refused to get out of the car when he asked me to leave...

I was crying and he was pressuring me and it was intense...
after a few minutes I did get out of the car and he told me that he would text me about a day that works to meetup, but he never did.

i texted him politely for a few days then gave up, one month went by and he never responded.

Per my request, my parents arranged a group meeting with us and my brother in late November that ended poorly, as I felt they were all against me... I was getting very loud and defensive, as this is a very painful topic for me and my brother wasn't taking my side...
and it ended with me I standing front of my brothers car as he tried to leave early.

So our two interactions since the amazing day in September ended with conflict in October and November.

There was no contact since late november until today on christmas, where he refused to answer some questions I had when I was calm and asked politely... he refused because it's christmas and he doesn't want these conversations today.

I walked away and cried for 30 minutes, then asked him again this time clearly sad and hurt and he still refused..
I then asked him if we could talk on the phone sometime this weekend and he said ""idk, text me""

yet last time he said that he never followed up, and that's probably because we had huge conflict and i wouldn't get out of his car...

this time I was civil and let him leave without getting in his way.

I was crying my eyes out and he wouldn't listen to me or show sensitivity.
We are both twins and INFP's...

I can't help but feel all this behavior is extremely wrong.

I said that would be fine, but I wanted to hear the price before agreeing. They took all my info, where I was the car type and the destination.

139,"Long story short: went to high school together 7+ years ago. Made it evident that I liked him. He didn’t like me back but we were still friends. Got into a relationship with someone from a different state shortly after I realized he didn’t want me. He then told me his true feelings for me. I still cared for him but didn’t want to ruin anything with my new guy. 

In between that time we would still be friends on Facebook but I deleted him at least 6 times and he added me back everytime (I added him maybe 1 time) I just didn’t want to keep track of his life cause he was in a relationship and know he’s married. I still care for him very much. So I deleted him almost a year ago actually because why would I want to see his life knowing I still care for him. 

Today he added me back on Facebook out of nowhere. I went to my memories on Facebook and I saw a post about 6 years ago from his mom, I clicked on and to reminisce and I saw his name and I told myself to not click on his page and I kept it moving. Not even a hour later he added me. I didn’t click on his page or his mom page so there’s no way I accidentally clicked on something to alert him.

But I’m confused as to why he added me again after I deleted him knowing that he knows how I still care for him. Am I crazy? It’s like he wants to continue to be seen. I don’t want to accept his request, he’s such a great person but I don’t want to bring up those emotions again. We were close.

140," I'm just looking for any and all objective comments, just looking for perspective. Thanks for reading

Title says most of it. Sorry for bad formatting, I'm on my phone just trying to type this shit out.

I'm a 29 yr old male. I've known or have felt I was a little different way back as a kid. I remember seeing one of my classmates in first grade differently, or thinking of him differently. In other words, I knew I had a kind of attraction towards him quite differently than the rest of my male classmates.

One of my many other male classmates was obviously my now best friend, we didn't really cement our friendship until we started hanging out around middle school. He's straight, always has been. And he's known I'm gay since we were both around 25. But enough with random details. On to the matter at hand:

During one of my conversations with him, I referenced how I was born this way. He said he doesn't believe that and being gay is more of a choice. His reasoning being that one chooses to be gay out of pure necessity after being rejected so long in life. Mentioning examples of how some men in prison, after being rejected and going on for so long without women would choose to be gay since there's no other way. 
Or men who have been constantly rejected by women and not being able to get any with them end up choosing to be gay in order to satisfy their sexual needs. The way he worded it made it sound like men choose to be gay as a last resort, as a way of survivability to obtain that human contact they've been deprived of from women many years. 

He expressed how a lack of evidenced ""gay gene"" reinforces this theory.


I told him that is ludicrous and that I have always known since the first grade which he immediately brushed off saying how could you know when we weren't even sexually developed or thinking about sex that age. My reasoning is that not everything really has to be sexual, but instead you could still feel differently (butterflies when you were kids around a certain male classmate, or maybe behave in a weird way around them cause they would just ignite something in you. And that's how it was, I felt/behaved different with one of our male classmates at that age, back then you don't know what to make of it but now I know it was a typical cute crush) Maybe at first grade I didn't know fully what it was, but that doesn't exclude that existence of something there. Some feeling, something, anything because it was certainly different with him than my other male classmates. 

I believe what he said to be rather ignorant and insensitive especially when he has such a good example close by. I would assume by having a gay best friend so close by he would at least try to think more in depth about it and be more considerate about what/who is around them to have more perspective. It's as if my sexuality and/or existence did not cross his mind at all when thinking about this. Made me feel like shit. 

I have gone through a lot, a lot. For being gay. From taking homophobic crap in silence. Hearing my family talk shit about homosexuality (very religious family so you can fill in the blanks) till feeling miserable all through my teens thinking I was a freak of nature, not normal. It's ridiculous to think I ""chose"" to deal with this, to deal with pain, to deal with feeling marginalized and feel like I'm not worth living for being different. 

The more obvious argument would be.... If it were a choice, don't you think I'd choose the better route? The safer? The one that wouldn't make me feel and go through so much shit? Yet despite it  all I'm still here suffering, still feeling like I'm an outcast, different, trash, a freak of nature..... Not normal. I'm still taking, dealing with homophobia, still taking all this crap from every homophobic because well, Being gay is what I am. 

Needless to say I don't know what to make of all of this, it hurt me deeply to find out this is what I was reduced to. I may delete this later anyway, guess just wanted to vent.

He does not have a license yet and I don't see his father helping him to obtain that. He has family in another state, but he hasn't really talked to them since his mother passed. Today, he contacted one of his maternal family members but I'm not sure if they are going to respond to him. He needs some sort of family, as I think that'd be a stable ground for him. Perhaps they'd even allow him to move  in with them. He currently has no family members to talk to about his situation except for his sister, but she cannot do anything about it either as she is just slightly younger than he is.

143,"First of all I don't like complaining about my parents or I feel like I'm a ""annoying teenager that hates their parents"" but I'm not like that, but I still feel guilty for complaining but I think it's necessary, I really hate my clothes and I try to tell my mom that I really feel uncomfortable and ugly with them very nicely but she starts yelling at me starting a lot of drama so I decide to be quiet and accept what she says, I can't be like this anymore but I don't know how to change.

I'm a girl and I don't like to show myself a lot but my mother forces me to use ""revealing"" clothes to be more feminine or nobody will love me, I really find it unnecessary to use clothes that shows more my body instead of covering them, I only want at least ONE normal t-shirt during my whole life and I kindly ask my mother to allow me to buy it with my own money and she will start a huge drama in the store saying that I will look like a man, nobody will love me and I look like a lesbian and she doesn't wants me to be a lesbian (but I am but my clothes doesn't means anything), as I said before I don't confront her a lot and I feel guilty if I do (if I'm a ungrateful teen or something), I really tried to tell her that I don't like my clothes at all but she insists saying ""I know you don't like them but I don't want you to look like a man!"" (she has this paranoia since I'm a child), I honestly don't think that I look like a man at all, anyways... everything that she doesn't likes she says that it looks masculine and she will scream and yell just by touching that clothing. I'm in a level that I'm hating myself for always not being happy for myself (including what I wear) just to not be judged by her.

I really can't understand her, she says that I'm old enough and independent to choose what I want but she forces me to like what she likes or she will start a huge drama (even crying saying that I hate her), I hate dresses but she was insisting in saying ""YOU HAVE TO LIKE THIS"" and ""STOP BEING A B**CH FOR NOT LIKING THIS, USE IT AND SAY THAT YOU LOVE THIS DRESS AND THAT YOU WILL BUY IT"", I usually stay quiet to not make her mad but she would still yell and start some drama even for my face showing that I'm unhappy, saying that I'm complaining and whining even though I said absolutely nothing, she knows that I hate her style, but it's in a way that it actually hurts me for what she says and that I really don't know what I like in order for her. I also can't understand that she complains about my choices (I never end up buying them, if I buy something with my money she will start drama to go back to the store and get the money back -- for that same excuse) but she also wears what she complains about, she doesn't thinks that she looks like a man or anything, I can't understand her head for real.

This isn't only about clothes, I want advice to know how to make her accept my choices in general without starting drama, I already tried to talk normally and calm to her but she started crying and yelling saying ""WHO IS PUTTING BAD IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD? INTERNET? WHO ARE THESE FRIENDS? I NEVER TAUGHT YOU TO BE LIKE THIS!""",26Dec2020,1

145,"Hi. 

So on Thursday (24th December) my company held their Christmas party at a cafe. A week before, I bowed out of it because I found out there were going to be over 40 people and social events are limited to 5 people. They tried to reassure me saying that there would be no mingling between tables, and each table would only have 5 people. They also apparently booked out the entire cafe, which is still illegal. The cafe is not meant to book out the place to a party of over 5.

I searched up the fines and it would be a $10,000 fine for EACH PERSON attending, if caught. I couldn't risk it, so I declined to attend. I also just don't like events with people I barely know, and I knew I'd be miserable if I attended. My work life and social life are entirely separate and I have no intention of mixing them.

Now, my coworkers are upset that I didn't attend. I assume they didn't get caught since there's no news articles. They won't respond to my texts, don't pick up my calls, and the worksheets I asked to have printed (I don't have access to the files) were not printed for my class.

I must admit, I had thought of tipping off the party to the cops but I refrained because I knew they would suspect me of doing it since I didn't attend.

But what the hell, now they're upset at me? What should I do? Seems like no one is interested in doing what I need them to do, like preparing worksheets for my class. And no, I don't have the option of doing it myself as all the worksheets are on a private account that you only get access to after they decide you can be ""trusted"" with it.",26Dec2020,1

The biggest event of them all was the athletic competition. Hundreds of students would compete in multiple activities and would be eliminated one by on

I had won the competition during my freshman, sophomore, and junior year. In the 50+ year history of the event, I was the only student who had ever won three straight competitions. I was fully prepared to win a fourth straight and complete the ‘dynasty’. The athletic director had told me the school would gift me a scholarship fund if I was able to win it all one more time. 

As usual, I breezed through the competition early and comfortably secured my spot in the final round yet again. This time my finals opponent would, for the first time, be a girl who just happened to be a freshman. She was tall and lanky and posed no real threat to me off the naked eye. The final round would consist of a basketball shootout, first to 10 wins. Basketball is my best sport and I felt as if they were almost gifting the championship to me. I took an early 5-0 lead but she ended up getting into a lucky hot streak and won 10-7. She defeated me and became the champion. I was humiliated and went into a massive depression. I know that I deserved to be the one holding that trophy and seeing her hoist it up killed me. The rest of my senior year remains a blur to me. To put even more salt in the wound, the same girl that defeated me would go on to win the competition in her 10th/11th/12th grade years. She got the dynasty that she denied me of. 

Last week, I came across the Instagram account of the girl who defeated me. I found out that she came out as gay and is now married to a beautiful woman who’s pregnant with their first child. Both of them have a ton of followers and she appears to have a high paying job that allows them to live a luxurious lifestyle. I thought I had it good but she’s really living an amazing life. 

I’m extremely jealous of this woman and I can’t help but to think what my life could have been if I had just beaten her in that high school competition 9 years ago. I know it’s silly because I’m 26 and she’s 23 now but I just can’t seem to let go of the past. I know it’s unhealthy to be this envious of a person, but I can’t help but think about it each night. I toss and turn thinking about how she’s better at life than me in pretty much everything and how it could have been prevented had I just won.",26Dec2020,1
149,"1 (21f) have been fighting with the father 31m)  of my unborn daughter for months now. He has 3 kids from his “previous” marriage and a few months ago I found out he is abusive and extremely neglectful. I also recently found out he is a pathological liar. His best friend reached out to me recently because she heard about what was happening and felt like she “needed to tell me because she felt bad”. She told me that he is STILL legally married, which he’s been telling me since we met he is divorced. She told me that while he was living with her and her fiancée, she was the one taking care of his children while he sat around and did nothing. He stole her credit card and paid his bills with it. When she confronted him, he tried to lie (eventually he told the truth) and she kicked him out. 
Now this is where all the lying comes in: he told me that he left to have a better life with his kids. When I confronted him about still being married, within a minute he lied 3 times before finally saying alright yes I’m married. We were engaged at one point too, so I’m not sure when he planned on telling me. He has a problem with spreading my personal business to our mutual friends and my work (we work together) and then lying about it, then admitting it later on. 
He has 3 CPS cases open in 3 states that I wasn’t aware of until recently. When we first started dating his house was DISGUSTING. His kids had lice for about 7 months.  There was food all over the house to the point where it was piling up the walls. Flies everywhere and fleas everywhere from his cats. Maggots were in the carpets and there was trash bags with cat pee and maggots all over it, hidden in his closets. The kids best room ( 3 kids packed into one small room) was so bad, their beds were infested with ants and maggots. He got rid of their beds and I cleaned the room and the rest of the house and I was upset when his brother moved into that room instead of making it better for his children. I cleaned that entire house, but he wasn’t cleaning or watching the kids so every Monday I came out the house was DISGUSTING again with food all over the carpets and such. 
The kids do not have a bed room. They sleep on the floor in the living room. They had lice for 7 months and he wouldn’t fix the problem. I had to do it because he didn’t care enough to do it. I have picture proof of him whipping his children with an HDMI cord. CPS has been out 3 times, the last time they were out, he admitted to using the cord on them and the CPS worker said “we’ll just don’t do that again.” He also got in trouble for leaving his kids home alone for hours at a time. And he trained his kids to lie if anyone asks questions.  I will admit before I got pregnant, I was doing coke but I got clean before I had gotten pregnant and have been clean my entire pregnancy and I refuse to touch any drug. He encourages me to do drugs on a regular basis and he was also doing coke. He says he’s going to use that against me in court even though I’m 18 weeks pregnant and i haven’t touched anything for even longer. I was 21 when we met and I was just having fun. I need advice because I want to get full custody or give him just supervised visits but I’m scared for her to be alone with him. He’s very abusive and neglects his children.",26Dec2020,1

I have no idea how I am going survive with no means of income in sight. The government doesn’t care and even if they did, it’s at the point where he’ll literally can’t come soon enough. 

I know some people have it worse than me and that genuinely bothers me because I can’t imagine being beyond the point where I’m at but I know it’s getting to that point but for people that may not know the struggle that some people are going through, here is where I am currently at. (I had to work paycheck to paycheck before But I was making it work)

Almost $1000 owed to the electric company.
$1500 to my mortgage
$4000 credit card debt since august
Dropped my auto insurance
2 months behind on my car payment

Ever since she got a boyfriend she just stop caring about weight, she’s probably thinking “he loves me for me and I don’t have to change”
But she’s like, 300lbs im not exaggerating we have a scale. 

I’m pretty sure she has diabetes, she has two of the symptoms, the dark skin parts, and she pees a lot.
I don’t want her to die early or have one of her legs amputated like my moms friend did.

She’s controlling herself to believe she isn’t unhealthily fat, when her shirt gets too small for her, instead of realizing she gained weight, she says “the drier shrunk my shirt” she wears my clothes that are form fitting then lies to herself saying “Ooh I’m thicc” it’s worrying me because she could die.

155,"

I have a friend who I consider myself very close to. We've known each other since we were in highschool at age 15, now we're 25. We share/confide with each other in almost all aspects of our life.

The thing about this friend is that we both seem to handle setbacks and stress differently.


For some background, we both went to the same university directly out of highschool. We both coincidentally chose the same program (different majors) and struggled with it.
Unfortunately, my friend was forced to drop out due to low grades. I was able to pick myself back up and finish.
My friend was extremely upset about having to drop out. In fact, they still are to this day. 

I never actually told them when I graduated, because I was afraid it would seem like I'm being a show-off. I didn't post any pictures to social media either. They did eventually become aware of it when they realized I had more time to hang out. We never really had a formal conversation about it, but they just clued in.


Fast forward to today, and my friend is still struggling. They have a hard time landing a job, let alone one that isn't minimum wage. They have tried to go back to school and try smaller programs, but they have a hard time getting accepted.They have constantly expressed to me that they are upset about the situation they are in, where nothing seems to work. 
Slowly, my friend stopped actively pursuing jobs and opportunity and became more passive. They haven't given up completely, but the drive has gone down significantly. 


I, on the other hand, have a relatively well paying job where I recently got promoted. I'm also applying to do my masters degree. 

I feel reluctant to tell them that I got the promotion and I'm trying to go back to school. I don't want them to be comparing themselves to me and feeling upset that we're not at the same level.

However, I also don't want to hide big details of my life to someone I would consider my ""best friend"". I feel like it's not fair to them who constantly confides in me, and I'm not reciprocating. 

Also, this may be a bit selfish of me, but I want to share the good things that happen to me and have encouragement and support. 

I know a lot of people that would say that good friends will support you with your achievements, but I don't think it takes my friends mental and emotional state into account. They are a good friend. They're just having a hard time. I don't think they'll be able to offer the validation I'm looking for at this time. But I can't keep these kinds of things secret from them either.

What would be the best approach to this scenario?",26Dec2020,1
156,"So my whole life I’ve been a happy person with no big problems whatsoever but lately I’ve been feeling like im not being myself. I’ve a normal family, good friends and a girlfriend (For 4 years now) and I go to college, so the way my life is going im supposed to be happy right? But im so sad and I feel so lonely and like I can’t find the meaning in the things that I do and I know you are going to tell me something like “you should see a psychiatrist” but already did that and nothing changed. Sometimes I just don’t see the point in keep on living like this, it’s like my life is fucking good I don’t have any reasons to feel this way and yet I just can’t seem to be happy or at least not sad.

158,"Sure some of you may say that it's the thought that counts but I have sensitive skin. She bought me a gift that's a foot cream and socks for $5. I don't need this. I said 2 years ago and I said again last year that I don't want to exchange gifts. But she insists and says it's ok even if I don't give her a gift.

But this year, she bought me a gift that I got in November. I already said thank you when I received it. Even during this pandemic. She's the type to not wear a mask and she said this herself. And she said she wears it just to get entrance to the store. She really doesn't care and I don't want me or my family to get sick.

She's not respecting my decision that I don't have the money to spend on anyone. I have bills to pay for. Money spent on a gift and sending it out adds up.

This year I didn't get her a gift. Not only because we're in a pandemic. For other reasons, she makes me feel like shit every time she talks to me.

Right now, she sent me a text asking how did I like my gift. Wtf.. I'm trying to spend time with my family.

I think she's upset that I didn't give her a gift this year to ask that question directly but I told her I don't want to exchange gifts anymore.

She's actually crazy. She's the type to cause a scene and record a video of it. And hurt her ex bf by putting sharp objects in his bed.

I know what she's capable of. I need help. What do I do?",26Dec2020,1

161,"At about 6 am ish Christmas Morning we woke up to popping and then the fire alarm. A fire had started, quickly consuming the room it was in (office/second bedroom) and setting off live ammo. He threw open the door to an absolute inferno and explosions. I got dressed and called 911 while my husband emptied our fire extinguishers onto the fire until more ammunition started going off. I got the dog and he got dressed and we both ran outside. He ran away from me twice to go in and try and save our cats, crawling on the floor until I yelled for him to come back. They think it was a freak electrical accident. 

One of our cats died. The computer room, containing two custom PC’s, game consoles, laptops, and other media products was absolutely destroyed. Everything in every part of our apartment smells foul and is covered in soot or water. We maxed out our renters insurance coverage just on claiming our computers. Never mind the fact that all my husbands shoes and pants are burnt to crisp, my cat, who we just rescued because she was heavily pregnant is dead. Firefighters couldn’t find her but I did, in the room the fire happened. 

My husband was coughing up soot all day and had it running out of his nose as we watched them kick out our windows. He can’t turn to his family as they are pretending nothing happened.

Anyway he is 53 and currently overweight, not enough where it’s too far to lose it but about 20-25 lbs overweight 
He has has stents put in for his heart 
He has high blood pressure although on medication for it and other minute health concerns.
He is at an age that is pinnacle to the future of the rest of his life. He can take care of himself and live long and happy or in and out of doctor appointments with old man health issues.

He has a serious medical condition and I am his carer, neither of us are able to work due to the severity of his illness though we are doing continuous medical research to find ways to make his life better. Where we live now we are completely without support. All friends and family live far away, and the only relief or happiness I get is when we visit my family back on my own country (UK).

I am desperate to move back home but with his disabilities and our inability to work, I don’t know if there is a way for us to move nearer my family. We have tried to investigate possibilities, though there are many contradictory things online but I think the basic is that he cannot continue to receive his disability while we are in the UK and I can’t go back to the UK with him unless I prove I can support him on my own, which I can’t because I am his carer. That is my “job” and it takes up my every waking minute.

I am F 20 and my boyfriend is 20 as well. I will call him L. 

L and I have been together for 2 years and I am so head over heels for him. I truly have so much love for him and I am absolutely terrified I’m going to lose him. Here’s why. 

We moved into my grandmothers house a while back. She was going through some mental issues and needed help. 

When we first got here, everything was fine. Now he does nothing all day because he’s depressed. It’s hard to get him to even eat. He plays video games until he gets bored and then he lays down for hours. Doing absolutely nothing. 

He hates it here. At least that’s what he tells me. He has thrown a fit about moving out a few times, but each time ends with nothing happening. 

The latest one he had all of his things packed. I was okay with this because I just want him to be happy. Obviously I was sad and I cried, which he freaked out about. Telling me every time he tries to leave I make him feel bad. I didn’t say anything I just cried. 

His mood swings are insane. Sometimes he is the most affectionate, sweetest, loving person ever. And then other times I am on the verge of begging for a conversation. 

The problem is he is so bored all of the time. I don’t know what to do to help. We live in a small town and there isn’t much to do at all, especially with a Pandemic. It also doesn’t help we are in the middle of winter and it is freezing outside. 16 Degrees to be exact right now. 

I’m also fine with getting our own place, but I cannot afford one on my own. He can’t find a job.

For my entire life, school has bored me, not because I'm an insufferable genius or anything like that, but because I feel like it doesn't give me the support I need to actually study the things I'm interested in. It's made me depressed, given me anxiety, and made me feel like I'm under constant pressure. 

I really want to study physics in college. I've taught myself physics and calculus outside of school (finished Calc 2, onto multivariable calc) because they are subjects that I've felt legitimately motivated to immerse myself in, as opposed to the ridiculous workload exerted upon me at school full to the brim with uninteresting material. I really wish I could skip high school and go straight to community college/university. I have supportive parents, so I know they would help me in this if such opportunities presented themselves. I just don't see any potential in staying in school much longer if I already know a lot of the material and feel helpless learning-wise in this environment. Theoretically, I *could* stay four years and graduate high school without too much trouble, but I feel I'd be very unhappy.

I want to be able to get my savings back up/set aside money for things I’ve been wanting. At the moment I want: a Polaroid camera ($60), an ipad to make digital art ($400-700) and a switch ($350)

which do I save up for first? I want to make digital art with a tablet and have wanted to do so for so long now but then again I also want a switch because I bought an animal crossing game for my ex’s families switch to play on them we broke up so now I just have the game and no switch, and I’ve wanted a polariod camera for forever lol. send help idk which to save for first",26Dec2020,1
178,"My girlfriend is always asking me to have a baby with her. We’ve been dating for over 6 months and she consistently asks to have a baby. I know her intentions are good and she even says she wants a baby so she can have a mini version of me with her all time. 
My issue is that we are not ready to have kids, both financially and from a lifestyle point of view. 
She’s at University studying to be a nurse and I work in construction as an apprentice. 
Logically we just can’t afford it. I make just over $600 AUD per week and she makes around $400. We just cant financially afford it. I’ve already told her multiple times that when I finish my apprenticeship and start making a guaranteed $100,000/year, I would gladly start a family with her but right now isn’t the best time for it. 
I just don’t know what to do because she asks atleast once a day. 
Any advice is helpful",26Dec2020,1
180,"On Christmas Eve my teenage niece (15) was caught sending extremely explicit messages to a boy on an app. Her phone was taken away and her mother and father went through it and discovered many messages and explicit pictures with this boy, who she (and he) claims to be 17. 

The images and videos are extremely graphic and are basically pornography of themselves. This guy has also sent other pictures that are disturbing and include guns. 

We just discovered she had given him her grandmothers address in hopes that he would meet up with her sometime soon. 

We believe his is not 17, and actually lives in Mexico, a short 4 hour drive from us. Right before her phone was taken, she text him and told him what was happening. He is now texting the phone with the messages intended for her father (my brother) saying he will kill him. I am telling my brother to call the police and file a report. He is unsure if that is the right thing to do. 

I feel like getting the police involved is the obvious answer and no discipline or “grounding” will solve this issue. I am concerned that if he does in fact come to meet her and take her to Mexico, by the time the police are involved it will be too late. I am trying to tell my brother this but his is very disturbed and distraught by the whole thing he doesn’t know what to do.",26Dec2020,1
181,"I am a 25 year old Male, very lonely and living with zero friends in my parents basement. All the school and college friends don't talk with me because I was a nerd and introvert. The girl who was love of my life ended up cheating and breaking up with me to go back to her ex. I think I will die lonely and nobody will give a single F about my whole life. Can someone please advice me on below topics.

1. The girl who cheated on me destroyed my life. I am taking medication for depression and panic attacks and my life is completely ruined. Even after this that girl is having the best days of her life , getting married and having a great job, posting daily pics on social media with new BF/husband. Why as a victim I am the one only suffering and why the girl who destroyed my life is having a good time ? (P S I don't believe in karma)

2. My family thinks that I am a loser whose life got ruined by a girl and I am a pussy. But whenever I try to change my life my depression makes it harder. What to do ?

3. In my whole life all I wanted was someone to love me. But since I was an introvert nobody really talked to me and I ended up being lonely. Why was I born introvert ? Why I was not born as a normal working kid who lives a regular life? There are millions of people who desreve to go through pain, but why me (the guy who never hurt a fly) is suffering through this brutal life ?",26Dec2020,1

183,"When I graduated high school 4 years ago I got into the only school I applied to and intended to study film. I wanted to pursue screenwriting. I attended there for a year and a half but ended up feeling very unhappy with the film program and my position in life at the time, so I dropped out and took a gap semester at home. After that, I decided I wanted to go to FIT in New York for the shallow reason of wanting to move to New York and get out of my small hometown. My girlfriend at the time was living there (yikes.) I also figured I could make use of my sewing skills, make a career out of it, like going to trade school. Not only that, but I could knock out the AAS in one year.

I won't go into it but basically, it took me a LOT of finessing to get to FIT in the first place. So, even though the program sucked when I got there, I stuck to my guns and really tried to go into fashion for real. I had tons of internships and everything. None of the internships were terribly satisfying to me, and I found that the fashion office was a really disagreeable environment. After I graduated I landed a job as an admin assistant at a midtown fabric store and was looking really hard for something more permanent but the job descriptions and interviews were soul crushing... I felt really stuck in believing this was my passion because I fought so hard to get to FIT and to New York. 

Okay, so that's where I am when Coronavirus hits. I lose that admin job, and it's pretty much impossible for me to find a fashion job elsewhere. At a certain point I just gave up thinking about it. Thanks to a friend of mine, I was able to get a job as a personal assistant  instead- to two screenwriters! I've been working this job ever since, and it's really reviving my passion in screenwriting, reading, researching, and just writing in general. But of course I don't want to be an assistant forever, and now I'm stuck with an Associates degree in fashion design. This new job has really made me reevaluate things, so lately I've really been kicking around the idea of going to an affordable college in the city to complete a bachelor's degree in English. I really want to chase that passion for research and hone my writing skills. It's something I've always had in the back of my mind. 

The problem is that I can't help feeling like up to this point I was really reckless and immature when it came to my education, and now I'm stuck with the degree I have because it will just be too expensive to pursue something else. Not only that, but I'm afraid of my mind changing AGAIN! 

To be fair to myself, it seems as though research, reading, and writing are the common thread in my passions with fashion design being a bit of an outlier. Even when i was studying that discipline, it wasn't the hands on work I was really into. I just wanted to compile information and write about it instead of actually making a fashion collection...

The schools I'm thinking of applying to are Brooklyn College and City College of New York. I could get in state tuition for both and my FIT Associates credits would transfer. 

Anyway, all of this is a really long winded way to say- is it even worth it for me to go back to college? Should I just start writing and researching on my own time and build up a portfolio then see where it goes from there, or will it be really valuable for me to have that Bachelor's degree? Does anyone have a similar non-traditional schooling experience?",26Dec2020,1

186,"My sister is 18 years old, I am 14 years old. I do not hold myself to a lower standard because of my age, I think that if you recognize that gap, you have no excuse. Tonight I went to my bathroom after watching a long movie wanting to clean my face. I realized that almost all of my face masks were gone. Immediately, I was upset, and knew my sister was the culprit so I rushed to her room and knocked on the door. I remember thinking to myself ""keep calm and mature"", I said, ""I know you raided my bathroom and stole my stuff"" she proceeded to say that all she did was take her stuff back (this is not true). I responded, ""No, those facemasks were a gift for my birthday."" She said she would talk to me later, but I could hear her laughing on the phone with her boyfriend. I went back to my bathroom to see if she stole anything else and noticed she stole the sugar scrub I had just bought with my own money. With this, and I admit this was dramatic, but I began to cry. I'm close to my period and have been crying a lot lately so I think I'm just overly sensitive right now. But then again, that isn't an excuse for me. I went to my mom and dad's room and told them I needed help getting my stuff back. My mom, already agitated with my sister from them fighting earlier, went upstairs and knocked on her door extremely loudly and demanded her to give me my stuff back. This resulted in my sister crying and getting extremely angry. Some of the things she found were apparently hers, like her REVLON curling iron, but she had left that in my room before she went to college and I had just been using it. My sister is now extremely angry and upset with me. She thinks I'm using the fact that her and our mom haven't been getting along very well to my advantage. I know that I shouldn't have stolen ANY of her things while she was gone, but I was really upset. Ultimately, I feel really bad about the whole situation. I should have waited until the morning to confront her, but now I don't know what to do. Both of my parents are angry with her now, but I should be in trouble too. What do I do?",26Dec2020,1

191,"Hi! I’ll start by saying I’m an ICU nurse, right now I am taking a break from work, due to noncovid related health issues. I’ve worked in a couple different covid ICUs at this point.
I apologize ahead of time because my grammar is shit and I’m also very angry right now. 

Picture this, I’m scrolling through Reddit news before bed, see two back to back posts. “1 person is dying every 10 minutes in LA county due to covid” then “1 million people in the US travel on Christmas Eve” 

I am so beyond frustrated the with the US population lack of empathy or consideration during this pandemic. People are dying. Nurses and doctors and all essential workers are fucking tired. And no one seems to care anymore. Everyone did “care” at the beginning but not anymore

Seeing so many of my friends travel during the holiday, visiting family, seeing large groups.
I live in the south, so everything is open here. Just seeing people not care and continue with their life.

My mental health has been deteriorating over the past couple months. I’ve been angry since the start of the pandemic, posting on my Instagram stories explaining from my point of view, begging them to stay home bitching etc. I’ve gotten some positive feedback. But over the months I can tell people are annoyed of me. I see others on Instagram posting doing shit they probably shouldn’t be doing. And now I’ve just grown to hate and resent everyone. I’m depressed and angry. You would think by now I would have coped and gotten used to people not caring but I haven’t.

I’m asking for advice on how to cope, how to stop being so angry at people, how to forgive my friends and not think they are fake as shit 

I’m so angry, things are only going to get worse till enough people are vaccinated, I need to find a way to cope.

194,"Long story short, I interviewed with an animation studio for a production management like internship and got rejected. From my understanding by the rejection email, my two interviewers (one being the boss) were very impressed by my resume and experience, but they went with a candidate with slight more interest in the position than me. I think it’s because I said that my favorite part of the production process is editing, which isn’t rly what the position entails... oh well.

Anyways, the problem is that the main interviewer offered to zoom with me next week and basically network/connect with me. She wants to give me advice and insight on the animation industry and answer any questions I have. She said she knows people at “big companies” with editing roles which would be beneficial for me in the long run.

The thing is- I’m really embarrassed and humiliated that I got rejected. I hate that I’m taking it so personal. I’m like- what’s wrong with me? What did the other candidate have over me? I really felt like I had a shot of getting this internship and I thought I had it. Ugh. I’m so grateful that she even offered to connect with me, but part of me just does not want to zoom with her. Maybe it’s my stubbornness, maybe it’s just my pride- but I really don’t wanna speak face to face with her knowing that she didn’t want me for the role. I got my rejection email on Monday and I don’t know why but this specific rejection from this specific internship is REALLY bugging me. So these are my internal feelings, but I’m still going to speak to this woman next week.

Does any have advice on how to process these feelings? Have any advice on how I can get through this zoom call and not break down and cry? How do I maintain professionalism when I’m still feeling sad about being rejected? Literally I’ll take any helpful advice. Thank you in advance :)",26Dec2020,1

213,"This evening, my mother was going through my room putting my Christmas presents away while I was gone and she came across an empty bottle of liquor and an empty bottle of Oxycodone. (I’m 16)

Now I know, this sounds bad...and to be honest, it is bad. I realise that. However, it’s not as bad as they think. They exposed me on it and think I’m an addict. So, naturally, I lied.

I said that I was emptying the pill bottle to prevent anyone in our family from getting into them and just accidentally kept the bottle. Obviously they don’t believe me as the empty pill bottle was next to an empty liquor bottle, and I know how stupid the lie was.

I admitted to the alcohol as I felt it would give me some sort of plausible deniability....however I now see that it hasn’t. 

I understand their concern and nervousness. I was not yelled at or punished, as they realise that doesn’t achieve anything. I know the issue isn’t over and it will be brought up tomorrow. 

I don’t have a pill or alcohol problem. I was a curious kid who had access to bad stuff and took advantage of the situation. I was just experimenting and I do not have any addiction to anything, in fact I wouldn’t go back to taking a narcotic for the rest of my life if I’m given the choice.

What should I do? Should I just come clean and tell them that I was being stupid and ABSOLUTELY do not have ANY problem with substance abuse or addiction, or should I just lie about the pills to avoid the obvious response they will have.

I know my parents, they will not respond well. Addiction and alcoholism runs in our family and we just recently lost a family member to addiction. (This happened after I used any narcotics) They will view this as an issue and will send me for help by professionals and before I know it everyone in my life will know. And this is ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY. I literally have no problem, I was just being stupid and it was dangerous and I recognise that.

What should I do? I appreciate any insight.

Thanks!",26Dec2020,1

today he helped teach me something without me even saying anything and demonstrated it and i noticed we were sorta close then... i thought the act was sweet and kind. there’s been times where we make eye contact for like several seconds.

216,"Long post ahead my apologies! 

My cousin and I were close growing up. We were together in all the family gatherings, birthday parties, and she even slept over my house most weekends because her parents worked. She became kind of distant/strange when she became a teenager (she is only 2 years older than me) and when she went away for college, but other than that we had a pretty good relationship. A few months ago she got engaged and she did not pick me as a bridesmaid. I was surprised by this because I felt like we were close throughout childhood and I’m the only female cousin who’s always around because her other cousins live far away. In November, she forgot my birthday and texted me the day after saying she had a lot going on and wished me a happy birthday. I said thank you but I still found it strange because November is a big birthday month for my family. A few weeks ago she had her bridal shower and I didn’t feel comfortable going because of Covid. I texted her saying I was sorry that I couldn’t be there but that I was happy for her and looking forward to the wedding. She never answered my text. That same day she texted my mom saying thank you for the gift (my mom went to the shower to drop off the gifts). Both my name and my mothers name was on the card. The wedding is in February. If things are the way they are now with Covid then I will most likely go for the outside ceremony and leave after. I’m sorry for the long post but I would like some input/advice about this whole situation. Does she not like me for some reason? I don’t know what I did to her.

223,"Part 1: I was talking to my dad about stuff that’s happened in my mom’s side of the family (they are divorced) and he brought up how a lot of my grandpa(moms dad)‘s family(brothers and dad I think) is seriously fucked up and a lot of them have done some fucked up crap to my mom and aunts when they were little. This concerns me greatly because if all of my grandpas family did that shit then my grandpa(who is not a great fellow) is perfectly capable of it too.

Part 2: I have this very vague memory. I wanna say I was 7 or 8. I will now state every bit of what I remember. I was laying in my grandparents bed (not sure if we were sleeping or if we were just laying there) with my grandma to my left and my grandpa to my right. I was in the middle of the bed. We were under the covers so I wanna say we were sleeping(still not completely sure?)when I felt my grandfather reach and touch the zipper of my jeans and fidget with it. I’m pretty sure I swatted his hand away thinking that he thought I was my grandma or something. Looking back on it now, I was a very skinny, small girl and my grandma was a bit taller than me but was fatter(hope that doesn’t sound rude) so it’s now hard for me to believe that he thought I was my grandma or something. What worries me the most is that I remember nothing that happened after this and of course this could be because nothing happened and the memory only consisted of a startling thing but after hearing what my dad has said about my grandpas family, I’m very, very scared that more happened and my mind just removed the rest from my head.

I’ve always had a great fear of men, especially adult men. I always feel scared when I’m left alone with adult men in my family because I’m scared that they’ll touch me or rape me. I always just thought this was an irrational fear I had but maybe it has some reason behind it. I have no idea what to do with this memory. I considered mentioning it to my dad because he said that if I ever want to tell him anything that he’s here for me but I really, really don’t want to make him worry especially if it all turns out to be nothing. Do those hypnotists that retrieve lost memories from you actually work? But, if that did happen to me I wouldn’t want to remember it. I just feel so lost and don’t know what to do.

My personality is not obnoxious, over the top, arrogant, pretentious or anything. Unique? Yes. But not malevolent in any way.

And I don't understand it.

225,"Sorry for my English!

My (25 F) mother (60F) is a psychiatrist and since my early childhood she has always had this inability to behave like an adult: she cries at the slightest annoyance, she only talks about herself and sucks her thumb.

I know that my mother is good at what she does and that when she finishes her day she has no energy to listen to others or to take care of them. If she cries it's because she cracks up from absorbing all the problems of others. And I know from her colleagues at hospital that she is respect in her work. Just at home she wants to talk about her and can’t handle losing her keys.

I always knew that my mother was unable to help me when I was in bad places. So I always find help elsewhere (friends, my sister...).

2020 has hit hard! I was confined alone in a foreign country for 8 weeks which affected my mental health, then unemployment and finally a very complicated return home.
I'm not the kind of person who lets things happen to me: I managed to find a food job and started therapy. My job is not great but I can’t complain because I am able to pay rent and food.


After 8 months without seeing my family I just came home for the holidays (tested negative at Covid!). My mother then told me in the middle of Christmas dinner that I needed medication because I was depressed. And she had them with her...
I broke down and since then we don't speak to each other anymore. 
My sister seems to think I should take them. She was not at the dinner due to Covid but I call her to explain how furious I was and turn out she agreed. In addition my mother send antidepressant to my sister few months ago.

So let's be clear: if my therapist tells me that I need medication to get better, I will not hesitate to take it. But am I the only one bothered by the fact that it's my own mother?!",26Dec2020,1

227,"Yes, this is my first account and post on Reddit. I’m kind of desperate. Also, I’m on mobile, so I apologize for formatting. :)

The title pretty much says it all. Here’s a little backstory...

Every year for Christmas, I’m given one “major” gift and multiple “regular” gifts. For example, last year, I got a laptop for my “major” gift. Some of my “regular” gifts included a heated blanket, clothes, LED lights for my room, etc. I’m sure you get the point. 

This year, I was given a ferret for my major gift. Then, for my regular gifts, I was given toys for the ferret, food for the ferret, and other necessities for the ferret. And I don’t want it.

Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely adore animals, and the ferret is really cute. I’m just not ready to take full responsibility of it. My dad was expecting me to keep its cage in my room, and to take care of it 24/7. Which, again, I don’t think I can do. And it’s not out of pure laziness— I struggle to even take care of myself. I have severe depression, anxiety, and I was only recently diagnosed with ADHD as well. Plus, I’m just... not interested in having a ferret. I’ve never thought about having one, and I sure as heck don’t want a ferret in my room all the time.

Anyways, soon after everyone finished opening their gifts, I gestured my mom to my room and I confronted her. I told her how I felt about the ferret, and I ended up breaking down and crying because I felt awful. My parents spent so much time, money, and effort to get this special gift for me, only for me to turn it down. I made sure to emphasize how much I appreciate their sentiment, and I even offered to pay back the costs of the ferret. 

My mom was super understanding, and told me that the ferret could be a “family” pet instead of my pet. It didn’t have to stay in my room, and it didn’t have to (always) be my responsibility. That made me feel a lot better, and she even told me that she was willing to buy me more gifts that aren’t ferret related. 

However, when my dad found out how I felt, he wasn’t fully “on board” with my mom’s idea. In fact, he’s been making me feel guilty for not taking full responsibility of the ferret. Not too long ago, my parents were trying to figure out where to put its cage, and my dad took a passive-aggressive approach to his frustration and said, “Well, maybe if Ava actually took responsibility, we wouldn’t have to worry about this.” 

He’s done plenty of other rude, passive-aggressive things to my face, trying to make me feel guilty. And I mean, it kind of works. I know he’s being a jerk, but still, I can’t help but feel bad for not wanting the ferret. 

Am I being selfish? Should I just suck it up and keep the ferret in my room? Should I have a talk with my dad and try to get him to understand how I feel? Should I talk to my mom and see if we can give the ferret to someone who will take care of it? I don’t know what to do.

Any advice will be appreciated, and I’m willing to answer any questions regarding this post &lt;3 Thank you!",26Dec2020,1

230,"Hiya, I'm just here to blow off some steam, maybe someone can relate to that maybe not but listen I'll explain in a second.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a pretty emotionally hardened guy, there was a lot of shir going on in my life as a kid I didn't quite recovered from lately however everything went worse than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm no stranger to spending Christmas alone in fact I'm spending it alone since four years since my mother died of an liver decease among other things when I was 15, I usually do go to my father, sadly the interaction is always cut short by his girlfriend he's been with for like 9 years since she absolutelely hates my guts and is extremely possessive of my father and really easily jealous as soon as she isn't the center of attention (It wasn't quite unusual back when I lived there that she physically and verbally assaulted me in a drunken rage) kinda ironic, given my mother died as a cause due to being unable to beat her alcoholism, despite be trying all I could but I was just a kid so it wasn't much.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I sidetracked, recently I lost my job due to my workplace going bankrupt and shutting down, some time later I fell ill unable to work for more than two hours and even collapsing once so I had to stop working for now.

&amp;#x200B;

So the last two months I visited my half sister constantly since I just got my driver's license. I really wanted to hang out with someone, but she's a mess and never get's her life around, so she borrowed money from me, asked me to please buy her food and shop with her and buy her new prepaid cards for her phone and whatever, spending around 270$ for her which she promised to give me back at the end of the month (She didn't), eventually she even moved, didn't cared about a single word I said and didn't packed, she was left alone to clear her apartment on her own in four hours which was impossible on her own so I felt bad and came over and helped her back and bring the stuff to her new place which I never really got any kind of thanks for.

&amp;#x200B;

So eventually however thanks to her I met a girl, I'll just call her Mary here. So Mary just recently broke up with her boyfriend due to him cheating on her with her best friend, being still somewhat inexperienced because it never went beyond cuddling she was perfect as I was not experienced either, so we chatted with eachother and found quite a liking to one another, eventually we got together after four weeks of writing with one another, I knew she can be trusted since my sister does as Mary constantly used to help her out before so I thought she could be trusted and it was quite nice having a girlfriend again, I had a girlfriend before I waa together with for 2 Years but never met in person and the contact just suddenly disappeared and I nevwr heard something from her again leaving me quite depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

So she eventually asked for a prepaid card for her phone so she can later call me, telling me she felt guilty to ask such so early on but I was a nice person and didn't hesitated to drive to the nearest gas station amd got her that, over the few weeks we had been together, she used to constantly beg me to basically help outy half sister financially since I didn't wanted to anymore given she never gave me back any money she owned.

&amp;#x200B;

This was quite weird but I didn't cared because eventually I just gave in and did it I wanted to make everyone happy even if it means destroying my small savings, so it went on and on until my sister needed 70$ to get with a train a couple of towns away to meet up with her fiancé for the first time, I wasn't gonna do it since first she still owed me alot of money and I wasn't supportive of their relationship, given they proposed to one another one week after coming together and me finding out he casually said to his friends they are only together because she 'forced' him to. But eventually I couldn't help but feel bad so I gave her the money and she drove of the next day meeting her friend, in the mean while I and my new girlfriend wanted to meet eachother, we agreed to met at a hotel, she wanted to pay for everything despite me insisting I would (We couldn't go to my place due to strict rules in the house and other roommates) I didn't wanted sex, I just wanted to hold someone for once and spend genuine time with an person amd finally meet her in person, I'm a small and shy guy so it was quite exciting, she asked for another prepaid card so I got her the card as she wanted to take the train to my town and book a hotel there the next day, that was 23.12.

&amp;#x200B;

So a day passed and I heard nothing back, I just shrugged it off, thinking perhaps she just takes the train a other day, I left a message but she didn't read it, the next day however I started to worry a little and messaged my sister. She messaged back telling me she didn't heard anything about her either, so I once again messaged my girlfriend, again she didn't read it. So I messaged my sister instead. Messaged arrived and she read it but she didn't answered, this all continued the same I worry more and more, my girlfriend doesn't read it and my sister when I write it just reads it but doesn't answer despite me saying how worried and sad I am.

&amp;#x200B;

This just continued for now a few days already, I just saw my girlfriend online for a few minutes but she didn't read any message, same with my sister who still didn't answered once just reading.

236,"Lemme give y'all some background.

So, basically, music is my(16M) life. I've been playing piano since i was 4, guitar and drums when i was 5 and I've been picking up other instruments and have been teaching myself how to play them (with a little help from teachers here and there) since i was 12. I've always been at the top of my class for music and have had a music scholarship throughout high school (years 7-12)

I take lessons for piano and drums and ultimately i enjoy the drums more. I'm in AMEB Grade 8 for Piano which is the last grade for piano (then there's other certificates and stuff). I enjoy piano up until grade 4. This is when i started to dislike it. I've kinda just been rolling with the punches and trying to ride it out till i finish, but now i truly dread ir. I like playing the beautiful pieces but the fact that it's not for my enjoyment (as i believe it should be) and is instead for me to play in front of a marker to be given a grade and a certificate really doesn't sit right with me. It's become more of a chore than a fun activity for me. 

I've told my mom about this but she says stuff like ""just finish it, it's the last grade."" and other things like that. IIRC, i once said something along the lines of ""How about you try doing 8th grade piano after years of the same thing?"" and she started talking to me about what she had to do for university and her job. I had nothing to say back then, but thinking about it makes me realise that the years of studying and working day by day is something that brings her the money and the life that she, my siblings and i all live, and while I will always be grateful for this, the difference is that I will ultimately have nothing to gain.

The reason i say nothing to gain is because whenever I talked about going into uni to study music and make a career out of it, my mom says that it isn't a good career path to go down and so I've decided not to make it my career. I am, however, making my own music and putting it out there hoping to become a successful artist. 

She also says if i quit, she won't pay for any other lessons either. I would be happy to pay for them as well, but i'm not allowed to get a job because it is my last year in high school (i graduate in 2021) and she says i need to focus on school 100%. This i completely understand, but i don't agree with.

I'm not trying to say i don't want to do piano all together, I just want to do something different. I've been really into jazz for almost 2 years now and i want to get jazz lessons for piano. I don't have much freedom outside of the confines of my home so this is something really important to me.

I don't know what to do at this point.

I tend to lose my shit very easily and get mad at him and I always feel terrible after but I can’t control it sometimes, I break down because I know it’s just a side effect but it’s hurting my relationship. 

Now the problem is we’re about to be long distance for 6 months, we’re both moving to different places. The previous times we’ve been long distance our relationship has always fallen apart. My insecurities are through the roof, I keep feeling like he’s going to lose interest. I just want to not fuck it up. When I’m hurting I tend to get mad and suddenly I can’t control my emotions. How can I get over these insecurities? How can I just trust that he loves me?",26Dec2020,1

244,"I need help. I’m tired of fighting the same fight in my head, I don’t know what to do anymore. 
I was diagnosed with EDNOS a few months back and I have this problem where I choose when to fall into my disorder or not. Do not get me wrong, the thoughts are there 24/7, but I have points where I am strong enough to resist and other times when I don’t care anymore and fall for them. My eating disorder feels comforting to me in the weird insane way. I can’t explain it, but looking at all these old anorexic recipes and thinspo’s make me feel so calm and in control. I don’t understand. I logically know that restricting does not work and I will put on all the weight I will have lost but it is so hard to recover when past behaviours bring me such peace. How do I incorporate old behaviours in such a way I am still being healthy, but comfortable enough that I can trick myself into feeling like I’m still listening to the disorder?

246,"I am not a funny person. I guess I just suck at making jokes. I have been trying to learn how did a while now but I guess it's not something I'll be good at anytime soon. I want to be a charismatic person, someone people like to be around and honestly the best way to do that is being funny, everyone loves a funny guy. I am just not though. I have a number of insecurities I am trying to work on. I know I talk too much, but I do that because I feel like if I don't talk a lot I'm not rly part of the conversation, that I'm just there. That's not the secret to charisma. In all honesty charisma comes from feeling good about yourself and letting that rub off on other people. I guess based on that definition I don't have to be funny, but I don't really buy that. I mean the people you like to be around are generally funny. IDK, I have been consideri g just shutting up and listening. This would let me have time to think before speaking and not say dumb shit just to feel a part of the conversations and maybe let me be funnier (but IDK if it would actually make me funnier cause I'd struggle to tell if what I thought was funny). IDK, I feel like I need to filter more but everyone else says to be funnier or more likable you need to lessen your filter. I'm just really confused .

So, I want to be charismatic and I wonder if I have to be funny to do that. I also wonder if I should filter myself more and just shut up and listen, instead of feeling like I have to speak to be part of a conversation.",26Dec2020,1
247,There’s one girl at school (same grade and almost done high school) that comes up to me at random points In the day and hugs me.

249,"Guys this might be a good or it may not be. 

Ok. So I was out with a couple of friends. At a bar nothing really crazy. Having a couple of beers, my friends taking a couple of shot. Nothing weird. 

So this is where the night become interesting. I was speaking to one of friends(let call hom Billy). And other comes by(lets call him Eric) and starts telling us to be quiet. But not like a ssshh. No!! Eric flat out told us stfu i want to hear this. (Yes he was easy dropping) .

So now Eric, Billy and I are quite interested in a convo 3 girls were having.  1 of the girls went out with a guy who had an 11 incher. And this is the surprising part. He was no good in bed. No motion in the ocean, no technique, no oral game. Over all she said it was a waste of time. She was ready for her world to be rocked!. But didnt happen. 

The other chimes (2nd girl).  She like an average size men . But as she said..... the oral game has to be there.  She is more turn on when guys kiss her body. 

3rd girl. Said she has had varies of guys. But the ones that did sand out was the 2 that she cant get out of her mind. 1st guy . She went through the same experience as 1st girl. Sex wasnt there. She felt like since the guy was well hung he didnt have to try. The other experience was a guy who was below average. I remember correctly 5 inches. But she said he really but rrreeallllyyy tried.  He went out of he's way to make her reach o point. He used lotions, oils, creams, toys or vibrators. But even she though she enjoyed those things . He made her get to the o point orally and with penetration.  She said he had stamina and could last. She also said  he would surprise  her like .. when she was showering, he would join her. Wash her body, then wash her back door and go to town with his tongue.  She really enjoy the actually penetration.  But eventually they seperated. But she still remembers how he even though not big, still loved every time they had sex. 

So now my question to you ladies of reddit. 
Have you girls been with a guy who has been below average and how was the motion in the ocean? And did you go back?  or is it 8 inches and above?",26Dec2020,1
250,"So basically I was having an episode of PMDD and posted a stupid comment in response to a video...well a bunch of stupid comments. anyway, she posted a response video that got 1000s of likes. I tried to defend myself later but I kept being told I said certain things when...I didn’t? Like, basically I got told I was a TERF because I called someone an otherkin because their pronouns were faun/faunself, and I genuinely thought that meant they identified as a fawn...apparently that is “mocking someone’s pronouns” and “comparing transness to otherkin”? They made this big response video that explicitly linked to my account, I reported it but they wouldn’t take it down. I’m scared. If they have me blocked, are they allowed to still have a response video to my comment? I don’t know what’s going on. Do I delete my account? Do I record an apology video no one will watch or accept? Do I kill myself? What do I do? Is anyone on this forum in social media? If I change my username (which I can’t do until Jan 1st anyway) does the comment in the video still link to my account?

252,"I know the title is a bit weird but I wasn't sure how to explain it in short. Basically I have only one real life friend  and I don't think that one friend is really that good of a friend. I have a really hard time making friends.

I'm autistic, adhd, and ptsd so I've never been good socially. Only friend I had until middle school was a girl that lived next door to me. After that I got managed to keep a couple friends at a time through high school. When people moved or we grew apart I made new friends but I never made more than a couple. 

After high school though I haven't been able to make a friend to save my life. I'm 24 now and my ex is the only person I've really made as a friend since high school. My only other friends were friends I made in high school. I basically have 3 friends I kept from high school. The first one moved away. I talk to him about once every few months still but that's all we ever do anymore. The second one stopped seeing me recently but it was predictable, we were really close about 5-6 years ago but slowly drifted apart and after I came out as trans he basically talked less and less until he cut ties completely.

The last of those friends is the one I mentioned at the beginning. I see him in person but I think he's a bad friend. It's fun to be with him but it's pretty clear he only does it when he has something to gain. I let him drive my truck after he begged me and he crashed it. He said he would pay me back for the damage or fix it, but never did. I've also lent him money a bunch of times over the last couple years and he doesn't always pay me back. When I try to call him out on it he gets mad and it starts a huge dispute. I've tried to get wiser recently and not lent him anything and now he never wants to see me really.

I've struggled with making new friends, I seem to never click with anyone. I never feel comfortable being the one trying to start the conversation. It feels like even when I tame my fear of it, and I try, when I talk I just make things more awkward. The furthest I've really gotten at making a new friend in the last few years was I started talking to someone who lived near me on facebook. We met up and hung out one day and I had fun, but after that I never got another message so I assumed I must of left a bad impression, because why else would they not contact me anymore. I tried messaging them but they wont message me back.

I've come to realize that isolation takes a toll on my mental health. So I'm trying to remedy that. I don't have any family instate that hasn't cut ties, the only family I still have is out of state. I don't got really anything for friends, and what I have isn't great. I know being in the middle of pandemic ups the difficulty by that much, but what can I do?",26Dec2020,1

black girls shouldn’t be allowed to color their hair, it should be illegal because it’s ugly. When my daughter told her she is mixed and pretty she said “that’s because you can only see the white in me”. What 9 year old comes up with this on her own.

My husband got a text saying his niece didn’t want the doll we got her and doesn’t like that we don’t appreciate the fact she is white. I’m not making this up. It was his sister who gave her the doll. MIL told my niece that I think she is ugly and bad. Because I said she is mixed. So now my niece thinks being mixed race equals ugly and bad.

254,"**\[Trigger Waring\]** I (M25) was sexually harassed and even sexually assaulted often by a few of my fellow male high school sports team peers during a two year period (2009-10) and it caused me poor mental health issues and later therapy, and am wondering what people think about if it is any worth any good in making a report or if I should let it go and move on? 

My \[Long\] story for context to the question I ask if you want to read and understand my dilemma...

I was apart of a sports team for another local school. During my time there, I was often subjected to sexual harassment and at times sexual assault. The harassment involved sexual slurs and insults toward my sexual orientation. I was seemingly singled out and often called ""gay"" and a ""f\*ggot"" and subjected to other sexual insults; and not in a teasing ""rowdy locker room"" way, but in a genuinely rude and mean manner - so much to the point that the coach had to lecture the team and threaten game cancelation just because of the harassments and bullying directed specifically at towards me - even though I never directly told him my problems or asked for help; he just overheard it and addressed all himself - which I'm thankful for. But it didn't stop. I was constantly asked if I was really gay; and I was seemingly NOT liked for my assumed sexual identify ...I couldn't make friends.

On top of the harassment and verbal/mental/social bullying. I also suffered sexual assault. A few of my  older peers, especially on in particular, really had it out for me. One guy would regularly try to humiliate me in front of others by shoving me against walls or lockers and hump me, he even once did this while we were alone, and at another time reached around and grabbed my crotch while humping me. It was really messed up and I would try to fight him off and would tell him to stop and screw off, to no avail. He also once in the locker room, while I was bent over changing, blind-sided me and pressed his crotch into my head/face - and everyone burst out laughing; but I was horrified.

In Addition, some of the guys would hold me down in the locker room, bend me over, pull my pants down to my underwear, and insert objects into my rear, even at times their fingers which is really gross to think about, but... anyways, it'd hurt me, hamulate me, and I'd hate it, especially while they laughed. Once, while I was naked changing out of my sports gear, I had my clothes and gear taken form me and spread out in various unreachable places and some placed in front of the girls locker room door, left all for me to get naked, until one of the only friends I had helped me get my stuff back.

It was **all unconsensual** and I tried to make it clear to the perps. I eventually become too depressed and fed up and ended up quitting my favorite sport. I never told the coach or anything about what was happening out of fear and shame, until I told my parents and therapist years later. 

**So I ask,** is any of this worth reporting? Do you think any good would come out of it? I asked my therapist and they said ""why not?"" I asked my parents and they said they don't want the drama and told me to move on.  What do you think?",26Dec2020,1

259,"Sorry for the length on this one, I wanted to cover everything so I can get the best advice possible. 

So my girlfriend and I moved into our place in February 2020. Place is great, no issues and we get along with all of the neighbours (it’s a townhome). In June we were driving home from her parents and passed someone on a bike riding along the side of the street. Nothing special about it, gave nearly 2 meters of room and didn’t cut in front. We stopped at the store near our house to get chips and the guy on the bike followed us there and started trying to fight me and yell at me for passing him. We exchanged some words but nothing happened and we headed home. He then followed us home and started at it again, threatening us. We exchanged more words and ended up just going inside and that was the end of it. Keep in mind, this whole thing was caught on my dash cam which I saved the footage. 

Fast forward a month and turns out the guy moves in two doors down from us - great! A month goes by and he put a letter in our mailbox at 3am one day (our security cameras picked it up) and it was a sort of half-assed apology letter. We ended up shaking hands one night and making amends. 

Since he moved in, he has harassed and threatened many other neighbours. One morning my outdoor camera caught him threatening his direct neighbour to kick their door down and kick their ass because their kids were going up and down the stairs in the morning to get ready for school. (Our walls are concrete so I can’t see how it would’ve been that loud, plus it was about 8am). 

Now, today (Christmas Day) I was outside shovelling snow out of my parking spot and I decided to shovel our shared walkway as well as the stairs and clean off the snow from my neighbours moms car and clear her snow too. His parking spot is directly beside the walkway to the stairs, however he doesn’t drive at all nor does he have a car. Most of the snow I picked up and brought to the grass and set it there but there was a bit at the end and I put exactly a small shovel’s worth of snow into the side of the spot cause it was the furthest away from the grass. No big deal, didn’t think anything of it. (Again, all on camera)

As I’m shovelling this guy came out and started calling me and my girlfriend names and threatening to fight me because I had put this small amount of snow in his unused parking spot. Of course, we exchanged some words but I eventually removed myself and went inside. We made the decision to call the non-emergency police to file a complaint as well as contacted the rental company for our units to put in a complaint. My direct neighbour between us also put in a complaint against him due to the constant harassment. The officer came out and told us she was going to file a report and get us in touch with the proper unit that handles neighbour disputes. 

Now, my neighbour between us actually sent me a screenshot of a message he sent to him earlier today after everything happened and at the end of it he was making death threats towards me, saying that he can make me disappear and stuff like that. Of course, now we feel unsafe in our own home because of this guy. We’re also pretty sure he’s not on the lease where he lives and is just a non-lease roommate. 

Just wondering if you think that calling the police was too much and what you think about the situation and what we should do? We love our place and we get along great with everyone - it’s just this one guy who’s making our lives hell. Any help is appreciated, and happy holidays!",26Dec2020,1

261,"I am 23 now and want to get toned. I am about 6 foot and weigh 160. I'm about your average 23 year old as far as build, but I have flab on my lower stomach I'd like to get rid of and get overall toned. However, I have a couple problems...

1. My heart. I have a heart rate of 120 walking around. I work in retail and it usually goes anywhere from 100 to 120 doing that. I wouldn't consider really any of it exercise since it doesn't feel like one. Just a lot of walking.

I also have premature ventricular contractions. I worked with a cardiologist and learned my maximum heart rate is about 197 and I shouldn't push my heart rate beyond 145ish. However, as you can imagine, it's not hard to get it from 120 (when you're not pushing or exerting myself) to above 147 with mild exertion. So... That's a difficult time... I am taking medication daily to reduce the contractions (verapamil to be exact) so don't worry. I have been seeing Dr's about my heart for a bit. :) but the high heart rate has me concerned... 

Other than that, I have no asthma or any other health issues. Perfectly healthy besides that! 

2. I don't have any direction in life or motivation. I've never experienced the fire of sports. The passion, the drive. Never. I have sat at home playing video games for most of my life. :) I'm an introvert and mostly keep to myself. If it weren't for my fast metabolism, which is likely going to slow down in the next year or 2, I would be a very fat guy. I'm not competitive.... I'd rather lose to someone than best someone and run the risk of damaging them. (a sentiment I'm working to overcome) So as you can imagine, I feel very apathetic towards most things. And after the first couple days of working out, I have extreme difficulty working out.

I am doing things for my health. While I don't have super well balanced diet, I do drink only water or powerade when I want to splurge. I don't drink soda or really high sugar things. I also only eat in a 10 hour window. Outside of that, I consume nothing but regular water to try to maintain a healthy cercadian rhythm. I take vitamin D every day and I try to make sure to always eat a high fiber breakfast. (90% of the time I do)

I'm completely new to working out. I have here and there but... When I get my heart rate up it worries me. I know that's counter intuitive to exercise but, that's something I'm going to have to get over. If I could get any advice for how to work out.. Or build myself... How to do rest periods and how long to... You know.. The whole 9 yards for someone new to working out.

The only catch is, I want to do it at home. I have 2 dumbells with customizable weight. And 2 5lb ones. That's the only equipment I have. Before I was mostly doing body weight exercise.

After a couple months, I'd like to post on here that I followed the advice of individuals here and specify my results. Even if this post never gets looked at again, it'd still feel nice to know that something is waiting on me for results. To help me follow through and keep going, knowing that there's a possibility I could let someone out there down if I came back with bad news. I care deeply about others... And I feel it would push me through. 

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you so much.",26Dec2020,1

To make a long story short, I've had issues with my mother for years. Shes been very emotionally and mentally abusive, but I love her so I've put up with it over the years. However, it's gotten really bad in the past few months, and tonight it hit a very explosive point.

I had been upset with her for a few various reasons and when she confronted me about it thanks to a text from my girlfriend (who she promised she would help me calm down and talk it out) she began yelling at me. My stepdad joined in when I tries to defend myself, and eventually I asked them to just leave me alone and to go away. Not mature and not the right way to handle the situation, but I couldnt deal with both of them at once.

That was when my mother threatened to ""slap the shit out of"" me. And then escalated to ""or punch you in the eye,"" because ""you're 18 now, I can do that.""

Shes never threatened violence with me before, and it's really my breaking point. I'm hurt and honestly scared, as while I dont believe she would actually do it the fact that she said it just makes me feel so awful. I left the house for a walk afterwards and called my dad (who lives four hours away) and talked to him about the possibility of me moving in with him for the time being. However, I'm supposed to be moving in with my girlfriend (who thankfully lives very far away from my family) in two week's time, which is also in the direct opposite way of my dad by hours.

270,"Hi , i'm currently 24 years old (M) and almost no ""life experiences"" , i still live with my parents and i have what i think is , severe social anxiety , i have no job as well (though i would love to have a job i can enjoy and feel comfortable with) but i just can't stay longer than a week because i feel they are judging me even though that is most likely not the case.

What makes it worse is that my family is having some financial issues and i can't help them because of my issue.

I have not spoken to anyone about this and probaly never will ,but seeing that i probaly won't meet any of you guys irl , i feel i can ""unload"" here 

I'm also very depressed , i keep thinking that i'm a failure in life and that i can't even help my parents out during a difficult time , how will i even be able to provide for a family of my own one day?(if i somehow manage to reach that point).  I also don't have many clothing (back to the financial issues i mentioned) and that just sparks my anxiety even more because i think of how they will judge me for wearing the same stuff multiple times during a week.

I'm gonna be honest and say that yes i do have suicidal thoughts sometimes but never act on it , as i know it will just hurt my parents further and i DO NOT want that but it gets hard sometimes.

The only thing thats keeping me sane these days is my pc (even though i can't really play any games i like because it being old and no funds to buy new games but i'm not ungrateful and thankful for what my parents have done for me so far)

I know that this is a massive wall of stuff and i wouldn't blame you if you just briefly looked through it but my question is , How can i do better , what can i do to be better , what MUST i do to be better?. I'm not getting any younger and would like to at least have some during my time on this planet

Any advice would be much appreciated , Thank you and stay safe \^\^",26Dec2020,1

273,"Like the title says, I'm wasting my life and have been for I really long time. I have no friends, no social life, work a dead end fast food job that makes me miserable, and have no clue what to do with myself. I went through  some serious social anxiety and depression issues starting back when I was in middle school, lost all my friends because of it, and didn't make any new ones. I missed so many milestones. I've never been to a party, never been on a date, never drank, never had sex, never found any hobbies, never went on any trips, never got my drivers license, never did anything remotely enjoyable or interesting with another human throughout my teens . I went to a community college in my small town for something I didn't care for because my overprective parents pushed me to. My mental health issues started to even out around the time I started, and I thought that I could use college as a fresh start, but since it was so small, it didn't offer any clubs or any opportunities to interact with people outside of lectures. I graduated with an associate's degree last year and spent the rest of the year trying to save up as much money as I could hoping that I could go travel and enjoy my youth and do the shit that I'm supposed to do at this age. Then the pandemic hits. I end up leaving my decent paying retail job because of it and spent four months cooped up with my parents. Eventually I become desperate for some kind of social interaction with people other than my family and start looking for another job, but my town doesn't have much to offer and I end up in a fast food job I can't stand. So here I am in the middle of this fucking pandemic, halfway through my 20th year on this earth with the life experience of an 11 year old and nowhere to go from here.

274,"My immediate family and my cousin's family used to be really close up until a couple years ago due to a dispute between the the two brothers (my dad and uncle). As a result, we started to drift apart and now we only cross paths a couple times a year. I used to have a close relationship with my cousin (who's  6 years younger than me) and were like brother and sister. We would catch up on most weekends however, largely because our two families would get together on most weekends. This all stopped when the two brothers got into an argument and we all stopped hanging out. My cousin and I didn't really communicate via text or social media because we saw each other most weekends so we never had that sort of connection and due to the age gap. The age gap isn't such a problem anymore but at the time she was only 17 while I was 23 so we didn't have many common interests. 

Most recently, I would only hear from my cousin when I'd send a text for Christmas, New Years, or her birthday however, I would always have to make the first move and send the text before I'd get some dry reply from her. Even though these messages never led the rekindling of our friendship or any sort of meaningful conversation, I thought I'd keep the peace and therefore, even though we didn't really speak anymore, I felt the least I could do was wish her well and make a small effort. For a while I had this hunch that she used to only send me a message back for Christmas etc because I made the first move and she felt obliged to reply. Well this year, I didn't hear from her for my birthday (not the first time) and I waited to see yesterday if she'd send something for Christmas but I never heard from her.  I then found out through my brother that she had sent him a generic text for Christmas as part of a group message but I didn't receive anything. We have never argued, I have never gossiped about her or ever done anything intentionally to hurt her. There are only two reasons I can think of as to why she would be upset with me.  
   
The first is because when her sister passed away last year, maybe she felt I wasn't really there for her because I didn't call or text her constantly to see how she was. The thing is, during her sister's 2 year battle with cancer, every time we'd visit to see her in hospital, we would always get the cold shoulder from my aunt and uncle and therefore we didn't feel welcomed there. When we were in my cousin's hospital room, we'd sit in silence because they didn't want to converse with us due the fallout of the brothers' argument but we'd still make the effort to go to the hospital every weekend/fortnight, to support my now deceased cousin. It got to the point that whatever we did, we were always in the wrong with my aunt and uncle. If we were there at the hospital, they'd act all cold and give us the silent treatment (which was really apparent because there were multiple instances where other visitors would come to the hospital while we were there and my aunt and uncle would behave completely differently around them and act all social right in front of us.) If we didn't visit every weekend/fortnight, then we were criticized by them to our mutual family friends and they'd keep tabs on how often we'd visit. They would compare how many times we'd visit them to my aunt's brother who unlike all the members in my immediate family, didn't work full-time and therefore could visit multiple times a week. The cousin who has now shunned me wasn't really at the hospital when we'd visit on the weekend because she would normally work weekends.  


The second reason is probably due to my aunt. The reason why the two brother's argued was because my aunt is a compulsive liar and gossiper, and would gossip about my family and grandparents to all our mutual family friends. We found out because one of our family friends revealed to us that my aunt had made public some very personal family matters to all our mutual friends, which then led to my dad confronting his brother (my uncle) about my aunt's gossiping.   
It's just a suspicion but I feel my aunt may have got into my cousin's ear and criticized me and my brother to my cousin about how we aren't supportive, and aren't there for her etc.    
    
Following her sister's death, we were all devastated and I became a bit of a hermit while I processed and came to terms with what had happened. Maybe I wasn't around enough for my cousin but the few times we spoke face to face, she seemed completely fine and never once confronted me or gave me the cold shoulder. As far as I'm aware, I haven't wronged anyone so I'm not sure why she is behaving like this.

 I spoke to my parents about this and they feel that I need to confront her and find out what the problem is and why she has shunned me. I'm of the opinion that I don't need to confront her because I'm not the one with the problem and if she doesn't want to speak to me then so be it. The truth is, I never want to speak or see my aunt and uncle again because they've always been jealous and hateful. As for my cousin, it is a shame because we used to be close but if she has a problem with me, and I feel I haven't done anything wrong, do I  need to be the one to make the effort and confront her?

280,"I (F18) made my friend (M19) a gift for Christmas that I put a lot of time and thought into. I gave it to him and he seemed to love it, and he gave me mine, but it was 2 shirts and a sweater that he knows that I know he's had for a long time. When he gave the sweater to me, he mentioned he couldn't sell it, which made me feel like it was something he just wanted to get rid of. We used to date and broke up in August, and I'm pretty sure he knows I'm still sad about. He was the one who broke up with me for academic reasons, and we decided to stop talking at the end of October so we could get over each other 

We also had agreed  we could still get each other gifts for holidays, but we didn't ""have"" to. In my eyes you give a gift when you care about the person and want to show that, and so if you didn't want to give a gift you don't think about them enough/care enough to. 


I didn't spend much on him, but I did take a lot of time making it and putting it together nicely. He didn't even wrap mine or put it in a gift bag. I know you shouldn't give a gift so that you can get one- that's not how I felt at all. I wanted to show I cared about him as a friend and it hurts because it feels so one sided, like he was saying he didn't care. I don't care about price tags, I just care about effort. Something small would have made me happy, but I felt like he just gave me things he had no use for. 

Is it reasonable to feel upset? 

I know I still have feelings for him, that's not the question. My question is what does it mean? Does it mean he doesn't even want to be friends/doesn't care at all? He initially stressed that he wanted to stay friends after the breakup. Do guys not give presents to their friends? Is this normal/a cause for concern?",26Dec2020,1

Merry Christmas to those reading. Hope your holidays are better than mine.

21 year old female who still lives with parents at home with a year and half of college to finish. Have a good job that pays alright, but I only work half time.

I’ve made the decision to begin saving up to leave this god forsaken house. Over dinner, my father degraded me (which isn’t the first time) and discouraged me saying that I’m not doing enough to exercise. I’ve been exercising privately on my own time (7AM or at night) and I have my own personal trainer? I’m trying to get into the Navy after college and I think I’m doing pretty good so far.

Parents are also a roadblock on a relationship with a boyfriend, in which we are both mature and have long term goals for the both of us. They allow him to come over and vice versa, but there’s so many constraints.

My parents are also Trump supporters, in which I am not, and so there’s a lot of disagreements and permission to be doing things. I have a 5pm curfew to be back at the house and I’m not allowed to sleep over my boyfriend’s house, even though him and I are being perfectly safe (something I’m not trying to explicitly be public about cos.. my sex life is PRIVATE wtf?)


TLDR; My parents are a pain to deal with and I’m on my way to save up to move out. Any tips on where or start and... Should I really be doing this? Or am I overreacting?",26Dec2020,1

On the other hand, there are specialties like book Illustration, animation, cinema arts and so on... I like these better because they don't rely on math all that much and I think competition is not much of a problem there.

He switched schools which resulted in the end of a lot of his friendships. He struggled making new friends at his new school and had multiple instances in which his friendships ended turning sour. One of his friendships was on and off due to some of the mistreatment that he received from this friend until my brother finally cut him off for good. They were kind of in a group together so he lost all the other friends in that group as well. More recently, he started the new school year and made a friend group, but doesn’t see or connect with them much due to the quarantine.

290,"Hi! 

I'm a female who is currently In an online relationship with a male. this relationship is really going great, though there has been a few things that has been bothering me. I feel quite selfish about it. most of my friends are telling me it's perfectly ok to feel like this, but of course they could be biased towards me. before I go on, I've been in two toxic relationships, one I'm close friends with one and the other one I despise. my boyfriend is actually really close with the one I despise. 

This is the first reason why I feel selfish and just a horrible person, he is really close to my ex. my ex is the reason why my boyfriend and I met. they are really close friends. of course my boyfriend, or friend at the time was the person I went too when thing went to hell. I didn't know what to do, he was the only one who knew my ex on a personal level. he knows how toxic he was to me, and he still is friends with him. I don't think I would have had a problem with it besides how he always mentions that he could add me into group chats with him, and let's him play with us (usually just in game, no call) of course I decline the group chats and get uncomfortable when he plays games with us. 

another reason why I feel quite selfish is that he doesn't give me much attention. this is is a weird one for me, cause it goes into the female stereo type that all we want is attention. though, I feel like wouldn't have had a problem with it if this wasn't almost a daily thing. he's constantly online, meaning he's probably in a call or texting. and lately he's been calling me for about 20 minutes, maybe more? i'm lucky if it's an hour. the call is always ended with me hearing the discord call noise and him saying ""I love you, call you back in a bit"" and he never does. or if he does, it's at 4 am and it's a 20 minute call with him soon falling asleep. nor does he really text me, maybe one here or there. of course it bothers me when I see that he's playing with my ex for long periods of time. or just the knowledge that he's gaming. 

I'm not really sure what to do, could I get some advice? am I being a super toxic lover and selfish? is it normal to feel like this?",26Dec2020,1

292,"Hello, I need advice on my 16 year old sister.

Over the past few months she has been stressing my parents and grandparents out. She stays out until 4AM with her friends (mostly guys), doesn't pick up her calls, does not let us know where she is going, and ignores my mom and dad (even on Christmas) when all they've done was treat her with respect. The only time when she's nice to them is when she needs money. 

This has been going on since spring 2020 - we always talk to her reasonably, i.e. explain why staying past 12 is not okay but if she HAD to, she just needed to let us know where she was and when she would be home. She would always respond with a form of ""okay I understand"" and it would happen again literally the next day. 

My parents are too sweet to yell at her, but they did flip out a few times like when she came home at 6am once. I try my best to remind her that we trust her to stay out, its just that she needs to answer her phone if she wants to stay past 12. I also remind my parents that they need to let her know that they trust her with her decisions and to not push too hard because it will just make her push us away. 

However, this behaviour is continuing - she worries my grandparents so much that they wander the house and cannot sleep. My mom and dad are constantly worried as well - we cannot get ahold of her or of any her friends. 

I am her brother and am staying home because my university classes are online. I normally would support her doing whatever she wants as long as she meets reasonable rules, but I find myself getting angrier and angrier that she blatantly refuses to follow any rules despite getting so much freedom already, in addition to seeing my parents/grandparents in such stressed out states. 

I am writing to ask advice on what to do. I do not know much on parenting/teenagers, as I always followed the rules my parents set out for me as they gave me freedom similar to my sister. 

My parents refuse to take her phone away because she will sneak out regardless and it would be impossible to get ahold of her. My friend suggested that we set up an intervention. I am out of ideas, I feel like we have been permissive enough, but she just does not listen to words.

I feel like this is classic teenager stuff, but my parents and I still cannot figure this out. Please give us some advice!

293,"So just to preface, I know that my oversensitivity comes from a ton of childhood trauma. My mom was really abusive, emotionally more that anything. Lots of screaming, breaking things, saying awful things to me, and often for no real reason. 

As an adult, I’ve found that because of that I’m really sensitive, mainly to other people’s anger. 

Like a random burst of anger or irritation from another person sends me into a spiral and makes me feel awful for basically the whole day.

It’s usually worst when I feel like the anger or irritation is unfair or undeserved like my boss is snapping at me over a problem I didn’t cause, or a man on the street yelling nasty things at me for ignoring his catcall.

Like I think that’s all typical stuff, especially living in a big city, that normal people just brush off and move on from, but I can’t. 

I’m in therapy and taking medication, but I don’t know what else to do. The only times I feel better in those situations is when I feel like I successfully stood up for myself. 

That doesn’t happen often as I’m not good at that, and often times I feel that I avoid more conflict and anger when I deescalate, but afterwards I always feel like I just let someone walk on me and I feel helpless and small. 

The anger, anxiety and fear that comes up in those moments is sometimes overwhelming for me, and occasionally I even have nightmares about stupid little confrontations that have happened. I just woke up from one which is why I’m writing this.

I did not know the packages was delivered as my mom got to it before me. She asked me why he was sending me stuff and I told her because of Christmas. Right in front of me, she began to open it. I begged her not to open it as it was mine and she basically said her house her rules. She analyzed each present and left me the box with all items to now see for myself. 

This whole situation highly upset me. There is no bad blood between my mom and him. However, my mom ensures she stays in control of me somehow or someway. This in my opinion was too far. I don’t know how I should address her on how to lay off. I understand I’m in her house now and I’m only 23. But I feel that I deserve respect and independence again. How should I address her?",26Dec2020,1

Everything was our own decision nothing was forced or asked for, i’m actually the one who brought it up. I’m 15 and he’s 17 so it’s not a big age gap. We’re kind of a long distance couple we live in the same state but we live 2 hours away from each other plus we have strict parents. I’ve talked with my mom abt the whole age gap thing and she said that if he can wait till your 18 to have sex then he’s worth it if not then leave him. He said he was willing to wait and i’m ok with that but showing our bodies is a different story in my eyes. I was teasing him a little by getting naked *he only saw my top half* but then i hid under the covers when my mom barged in and saw that i wasn’t wearing a top, lifted up the blanket and saw that i was naked. My boyfriend panicked and hung up and my mom stormed away.

299,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for two months now. I’ve noticed the past week or so she’s been distant over text. Our last date was Friday the 18th. I thought we had a good time. Then the whole weekend we didn’t speak. Then Monday I called her and we talked for three minutes and I tried to make a date but she said she was unsure and would text me about it later. She never did. 

She then texted me Thursday to say Merry Christmas Eve and told me she was busy the past couple days and was busy today too. Once again I brought up her schedule, and I told her I missed her. She said she missed me too but that her family was spending the next week at her uncle’s at a a different until New Years. 

Then at 12:00am she wished me Merry Christmas and when I woke up I replied to it and asked how her night was. Then she took 10 hours to get back to me and answered and said she hoped things were going well for me on Christmas. Then we talked for a bit about what we got for Christmas and she said that her family wasn’t going to her uncle’s anymore. I didn’t bring up getting together since I just didn’t want to push her after asking twice now. I then sent a goodnight text and she didn’t reply to it and left it unopened while she was active on social media afterwards.

I just feel like she’s not into me and may be talking to someone else. I feel like calling her up and telling her this. I just woke up in the middle of the night and I feel heartbroken. What do I do?",26Dec2020,1

302,"This has been a friend of mine since we were 10, we've gone a few years not being friends but have made up and moved past issues. Right now I'm not sure what's going on.

Last December we started hanging out together again after a long time, nothing happened just lost contact with being busy. So we start hanging out once or twice a month. Literally everything was great until March when she got a bf and moved to a new city and hour away. We were still in contact but seeing eachother stopped.

In August and September she was asking to hang out a lot, I had to decline once or twice due to work but promised her I'd go see her new place. We saw eachother in september but I was just meeting her bf so it was an hour of catching up. Honestly not much was said, we laughed and chatted but it wasn't like a normal hang out. It felt awkward and unnatural. So the last time I saw her was in September, and she basically stopped talking to me since. I'll try and make plans to come up, I'll ask her when she's free and she says she'll let me know...never lets me know. I ask again and she says again I'll let you know. Still doesn't let me know. 

I send her videos or pictures and get a read message. I ask her how she's doing and she responds with ""ok, hbu"". I went 2 weeks without messaging her just to see if she'd say something and nothing. So late November I asked her if everythings ok because we havent talked in awhile and she said we're ok she's just busy working. 

I can understand if she's busy working but this seems weird to not even talk to me or make plans at all, especially after us becoming close earlier this year. I want to ask what's wrong and if anything happened but it feels weird asking her again when I just asked what's wrong in November. How do I bring this up? To me it really feels like she doesn't want to be friends.",26Dec2020,1
303,Im 15/m and recently have been dealing with severe depression for a while now since ive had a rough childhood. About 5 or more years ago i met my first ever step dad since my real dad was never really in my life. My step dad also has a older daughter the same age as me and recently shes been like my only friend ever in life and i felt like i could really relate with her. Whenever i was feeling super shitty or depressed she would always be there for me to make me feel better and give me hugs or let me lean on her. When i would hug her or lean on her i never really saw it as much but last week on a ride back home i had my head on her shoulder during the ride because i was going through something at the time and after we got home he had a talk with me how he doesnt want me having physical contact like that with her including hugs. I didnt really say anything to him cuz hes a big scary dude but he was actually very nice.

305,"Right now I’m on break and I feel great, but I can’t help but think about how much agony I’ll be in when my break is over and I have to start school again. I just finished my first semester of college and it really brought to my attention how angry I get while doing assignments. I developed a strategy to de-stress before and after doing my assignments. (Eating breakfast, exercising, stress ball, breathing exercising, meditating). All of these methods should’ve reduced my immense stress by at least a little bit right? But they didn’t. Every time I would sit down to do an assignment after about an hour or two of trying to calm myself down, it would be like I did nothing. I was still getting mad every time I opened my laptop and looked at an assignment. Most people would say, “If you find yourself getting frustrated, take a break and come back” If I were to take a break every time I got frustrated I would be taking a break about every 5 minutes, and I would get absolutely nothing done. Every day throughout my semester I sat there doing calculus with my skin crawling, mind wandering, foot tapping, etc. It was actual agony for no reason. I would end up throwing something or hitting my desk at least 2 times a week. So I guess my question is... what is wrong with me?? People always said I would get used to it but I never heard anyone struggle for as long as I did?? What do I do? I’d also like to point out that I don’t think I have anger issues, the only thing that has ever made me this mad is school. (Thanks for taking the time to read this if you did)",26Dec2020,1

308,"Okay so there’s a lot of stuff that went down. It’s also 3am for me so hopefully I can type okay for you guys and try to explain myself well. Here we go! 

So a year ago my younger half sister got disgruntled at me for something that was totally wrong. My dad needed something from my mom and I. My birth certificate to be exact. At the time my mom worked till 5 everyday and I went to school and worked everyday. So Saturday evening when I’m working, my sister snaps me and says that they need that by Saturday. Keep in mind that where I live the post office is all the way across town, it closes at 4 and it’s not open on the weekends. And the only day I had off was Thursday and I was going to pay the fees to get it shipped in time. My dad asked me Wednesday night if I had sent it or not and I replied “no, I told my mom” and he went off on me. Which I get he needs it and he’s stressed out. But I got upset and my mom got upset that he didn’t call her like an adult should and she went off on him how he doesn’t do much for me, how he should’ve told HER instead of my younger sister snapping me for it sooner than last minute. Also saying he should’ve apologized for things that he did in the past, etc. next thing I know my dad hangs up and my sister is texting me horrible things about how I don’t love my father and how I’m bad bc I’m a white daughter and I don’t fit in with them. Things like that. So I apologize and say you know we had some miscommunication, I’m sorry my mom went off on dad, I love you we can fix this. She continued to act like that so..

I apologized again 2 weeks later and then 2 months later, while reaching out to our cousins on that side of the family for guidance. Around April(covid time) I went to my boyfriends for the weekend and covid got really bad so my mom told me to stay with him and his family for a little. His sister had to move out of her dorm, so of course we went. 
My dads birthday is in April and I got a card for him figuring I would stop by and say happy birthday(my dads family lives 40 minutes away from my boyfriends family) but I didn’t go bc one I was with his family and he doesn’t like them bc they are white. Also my sister and family probably hate me bc they haven’t talked to me since that incident. And I get it family fight but I hardly see them and I have really bad anxiety. So it was hard for me to force myself to go. 
Later that day I posted a snap of me at the college, bc I got accepted there. And my sister bashes me again about how I’m horrible and saying that I don’t love them. And saying we are going to have a meeting about how I do everything wrong. I told her I can’t do that bc of the mental illnesses that I have. And she said she doesn’t care, that’s not an issue. You get the point more negativity. 

So around July - October the presidential election was  being thought about. Not everyone is positive about that I mean I get it. Next president!! And I decided to post something positive and nice for everyone. Her and my cousin slid up and started bashing me. And they both started manipulating me. 
So while being at the college this semester, I tried to fix things with me and my dad first, explaining what happened about the birth certificate and not coming to see him and about my family hurting my feelings. It was a good conversation, he told me I shouldn’t run away from my problems and that helped me overcome my anxiety a little bit! 
So I came over to visit them for the whole month of December, my sister didn’t talk to me at ALL. She was mad that I came and told my boyfriend that I should’ve never came back. And most of family during Christmas, my step mom, half bother and sister, cousins, aunts and uncles seemed to ignore me. 

So I told my dad that I was going to go to my boyfriends house to visit. Even though they were in a different state. (His family didn’t care that I was there). So I came back home my cousins were still at my house, and my dad asked me in front of everyone if my boyfriend was somewhere else. I know I should’ve just told the truth but I just couldn’t. Not in front of everyone! And he asked again. 

Now I’m leaving tomorrow in the morning and I don’t know if I should tell him the truth about that situation and my sister and having him possibly tell everyone  or not tell him the truth at all. 

- I don’t think I did anything wrong. And its not always about being wrong or right but I’m not sure what To do. I tried to overcome this problem and it’s not working about. 

- should I continue to try(I really don’t want to) i know it’s the right thing to do but I don’t even feel like I’m a part of the family. Or should I just stop talking to them( I really can’t handle the negativity, even if they are my family)

309,"So first of let me say I'm not looking for sympathy in any way, as I feel very disgusting right now. So I'm a pathological lier, and I just recently destroyed a relationship with someone that I think was truly the first time I loved someone. I'm seeking help and going through steps to fix my life, but I feel like the damage is done. For majority of my life I've lied to impress others and to put on a persona, because I wasn't happy with how my life turned out. Not to say it hasn't been a good life or I haven't done things of note, it's just idk, in my head I feel as if I was never good enough. A few months back in August, I met the most amazing girl with the most unique name. At the time I didn't care or really want to know anyone. But when I did I wanted to start over with her ya know, speak the truth on who I am. Unfortunately that's not what happened, and unconsciously I lied.....about my entire person. Now I don't lie about how I feel on things, or advice I give, or my beliefs and personality, all that's shines through. We started dating back in October after I broke my foot for her lol, and asked her out the same night, she said yes. We dated for about two months, but her parents are over bering and forced her to leave me. And for the next month we been struggling alot to keep our tempers and thoughts to our selves. But shit hit the fan this week, and it's been a real eye opener. She talked with my mom and found out everything, that her whole perception of me is a lie. Now like I said, I don't expect sympathy, or good judgement from anyone. But I feel lost and my world is collapsing, even though I know it should be and I'm a terrible person. I've been making huge steps to change, as my best friend is a license counsiler and all, and opening up to him on everything made me feel a bit better, because he wants to help, and he still trusts me. But I feel like I destroyed her world, and hurt alot of people over the years. Shell check in every once in a while, but I feel tonight was the last time for that. I don't think I'll be able to fix it, ever, and idk if I should move on or what. All I know is right now, it's time to fix myself. Any advice?",26Dec2020,1

Uh, some info before I get to the actual advice part, I'm only 14 and may or may not have ADHD.

Anyway, I've always been invested in the future. I've learned to dial it down a bunch and to not be obsessed with it as much as I was a few years ago, and that's all well and sorted, but I'm still struggling with not spontaneously making life-changing choices.

Like, for example, when I was around 6 or 7 years old, I randomly decided that I wanted to make a game company, which was later cancelled because I saw that it was waaaaaaay too ambitious for the time.

Around the age of 12, I randomly got inspiration to try making a similar company, but not limited to video games, which is a lot more problematic than the former company concept.

Why is it more problematic? Well, I'm not the only one involved with this case. One of my friends is part of the thing, and we're working together to make a few movies (not yet of course, it's just in planning for now) and some other projects.

Now, while deciding what to do with this situation is probably post-worthy in and of itself, I felt I should get advice on the matter of not letting history repeat itself.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time creating and using a reddit account since i find this site very helpful in this regard. Thanks in advance for reading this.

I'm currently 18 y/o female. I had this in mind for a while before thinking 'fuck it' and talking about it here.

So, this took place when i was very young. I was probably about 6 or 7 years old. We had quite a simple neighborhood. Opposite to our house was a family of four - mother, father, son and daughter. The daughter was the older sister and son the younger brother.

I don't usually interact much with my neighbors but those people were an exception. The son was probably 13 or 14 (I'm not quite sure) and the daughter was 18 - 19 (again, not sure but she was definitely an older teen or young adult). I remember playing with both of them. Not gonna lie, we had a great time together. The parents were good too, inviting me for lunch and all.

And another thing to note, my parents had divorced and i was living with my working mum. She'd be working during the day and return home by night. I was quite alone, so i was quite happy to have some neighbor friends.

This happened during my summer holidays, because i was all by myself in my home while my mom went to work. As usual, I'd go to my neighbor's house and play around their house with the kids. The son (let's keep his name Lucas) was pretty aggressive and 'manly' to me so i didn't like hanging around with him that much. But the daughter (Sandra) was very sweet and kind. so it'd usually be me and Sandra playing with Lucas occasionally annoying us.

One of the first among the few memories i had on the 'assault' was this, and yes Sandra did this:

The parents and Lucas had gone to the farm near our houses to, maybe pick something? i don't remember. Sandra stayed back with me at their house. She took me to their bedroom and shut all windows and the door. and the next thing i remember is me laying on the bed naked, while she was sucking on my nipple and her hand roaming near my vagina (maybe) caressing it. Now i genuinely don't remember if she penetrated me or not, but the above definitely happen. I even remember after that, she made me suck on her breast, and (maybe?) touch her vagina. I'm positive about this memory, i remember the specifics.

Afterwards, we lay in that bed while she was saying how much she loves me and i was getting shy and maybe she made me say it too, who knows. When we were laying naked on the bed, Lucas returned and was trying to open the window near the bed. Sandra rushed to close the window, while we hurried to get dressed.

The next memory was when the parents were gone outside and Lucas roaming near the house, Sandra shut the door and kissed me. I maybe kissed her back too. After a few minutes, Lucas came banging the door. And this girl blocked the door with a chair and her back while she continued to make out with me.

Then the less significant memory was she smirking at me when we all were having lunch at their house.

Those were the only memories i could remember about this experience. After a few years they moved out and the house was rebuilt. Currently there's another family living there. After they moved out, we didn't remain in contact. The memories faded away slowly. Since i was very young, my memories of that time weren't strong. Soon, I had forgotten their names and faces after they moved out

But there's more. On 2015, I met her again.

My mom was working for a big company at that time. She was the team leader to a group of 20+ people. The Heads were throwing a big party to celebrate the company's anniversary and all the teams across the state's branches were invited. My mom brought me too, since i wanted to go out and i knew a lot of her colleagues.

A few months prior, i had asked her about 'the family that i used to hang out with' (Sandra's family). She then said that the daughter, Sandra, was IN HER TEAM. I never knew about this information and best believe, I had a mini mental breakdown.

So from then on, i was mentally preparing to meet my 'assaulter', but at that time, in my head it was 'the girl who made me have a weird experience' (I didn't have much awareness about sexual assault then).

The day of the party came, and due to some wardrobe malfunction, one of my mom's friends borrowed my evening dress, so i dressed up in jeans and a flannel shirt, nothing revealing. That evening, I was very nervous. I had no idea how she looked, so i felt even more anxious. I didn't know if she remembered what happened, or worse, would try to 'do it' with me again.

After a few hours into the party, mom finally introduced me to Sandra. I didn't remember her face since i was very young when we were neighbors. She was pretty and had a good position in the company.

But the most shocking thing was, she acted like this was her first real interaction with me. Barely 'knew' nothing besides my name. This led me to doubt my own experience. So, with a leap of courage, I separated from my mom and sat beside her (while having my mom in vicinity). I wanted to confirm if she IS the one i remember or not. I asked her, ""How's your brother doing?"". She said, ""Oh Lucas? He's in college."" So i was quite sure she was the girl i remember. But she acted like nothing significant had happened between us. No discomfort, no 'excitement', nothing. Absolutely nothing. I felt very confused and speechless. What she did do was give her number to my mom, not me.

As you guessed, we didn't talk much, except basic formalities.

From then till now, I have never contacted her or spoken to her again.

Now I'm confused and concerned for many reasons.

The experience feels like a fever dream. All those touches and the specifics all feel like a wet dream i had about my old friend. I feel like I'm just projecting my fantasies into my ex-neighbor. But there are some contradictions.

This happened when i was 6 or 7. I was a very young child. I had ZERO sexual exposure at that time. Hell, i didn't even have a smartphone or laptop, and i barely knew the internet. I rarely saw two people kissing on TV. So i didn't even know anything sexual to have a wet dream. and this 'dream' was *way* specific to originate from my own mind.

I was only aware of all the sexual things when i was like, 13 or 14. And by then, i was pretty self-aware about the things happening around me. Even then, it can be argued that i maybe made up a sexual fantasy with my neighbor at that time. But there are two things- 1. I'm pretty sure Sandra's family had moved away by the time i was a teen and, 2. I had already forgotten them. I only remembered Sandra existed a few months before the party when i was gazing at our neighbor's house and remembering Sandra used to live there.

After the party in 2015, I wasn't even sure if it was Sandra, or someone else, I was *that* confused. now, i *do* remember it was a girl and no other girl was there when she did all those stuff to me. I'm pretty sure it was Sandra and no one else.

The thing that upset me the most are that I was a CHILD. I didn't even know what sex was, and I most definitely didn't know what consent was. She did ALL THOSE TO AN NON-CONSENTING CHILD. I cannot digest this part at all. Now, thankfully, i don't have any psychological trauma or damage because of that. I barely even remember the events, hence my doubts of it being a 'fever dream'. I'm incredibly grateful of coming out of it without any mental or physical damage. I did go through depression two years ago but it was not linked to any part of my childhood whatsoever.

But, what I'm most worried about is Sandra's actions after she moved away. I'm scared if she's still continuing her pedophilia to other children. Just because I came out of it unharmed doesn't mean other victims (if any) are so lucky. And that's the thing, I DONT KNOW IF THIS IS STILL GOING ON.

I 've never talked to my mom about this. Part of me is scared, I don't know how she'd take this. She'll be devastated. And I'm also scared she or any others may invalidate my experience. To be honest though, i *want* to believe this was all a fever dream, and that my imagination was just running wild, I *badly* want to believe that. But I have substantial evidence in my hands to deduce it is real.

I don't have any reasons from my mental state perspective to open up about this assault. I didn't suffer any trauma, and I'm willing to forget all of that bs as a nightmare. But the reason I'm even thinking about this and asking for input is for the other children who may be vulnerable near Sandra. I have no idea if other children are being assaulted by her, or if she has stopped her assault. I don't want any other child get assaulted by her, and if some child *does* suffer by her and gets mentally disturbed, I'd never be able to forgive myself.

I don't want to involve my mom in this, i don't want her to put herself down as a parent, its not her fault. I want to wait till I'm independent to handle this. But I'm just scared it'll be too late.

I'm just so confused and lost right now. Any advice?",26Dec2020,1
317,"I'm a college student pretty nervous about my career as I'm bad at interviews and such. So I guess I subscribed to a career strategy thing a while back and they're sending me emails; typical marketing, praying on the vulnerable and intense emotions right?

One day, the career place sends me some correspondence that's like ""hey wanna get on a call with us?"" I leave it in my inbox for a while as I don't have time to get to it right away and looked at it again just now. I googled a bit to see if it was a scam and if the people running it were shady and nothing came up.

So I reluctantly signed up. However, after I signed up, the vibes I got were really terrible. It said that if you didn't act professionally while talking to them, they'd just stop talking to you, and that you had to do your homework before the call very seriously.

So...I backed out. I tried to cancel the event, but it wouldn't let me cancel, and so I just clicked ""not going"" and emailed a person saying I wasn't going. 

I'm giving them almost a 2 week notice and I tried to professionally tell them that it just wasn't a good fit for me at this time.

i know he has picked it up from his friends and it’s extremely embarrassing since i’m the exact opposite. i’m bi and he knows it which frustrates me more that he homophobic language.

So he of course promises to be just a friend. Yet I still get flurries of 2 am texts that are then deleted and creepy compliments that were completely unprovoked and undesired. I’d tell him, every time, that he needs to stop, that nothing will ever happen between us, and I’ve said so VERY aggressively. But he literally cannot stop.

323,"I am currently stuck in an extremely unhappy and toxic relationship. Without going in depth too much it has largely contributed to a decline in my mental health. I think she and I both know it’s time to leave but the one thing stopping us is our dog. 

We rescued a sweet 4 year old girl mix a few months ago. She has grown very attached to both of us but mainly to me. She came from a hoarding situation and has a lot of anxiety problems. 

I work 13 hours night shifts 3-4 days a week and I feel like it would be extremely unfair to my dog to leave her alone in my house while I’m working. I sadly don’t have family near who could go check in on her and me being a night shift worker means I wouldn’t be able to hire a dog walker or anything like that. 

I wish my partner and I would be able to remain civil enough to share “custody” of our dog but I don’t think that would be the case. Nor do I think it would be healthy. 

The thought of giving up my dog genuinely devastates me more than the thought of staying in my relationship. And I feel very stuck and at a loss of how I can dig myself out of this depression hole.

325,"Growing up, I had a hard time being friends and getting along with people my age. In school, I was never into what’s trendy. Because of my looks, many didn’t want to be friends with me.

As time went on and I started becoming fit and better looking, I was able to get some friends but those friends were outside of my community and they were from different parts of the world. At least they were near my age and never knew how my community saw me growing up.

But with the difficulties of 2020, I lost those friends. And now, I’m left with very little friends. Because I’ve grown up with not having friends, I’ve grown accustomed to enjoying and being able to survive my alone time.

Now here’s where things get different.

Growing up, I’ve envied other people for getting dates and finding love and having sex. Because those are things that I was never able to have. No girl showed interest in me and because of that, I couldn’t have those things.

And right when my life was about to take a positive turn, 2020 happened. No longer could I meet females. Because I didn’t have people to talk to, I’ve lost the progress on my communication skills. Meanwhile, I still see my peers getting dates, hookups, and all the things life and the universe gives to other people EXCEPT ME.

I wish I can be loved, but no one loves me. I wish I can experience sex, but I don’t know where to find a hooker. You might tell me to do online dating but my issue is that I don’t have great photos of me (or maybe I don’t look great overall and God chose to curse me with ugly looks). 

With how bad my love history has been, it’s clear that the odds are against me. With how everything is looking, with how our leaders are so determined to ruin our lives, it’s clear that natural selection is only favoring the sons of politicians and wealthy people. 

If you think about it, past performance is usually indicative of future performance. From that perspective, clearly I was meant to be single forever.

And you might say that my parents love me and I am thankful for that but it isn’t enough for me to feel content about myself. How in the world am I suppose to feel content for myself if only my parents love me? Because if you think about it, parents are forced to love their kids. And a parents’ love is the easiest life a child can get. In other words, it doesn’t mean much if it can’t remove the “loser” label that society has placed upon me.

Think about it this way: if an inventor made a great electronic and only his team liked the invention but the public doesn’t like it, how would the inventor feel about the product? Terrible. He wouldn’t think it’s great just because his team said it was great.

That’s the same in my situation. How can I feel great about myself and be optimistic about my future if the world is terrible, the people running the world want to make it even worse, my peers never liked me, and the current state of the world looks to be the same for the next 100+ years?

I used to be a teacher (high school), was married, and was doing extremely well career wise. 

We moved abroad and all this changed rapidly. My ex became abusive due to a drugs and alcohol problem, he didn’t work (I also paid for him to undertake another degree), and he cheated on me with local women. I lost a baby and needed emergency surgery, was told I was now infertile, and my husband didn’t call or visit me in the hospital (too busy getting wasted with his mates). I was also bullied at work when a new manager took over, and had a breakdown. I quit my job and went to live on a friend’s couch as I was homeless and had to piece my life back together.

I couldn’t get a work visa that would enable me to work where my best friend lived (too old), had almost no money left, so I turned to webcamming as a last resort. The job enabled me to move home to the UK and to pay rent on an apartment so essentially it saved my life when I needed it. 

I HATE webcamming. I am not someone who believes it is a good thing to do. I feel like I used to contribute to society and was fulfilled. Now I feel like I only contribute to feeding men’s porn/cam addiction, and that weighs so heavily on my conscience. I do enough hours to make the bare minimum to survive and pay my debts, then log off, feeling disgusted and full of shame. I feel like camming is an awful thing to make money doing: what good can it possibly do? How am I helping society?  I am not a natural cam girl. I do not enjoy showing my body to strangers, and feel like my own sexuality and desire is suffering due to this job (the irony).

I hate the fact that so many guys I talk to have significant others they hide this from. I hate the fact that men who spend money on me should be saving it during a pandemic and spending it on things that will actively benefit them. I don't even want to touch upon the very disturbing individuals you also come into contact with whilst doing this job and who make you despair for humankind and make me worry that lots of men are secretly like them. I now look at men differently, and this has made me sad. 

I am always told how unusual I am for a cam girl due to being extremely well educated, older, and not telling the dudes I speak to that they might have a chance with me in order to keep them camming and spending money (I think the practice of giving these men false hope that I will meet them/escort/fall in love with them is abhorrent and was encouraged by my ‘boss’ to tell them I would meet them, i.e. string them along and lie when I joined the cam group. I vehemently tell the guys I do not want to meet them, and I would rather they stop spending money if that’s what their ultimate objective is in talking to me.

I want to leave webcamming but I feel stuck. I do not drive and live in a very remote and economically deprived area with no real pubic transport, so I cannot access jobs at all. I feel wholly dependent upon a job I hate, feeling like it is damaging my future, my self worth as a woman and human being, and adding bad karma to my soul. However, I feel stuck in this hand to mouth existence due to needing money to pay debts and my day to day bills. I also cannot date as I work so much and I also hate lying to people about what I do.

I really want to return to teaching but now feel that due to having cammed for over a year this would be incredibly risky, and that one day I will be found out due to screenshots and videos posted online. I will have stopped camming before returning to teaching, but obviously the past can always come back to haunt you. I also look distinctive and have a rare colouring, so I would easily be recognised. Should I forget ever returning to teaching? I was a great teacher before everything went wrong. I absolutely loved my job. But perhaps the sword of damacles hanging over me will be too stressful. I don't know what to do.

Should I leave the remote area and move to a city, perhaps supply teach and phase out camming? I feel like I am stuck and cannot make a decision due to needing to cam so much to make enough to survive (the earning potential is a fraction of what it was before the pandemic, so I now work 6-8 hours to make what accrues to a minimum wage.)

Hi friends,  
Merry Christmas.  

I have a question.  I was with a man, he lied that he was separated and going to marry me... I feel in live with him,  but he was actually married.  He bought me gifts,  took me to lunch when it was convenient to him. We did everything on his schedule. If i asked to go to an arcade he said he couldn't. He use to gulit trip me when we were off and i started seeing someone eles,  to a point i break up with the guy and go back to him. 

 Anyways, When my dad passed he whined because I didn't want to give him a blow job, I jyst lost my dad,  obviously not cool too ask that. So,  one day we studied together,  but i was hungry and wanted to eat, he made me meet him at a weird bar with no good food... so,  I let him derive my car since I didn't know where to go.  So he drove behind a hotel,  parked and took out his penis and said he's horny and started to wank.  I told him to stop and that i was scared because it was public.  He kept say ""please suck it and lick it"" i told him i didn't want to in a car and in public that someone going to see , that I was scared and uncomfortable,   he laughed and said no one waa around.  So, he said if i licked once it we'd leave,  so i agreed so we could leave,  I was getting really anxious. As I went down he pushed my head down to him and when i said what are you doing, he shoved his thing down my throat and finished in my mouth,  I threw up.  

Was this rape?

 I stayed with him,  until August 2019 and when i tried again with him and  tried to let go, I was stl uncomfortable with him and didn't trust him,   we started kissing,  whatever happened,  I told him i didn't want to have sex and not to enter me. I had panties on,  he threw me below him and he tried to shove his penis in me,  and i started crying bc it hurt. So he called me a baby and that I was being dramatic.

I'm a university student in the last year of undergraduate/bachelor's programme of Finances and Accounting. Lately I've been struggling to decide what path should I chose after successfully finishing my current studies. 

I've chosen this major because I thought it was a practical field with lots of job opportunities and something I could possibly continue doing while on maternity leave from home. But right now, I feel like I've lost all passion in life, that I doomed myself for a career path that gives me no happiness or satisfaction, and that escalated even to me not enjoying other aspects of my life. It all feels so pointless when I see myself in the future spending 9 hours a day doing accounting or audit, getting 8 hours of sleep, if lucky 1 hour commute, 2 hours cooking, cleaning and other chores and tending to children in the time left. 

So now I ask for an advice. Should I stay on the ""brain"" path that I've chosen for myself few years ago, meaning to join a graduate Finances and Accounting programme and then pursue certificates such as ACCA or an auditing licence to get better job (and salary) opportunities. Or is there any other solution for me avaiable to not completely ruin my life by not continuing the ""brain"" path?

348,"My (23f) boyfriend (21m) and I have been together a little over 3 years now. I’ve never been very close with my family although we usually do have a small and short get together for Christmas in which my boyfriend is always included. My boyfriend is much closer with his family than I am mine. For example it hurts him to go any longer than a week without seeing his immediate family whereas I don’t really feel the strong urge or need to see/communicate with mine more than a few times a year. His family Christmas is typically a much bigger deal than mine and I am also always expected to attend. This is difficult for me for starts because I have extreme social anxiety when I am around his family like I have never experienced before. My boyfriend really pushes and urges me to communicate with them and be this big bubbly person that I normally would be. I know it is causing issues between our relationship. I just seem to close up around his family a lot and get nervous as heck. They are so important to him and I don’t want to screw up and say the wrong things, and again I haven’t experienced a close relationship with my parents so it’s hard to try to build that with someone else’s. On top of all this 1 out of the 3 years my boyfriend and I were together, we lived at his moms house. During this time period I still experienced social anxiety around his mom so we hardly talked. I spent most of my time living there locked away in my boyfriends room due to my anxiety. I would however see his mom occasionally to give her rent money or just happen to run into each other coming or going from the house. I always tried being polite with her &amp; show my gratitude for allowing me to stay there. She’s a nice lady it’s not her fault by any means I feel so anxious around her. However one day my boyfriend and I were getting into a pretty heated argument when he told me something like “just leave no one wants you here anymore.” Meaning he was the only person who wanted me there and that I must’ve been a  much bigger burden to every one of his other family members than I realized. This made me feel awful and I moved out very shortly afterwards. (I never wanted to live there to begin with but my boyfriend wanted to save money and wanted us living together as long as we were a couple).  My boyfriend has since apologized for saying that and has repeatedly reminded me that, that was something said more out of anger than actual truth and that his family does in fact love me very much. That has not helped with my anxiety though. If anything that comment has skyrocketed my anxiety when involved with his family now regardless of him “taking back” that comment. It can’t be taken back. It has also made me pay greater attention to how his family interacts with me. They are mostly nice but I have noticed a lot more condescending remarks from his siblings towards me. As well as for one family event I attended my boyfriends mom paid for all his siblings s/o’s to get their hair/nails/whatever done which I was invited to but had to pay for myself. Not a big deal but it certainly doesn’t seem like I am liked to much. This year for Christmas I was supposed to go to my boyfriends family’s house but we ended up getting into a big argument beforehand and he left without me. When he came back he threw my presents down saying “here ya go all this stuff from people who supposedly ‘hate’ you”. I didn’t ask for gifts from them and I got them things as well. I know it’s my fault that I get anxious around them and I wish that there was something I could do to help it. BUT! It is his fault for saying what he did that obviously did not help anything. He says I can’t use that as an excuse to never spend time with his family again. Which I wish wasn’t such a big deal to him. We only see my parents for big holidays and even if my parents didn’t like him (which they love him) I wouldn’t care cause it is not my parents choice to be with him. I do love having him with me for my family’s holiday but I also understand social anxiety and I would never force my boyfriend to attend especially if he was under the assumption my family hated him. I would also like to mention I had full intentions on going to my boyfriends family’s for Christmas before we got into an argument despite my anxiety. I know spending time with his family is important to him so it’s something I can put up with a few times a year. My boyfriend acts like I am just not good enough around them.",26Dec2020,1

351,"So there is this guy who I dated for a short time two and  a half years ago. But ever since we broke up (I broke up with him) we always bump into each other. Two days ago I met him on the train and he sat down next to me and we started talking. He seemed as if he was interested in how I have been doing lately, so I told him that we should get off the train and talk and so we did. We talked for 4 hours, and it felt so good. I felt listened and cared for. Ever since that evening I can't stop thinking about him... but I shouldn't think of him, because he has been in a relationship for two months. Three months ago we also met on the train, so we started talking again but I disappeared because I felt like a burden and that he will better off without me. He told me that if i had written, he would have gone on Tinder to find someone else. 
I have never been in love and I still don't think I'm in love. I just want to be with him because with him I feel alive. This feeling terrifies me. I wish he weren't in a relationship. I could go on forever, but I hope you get the gist of it. I just want to stop feeling that I need him, but I don't know how.",26Dec2020,1

354,"Wanted to ask for advice or your opinions on this matter because it’s been irking me for quite awhile. I come from an upper middle class family  in the city and can live very comfortably, afford to go out often/have annual holidays(pre covid).

However I feel a tad disgruntled(?) or disappointed at times, such as say when it comes to presents. I fork out my own money to get a gift of sorts for myself and even if not, most recently as a birthday present from my parents, I got a pen. One of those weighted kinds businessmen might use- but I have zero interest or need to use, not to mention that I don’t intend to pursue a career that has any kind of setting close to an occasion requiring such an item. So it seems very irrelevant or really just useless.

I have had very clear interest in things before that my parents have had no intention of supporting directly, at most just allowing it. Such an interest was fishkeeping which was a big part of my life when I was around 12-20. Compared to others my age who regularly spent on games or clubbing, I was often told that it was a comparatively good hobby to have, not to mention that I made my own money selling off fish I bred. Compared to my friends who had parents get them a new pair of shoes if they liked running, a new computer if theirs was spoilt(I’ve never had my own), or just a new plant for someone who liked gardening- I never actually had such relevant support to my interests.

Sure, I understand that a lot has been done for me. My father pays for my education which could’ve simply been reduced or made easier and cheaper for him by leaving me in a more mainstream school, he buys back food occasionally when he could’ve left me to cook my own meals. 

I’ve never actually voiced my unhappiness (or displeasure?) as it’s something I hate to see. I dislike it and look down on people who do that as I see it as spoilt, but although I don’t show it, I definitely feel this way. Somewhat like how I might be amused in my head but still offer to help someone who may have tripped, I’ve realized that my first reaction in my head is always somewhat nasty/negative although I do my best and act politely/helpful. 

Does this mean that I’m a bad person? It’s uncomfortable acting one way when I feel another and as much as I could call myself “good”- I know I always think otherwise. And if so, how best do I inherently change my mindset? Part of me rationally tells me what to do but I’ve had no control over how or what I feel and the hypocrisy is really affecting me more lately as such situations have been occurring more frequently.

Apologies for the bad English as it isn’t my first language- but I could try to provide more context if it’ll help",26Dec2020,1

358,"So I've been in a relationship for a little while now and I love this girl with all my heart, but I'm worried. You see, I have this vision of what a couple is supposed to be like, and if it doesn't go the way I envisioned it, I start to panic thinking that it's not going to work out. It gets to the point where I start to question my own motives. I start thinking: do I really have feelings for this person? Do I really care about this person?
 Obviously these thoughts are bullshit, and I know they are, but for some reason I dwell on them for so long that I actually start to believe them, and then I just quit the relationship entirely.
 This mindset has ruined many relationships for me that otherwise would have been amazing.

I know a lot of people don’t get anything, but I was hoping with how hard of a year I’ve had that someone would give me something, hell even getting a plain Christmas card would have been fine. Only 3 friends reached out to say merry Christmas, which doesn’t surprise me. Maybe it’s me and the fact that I’m not good enough. My own bf didn’t get me anything. I just give and give and give, yet get so little if anything in return. I know I shouldn’t be focused on receiving, but it hurts to know virtually no one was thinking about me on Christmas.

she’s been very distant from me and honestly just not a great friend at the minute. i want to confront her however i know it will result in a lot of drama which she will not want to resolve, with her being a very stubborn person. she seems to only want to see me when it is convenient for her, and when i am unavailable she will find someone else instead. it is rare she asks me to do things first anyway. i feel very isolated and alone, as she is my main connection to other friend groups. 

a month ago she split up with her boyfriend and i would go round to her house at late hours, even when it was inconvenient for me, just to make sure she was okay and to keep her company, yet she doesn’t seem to appreciate it despite her asking for me to help her. i would do anything for her because she is my best friend and i care about her a lot, but it’s just not reciprocated. it never has been. i’m at a point where i don’t know what to do, as i’m entering my last year of high school which is really important and she (and the other girl i get ditched for) is also in those classes, so i don’t want to make those classes awkward or difficult. most girls in my school is dislike me anyway and i really don’t want to lose any other friends. fuck i hate being a teenager

367,"Hey everyone! This post may not seem as grave as many others, but I could still need a couple of extra brains for advice.

I live in an area with a lot of immigrants, mainly muslims as far as I can tell. I don’t look to vilify anyone but we have had a long lasting debate in society regarding so called “honour killings” and “honour oppression”. This is when some parents impose strict cultural or religious rules on their children with negative effects on their well being, so to speak.

Anyway, outside my place there is a playground with a swing, and every day for almost a year, come hell and high water, I see this girl sitting on the swing, listening to music and kind of zoning out. She is arabic, something like 12 – 13, not sure, but old enough for it to seem a bit odd to like the swing that much, especially in rain, sub zero temperatures and all kinds of bad weather. Earlier this year she had her hair out, now it is covered in a hijab. Mostly she is alone, but sometimes she got some siblings or peers around her.

My dilemma is this: I feel like she is either kind of meditating or escaping by going to that swing. With all the stuff about honour oppression in the back of my mind I would just like to make sure she is okay, nothing else. However, I don’t know if that is wise and I don’t know how I would approach such a question. If she is having a hard time at home, being seen speaking to me (an older caucasian male) would probably only make it worse. Or maybe I should just realize it is none of my business and do nothing?  But I get the feeling that something might be off and it is hard to ignore it as I see her every single day.

On the other hand, everything might be completely fine and she is just enjoying some alone time.

370,"So I lost my sister (BB) a couple months ago. It was a couple weeks before my birthday and the day before my younger brother's. I won't go into too much detail but I will say it was self-afflicted. 2020 has not been a good year for us. A quick backstory is that all of us suffered from physical, mental and emotional abuse. Mainly from my mother, who as mentioned later, is a habitual liar. I'll admit Losing her has brought up a lot of bad feelings so I've been rethinking my relationships/life. Most of info concerning BB and her case I had gotten from our mother. At the time I hadn't questioned any of it but lately I'm having doubts. During funeral planning there was big drama involving my mother and BB's on/off girlfriend (M). Apparently my mother had possession of BB's phone and had told me a lot about their toxic relationship. ( involving drugs, alcohol and self harm) What really shook me was that my mother had told me she had been in contact with a detective investigating any foul play regarding the incident. She's claiming that BB had a large amount of drugs and alcohol and that M and their roommates may have pushed her over the edge. She also told me some much terrible things regarding BB, which I won't mention. But suffice to say my heart is literally broken and haunted by it. I've been going LC with my mother for weeks now relating to it past trauma. Half of me is saying she is over blowing and lying on some aspects of it, as she has a history of making some MESSED UP lies.

First thing my therapist asked me after hearing my name is ""Do you speak our language?""and cut me off as I was responding her and said ""oh just a little then?"" despite me trying to tell  her  that I speak the language fluently (my name sounds foreign because my parents were immigrants).


Afterwards I told her about my childhood abuse from my family. I told her how my dad broke my teeth as a kid, once injured my face until I was bleeding, used to beat me and leave my body scarred....I told her about my cousin who beat me and tried to stab me when I was a kid...and  how his behaviour made me shut myself off from other people, skipping school and running away from home once.


She said that I was obviously not telling the whole truth. I was shocked to hear that since I was  being sincere with her, but I asked her what about the things I said made her question my truthfulness. She replied that I was obviously telling my side of things only and that I am being unfair to my parents and family. She also said, and I quote her : "" you just weren't strong enough to deal with it. Plenty of people get hit when they're young but you were too sensitive. It's like how some people have more melanin to protect themselves from the sun, you weren't strong enough to deal with that""



She also suggested that I should drop out of college and pursue ""a similar career to my mother"" (my mother is a house cleaner) since I used to do poorly in highschool.

377,"When I make a mistake it intensifies in my mind. It could pop up in my head even months after it happens and it intrudes even more often when it happens moments or a few days ago, where of course it feels so much more painful. To the point I am begging to my own mind to please stop.

These mistakes aren't even a big deal, I do not even think other people would remember it happened. So why does it bother me so much?

I am able to acknowledge ""it's not a big deal, people make mistakes, learn from it and move on."" I do learn from my mistakes and I do not want to repeat it. 

But what happens when these feelings are too much? What if because I'm too scared to make mistakes I no longer wish to try and shut myself off from everything and everyone. Where I no longer will hurt others or myself.

378,"So, this guy was really into me. I mean, ""constantly posting about hurting because of heartache"" into me. He was aware that I would read every post he wrote about me, about how much it pained him to love me, yet I had a hunch that it may not have been about me. But, this one day, we were playing with some friends, then I started being super friendly to one of them (we were talking about music, hyping about whatever we picked for our friends group playlist), and he fell dead silent. Muted himself and the like. Later on, I found out that he had been telling my other friend to stop being so friendly with me, saying that he didn't want to compete with him over me.
Let me just add, this guy has known that I am in a monogamous relationship all along.
So, the other dude told him he thought he had some kind of issue, that he couldn't be jealous of my friends and suggested he went to therapy. He didn't.
That night, he wrote something on twitter, all like ""Do you have any idea how much this hurts? it feels like being stabbed, left to bleed"" and whatnot. This really scared me, since I'm a very anxious person, I panic over anything, really. So I tweeted ""ok now im scared"", then he talled to me.
Esentially, he confessed his dying love for me. He asked whether if I wanted to listen, I told him ""yes, if you feel it would help"". Then he asked if I wanted to speak over the phone or in person. Suffice to say I was very scared of meeting him (I know he's been in violent, hooligan-ish groups and the like, that he joined bc a girl left him and he was resentful). I asked if he could tell me about it over the phone, then he wrote a sad emoji and said he was ""disappointed that I didn't want to meet in person"".
His confession was very hurtful, saying stuff like ""I know I didn't have a chance, I never do"" and ""I didn't do anything to you because I like your boyfriend"", and he told me that my ""signals to him were a lie"", as he thought I had been leading him on for being nice to him. This all really made me sad, but I told him I understood where he was at that point and asked if we wanted to be friends. He said yes. Then, he asked me ""before we go to sleep, be honest, had you been single, would something have happened between us?""
I was scared to answer, because any answer would be wrong for him. I kept saying I didn't know for sure, because sometimes, you take a liking to someone you didn't initially like, but then he kept insisting that I ""be honest"", and I finally said ""well, before my bf I didn't ever really want something serious, and you sound like you would want a relationship with me, so I think not"". Then he said ""so it's a no, then. Yet, here you are."" This really pissed me, him implying that I liked him despite my no, so I told him I was going to sleep, and he should too.
15 minutes later he texted me to say ""I never said anything about wanting something serious"". I didn't answer.
The day after, he half-apologised for ""insisting that I give him an answer only one of us wanted to hear"", and I told him he had been a little persistent, but everything was fine. We kept gaming together along with our friends, and the dude he was jealous of got less nice (I didn't know about the conversation they had).
For the following days and weeks, he has kept on coming back, insisting that our PJs in a DND game get together, I told him it would be uncomfortable for me, he insisted that his character confessed his love for mine, I kept saying it wouldn't be nice and people would be weirded out by it, then he got mad at me. He started blaming me for not meeting him in the first place, and said he wanted to point out something I said and correct it, but it ""was not the right time for it"". At this point I'm tired of being blamed for stuff like this, and I tell him to tell me right away. He goes on about how this situation should have happened in person, that I never take him into consideration and that no one ever does either. I am very mad at this, bc despite not meeting him to talk, I had always been nice and understanding. We argue over it and, in the end, he says I'm very mean and selfish, that I never treated him how he deserved, and that he always respected my boundaries. Then I decided to put an end to this, started crying like crazy, and told him we shouldn't be talking about this right now, so I blocked him. 
He started tweeting like crazy, saying that I hated his guts, that I had been a bad person and whatnot. I don't do anything about this, because I can't control what he tells other people about me. Ever since that day, he's tried to reach out for me on other apps to tell me that I ""have to face my problems head on"", telling me to ""start acting like an adult"" and asking why I blocked him. I blocked him on my locked twitter account to stop going on his twitter to read what he said of me, because it was only hurtful, and because one day, he wrote me a poem that he submitted to his blog where he said my ""no"" was ""a lie i told to protect him"", that I should ""learn to love myself"" and that I should ""know better to see who REALLY loves me"". This made me cry and have a meltdown, so I just blocked him on my locked twitter. This made him really mad, so he chased me over Instagram, where I hadn't blocked him yet, and said I was ""acting up"", that he ""wrote that while drunk"" (yet posted it sober days afterwards) and the like. I told him this was insane, and that he was unable to accept my negative, he told me to let him finish, and I didn't. At this point, this man is obviously obsessed, and I blocked him again.
Then, he found me on another twitter I have for posting art, and openly insulted my choices, said that he didn't understand why I didn't want to talk about what happened (I don't understand what more there is to say, except for the fact that he seemed to think that I actually liked him all along, that I led him on and that my ""no"" was actually a ""yes""). I didn't answer either, then blocked him on that account too.
Days after, he ranted to one of our mutual friends about not knowing what he had done wrong, that he really thought I loved him and someone who loves you cannot block you out of their lives like that. My friend asked me what to do, and I just told him to act however he thought fit. He (and the dude this man was jealous about) talked to him about not respecting other people's boundaries, that he should have stopped asking to make our PJs be in love and confess and the like, that he shouldn't have insisted day after day to have met me to talk about it and that he scared me with his nearly violent manners. Also, that my ""no"" was final, and that no matter what he thought, that was my answer and he should respect it.
Over this time, he's become more talkative on this group we have for gaming, and my friends have told me that he often cuts me off, interrupting what I'm saying to make people talk about something else. I noticed that he often does that, but I didn't take it seriously since it's a text chat and people do that all the time when texting. Also, this other friend we have told me that, over these weeks, he has been showing him tweets and texts I write, saying ""see this emoji she sent me? this means something special"", and such.
To this day, I am honestly angry and resentful. I can't believe that he doesn't understand when and how he wronged me, and he insisted that he always took me into consideration but I didnt do that for him. I am baffled, and I seriously hope that he doesn't do that to another woman ever again. People taking your ""no"" and deliberately turning it into a ""yes"" really scare me, as if someone took my capability to choose and decide, crushed it and deemed me incapable of choosing.
TL;DR: This friend I had confessed his love for me when I already have a bf, has consistently insisted over weeks that he should meet in person to discuss this, making me uncomfortable, and decided to tell other people that I have been leading him on, making me block him when he told me I didn't take him into consideration and that I was being childish. I can't get over this. Help?",26Dec2020,1

I know I have had significant positive experiences, but I cant remember any of them that occured after i was 10 or so.

- First video, in my eyes, she was saying things and touching the guy subject in her video even off camera that were crossing the line. We cancel video. 
- After that, she did the video with someone else which is fine, paid them and so forth.
- Next project she comes to me and basically asks me to film/direct/edit/produce it for free(mind you I do this full time and it’s a lot of work to do these things). I ask why she can pay someone else and not me? She spirals and gets upset.
- Does another one without me, now I am upset.
- Offers to do next project together, offers to pay fairly, sounds good. In between these projects I dealt with finding out about her having a guy over for wine and painting, among a couple of other “hangouts”.
- I find on Instagram that she’s flirting with a guy who commented on her profile and I comment to him, she blocks me. 
- I ask her why she blocks me yet will talk to another man like that? I tell her if she doesn’t unblock me and stop acting like this then I won’t do her video.
- We break up. She tells me she just wants to be friends. She cancels the video instead of doing the other. She comes crying to me after a few days to come stay the night and I let her in. We sleep together and I’m back at ground zero. What does this girl want, I ask myself.

I always wanted to become and artist, writer or product designer but because of something my parents decided as I left middle school (went to school in France and your career path is mostly decided at that point) I couldn't follow this path at all and now at 24 I am working as a mailman in Germany (German and French are both my mother tongues). 
It's payed well but I don't have time nor energy to do anything creative anymore and it's really starting to feel like torture.
I can't go to university because I need to pay rent and I am not eligible for any financial support...

388,"I'm 20 M, unemployed mostly because is hard to find anything during this pandemic. My father has cirrosis and other medical problems. He needed a liver and lung transplant but recently the doctors had decided they can't operate him. A surgery on my father would be impossible. He's been in hospital for the past week but now the condition is worse. He is intoxicated because the liver doesn't work as intended. In a coma like status, he's moving, doesn't talk, doesn't recognize anyone.


My mother she has her set of problems, epilepsy and something other. She's been overworked past week to take care of my father in hospital so I worry a lot about her health now. I try and do help her but she's very stubborn. Anyway I'm afraid my father condition would worsen even more... The doctor has told us there are no chances in the futures even if now he gets better...


I'm afraid, I don't know what to do. We're foreigners, no family that could support us at all. Only by videocalls. I don't know what to do if the worse happens to my father... I'm honestly really afraid, we've lived here for the past 5 years. I've been prepared mentally for the past 2 3 years for this, had a ton of moments in my life, even now, where i am extremely depressed. How can I be strong for my mother when there's no one who can support us?

I've been trying to get a new job but that + depression has make it extremely hard. While I was studying we three lived off a stipend the government gave us (that's for 3 years now).

But as I grow older you’ll be surprised as to how quickly I get goosebumps and tears in my eyes to scenes that don’t deserve that reaction. For example. It can simply be eye contact between two people, or even a smile or even any random facial expression. Arghhh like I don’t get it, it can be as simple as the kid in a movie just saying the word mummy and the mum turns around to look at him and boooom there goes this wave of goosebumps and tears, or maybe someone singing , I don’t understand why this is happening but I’m a little scared.

391,"My mother (50F) is going through menopause and in the past few weeks we've been fighting a lot. One day, for example, I folded my father's underwear but not hers (I didn't know how to) and she took offense to that. She yelled at me because ""I made her feel inferior."" Then what happens is she tears up and goes on to say I must hate her because if I truly loved her, I would treat her equally to dad. I just couldn't understand what's making her play the victim here because I don't care whether my underwear is bloody folded or not. I wasn't putting any thought into it when I was folding laundry. 

As you can see, we start fighting over little things and it gets blown way out of proportion. If I don't do what she wants me to, she takes it as a personal attack. She twists my (rather harmless) words and actions and convinces herself that I don't love her, I don't think she's a great mom, I'm ungrateful etc... 

Once, we're watching this show and she starts crying hysterically. We ask her why and she tells us that the kids on television are much better sons and daughters than me. She tells me I'm a brat so I'm starting to feel like the biggest brat there is. 

Maybe I'm the inconsiderate one here? I keep unintentionally hurting her. I swear I love my mother and every time she doubts it, I tell her that I love her. I love her as I always did. It's just that I'm starting to feel really shitty about myself too so this needs to stop. 

As silly as it all sounds, I need advice. Going through menopause making her feel  insecure and sensitive as ever. No matter what I do, she gets really upset. How can we reduce conflict? How do I avoid triggering her as much as I do now? Since I'm a ""bad daughter"" how can I be a ""good daughter""?

I have a few close friends who are the “popular ones” but I prefer to stay in at night rather than go out to big loud gatherings that my year group usually have. Over the past couple of years I have dealt with social anxiety, low self-esteem and low confidence. But this past year I have pushed myself and forced myself to be more out there. This lead to me talking to more people and feeling confident in myself. However, I am still quiet because that is the way I naturally am and it has never hindered my learning or anything else. In my reports I get the same comments “she is too quiet” “she needs to participate more” and the thing is I do just not to their liking. If I need help or have something to say I say it. I don;t sit there in class I talk to the others in my class asking for help or just because I am bored I am basically a more naturally reserved person, I don’t have “banter” with the teacher like everyone else. But, every time I start to feel confident in myself I see those comments from those teachers and they just bring me down into a cycle of self hate and thoughts like “why can’t I be more loud” “I am such a weirdo” “why can’t I be normal like everyone else?” and I just feel like there is something wrong with me because I don’t act like or like things like everyone else.

414,"My (26, F) partner (27, M)  has revealed to me that his ex (26, F) has been harassing him ever since their break up more than a year ago. It started before him and I got together and it is still ongoing. He has blocked her on all social media, email and her number, but her voicemail notifications still come through (last time was a few days ago and at its peak, she calls 60+ times a day). She has also made fake account and used her siblings social media to get in touch with him.

Not only that, this ex has also contact his other ex(??, F) via social media/ phone and has sent continuous mean messages which led to her getting the police involved; however, I'm unsure if anything came out of it.

I am really conflicted because I want him to file a report to ensure the harassment is stopped or at least send a warning so she knows that her behaviour is inexcusable. However, my boyfriend seems complacent to this and is borderline opposed to the idea as she has experienced childhood trauma and has been suicidal in the past. I want to empathise with her but I cannot excuse her harassment because of her past truama. To me, it seems like an manipulative behaviour to make sure her presence is still in his life, no matter how much he refuses her.

I know it is ultimately his decision and since he doesn't seem too affected by it because he is so used to it by now, I should not push it, but I feel really hurt and am worried that this is going to affect our relationship. I only found out the extent of this harassment recently, a year into our relationship. It was mentioned briefly before but he said he didn't tell me again because I once mentioned he brought up his ex a lot (this was on our first few dates and not related to this topic/ex). I now feel like a shitty girlfriend for feeling like I've silenced him and issues because of that comment and on top of that, I feel like our relationship isn't as good as I thought it was. We've never had any major argument or problems and I'm thinking it's because I've only been exposed to the 'good side' and issues like this one which is tearing me apart was hidden from me. I can't stop thinking about it and is upsetting knowing that this ex, who was emotionally and mentally abusive towards him, still has managed to make her way into his life past their relationship. 

If it happens again, I want to escalate this with the authorities if my boyfriend is open to it. But again knowing that she was/is suicidal, I don't want to cause more damage. I really don't know what to do.

I'd appreciate any sort of advice and wisdom because I don't know if what I'm feeling is okay and should just leave it to him to sort out.

415,"So I(21m) have this friend(25f). We have been coworkers since April but started talking, texting and hanging out in June. We would talk everyday we would see eachother at work and we would text often. I consider her my closest friend that I can confine in if I needed help on top of just being comfortable to talk to her about anything. It was until last week when I sent her a text and she hasn't responded. It isn't a normal thing because the most we would not  text eachother was 2 days. It has been over a week. We still talk at work but not over text. We don't talk about what we talk about over text at work because that's a rule we both set to keep text messages a private matter between us. We also made plans to hangout but she cancelled them about 1 hour before we were supposed to hangout. This has left me confused because they day before we were texting  eachother like normal and we hungout 2 weeks ago like normal. Even a couple minutes before she stopped texting me we were texting like always. I look back at the messages but there is nothing on there that could have offended her or pissed her off. Is it normal for friends to just stop texting out of the blue? Or  is there something that I probably said or did that made her not want to talk to me and hangout outside of work anymore? Because I'm left real confused and I dont know if I should bring it up to her or just leave it as with her? I don't want to loose this friend because she helped me to open up to things I needed healing on from my past and is someone that I could  be myself around without being judged. Need Help Please.

419," I (35f) started at the company in May as a customer service representative. It's a small office office of CSRs that manages a bigger Warehouse of technicians doing in home service calls, with two different branches. Once I settled in, I was given the job of planning the route for one branch of techs, a job the GM used to do personally. After a few months, I was also given the other branch to dispatch as well, taking it from the loud woman, who we will call J (44f). She was very upset about that but she was given a new task. 

J and I normally get along great, chatting at the end of the day, etc. But this week we were also told that the owner doesn't want me to be part of the Saturday rotation anymore. She flipped out in the meeting, saying that she shouldn't have to work Saturdays at all bc she has seniority (2 years). It was awkward. She had to have meetings with both managers afterward. I actually don't mind working on Saturdays bc only 2 technicians work on Sat so there isn't much to do.  Last time I did a coloring page and watched a bunch of YT but it's very obviously not the best use of my time. 

I also made the mistake of calling her out on something that I usually keep my mouth shut about. She was walking around the office saying that Trump is the best president we've ever had. Which, I mean, wtf. She's black and so is the majority of the office. Not even the white owners dad, who does support Trump, would take it that far. I really regret doing this but I said ""Trump is better than Obama?"" Which shut her up. Which would've played better if she wasn't already pissed at me. So I essentially added fuel to the fire. 

And now I feel like I'm on the outs even more. She's well liked in the office, even though she's not very good at her job. She messes up a lot. She fills out work orders so that the techs can't see any of the info. The new task she was given is constantly messed up. I've had techs tell me that they are happy I took over her job bc she ran the dispatch horribly. I'm actually a little worried that she might be fired bc she's is rocking the boat and bc I'm well liked by management and the technicians. 

But it's a small office and I know I need to smooth things over. What would be the best way of doing that? 

TL;DR: co-worker was pissed at me because I don't have to work on the weekend anymore and then I added fuel to the fire when I shouldn't have. How can I smooth things over so I'm not iced out in a small office of women?",26Dec2020,1
420,"So my brother in-law a 21yr old recently moved in with me and my wife back in July. I never met him before my wife and I got married but me and my wife always talked about taking him in if he ever needed it. I loved the idea because I grew up really hard and even lived on the streets at times just as he had. 

My wife and I had talked about it before but once when I was spending a couple of weeks away from home for some training for my job she unexpectedly flew him down to come live with us without letting me know or talking to me first. Also we had just had a son not even a month before this. 

At first I was excited he seemed like an alright guy, a little childish but overall an alright guy. He helped out around and whatnot and also managed to get two jobs as soon as he moved down. He’s in allot of debt due to fines for tickets and a DUI and racing. He doesn’t currently have a license because he can’t legally get one right now. So we were letting him drive my wife’s car to go to job interviews, we even let him drive to so hang out with some girls. He got a ticket using my wife’s car going more than 20 over so we took away that privilege. He stole her car in the middle of the night after drinking a couple of days later. 

He has also consistently brought weed into my home after we’ve asked him not multiple times. He’s lied to and verbally abused my wife (his sister) in front of me. Call her a stupid bitch, a retard, and multiple other names when she asks him not to do certain things. Him and I have almost gotten into three fist fights already with one ending up where I broke something expensive of his after telling him to leave and him refusing. He constantly lies to, verbally abuses, and disrespects me and my wife and our house. Also always bringing up my race when we’re arguing and asking my wife why she had to be with someone of my race.

He has caused allot of divide and frustration in mine and my wife’s marriage. I’ve tried to kick him out before but have always folded in the end due to the fact that my wife believes he would be homeless. He lost one of his jobs because the manager yelled at him and he took it as disrespect and decided not to show up anymore. My wife mothers him. Treats him like he’s her responsibility or her child. He’s told me in private before that he doesn’t even see her as family after we got into a fight. 

I’m away from home in Japan for 7 months and I told my wife I want him gone before I get back. That’s plenty of time to get a really cheap place where we live, And a second job. Any time I ask my wife how he’s doing with the job search and place search she gets really angry or defensive (I cant really tell the difference) and tells me he’s trying. But I know for a fact that all he does is sit on my couch watching netflix all day because it’s my account and I view the account activity. He’s barely making any money, he’s not even trying to make more, he’s not saving his money, He only works one day a week and he is just using my wife and I and she knows it but is fine with it.

I’ve asked my friends and family for advice and they all agree with me about kicking him out but That may just be because they’re biased. There’s allot of other stuff that’s he’s done and I’ve done but it’s just too much to put on here. I am heavily conflicted about kicking him out because I’ve been in his situation before but at the same time I never once treated anyone who gave me an opportunity the way he’s treated my wife and I.",26Dec2020,1

I've gathered a bunch of girls together, I laid out a plan for us and now the journey begins.

I've gone by three months working on this and suddenly my ""passion"" just died or I'm in doubt as to whether or not I really want this or if I'm really willing to work for it.

My rap skills are a little above average, my singing a little below and my dancing is 'meh' (okay). I feel like I'm stealing someone else's dream who may have better skills than me.

So I’m 24 years old (m) and have been single for coming up on two years. It’s the longest I’ve been single since I was roughly 15. I know for a lot of people this isn’t a long time but I’ve definitely found myself in a bit of a rut. I struggle with mental health issues and have been finding it harder and harder to meet women. Lately I’ve found my issue to be that I think I come on too strong, and perhaps scare them off. I am a massive over thinker and it leads me to doing silly things that probably puts them off further.

What I wanted to know is does anyone have any advice on how to not let your overthinking spiral out of control?
Also is coming on very strong always unattractive? Or am I just being unlucky. I always found it very flattering and attractive when someone was forward with me and keen to see me. But lately I’m second guessing myself

427,"Hi, I'm 23F and I love/hate my father.

My parents were always picture-perfect to me. 

They were so in love, even after 25 years, and I bragged about them all the time. I didn't want a relationship if it didn't look like theirs. They never argued, had respect for the other, and always worked as a team.

They didn't lead a very exciting life, but they had been saving up for 15 years in order to buy a boat and travel around the world. They were set to leave in September 2020.

In March, my dad announced that he was leaving us. He fell in love with someone else and that was that. He would ""leave"" the house to my Mom and he would buy the boat with their economies.

We were so stunned because no one had suspected a thing. He had only been seing her secretly for three months but he was willing to throw our family away for this woman. I was very angry and confused.

My mom took it the hardest, obviously. She's been depressed for 10 months now and she still cries every day, wondering what she did for him to leave her like that, without a second thought.

On the other hand, I am refusing any contact from my dad. He sends me messages asking me how I'm doing and he sends me money every month for university, but I never answer. Sometimes I snap at him, asking him to stop sending me stuff. He still tells me he misses me, that he loves me and wishes I would talk to him.

I have always been very close to my father, I was a daddy's girl and I adored him, even during my teenagehood I always had respect and love for him, and I still love him but he has lost all of my respect.

The worst thing is, he made a fcking Instagram for his boat, that he bought with mom's hard-earned money. It was her dream to sail around the world, and he posts pictures everyday WITH HIS MISTRESS in the pictures. Pina coladas, sunny beaches, luxurious forests and hikes: you name it, he's living the dream!

He gave everyone in our life his insta handle, including me and my brother, so we can see ""how he is doing on his adventure"". It has been incredibly hard on my mom, and I feel like I can never forgive him.

The only way I can describe it is she has gone insane. She used to be very steady and mature, but now she bursts out in tears randomly during the day, she whines if I don't sleep with her in the same bed, she spends alarming amounts of money in tarot readings and astrology-related stuff so she can be told he will come back, and once took my phone away to read my messages. (I have asked her to go to therapy but she won't btw). She's trying to recover.

What do I do? How long do I keep ignoring him? I miss him, I still want a relationship with him in the future, but he's being such an inconsiderate \*sshole. Soon it's going to be a year without seeing him, and I want him to suffer for making my mom miserable but I still consider him my father.

429,"Hi, all. I’m posting for life advice and hoping I could get some reassurance from people who have maybe experienced the same things. I’ve hit bottom in just about every way.

It all started about five years ago when I went back to school after getting out of the military. It was so tough! Lived on nothing and worked my ass off. But I graduated last year and landed an amazing internship. It was at the top company in my field. After three months, they offered me a full-time job, which I accepted. I did this instead of marrying my fiancé. I ended the engagement in August of last year.

I did this for many reasons. We had a bad history. Very toxic. And because staying together meant my moving to a very small town six hours away where there would be little work for me. He didn’t want children. No family or friends nearby. He wouldn’t allow me to have my cat. I really wasn’t gaining anything (I was losing everything) and there was no compromise. The worst part... I’d already lived there before and he wanted nothing to do with me then. He was a typical fuck boy. He dumped me (2011) and dated another woman with whom he had a child with. Since moving away (2013), he’s basically harassed me. Facebook, Pinterest, text, calls, LinkedIn, different numbers, etc. begging to get back together despite blocking him on most all outlets.

So, after ending the engagement, I worked with my new company. Ex was still trying to contact me (sent a pic of woman in a wedding dress to me on Pinterest - he’s sick) and I gave in. Found him on a dating website and it went to hell from there. I cut him off again and when I say I struggled, I mean that. I could hardly work. I was a complete wreck and started seeing a therapist who verified my ex was a narcissist. Then, COVID happens in March of this year. I fled the city and headed for my family back east. Worked remotely for about two months until I was furloughed.

Since then, I’ve been on a sabbatical. Visited a lot of old friends and family. Couch-surfed like a pro. Worked on a ranch in Montana for a bit. 21 different states this year. It healed a lot of old wounds. But then guess what? Ex came back again. Promised me the world and that he loved me; wanted a life with me more than anything. A family. A new life in Florida. We started talking and a month later he decided I’m not the same person he fell in love with because I believed in “therapy” and I’d caved to my parents (I’m living with them and they asked me not to travel anymore because of COVID, which I agreed to). 

I’m crushed that I was willing to overlook so many issues yet those were his trivial reasons to end things. I’ve leveled with the fact he’s just plain fucked in the head. Most of all, I’m crushed and ashamed I let him back in my life. I knew better. I’ve known better this whole time and I’ve done this to myself.

I’m grateful for my family, friends and my health. But now here I am. Single at 32. No job. Living with my parents. No direction. It feels like I hit a wall no matter what I do. I promised myself I wouldn’t chase after things (jobs and men) that aren’t meant for me. I need to be building a life for myself instead.

So, I’m taking it day by day. I’ve decided to stay close to my family (New Orleans) and just find any work I can. Been applying to jobs like crazy. I’ve been trying to remember who I am and what I enjoy. I workout several times a week. I’ve been taking horseback riding lessons again. Reading. Considering therapy again, too. I feel a huge sadness and void. I wish I could replace my ex and all the bad memories with a healthy relationship. But it may never happen, so I’m focusing on what I can control.

What else should I be doing? Did you or do you know of someone who pulled themselves out of a slump? What helped you? Where would you start?",26Dec2020,1

And I know the stereotype is that men get ruined in divorces, but I know of women who've been hung out to dry, too. The thing is, it just doesn't seem worth it to me.

I'm getting to the age where everyone around me is getting married, and I'm questioning if I ever want to. I've spent my early twenties working so hard to build a good financial base for myself in my later years, and the thought of that being plundered by greedy divorce lawyers frankly scares me more than the thought of dying alone ever will.

436,"Hi, everyone! This is not major, but I still have a case of hurt feelings. Basically, I am very close with my SIL and I got her a few gifts for Christmas. One was a perfume, which she said she didn’t like the scent of. She tried to give it back to me saying I could keep it.  It stung a little bit, but no worries! I told her to take it and exchange it for a scent she liked better! 

Later, she referenced the little ceramic jewelry tray I got her as the “ugly dish”. It took me a moment to realize she was talking about my present. 😢 I know my hurt feelings were apparent even though I tried to play it off in a joking manner. My response was stupid but I didn’t know what to say. I said, “It’s not ugly! I liked it!” To which she responded, “I just don’t like it. I’m sorry.” I said, “Are you really sorry though?” Which I tried to say in a light hearted and teasing tone, but I know she knew that she had hurt my feelings. She sheepishly said, “Kind of.” Then it was just super awkward and I busied myself with some cleaning because I could feel myself almost wanting to cry. 

I know it’s probably dumb, but I guess I just feel like I spent time trying to pick out gifts she would love and she hated them. 😢 We are close, so I’d want her to feel comfortable telling me if she wasn’t crazy about a gift, but...it just seemed like she didn’t even care how she said it. I guess she assumed it wouldn’t feel bother me, but it did. 

I don’t want to say anything or draw attention to it, but I just want to stop dwelling on it. She historically has been a wonderful friend so this was just kind of out of character. She did come back and say she was sorry and she didn’t hate it and just wasn’t sure she would use it, etc. I mustered up my best happy face and said it was fine and I’d take it back to the little boutique it was from and she could pick something else out, but I’m still feeling the sting this morning.",26Dec2020,1

438,"So, Christmas was kind of a bust. I didn't ask anyone for anything specific because my family usually gives money. I set myself up for Christmas this year with that expectation, and it backfired. Grandparents didn't give anything, which they are not obligated to, but I would have liked to know that so I didn't expect anything. The real dilemma is that my parents bought me a $400 smart tv. I don't want it. 

I do not watch tv, but I can use it to screen cast my laptop. That said, I don't have any room for it in my dorm, so I'm not going to be using it until i move. I really wanted/expected money this year and would have been happy with $50 to buy a couple books that i wanted. I feel like my parents wasted their money, they could have saved $350, or at least given me $400 if that's what they wanted to spend. The question is, **Should I ask if they can return the TV?** I haven't told my family I am disappointed, but I didn't get what I wanted, and they are out $400 so it's a lose-lose.

This is somewhat complicated, so hang with me.

I started seeing this girl about two months before Thanksgiving (so we obviously haven't known eachother long), but because of the pandemic things physcially have been weird (especially since we live in an area in the United States without a mask mandate). Anyway, I expressed my concern about being physcial since we obviously don't live together, but it ended up really bothering her. I fully understood and empathized, as it wasn't easy for me either.

Fast foward, she ended up pushing my boundary and wanted to know if she could come over and hook up (read: get me to retract my initial boundary). This obviously made me uncomfortable and I held my ground, but she got all up in arms and proceeded to drink way too much (this isn't the first time she's binged drank- which is probably a red flag for a relationship? i don't know). Next day, she apologized, but just couldn't believe I wouldn't allow her to come over.

Anyway, before Thanksgiving, I had established plans to do a socially-distant meet-up with my cousin who lives about an hour away. Naturally, I told the girl I'm dating this information, because it meant that she and I would not be doing Thanksgiving together.

Well, because covid cases got worse, I decided not to go see my cousin. And because of how she responded to my initial physical boundary/desire to keep things distanced, I didn't feel like I could tell her the truth-- that I was no longer going to see my cousin for Thanksgiving. I was worried it would cause her to push my boundaries again and ask to come over, which I would refuse, and then send her into another binge drinking spiral.

So obviously, I lied. She thinks I went and I'm continuing to let her think it and am talking like I went to the cousin. And i hate being a liar, but I felt like I was put into a tough position by someone who has shown me repeatedly that they can't respect my boundaries (I could give more examples, but the post would be too long). I don't know if I owe it to her to tell her the truth, or just let this lie live on? Am I a bad person? Ultimately, my intention behind this lie is to help prevent people from getting sick.",26Dec2020,1

I would’ve tried to talk to her alone but I saw her parents and then decided to walk out the backdoor and wait till they left (prolly should’ve talked with them, but I rlly wasn’t in the mood to talk to her and her parents in the middle of dinner).

444,"Growing up, my relationship with my mother has dwindle to where I don't really remember what its like to have someone there for you in such a way. Ever since I was in middle school where things started to change, I subconscious decided that I had to figure out everything and navigate myself through all this. I became my own mom and dad, and had to be there for myself in a way my physical ones could no longer. I m detached from my father, not that I have any truly harsh feelings with him. He was there in and out. Even now, he tries to contact me, in which i reply. But speaking with my mother and father had before, started to feel like I was/am, talking to adults who were just people that were there. 

Okay so that's besides the point. I m writing this out now because this year, i've completely broke that emotional bond with my mother. I still look out for her, and treat her like I would any other human being. But I no longer see her as a confidant, or any sort of figure outside the human stat. (Tbh this has been fragile for years, but the snap happened fully and completely this year)

Since then, ive stayed with My aunt, who, might I say, became someone i could somewhat rely on. She became that confidant. And, while she isn't the affectionate type, she still shows that she cares. 

Through Recent events though, just like with my mother, I feel sort of betrayed. I feel like that word is pretty strong. But, I felt my heart break in what she did. I know she didn't mean any true harm by it, but the fact that it happened that way made me realize that this isn't the relationship I want. 

I feel right now as if I m detaching emotionally from her too. I feel bad, because shes done so much for me. Shes the type of person that pretty much just rams head first into things assuming the worse. And even if I try and talk it out with her, its the assuming, quick responding, instead of hearing you out type deal. Thats- excuse my French - fucking draining. I didnt even realize how draining it was.

Before her, I was planning on just leaving, when it was only my mom in that role. I just didn't leave because my siblings would have to go through it all alone. But now my sibs are better off. I need to leave and be able to just breathe. I want to be on my own without having to live under someone. 

I fear that my need for wanting that parental figure in my life has cause me to stagger and take from whatever I can get, even if it requires me to walk on eggshells. 

But I have to- want to just leave. I know I may never have that parental reassurance. Whats done is done, and its in the past now.  I want to head on out but I feel guilty about leaving. I want to just disappear for a year or something, and just find myself. I can deal with being alone in my thoughts. I dont want to run away from my past.

448,"17f, living with my parents. For almost as long as I can remember, my father has been emotionally neglectful and unempathetic and has grown increasingly controlling as I've gotten older. He gets angry whenever I try to express an opinion different from his own and lashes out in anger (mostly verbally) when I try to set boundaries. Occasionally - usually about once or twice per year the fights get physical. He'd hit me first and then blame me for defending myself. His love for me is highly conditional and performative, as he usually doesn't express it unless my grades are high enough for his standards or if we're in a public domain. 

When I was 14 I was sexually abused, and then groomed, by two different people. For reasons I don't want to list on this post, he decided to place the blame of these events on me, instead of the perpetrators. When I told him a year later that I wanted to report one of my abusers, he got mad and went on a tangent about how I didn't work hard enough to heal. We argued back and forth until he eventually decided that I was doing enough, so THEN he finally ""supported"" me. I don't know how to describe our visit to the police station that evening, but it was emotionally distressing and I had a lot of trouble talking to the officer and figuring out what I wanted to say. I'm very lucky that he (the officer) believed me and so did the detective we were working with. 

That school year, I found myself constantly struggling with intrusive thoughts about passing on the abuse and potentially doing worse. I stopped talking to most of my younger classmates for several months, for fear that I would act on them. My father's expectations for me became progressively higher and as I failed to live up to them as a result of my mental health struggles, he would constantly taunt me about how disappointing I was and that I would never be good enough. I told him time and time again that I wanted/needed therapy, but he mocked me for it, saying that it was stupid and inconvenient because why couldn't I just trust him and take his advice for free, instead of paying a stranger to vent to? That stranger wouldn't love or care for me as much as he would, wouldn't they? I later resorted to emotional manipulation as an attempt to convince him, as my anger grew violent and more difficult for me to control. Nothing came out of it.

The anguish this caused me still affects me to this day. I often find myself avoiding activities like studying and feel anxious whenever I partake in the activity, because I know that the action is going to remind me of these events. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I'd feel a sudden surge of anger and hatred for him.

I've forgiven both of my abusers, and almost every other person who wronged me in the past. They didn't deserve it, but I did. The bitter feelings I had for them were eating me inside out, and they were hurting me more than anyone else. They're not in my life anymore, and I needed a way to let go. For me, this was the way. 

My father has done a lot for me despite his toxic tendencies, and I want to be grateful for it. He created me. I go to one of the best high schools in my state, and I credit him for helping me get there. He was the reason I was able to get started in the first place, with every hobby I enjoy. I have a love and appreciation for science and logic, and he was the first person who fostered these interests. He buys me stuff whenever I ask for it and pays for all my extracurriculars. He cooks food for me. He taught me how to drive. He takes me and my mom on road trips. We live in a developed country, in a nice suburban single family home, with clean water, because of him. Etc, etc. And there are people out there who've gone through much worse than me.

For about the past year I've been pretending that everything in our relationship has been okay, just to avoid conflict. But it feels so broken, and oftentimes I'm still emotionally strained. He probably doesn't even know how much he hurt me. 

Is there any way for me to let go like I did for all the other people mentioned in this post, and how? How do you forgive someone you have to live with, and still be emotionally guarded around them? Alternatively, is there another way to live life to the fullest without having to forgive the person? 

Tldr: my father treated me horribly in the past and is still a toxic person to be around. His behavior still affects me today. He genuinely tries to be a good parent otherwise and I want to forgive him / move on. But how?",26Dec2020,1

I proceeded to grab two pitchers and started filling it with honey thickened water from the juice machine. Half way through, the honey thickened water ran out. So I grabbed another box from the back. I’ve been working here for two months and I still struggle with replacing the bags. So I asked for help from a coworker. He said something I couldn’t understand, I think it was “does she want a cup of honey thickened water or a pitcher?” I said “what?” because i didn’t hear what he said. He said “you know what, why don’t you go ask her?” in the most belittling way. My other coworker laughing said “honey thickened water is in the fridge”. I’m thinking she already had a pitcher made in there but turns out she was talking about cups of honey thickened water. My coworker that belittled me said to the lady who was now waiting at the door “Do you want a cup or a pitcher?” She said a pitcher. And then he told me that he would fix it for them. And he saw the two pitchers, one filled half way with honey water and probably realized I knew what I was talking about all along. But he only fixed her one pitcher of honey water and left the other pitcher on the juice table. Then a second lady came back later and asked for another pitcher. Then he had to fix another one.

453,"I’ve never had a hard time making friends growing up. I always seemed to find a few friends. In high school I had a larger group of friends, but I only developed close relationships with a few of them because generally that’s how I best connect with others. Fast forward, I am 30 now, and I always thought I wanted quality over quantity but these days I’m feeling insecure about how little friends I have to hang out with. I have one friendship with a high school friend who was my bestie but she moved away to a neighbouring city about 3 hours away. We still keep in touch and I still visit with her when she comes to town but it’s just not the same as it once was. I have a really close relationship with my cousin who I would also consider a best friend, but she also lives in a different city. Her and I talk everyday via text: I can confide in her and my relationship is meaningful to me. My cousin also introduced me to her best friend a few years back, she lives in my city. I love her, she is a great new friendship and we have become quite close. I hang out with her periodically but she is busy often so we don’t hang out more than once or twice a month at the most. I have one more friend from university, she is lovely to chat with and I always enjoy seeing her but for whatever reason she and I don’t reach out to hang out regularly. I have some people on social media who are old high school friends or old work friends on Facebook or Instagram. They are more acquaitences than anything at this point. I just can’t help but feel insecure lately and I know this sounds so stupid but here I am. I see people with way more friendships and followers on social media and I wonder why I don’t have that. People I was friends with in the past at work, university etc have just faded away over the years. I’m not really a drinker/party person so I suspect that has something to do with why I haven’t been the go-to person for some people. People always speak fondly of me and my personality so I don’t believe it’s an issue there. It’s hard to describe how I feel... I feel like I’m a more introverted person who loves to be alone much of the time but who also longs for friendships and connection. I’m not bad at socializing, but I’m bad at asking people to hang out, and I love being at home. Lately I’ve just wanted more? I don’t even know how to make adult friends now. I’m the office manager of my husbands accounting firm and there isn’t really room for friendships at work. I don’t have any group hobbies or activities I do like sports etc where I could meet people.

I've always imagined that by now I'd have a place of my own and be doing my own thing so now I feel really frustrated that I'm still at home with my parents. Even though I know it's because they rely on me and not the other way around I still feel embarrassed about it. 

To make matters worse, there's no end in sight! My dad made some really stupid financial decisions when I was a teenager and ended up with horrible debt that was only recently resolved. But since both he and my mother are too old to work, they have no income and no savings of their own. If it weren't for the scholarship money I had, I never would have have been able to afford college.

455,"For about 3 years now I've been stuck in driver's ed limbo with a driving anxiety that has only gotten worse.

It started with just some nervous tingling and creeped up to shaking, nausea, migraines and nightmares. At that point I just gave up getting the license since my parents refused to accept that I couldn't do it, and therapy was of no use either and way too expensive.

Flashforward to today, a little over a year since I last put my hands on a steering wheel. My family has been really pushing me into ""taking it seriously"" and ""stop being lazy"" to the point where it's just getting annoying.

I bought Dirt Rally on the Steam winter sale for 5 bucks just to play with some friends and figured I might as well *try* it in VR. Turns out it's immersive enough to actually trigger my anxiety, and since it's a game I can just click pause and take a break if needed.

Since the sale is still going on, I thought about buying some more driving sims and get myself a proper steering wheel. The problem with the steering wheel is that I still live with my parents, who again aren't very understanding/supportive of my anxiety, so it would be awkward spending 200+€ on a steering wheel setup when I've been in the middle of driver's ed for almost 3 years.

I don't know what to tell them that won't turn into even more pushing.

Obviously what I do with my money is up to me, but it's still going to bring up a discussion I'd rather not have just because my parents doesn't understand my anxiety or even how VR works, they would just see it as me being lazy but still wanting to drive so I throw my life away for a video game or something.",26Dec2020,1

460,"Hey All. So lately I’ve been having some thoughts in regards to gaming on the PC, particularly on using the platform of GOG. I don’t really have the strongest computer for gaming, using a Surface Studio, but for the longest time I was an advocate of theirs for their more open minded policies, particularly in DRM free gaming (allowing one to keep the games they buy without fear of losing the license if the store ever shuts down). However, with certain elements coming into play lately, from the disastrous reception of CP77 due to it’s buggy release, along with the removal of Descent from GOG after pressure from Chinese market, my confidence in them has begun to shake a little bit. 

To that end, I have been wondering if I should have more confidence in buying games from Steam, even if it means I’d have to give up DRM free quality in my games. On the other hand, since I don’t have the strongest computer for gaming as it is, I’m also wondering if I should stick to the Playstation ecosystem, seeing as I also have a PS4 they’ll begin utilizing backwards compatibility in their catalogue at least with the PS5 and possibly further. The game library may be more limited, but it’d be more likely that the games I purchase would be able to work completely on the platform.

461,"Throwaway account, just in case.

So... late last night I (female, twenties) got a text from a close friend (male, thirties) that freaked me the heck out. I won't give details on it, but it confessed to long-term suicidal thoughts, referred to himself in a self-loathing way, and ended like a goodbye note. This was after he had called a little earlier, for the first time in several weeks, for a conversation that was only a couple minutes long and where one of the only things he said was that he'd missed hearing my voice. After he sent the text, he stopped responding, and his phone went straight to voicemail when I tried calling (normal, as his phone automatically goes into DND at night.)

I'm several states away from him, and didn't know anyone to call who could go check on him. So I called the local dispatch in his town and asked them to do a wellness check. I figured he might be angry, but couldn't think of what else to do. I already knew he struggled with depression, and I want him to be able to talk to me about it and know that I won't freak out at him, but this... honestly just seemed like a goodbye. I've known him for less than a year and don't have very much context for how he copes or how he speaks when he's depressed.

Well, he called this morning from a psych ward, where he says they're keeping him for at least the weekend, since it's a holiday and they don't have the normal staff to discharge him. Apparently he just went to sleep after texting, and with DND mode obviously didn't hear my texts or calls. He woke up to police officers standing over him, and they involuntarily committed him. I didn't even know they could do that anymore--I thought they would just check on him and maybe talk to him for a while. Super naive, I guess. It sounds like they might have lied about the evidence to commit him? He said that they said they had screenshots of a worse, more explicitly suicidal text that they said he sent me, but he didn't and I never told them anything of the sort. He sounded like he was upset and trying not to be angry with me, and I don't blame him at all--mental health institutions are awful, I'm pretty sure this will just make things way worse for him, and I feel terrible that he has to stay there for so long. At the same time, I don't know what I could have done differently. 

He said he doesn't have his phone, so he probably won't talk to me until he's out.

I'm deeply worried for him both physically and mentally, after reading horror stories about state-run psych wards. I'm apprehensive about how upset he's going to be, and I hate that I can't even be there when he gets out to make sure he has some easy food and that his cat is okay. I would jump on a plane in a second if I thought it would help, but that seems like crossing a major boundary, especially if he's angry.

So I guess--what now? Is there anything I can do, or anything I should have done differently? Should I try to have some deli food delivered once he's discharged, or would that also be crossing a line? Send him a text for when he does get his phone back, or lay low and let him reach out first? Does anyone have experience with anything like this?",26Dec2020,1

From then on she has only visited us once or twice a year, and we haven’t seen her since my 16th birthday. She doesn’t often make an effort to call or text.

I’ve realized now that no true mother would leave her kids like that. I feel especially bad for my brother who has pretty much grown up without her at all. 

But she birthed us so she has to love us right?? I still don’t think she does. She puts in below minimum effort. She was in a legal battle with my dad over all her missing child support, and was satisfied in paying only half of the total she owed.

My boyfriend and I moved into our current apartment at the beginning of July of this year. He has a 4 year old son and I have 2 dogs, a small dachshund mix and a large lab(?) mix. This post regards my large dog.

She is a rescue, around 7 or 8 years old. I believe she is a mix of rottweiler, black lab and border collie. She is roughly the size of a collie but much more thick and stocky. I have had her for years, and I am her first (and last!) real home. She is a very good dog, but she does get over excited and has a hard time calming down. She is also nervous of strangers but has never shown any signs of aggression. She mostly barks, (and she has a VERY loud voice, she sounds like a huge aggressive dog) which she wears a bark collar for.

Now, on to the issue.

We live in a house, where the main floor is an apartment and the basement is an apartment. We live upstairs, while a couple and their baby live downstairs. Occasionally, at night when I let the dogs into the yard for their last pee before bed, my dog will see the downstairs neighbours through their window and bark like mad at them. The bark collar doesn't stop her from this, as she gets very excited or defensive. I always immediately get her back in the house and it is obvious she knows that she is in trouble for barking at them.

Last time this happened, (last night) they let us know that they are absolutely terrified of her and are scared that she is going to hurt them or their baby, God forbid. They say her barking scares them, and the way she runs in the backyard and in front of their windows is frightening. They also say she has bared her teeth and growled at them through the window. There is no way for her to have access to the neighbours from outside nor from inside the house, but I understand their concerns and I worry about how it will affect their baby.

I have never experienced her being aggressive before and I am unsure what I can do to stop her from scaring them.

If anyone has any advice for what I could do to stop her from doing this, I would be very appreciative",26Dec2020,1
465,"Issues with trusting my girlfriend, she’s 21 and I am 25M

We’ve been dating for 3 months and have spent nearly every day together therein. She says she loves and cares about me, however there were things I noticed about her from the beginning that made me wonder wether or not I could trust her. 

To start off, I have a torn frenulum on my genitals and we’re not gonna be able to have sex for a few weeks. This is fine for me, but I worry she might do something behind my back. 

In the first couple weeks we started dating, I noticed that she was still willing to get really close to other guys when we’re together. Like, she’d go sit leg to leg with a dude we just met and give them some silly smiley remark. Or another example, we went to a party with some of her college friends. A guy she used to fuck was there and he was really stand offish toward me. Still, she sat on the arm of his recliner and was like, “is it okay if I sit next to you?” All smiley and shit. That was a red flag for me. I think she still snap chats this guy. At the same party, she got drunk and tried to suck me off in a bathroom right next to a room everyone was partying in. She will sometimes treat me differently around other people. She also has lots of guys who snap chat her constantly and I know she likes the attention for the following reason: 

She is dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety, followed by an eating disorder. She explained to me a couple weeks ago that she’s never been so lean and when she posts a picture of herself she gets a lot of attention from people she never did before and really likes it. She will purposely not eat if she’s hungry. There was an occasion a few weeks in when she slept over my place and she wouldn’t let me fall asleep. She would literally try to kick me out of my bed if I started to doze off and throw a fit. But I got mad and told her that wasn’t gonna be a thing or we’d have issues. It’s been fine since, but she’ll still make fun of me and give me shit for falling asleep early and it’ll upset her. She also called me a simp for being sweet to her once, which I didn’t like at all. 

This situation is difficult because while we get along very well and enjoy many of the same hobbies, I just can’t put my complete trust in her. She’s great with my family and she blows me up on her social media, but I feel like she still might try to pull something behind my back. Especially if we can’t have sex for a month because she’s incredibly horny. I really like her but I’m just not sure if I should progress further or if I’ve been ignoring red flags. This is my first girlfriend and I don’t know what to do.",26Dec2020,1

Is it because I'm a teenager? I've looked this up on google and It said that it's a symptom of adhd. I did more research on adhd and a lot if times I can relate to those symptoms, almost everyday i forget to do something, then feel guilty about it. I can't focus when there's too much going on. I can't sit still. I get bored of something easily. I blackout alot. But I don't know if it's actually adhd, maybe I'm overreacting and it's a normal thing when you grow up. I'm scared to tell my mom that I think that something is wrong with me, because both my parents are ""its all in your head"" type of guy.

469,"Hi all, 

I am from Germany so sorry in advance for my English.

My friend (40) thinks he is a prophet. He has always been into spiritual stuff but recently it has been extreme :/ He also watches new age videos such as Magenta Pixie and things like that (enneagram) and thinks he can influence energetic vibrations to lead humanity, activate Stargates etc. In addition, he wants to be like Jesus. I am really worried about him as I think it might be paranoia or something like that.

He does not take drugs but drinks about four beer of alcohol every day in the evening which has become that bad due to Corona and kind of a habit now - he is definitely not coping well. 

So last time I visited, basically a week ago we had a total fallout. I stayed at his flat for a few days. There he has been treating me really bad (hostile), I would pretty much consider it bullying. Complaining about things, criticizing etc. Even his housemate said that she had never seen that side of him. 

**To name a few examples:**

\- I once dropped a bit of chocolate ice cream on his pillow on the sofa. I said ""ups"" and got up in order to clean it in the bathroom. He freaked out ... When I wanted to slice the tomato, he told me I was using the wrong knife (I should have used the sharper one ...). I do not know his knifes and the knife was fine. For sure I was angry about it and stopped talking for a bit.

\- He has been losing friendships over the years. He is also in an argument with one of his former best friends who he has known since university times. He became offended when she sent him a photo of her unborn baby who had the mouth open on the scan - he thought it was a reference to his big mouth. He took it personally and has not really contacted her since - not even congratulated her to her pregnancy. Offending him was not her intention. She sent the same photo and text to many of her friends, even me. But still he does not see it this way.

\- When I was at his flat: Even though we settled on what to cook earlier in the day; he decided not to participate in the cooking process when we wanted to do it, as he just ""did not feel like it"", however, behind my back he criticized my potatoes and called them ""shit"" (I rarely hear him use such words, usually never) but this is what he told the housemate.

\- Understandably, I was in a withdrawn and not energetic mood once is hostile behavior towards me started - however, he was able to switch from a ""not okay"" mood to a ""let's have fun"" mood and this was just irritating.

\- Once he put on the Magenta Pixie video on TV which he wanted to show us, he started criticizing my attitude, how I was not opening up. He was praising the housemate for being interested as she was making noises like ""aha"" (though (I later talked to her) this noise was just made as she knows he does not like criticism - so he interpreted her ""confirmation"" totally wrong). She is also worried about him.

\- Also which I am very worried about. He has a ""friend"", which he did not like much in the past when he was still more normal. Now that she is into that spiritual stuff; he enjoys talking to her. She claims that she can talk to/communicate with trees and he believes her! I think she is a bad influence and just a ""support"" for his mental instability.

\- He told me he has never felt more clear in his head.

\- On the train he was asking my why I was so negative all the time; I told him it was due to his constant bullying behavior towards me this weekend. He then replied that this was not true, he was referring to my general energetic pattern ... I never gave him the answer which he wanted as there was not such one. He did not like that.

\- He always compares me and other friends to the enneagram descriptions. He gets his daily mails. I feel like he does not see me as an individual anymore but always tries to find truth in the enneagram. Furthermore, he (so we think) adjusts his behavior unconsciously to that of what the enneagram says. According to the enneagram, he thinks he is the Reformer (type one) - perfectionism ... 

\- He once promised me (already two years ago) to show me his university photos. He never did. When his housemate was there he got them out, showed them to her, asked me briefly whether I wanted to see them. I was saying ""yes"" but more quietly. Then he said: If you are not energetic for it, then you shouldn't (He had already criticized me a lot at this point). At the same time I was angry and I thought, why would you show them to her ""now"" and not me in the past. You have known me for much longer.

In the end we decided on a friendship pause. 

I don't know how to get him out of there. His behavior was just appalling. 

I called an anti-sect-organization for advice and they told me to keep my distance and that I should tell him if I decided to pause the friendship. In addition, I should use the words ""I"" and ""me""; tell him about how I feel about his changed behavior and how he hurt me but also that I would still be available if he needed me.

I just don't understand. He has changed for the worse and it makes me so sad to see his changing behavior and hostility towards me. A friend would never do these things. But what can I do?",26Dec2020,1
470,"I (F 18) am from Pakistan, about 1 year ago my cousin (M 13) started living with us when it was found that his mom used to physically abuse him. It's been a year since he has been living with us and during that time he has rarely ever talked to me or my mom. He usually pretends to not even hear us. We can knock at his room for hours and he won't open the door

. Daily he comes from school and locks himself in his room. Only opening to take food which he never eats with us. Not only me and my mother but I have noticed he doesn't talk to any women, none of my aunts or other cousins even those his own age. The only one in the house he listens to or talks to is my dad. He stopped going to therapy after about a month of going there which I think might be because she was a woman as well. My parents don't want to force him to do anything so they never asked him to go once he said he won't be going anymore. Similarly whenever he says to us to leave him alone my mom doesn't disturb him and I have been told to do the same. 

Since more than a year of being living together I've never really talked to him at all. Even if I try he us ignores. He even told the maid to not clean his room and when my mom said she'll do it herself he refused saying he'll clean it himself. 

My parents think he is just shy and will improve as he grows up. He has never really complained or argued other than to be left alone and has never fought with anyone as far as I know. He currently is going to an all boys school as well, although there are female teachers there but I haven't heard of him ignoring them.",26Dec2020,1
471,"I've been having some trouble with sucidal thoughts recently due to some unfortunate events that have happened in my life and I'm needing some advice from someone who may relate to my situation. 

This whole situation started in 2018 when a very close friend of mine called me at 12-1am in the morning. I didn't really think anything of it as we usually had conversations 24/7. but I did think it was a bit werid that she called me instead of texting. I was 15 at the time she was also the same age. The conversation started as any other conversation we've had before. We'd usually talk about how each other are going and basically just talk about whatever was on our minds. Everthing seem to been fine in till about 15mins into the conversation she just stopped talking and it sounded like she dropped her phone or something. I started laughing because she was always a bit clumsy. But then I got worried when she didn't say anything when I was saying her name. I started to shout her name hoping she would say something but it was silent on her end. I decided to call her back and see if she would pick up but I got no answer. I called her parents straight afterwards to go and check on her but her parents weren't home as they went out. I told them what had happened and they headed straight back home. I later found out that she deliberately Over Dosed to commit sucide and that I was the Last person she talked too. I was honestly shocked that she committed suicide as I had no idea she was having these thoughts. I blamed myself for not being a good enough friend for not noticing earlier that she was feeling sucidal. I feel like I could have helped her if I had known. I keep saying to myself ""What kind of friend am I"". 

To this day I still blame myself for what had happened and since then I've lost 2 more of my friends to sucide. I don't really feel comfortable sharing there stories but all you need to know is that I also feel like I'm solely responsible for them wanting to commit sucide aswell. I'm 17 now and I'm currently still in highschool but I don't even feel like Im going to make it to my own graduation.

472,"Okay so there's alot to say but I I'll explain the gist of my situation. Here it goes....so there's this guy 🙄 I've known him for 6 years and he's  my best friend. He cares about me, he's a great listener, gives me advice all the time and helps build my confidence. Whenever I talk to him he makes me so happy. We can talk for HOURS. My family loves him, he's one of the few realest friends I've ever had. Unfortunately he moved to another state and we stopped communication for awhile until I came up there recently to see my family and visit him. When I went to hang out with him, he brought something up that I never expected to hear from him. He told me he's ALWAYS had feelings for me but I was always in a toxic relationship. I was completely oblivious to that because I was soo caught up with these shitty guys and he knew I deserved better. I almost cried because I could've saved so much time and feelings and been with him instead :( but this was years ago. Now he's in a 2 year relationship with a girl that treats him right and I can tell she might be the one but I've never met her. I just knew because of what he has told me. But anyway I was sad because of the time he chose to tell me this. I'm in school working towards a career and he's in a committed relationship plus we live in different statea. Me and him were having drinks and eventually one thing led to another and next thing you know we start kissing and there was no sex but we both wanted to and now that's all he thinks about. He messages me everyday as a friend but also someone that has feelings but can't do anything about it. Its fucked up I know but I don't wanna lose him as a friend. He asks for nudes and talks about sex. I know it's wrong but we can't help ourselves. This is something that we both want but can't have. It's fucking me up because I don't want to catch feelings for someone in a relationship..I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. He's flirted with me while in his previous relationship with someone that was toxic but I always ignored it. I wish I knew why he can't just leave her and be happy with someone that's he's always loved. Now he wants to come to Miami where I live to get a hotel and be with me. He always talks about how he regrets not being honest with me and how he feels when he had the chance. But this was years ago and now things are different. I need advice he doesn't want his girl knowing anything of course and wants to keep it as our secret.",26Dec2020,1
473,"Hi,

I’m prospective college student and long story short, I accidentally missed the deadline to a college that was really important to me. I dealt with some personal issues and was also forgetful. I wanted to appeal this, however, it’s been awhile and I’m outside the appeal deadline.

I had an idea of telling them that I tried to send an appeal, but it was sent to the wrong email address, and then showing a screenshot of the “email” and changing the text to make it look like I did in-fact send it to the wrong one.

Would this be a bad idea? I understand it’s maybe not ethically great, but it seems like it’s pretty low on that scale.

i guess my question is what do i do? whenever i bring something up to her about how i’m feeling she gets really confrontational and i try my absolute hardest to not be bitchy when i’m starting that kind of conversation but she gets confrontational and defensive really quick.

476,"December 10th my dog of 10 years passed away after a surgery that we were told there was a low chance of her passing. Anyway, I am ready to love a new dog and my wife is not. I am willing to get a puppy or a 2 year old dog and i would like a small dog.  She says that it is too soon for her and any dog would feel too much like a replacement. I don't feel this way,  because like i know she is aware, nothing could ever replace my other dog. I asked if i could get a hamster or a guinea pig, a hedgehog, a ferret... the answer was no for all of them.

A few important things to mention: 

We have a 2 year old son
We want to try for another kid,  which could mean i would need to take care of my wife and 2 year old if she gets pregnant
We have a 13 year old dog that has seizures about once a month
We live with MIL
If something happens to our other dog it will put off getting a dog even longer

I am ready to move out away from the mother in law if she keeps me from getting a dog.  I have also considered moving out from my wife.  I know the last part sounds a bit drastic, but having a dog is obviously pretty important to me.  I would not literally break up my family over it,  but i do feel like it causes a lot of tension in the short time we are dealing with it. And it has potential to become a serious problem for me over time. I don't want my wife to resent a new dog, but i need an animal in my life to love.

479,"So I’ve known this guy for a while now and every now and then we go out in groups to hang out and such. About a few weeks ago, we were all hanging out at the park. While I was sitting at the bench with a couple of friends, he sat down next to me and asked me if I wore color contacts cause I had really nice eyes. I said “Haha, no I don’t, but thank you.” And he said “Yeah, they look so nice when the sun shines on them.” That was the first occasion.

There’s been other times, but this was the most recent occasion. Just yesterday, we were all in a car together. His girlfriend was sitting to his left, and I was on his right. We were all laughing and having fun. We all took a picture together in the car and while we all looked at it, he looked at me in the picture and asked me if I ever wore braces and I said “no” and he said “you have really nice teeth, they look so perfect.” I just said “Thanks,” and at this point I started to feel weird. I felt weird mainly because his girlfriend (who is also my friend) went pretty quiet and she wouldn’t talk to me much. I also felt weird because this guy I’ve known for a while just recently started complimenting me.

486,"Some context before we start so that you can understand the problem here:
We live in Brazil, where our currency is extremely cheap right now, so where the normal EURO price is 4, it’s now 6.50. But, when with our currency getting cheap, the cost of living here is practically the same. So, if in Europe you can rent a home for 1500 EURO, here you can rent a home for 1500 REAIS. Of course the prices are never the same, but it’s just a comparison for you to understand. So if I go from Brazil to Europe, I’d be paying 6.5 times more for the same thing. 

TL;DR: going from Brazil to Europe you’d be living a life 6.5x more expensive there.

My mother suddenly decided that she wants to live in Italy, saying that she wants to try a new life there. The problem? Aside from the obvious like visas and such, we simply do not have the money. Ever since my father died last year, we have no source of income (pandemic came at the worst time for me to find a job), so we only have what he left us. The money we have left would probably let us live normally for about 1 1/2 years give or take, BUT, like I said earlier, it’s 6 times “more” expensive there, so we’d have 6 times less time and, considering that at the moment no one has a job, we’re fucked. So we have no visa, have no money and we have 6 dogs, which I have no idea how we could transport them there. Basically, at the moment, it’s simply impossible to go there. But even knowing all of this, she just wants to stay 6 months there, because she says that everyone has a chance to start from zero, and I agree, but now when you’d have to abandon everything (we have property here as well), because just transporting the dogs would take money that we just can’t, and I’m not even considering that I’m doing university here and all.

And the money she’d be using is the same my father left behind, so from our savings (me my brother and hers)

488,"Hi.

Im a 35 (almost 36) year old guy from England. As I write this I am sat in my lounge with my wife and daughter. Christmas has been good this year, so for that I am grateful.

But in the quiet moments I do tend to think what if. So here is what I would tell my past  self. I hope some other people can benefit from this.

Firstly try harder in school. The goofing off and trying to play the clown for laughs isn't worth it in the long run. The resulting poor grades will mean you have to work long hours to achieve a half decent wage. In turn you spend less time at home with your family. So work harder at school. It will pay off at the end.

Be careful of your diet. It will take you a long time to get that weight off. It will ruin your confidence and self esteem. This will stay with you until you just get fed up of being fat and you hit the gym for 3 years (I'm still going). Even after dropping 4 stone you will look in the mirror and you still won't be happy. You will still see the fat you. But you are getting there.

Take chances. Don't always play it safe. Safe is Comfortable, but it's boring. Just push those boundaries. By the time you are 35 you will feel like your life is pretty much done. Yep you have a wife, a child and a house, but there is no excitement in your life.

Try not to compare yourself to others. You are you, you aren't them. Even though on the outside they may seem cool and admirable, they all have problems. Try not to take social media too seriously and for fuck sake don't compare yourself to what you see on it. These images aren't reality. They will also warp your idea of what is achievable and what is attractive.

Look after your hair. It will be all gone by the time you are 25 (probably just a me thing)

Try to look after your mental health. It's far more important than you will ever realise. It can cripple you.

Anyway. That's it for now.",26Dec2020,1

I’d really like to be able to stay friends, but I’m not sure if that’s realistic, at least right now. Should I tell her I can’t stay friends because I still have feelings? Should I just ask for space until I’m ready? Should I just give being friends a chance?",26Dec2020,1

493,"There’s been five instances of old nudes being discovered that he lied to me about by swearing they were deleted and he just forgot about them. He never actually deleted them and lied to me multiple times about one of them not being his best friends which we both knew was a lie but he stuck to his story. Anytime there’s a argument or something and I send my long paragraph about how he’s hurt me and how I don’t deserve this he always just says I’m sorry do you wanna break up. I sat on his floor balling on Christmas Eve and he just sat on his couch watching me with a very blank look on his face and it infuriated me and I just told him he didn’t care and then he got up and hugged me. I asked him why he lied he said he didn’t know I told him it was fucked up that he kept
Doing this to me he said I know
It’s my fault I’m sorry I really forgot about them like there wasn’t 4 other times this happened. I always try to leave and end up with crushing ruminating about what if I was overreacting he’s so sweet it was just that one thing I even dream about him being with someone else and I always run back to him and things are fine until they aren’t. I’ve gone through his phone a few  times like deep dive and never found any inappropriate texts or random repeated phone calls or anything so unless he just deletes everything or has a really good secret keeping app I didn’t find anything else. My trust has been broken before but I got over it and then the same girl he lied about to me the first time he had several screenshots of her nudes. It always feel like when situations like this happen he doesn’t care like I’m sorry is just supposed to make it all better. I feel crazy and broken and weak at times because no matter how badly he hurts me I can’t seem to let go I’m afraid he knows that and is gonna start like physically cheating on me if he hasn’t already. I’m scared it’ll get worse because maybe his intentions were to actually break me I was a pretty decently functioning virgin now I’m a recovering self harmer working really hard every day to gain some self confidence back and be able to function and deal with my day to day life. I’m not sure what I’m gonna do when he leaves he’s my first everything and only friends and person I hang out  and I don’t really have any friends and my family isn’t exactly supportive so it makes me even more happy to have him when things are good because I can escape in him and he buys me snacks to keep at his apartment he’s offered me a key and cleaned out a drawer and buys me travel stuff to keep at his apartment and I think he loves me but sometimes I’m not sure",26Dec2020,1

The above is the story of what happened.
Now, according to google, semen can be alive for up to 5 days, this is important because 5 days after out meetup, her period had came (19th of November). So when she was on her period we were relieved, but then her period has not come for the entire month of december now and we are starting to worry and overthink again.

496,Your mother in law throws a Christmas eve and Christmas Day  party during these tough times. She invites your family to spend time with her. Your family had already decided to attend the party on the 25 a week before. Your family decided to go on Christmas Eve last minute because your uncle work schedule changed they gave him the 24 off instead of the 25. He also couldn’t attend the party on the 25 . Your little sister was looking forward to spending time with your little cousin. So you call your mother in law and  ask her if your uncle could also attend the party on the 24  instead of the 25 she said no because of Covid. Mind you she’s coming from PA she has family coming from Florida and everyone else is from Boston where the party takes place . On top of that you have more than 10 people in room. Sooooo what about Covid are you trying to prevent?  I took this to offensive because her reasoning didn’t make sense to me and made me feel like my family has Covid because 4 other people in the party on the 24 was too much. If your trying to prevent Covid then you should of never had a party or should of never invited my family. In a real world nothing goes as plan .  We ended up not attending her party at all and decided to go to my uncles house . But she got mad because I took my son away from her . What she doesn’t understand is that my son goes where I go. She could of simply said it’s too many people not enough space I wouldn’t get offended. I understand. But don’t say Covid when everyone is coming from different places and you have more than 10 people in the apartment. Thoughts?,26Dec2020,1

The lady is very lazy, and does the bare minimum while the rest cleans up after us, is very unfit to work within a healthcare facility, and overall just very unprofessional. She can be kind, but only to those she likes. When she isn't I ALWAYS have to diffuse the situation. It's exhausting.

The man has no idea what he's doing, very mean to other people (especially the women), and deflects everything onto others. He also has a very bad temper for work, which again, I have to be the one to step in and diffuse.

It is very important to me because I used to celebrate it with my family (he's in a religion where they don't celebrate Christmas) yearly before I moved out. I mentioned to him that I was sad and that I cried last year because I didn't celebrate. It made me think of the happy times with my family. He told me he would celebrate with me this year and that made me happy. We were chatting and I told him I'd brb because I had to use the bathroom. When I returned, he wasn't responding.

He sat on the bed for a bit then fell asleep but apologized at around 2am when he woke up. I forgave him then but I don't know what to do now because it's happened again.

One person in my family asked for pictures of my grandfather for our small funeral from everybody that had them. Included was two of his children. Then, some issues came up between the siblings and the family member that has the pictures. 
Sibling One doesnt matter to me. I dont care about them. 
Sibling Two. I've gotten back in touch with. Its been close to a decade, and I've missed them... I missed my family so much. 
Ive been seeing sibling two in secret. And last night, they said they have no pictures of their dad.. And we had an emotional talk and cried and I said I would get them pictures... 
There is so many issues between everybody. Main Family Member is my world too. But she still has these pictures. 
I took a ton on my phone. As nice as i can make them for the next time I visit Sibling Two. I want it to be a late Christmas gift. 


Me seeing them will completely cut me out of the other side of the family if I'm found out. I know it. Main Family Member, my elder, is stubborn and a little stuck up... 
I also stole a picture from the many photo albums... Just one. Snuck it into my pocket. 
I do need advice please. Is this wrong. To send these pictures to them. I feel like no one should not have pictures of their dad... Is stealing one too far. Can I even trust them to not tell in the future... Not to brag they got pictures and the other didn't, (Siblings havent talked since, either, so that might not happen). Can i trust them to not be lying to me also.

515,"Okay this is going to be a long one. So my parents got divorced when I was 14 (I'm 23 now), and as far as divorces can be good, this really was for the best. My father fell head over heels for someone else about a year and a half after the divorce, and they have since moved in together. I hated my stepmom at first, I didn't want to be near her, but we have since warmed up to each other, though sometimes she can still get under my skin. 

My mom, on the other hand, has not been in an official relationship since the divorce, though she fell in love a few years ago with an ex-colleague of hers. He claims he has feelings for her too, he spoils her, and I can tell that she's really crazy for him. Here's the problem: he's married to another woman, and thus, cheating on her with my mom. He's been saying that he wants a divorce, but it's been YEARS since he brought that up. Frankly, it sickens me. Not only will his wife be utterly traumatized when this inevitably comes to light, but I can't trust someone who willingly betrayed the person he married, and then lies about it for years. I've brought it up with mom before, but she says she trusts him. I want mom to be happy, but she deserves so much better. I think she's got rose-tinted lenses on.

I'm autistic and big changes are The Worst, which is why I fear I'm overreacting. These technically aren't my issues, but I want my mom to be happy with someone who doesn't string her along while still married.

516,"I (32F) have a problem with my in-laws listening. I dont know how to view this or how to handle this.

It started off after my husband and i first got married. We lived in an apartment with his brother and his brothers gf. Instead of driving/walking the trash to the dumpster, they just left the bag outside by the backdoor (we were on the bottom floor). I told them they shouldnt do that cause animals will get into it. They ignored me and told me they did that all the time and nothing ever happened. Then twice in one week, animals got in the trash. I thought maybe they didnt want to walk everytime, so i suggested why not get a big trash can for the back. My BIL then said no, we'll just walk the trash out to the dumpster. I didnt say I told you so, but left a little stunned they didnt say at least sorry for not listening to me.

Another incident, my SIL was helping my husband put the bed frame together in our new house. This house has all wood flooring, and this is our first house. I told them to please put pads where the bed frame touches the floor. I dont want the floor to get scratched or damaged. There was one that wasn't quite touching the floor. I told them to still put one there. My SIL gave me the look like i was being stupid and convinced my husband not to do it. Well months later, we got a rug to go under the bed and theres a huge dent in the floor from that part they decided not to put a pad on! I was pissed and yelled at my husband for it. He just shrugged and said we'll replace the floor when we move. Still no apology.

There have been other incidents but those are 2 that stand out the most. How do i view this? Everytime i share some advice that i KNOW is wise, they ignore me and give me the look like I'm stupid.

Makes me delete ig because “instagram hoes” 

In reality theres so many guys on her phone.

Everytime i text her , sometimes shes good than other times (more times) shes in a bad mood which leads to an argument she says she doesnt start .. then tells me “stop texting or ill block u , your annoying bro” 
Shit like that , theres never communication.
Shes literally an escort . And idk if she actually loves me. Sometimes i feel lonely and down and wouldnt a text to check up on me just be fine ? Like isnt it normal? Its like she has no feelings. 

Shes been with over 40 guys.. thats including work cause she does escorting. Im stuck between i love her because sometimes things are alright . But sometimes i think i just want a pretty girlfriend who is also sweet and doesnt always hurt me.

Lets say for instance she gets mad or thinks im being shady.. shell add guys she used to talk to back on snap .. etc . Punishing behaviour when i havent done anything. Its so sad cause i feel like i shouldnt be this sad 😢 or someone who doesnt even show me off on social media, (im not saying thats a requirement) but we used to be on each others stories all the time. She says she doesnt cheat or talk to men but god knows.. ive seen her talk to men before..

She treated her ex like trash too. 
I was just reading the messages.. its like she has no heart . When i first met her i thought she was beautiful. I still do.. but i thought she was really beautiful and that i wanted to be with her.. more and more i kept giving her chances cause i liked her but she has many childish ways. She cant effectively communicate when theres a problem instead she ignores me.

She NEVER texts , im the only one who texts. And if i dont text her when im gone i wont even get a text.

She always gets mad when i bring up the fact of an open relationship, says she doesnt want one
But i feel she isnt being loyal100% but she wants me to remain loyal.
I dont check her phone cause im scared ill just be hurt. 

Ik ppl tell me stuff like leave her .. but its harder than u think . When u love someone u constantly try. I dont get why i do this to my self.

And for those of u who say just talk to her about these issues . I have and i have , nothing changes .. its the same thing over and over. 
She was a hoe before i met her , she told me she was a hoe.

Nd now being in a relationship with her has been the hardest ever and takes a toll on the mental. Even tho i never stop thinking about her and love her. And can see us both together in my head in a perfect relationship i can see us being happy and her being sweet ... all in my head.

525,"I'm 20 F and I have the most insane crush on a guy who is 30. I've dated and met so many people in a city but I've never met someone as kind at this man. Everyone who works with him says he is the nicest person they ever met. When I was upset on lunch break he sat down with me and bought me a snack. Last week when I was busy working all day he went up to me and asked me why I was ignoring him and it made my heart stop and it made me blush. He introduced me to his mom and said a bunch of nice things about me. The list goes on of green lights to pursue him. 

He is nice to everyone though but I get so shy around him and clam up. A couple things are holding me back. I was 220 pounds (I'm 5'6) in 2019 and when I met him three months ago I had already lost 40 pounds. I'm now 170 so I'm back to looking normal weight to where my friends were complimenting my body but I didn't know if I should wait till I'm 150. I'm comfortable with my weight for the first time in a long time but I don't know if that would help the situation. I know he is single as well.

 I'm sorry this post is a mess but I would like to get closer to him but I'm so shy and stutter when close to him. Are there any tips to help me get things going or at least show if he is interested? Thanks",26Dec2020,1
526,"I am 22 and I've worked nothing but minimum wage jobs for the last five years, the highest pay I've ever had is $10/hr. I've had jobs where I have to get up at 3am for work, and jobs where I don't get home until 1am. I've worked singles, doubles, and triples. I've worked 13 hour days, and 60 hour weeks. I've worked in miserable conditions that drove me to tears.

But through it all, I've always managed to get up everyday to put my shoes on and head out to work. And I do my respective jobs so well that I'm frequently praised for my hard work, and always valued as one of the best employees. I become a worker who everyone else can rely on, someone who is friendly, efficient, and fast.

But I have never been able to apply this same energy to myself. My true dream is to be a freelance artist, and during quarantine of this year I decided to give it a shot. I reached decent success fairly quickly, and got commission requests, contracted gigs, and offers to have my art featured in magazines.  But I quickly reached a point where I was unable to pull myself out of bed, and unable to paint anything. So I gave up, and went back to working dead-end jobs.

This same situation also happened to me when I tried going to community college. I was in and out of school for 2 years, and each semester I would be kicked out within a month from not showing up to class. The fourth time I tried, I lasted two days before dropping out completely.

Why is this the case? I'm sure it has something to do with mental illness, but even though I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety my whole life, I can still force myself to go to work everyday. But why am I only able to do this with my job, even though I hate it? Why can't I get myself to pursue the one thing I actually want in life? What can I do to change this?",26Dec2020,1

528,"My neighbor’s dog used to be one of my favorites in the neighborhood. So chill, calm, minded their own, adorable.

But as of the last 3-4 months the dog gets excited about my dogs. It sounds cute and it was, but now that dog barks 24/7. Anytime she’s outside she barks nonstop because she wants my dogs to come out. We’ve been trying not to let our pups out when she does that but it sucks for them to not get to go outside because the neighbor’s dog is misbehaving and we are trying to train her. 

On top of that we cannot really let them out when she’s outside or she gets even worse: scream barking, yipping, snarling at them. She’s not purposefully aggressive, she’s just excited. But my older dog doesn’t know that any after a minute or so he starts barking back. He never ever barks so this is abnormal, the dog just agitates him. I know we’ve gotten a noise complaint or two about the dogs because neighbors can’t tell who’s dog it is.

It truly is nonstop. If our dogs are inside, if they’re outside, if they stay quiet, if they defend themselves, etc. the dog does. not. stop. The owner has even commented to me “yeah I’m not sure how to get her to stop. It sucks!” I’m a dog owner so I’m super empathetic and understanding usually but this dog is out of control. Yesterday she stopped barking for 2 hours totally out of the 12 we were awake and home. We have to put on loud music to drown it out and our pups get so bummed when they can’t go outside otherwise it’ll make the dog worse. It’s really unfair to all of us.

Since the owner knows and won’t do anything about it and apparently noise complains from our neighbors don’t help, what could we do? TIA💕",26Dec2020,1

533,"So i’m in this polyamorous relationship (a group of 5 including me) and I (27M) have an issue with one (25M) of them. Let’s call him Bob.

He’a been odd with me these past few months. From such as having a go at me for getting my heart checked when I wanted a piercing (it can be fatal and it was in my family history so I needed to get it checked anyway. I’m ok). Accusing me of attention seeking about said condition. When I had one partner and him over, i wanted to cook them dinner. He said no as my cooking is terrible so we ordered food instead. When I was on a video call with friends, he would purposely make loud noises which my friends complained to me. He would sometime ignore me texts on purpose and when I ask him if something is up in person, he says no. We don’t have sex anymore or barely intimate. He would often be rude to me as well. For a secret santa, i put on my wishlist as a joke that I wanted his right nipple but also proper options. So he pulled a fast one and ‘gifted’ his nipple to me. We had to take photos of gifts and make them blurred for everyone to guess what everyone got and I asked for a pic of his nipple. He said no, i felt he was saying no just to be annoying. So i went on his nude twitter (which every person in this relationship follows) and got a picture of his right nipple there. Cropped everything else out so it’s just his nipple. When I used the picture, he had a go at me for using that picture without his permission and threatened to sue me for copyright infringement.

Again, i did ask if something was up but he said nothing. He DOES have bi-polar so it could be that plus he hasn’t been coping well with lockdown and losing his job n all (which probably explains the gift but he could just say to me he can’t get one due to his money situation which I would completely understand.

I have a gut feeling he’s to do something really bad that will jeopardise the rest of my relationship with other members on the group. I’m going to talk to one of them soon about this for advice on how to handle the situation.

I spoke to one of my friends and he says I should just drop him which is difficult in a poly relationship.

535,"My s/o and I went to my mom’s house for Christmas, driving about 10 hours to get there. 

My dad died 3 years ago and left my mom home alone in a big house. By choice of her own, she pretty much sits in her room in bed and watches tv and drinks way too much alcohol. She is definitely not adventurous, and when she’s drunk she is the most sloppy and infuriating drunk. Other than that, she has a good heart and does the best for people. She and I used to be best friends but we grew apart when I moved out and her drinking episodes drew a wedge between everything.

She sprang it on us last minute that she wanted to come back with us. Initially I was shocked and didn’t know what to say - of course I want my mom to visit, but it was the worst time ever for my s/o and I. I said of course initially, then tried to backpeddle the next day and tell her that we had plans that popped up to go somewhere for the new year. She immediately got upset, quiet and tried not to cry. 

So then I got really upset that I hurt my mom’s feelings, and said that we weren’t going to go anymore. I really did not think she would brave the drive with us but she did and she’s here now - and talking about staying for two weeks already.

My s/o is incredibly stressed as it is. She has a few things coming up in the next week and wanted to spend some time with the baby and me before January when shit starts to hit the fan.
I don’t think this is the best time for my mom and my S/O to get to know each other - my S/O right now is incredibly stressed, crabby, and taking it out on me.. meanwhile my mom is being passive aggressive already and asking where the wine is.

How can I kindly ask my mom to shorten the trip without her becoming offended? I thought about asking her if she wants to visit her best friend that lives a few hours away that she hasn’t seen in awhile...",26Dec2020,1

538,"am i being a total asshole or is my friend overwhelming? my friend was casually seeing this guy and it didn’t work out but is it bad that i’m tired of hearing about it? it’s been a month and last night she sent me over 40 (literally) separate imessages within a few mins. she also called me at 1am, messaged me on fb, etc. i just need to be alone sometimes, i’m sorry. 

another thing i find a bit of a red flag is that i never meet any close friends through her. she gets really really close to all my friends but at the beginning will always talk shit about them. for example, our friend she’s really close w now she called her “boring” at first. 

yesterday it was christmas and she kept spam texting me if i was alive but i said in our other group chat that my sleep schedule was messed up and i had been sleeping. i had also mostly been off my phone for the rest of the day and she kept jokingly saying “hello want to be friends again” etc. 

over all, i just find her overwhelming as a person. she’s extroverted and cannot be alone for even a short period of time. she constantly needs to be on the phone w a friend or smt. i just want space. my brother overdosed a few days ago and as an introvert, i don’t really want to talk about it with my friends. i’ve already expressed i don’t like ppl asking me if i’m ok if i don’t answer.",26Dec2020,1

543,"I am wondering if there is anyone who realised that they were around not-very-good friends before. Because I'm kind of reevaluating my whole life right now and seeing that. My closest friend (who is someone we have been friends from highschool) is someone who always made fun of me (not just an N thing yet) but she gets joy from it. It started as jokes wbut then I notice how she gets, she shows a sense of pride and content/ pleasure/happiness when such things happen and I feel lesser and she feels more (I'm bad at writing or explaining it). 

She also brags about being two faced a lot (which I realised is common among Ns) and she was telling me this as she was telling me what happened when she and her mom met to talk about me recently and she was obviously not telling me the whole truth about it (yeah weird and I wasn't aware of it till she told me afterwards) yesterday). I met her yesterday and made a while list afterwards (along with a whole lot of other things that have happened such as her meeting my parents to talk about me and not tell me honestly what happened- I hear two different sides from both and I feel kinda sad that they're talking behind my back and not telling me) and I realised all this. Is she an N? It seems like to me ;_;

When we hang out in a group, her actions are not very obvious and the effects don't last but in 1 - to -1 interactions, it is very obvious and pretty very dang uncomfortable to be around. She also keeps trying to make me feel bad about not having a boyfriend right now (I was dating on and off but I didn't tell her as it is not serious and she is the kind who takes it too seriously like impose her views on getting married and planning trips and etc) and she knows how upset I get when she compares and she loves to brag how she has an amazing bf all the time I just wonder if I should question it and see how she reacts now to test if she is an N. Yesterday, she said ""you should get a boyfriend so that you don't have to spend your holidays alone"" and I was just silent for a while then switched topics. Like it was a direct jab saying she didn't want to meet but she was the one who initiated it anyway ;_; I am trying not to be avoidant and change the topic when something uncomfortable like this happens but because I didn't want to fire back and make her feel bad but I don't want to be like this anymore. Also, these kind of things seem like projection to me

Anyway I'm also kinda sad because she and my other 2 friends met today and didn't invite me even though we talked about this in the group chat a couple of weeks ago so I wasn't so sure who planned this, till yesterday. When I met her yesterday, she told me that they are planning to go somewhere today and asked if I would like to come and I asked why wasn't I invited or this mentioned in the chat and she said she organised it thinking I don't talk to the other two anymore (lol, she slipped up here, i guess she talked to them too and decided to meet them without me) so I said sure I would love to go and she said she would message but she never did, and I saw my friend post pictures of it on instagram. And I feel like this is not just a classic old she doesn't like me, because she does pretend to in front of me. I feel like just cutting her out, but this is messy because of the other 2, wonder what she would tell them and also her relationship with my mom, which I am trying to ignore now. This just got me thinking, I never had any real genuine nice friends in real life because when someone was nice to me, I just messed it up by ignoring them (because I didn't know how to respond to it)

544,"We’ve been in a pretty serious relationship for about two years. We spend SO much time together, and he always treated me like a QUEEN. 

Recently he started college (MILES away from me), and I feel like things are changing. When we first started dating he put in so much effort, and he set the standard of not liking others girls photos or following/ talking to other girls. 

I saw on his phone that he’d followed only ONE girl from his new class (blonde, big boobs) that he’s never spoken to.  I asked him if he was attracted to her and he said no. I asked him why out of everybody in the class he’s only followed her, and he said a friend sent her profile to him so he looked. It doesn’t seem like a big deal, but I know he isn’t the type to follow every hot girl he sees, so it feels like there’s a reason when he only follows a certain few here and there. 

I snooped on his phone once after this, and saw texts between him and a friend. He’d bought up another girl from his college, saying he “wishes he could add her socials” and she’s “so leng”. Its the way he’s bought it up that doesn’t sit right with me. I’m not expecting him to only find me good-looking, but I know that he hasn’t added her because I would have asked him about it (we tend to look at his phone together) or he thinks she wouldn’t add him back (she’s older). That makes me wonder what he’d do if I wouldn’t find out. She’s also a girl he mutually parties with pretty regularly. 

There are plenty of boys I think are hot, but I’m not attracted to them because I’m very committed and happy in the relationship. I never think about sleeping with other people. Is it normal for him to talking to his friends like this? Is he attracted to these other girls? Should I be worried about him being at college with them?

We’ve always had a really open sex life, so it hurts when he’ll happily tell me he’s only attracted to me and then does things like this behind my back. He also lies to me pretty regularly about porn. I have no problem with porn, but I don’t like him watching cam girls. I’ve told him this before, and he still goes on those sites to this day. 

I feel like he’s either always been attracted to other girls, and now he’s comfortable in the relationship he’s not so bothered about hiding it. Or he’s becoming more sexually attracted to other girls now that he’s at college and meeting new people? It’s just making me paranoid that his behaviour has changed now he’s living miles away. Any advice?!!!",26Dec2020,1
545,"TLDR at the bottom, it's a bit long. 

It's a long story as to why I'm (f27) in therapy, but the short reason in that I spend many years being bullied and abused by my mother (dad worked odd hours and away from home, in addition to my mother manipulating things, so he didn't know until I was almost 24), and I've been through some sexual assaults and other shit in my life. We suspect that my Anxiety and Depression was primarily caused by the child abuse.

Anyway, for years I've been trying to get in to see someone for my mental health because I knew I needed it. In the past I was suicidal and the last time I had a thought/was thinking about ending it was 3ish years ago. Needless to say I haven't had a serious thought like that since then and even thoughts related to suicide idolization have reduced. The thing was that before that I had been asking my doctor if I could get a referral to someone for mental health. In our area of the province, there's a 2+ year wait list just to see someone. Like the services are in such high demand that therapists can blacklist you if you miss one appointment sort of deal. It's crazy, especially in an area with a mental health crisis. 

Anyway, my normal former family doctor (who started to suck in around me becoming an adult, he was my mother's doctor while she was pregnant with me) told me I was on a wait list in 2017. He knew I couldn't afford $200+ an hour but said he may be able to get me into a program where I'd be covered.  Cool, our healthcare system sucks in this part of the province but ok. 

2+ years pass (it's then 2019) and I'm really starting to struggle. I'm considering coming off my meds due to a cost issue, more so since I'm no longer in school. I ask my doctor where I am on the wait list band am I getting close to seeing someone yet and he admits that oops.... He never put me on the wait list. I flip out, I wasted 2 years waiting for something that I wasn't even on a list for (I later would learn this wasn't the first time it would happen) and he simply hadn't put me on the wait list. He didn't indicate if he had it written down or not but he quickly scrambled and told me that a mental health clinic just opened in the office next door and he can get me in ASAP, he'll even send the referral that day. I calm a bit and say sure. 

Between 1-2 weeks later (I had to keep calling because despite their secretaries being maybe 2-3 feet apart at most, it wasn't getting from his secretary to the Social worker's) I get in to see... Let's call him ""Jerry"". Jerry's cool and helps me out a lot. Sadly I can only see him for 8-10 appointments before our time ends due to policy. I still need more help so he sends a referral to another mental health clinic, one that's longer term and I get to speak with... ""Samantha"". Samantha is FUCKING AWESOME. She tries to establish goals for me to reach based on what I want to acheive with my therapy. At the end of each session, she gives me 5-8 activities to do between our sessions, things to help keep my spirits high and to keep me in some form of routine. Usually it's activities no enjoy like editing videos, doing art, some adult task that I need to do etc. 

I last saw Samantha almost a year ago in January. I was finishing up a work program and we agreed to meet again in March when my work term ended. We planned to work a bit more to further control my anger, and to get over my fear of my mother. A development happened that kind of rocked my world but idk if I can trust the source on it. In Febuary however 2 weeks before the lockdown, I got a call from her office cancelling my appointment because bshe just went off on mat leave. Fair enough we anticipated she may have her baby in around then. I was told that I'd be reassigned to another Social care worker soon but before my case is closed and I'd get a call letting me know. Ok fine. 

After ALMOST 4 MONTHS of waiting, calling and asking what was going on (cases are closed after 6 months of us not seeing a therapist/social worker) I FINIALLY call central dispatch for mental health bservices and ask what's going on. They get back to me and agree that the ball was dropped -actually wasn't C-19 related, they admitted that the offices down here are notorious for messing things up and dragging their feet- so they reassigned me to....Kelly. 

Now here's where I need advice. I don't feel like I'm making progress with Kelly, if anything I'm stalling or starting to slip backwards. She tends to ask about unrelated things, how my family is doing, what about the woman I'm ""involved with"" (despite me correcting her multiple times and reminding her that I'm not dating the woman I like, it's more like a crush/I have feelings), among other things. She spends a goot quarter bro held of our time rehashing the last session or leaves things out. I've been clear about my goals and what I hope to accomplish through therapy and she says we can work on those goals, but we never do. 

Instead she keeps suggesting meditation -which I suck at and hasn't helped, but I've been trying since I've met Jerry- and motivational stuff on mental health and relationships. Since appointments are done over the phone (I don't feel that Zoom is safe or secure and they for some reason don't want to use Skype but w/e) I can understand some interference or appointments bro not start exactly at appointment time, but on multiple occasions she's very late to start the appointment, often calling 15-30 minutes late and on one ocassion almost an hour and a half late and admitting that she forgot all about me. Only 3 times has she called early or on time. And we've had 7 or 8 sessions by now since July. 

What's finially pushed me over the edge was the last appointment. The call dropped out several times -leading me to call her back- and she admitted that internet calling sucks especially when she's hitting dead zones. She sounded like she was either driving or on a train and at one point I swear I head someone having a conversation in the background. Ok I get you have things to do but with 4 call drops and what sounded like other people in the background while she's calling me by name? Idk man. My appointments last about 45-60 minutes... Due to all the call drops and communication issue I asked if we could continue on another day... I spent about 20 minutes actually talking to her and the rest of the time trying to re-establish connection or waiting for her to call me back (she had to hang up 7 minutes into our call and took 12 minutes to call me back). Whatever. 

The main issue was this: after my mother walked out on us in 2016, I went Extremely low contact with her and later went full on no contact and utterly cut her out of my life and by extension her side of the family. There's a lot of drama there, trust me. Since then, my mental health is improving slowly, I'm regaining confidence and some self esteem. I'm slowly feeling happier and me, dad and my brother are arguing/fighting less. The divorce is taking it's sweet ass time thanks to my mother, but we're moving forwards bit by bit. In our last session last week, Kelly started suggesting that I re-establish a connection bwith my mother again despite the abuse. She's trying to convince me that cutting my mother out of my life like I have will only be detrimental to me. I admitted that I feel cheated by my mother because I should ba able to turn to her, to feel a mother's love, to have a loving relationship, but all I feel towards her is a string anger, pure fear, utter pain and a sense of emptiness. I don't feel safe around her. I want to get over these issues So no longer flee with my proverbial tail between my legs every time I see her in public. Kelly knows this but is trying bro push me towards re-establishing contact, saying ""she's your mother"" and that I'll suffer more if I don't. 

Later that night -despite a nice dinner out with my family- I had a break down that lasted the rest of weekend. Maybe she said it because of the holidays, maybe she's saying it because she knows I feel vunerable due to my diagnosis (had surgery back in October and they basically found pre-cancererous (or technically ""pre pre-cancer"" according to my new family doctor) cells in my reproductive system, so there's a partial hysterectomy coming in the springish) especially since I'm under 30. Idk why but after saying I may have a form of PTSD (where my mother is a bit if a trigger), I don't get why she'd tell me I should re-establish contact with my mother. 

So what should I do reddit? Do I just keep reminding Kelly that I'm not re-establishing connection with my mother or do I just explain the situation to central and see if I can get back with Samantha after she returns/get a new therapist at the risk of waiting another 2+ years?

Tl;Dr spent years seeking mental health help from child abuse trauma and got it last year. Got a good therapist but she went off on mat leave just before the lockdown. New therapist isn't exactly professional and last week tried convincing me to re-establish contact with my abuser saying that it will be detrimental to me if I completely cut her out of my life like I have. Should I shut her down every time she brings it up or should I ask to go back to the good therapist when she returns/wait 2+ years for another therapist if I can't?",26Dec2020,1
546,"As the titles pretty much sums it up. Even though things seem to get to harder and harder, especially with the type of year 2020 has been, I can’t seem to just pull the trigger.  To make the changes. It’s easy when I was working full time and had the money to make payments and to have extra on the side to hire a personal trainer. 

Once COVID reached the household, my little bubble popped.  Lost work, lost insurance. Had to put bills in deferment. And the irony of it all, my wife and I never caught it, and we took care of everyone else in the house.  At the same time, I’ve learned to be by myself and value it.  That’s probably the only upside when you’re forced to stay in. 

I’m a nurse that works home care.  But the work isn’t fulfilling anymore.  I like being busy.  Idk if it’s more of a distraction thing.  But I hate being idle, especially at work.  I actually enjoy a stressful environment that, in the moment, seems overwhelming.  But there’s that rush that comes with accomplishing the work in front of me.  This is probably why I procrastinate like hell.  Ever since middle school, as far as I remember, I have been this way.  (I’m 31 now.). 

I’ve thought about a career change.  Thought about deleting all of social media.  I’ve thought of being more healthy. I’m actually back at my starting weight that I was 2 years ago, that’s up 26 lbs after my fluctuating fitness journey. (I’m 284 lbs AGAIN) 😩

I know. Life gets in the way. My wife has told me I’m too hard in myself.  But my question is, how... HOW do you get out of your comfort zone?  I know the first step is always the hardest. But why is it so hard that I want to take it, but my fears just freeze me up???",26Dec2020,1

*So 5 years ago, I was a dumb child playing an MMO, didn't really have any friends. Until I did.*

*Their nickname was Kay, and I had a really nice chat with them 'n whatnot, became friends. They introduced me to their other friends, and we all took part in a big roleplay with a story 'n whatnot yadda yadda. It influenced me a lot and basically was the only thing I did every day.* 

*I don't remember how it happened, but one day I just sorta grew up, and got left behind. And for years I regretted everything, regrets and laments swirling in my head nonstop, and the story just stuck with me in particular. Over time the details got fuzzy and it warped and twisted as I grew up, and I made my own story loosely based upon it.*

*Yet a lot of the details remain lost, and I want to remember. I last tried to contact any of them in 2016-2017, but couldn't find anything and gave up.* 

*Ok I'ma just skip to the point,* I found the discord, twitter, and more of one of my original friends from that roleplay, and I want to reconnect with them. But I don't want to say anything I'll regret or for it to go wrong in any way, and I am completely different since the last time we spoke, and they probably have changed too, so what to say? *Sorry for long context.*",26Dec2020,1

550,"*So I'm 30 and have been through the toughest year of my life and for complicated reasons it has been important to meet up
and converse with my twin brother,
to build trust.

We're not close, yet he has told me I'm the most important person in his life.

 Anyways, we met up in September and spent the day together and everything went great. We talked about the topics I wanted to, to hear where he's coming from and it was beneficial.

I also suggested that we meet up again and he agreed. All was great between us.

A few things since then happened to have things be quite rocky between us; he visited a family get together in October, and I asked him to talk and he and i drove around in his car and talked about anything on my heart for 30 minutes...

i had other things to address yet he was pushing me to leave because he apparently had work to do, I was crying and I felt he was being insensitive and then I refused to get out of the car when he asked me to leave...

I was crying and he was pressuring me and it was intense...
after a few minutes I did get out of the car and he told me that he would text me about a day that works to meetup, but he never did.

i texted him politely for a few days then gave up, one month went by and he never responded.

Per my request, my parents arranged a group meeting with us and my brother in late November that ended poorly, as I felt they were all against me... I was getting very loud and defensive, as this is a very painful topic for me and my brother wasn't taking my side...
and it ended with me I standing front of my brothers car as he tried to leave early.

So our two interactions since the amazing day in September ended with conflict in October and November.

There was no contact since late november until today on christmas, where he refused to answer some questions I had when I was calm and asked politely... he refused because it's christmas and he doesn't want these conversations today.

I walked away and cried for 30 minutes, then asked him again this time clearly sad and hurt and he still refused..
I then asked him if we could talk on the phone sometime this weekend and he said ""idk, text me""

yet last time he said that he never followed up, and that's probably because we had huge conflict and i wouldn't get out of his car...

this time I was civil and let him leave without getting in his way.

I was crying my eyes out and he wouldn't listen to me or show sensitivity.
We are twins and INFP's...

I can't help but feel all this behavior is extremely wrong.

552,"My friend and I went to the same very small high school and have been rather close for the past 6 years. Since our high school was small, we never rlly had the opportunity to branch out. This year we both started at our rather large state school, except I went online and she went in person due to personal preferences based on the pandemic. She went through a breakup a couple months back and ultimately I felt used as a crutch— she’d call me all the time at like 3am hysterically which is like fine but it began to feel emotionally draining to me. 

Luckily when she went to college she became busier so the constant calling turned into weekly calling and slowly dwindled down. She became a very heavy partier and was constantly going out regardless of the pandemic. We’re both premed students, so we take the same classes and because of her lifestyle, she’d always ask me for answers and notes. The SINGLE time I asked for help (not even answers or notes), she did not help at all. I felt used, so I distanced myself. 

She started failing classes and at the same time, constantly called me telling me that her aunt was in the hospital, her friend got hit by a car, she got sexually assaulted, and a ton more. Obviously I felt empathy and talked to her about her issues. She asked me why I distanced myself from the friendship, and I decided to tell her that I felt that she only texted me for my answers. She then proceeded to yell at me and called me a few days later saying that “she’s ready for me to patch things up if I want to apologize”. 

I felt like I should also receive some sort of an apology, so I just never reached back out to her after that “invitation”. It’s been a month since then and I’m thinking about texting her again, just to clear the air since we both go to the same college. I’m not sure if it’s worth it, though :( 

TLDR; my friend of 6 years and I go to the same college, she started partying a lot and used me for answers/notes for classes, I felt that she took advantage of me so i distanced myself from her, she dropped a bunch of random emotional baggage at me randomly so I felt guilted to help her, she never apologized so I distanced myself again and never reached out to her after that.

561,"This is my first ever post so I apologize for the mistakes and the length. I’ll give a little back story first.

In the country I live in, we’re heading into lockdown again tomorrow after a surge in case numbers.
I (F18) live with my parents (Mom) and (Dad), my moms sister and her family live on the other side of the country, in a different state/county. With the new lockdown rules, it prohibits non essential travel outside your own state/county, So my aunt coming to even visit is a breach of the rules.

My parents presumed I would give up my room for the nice for my aunt and uncle (which I always do) but I am completely uncomfortable with this. I have always been extremely conscious of the virus and constantly take extra precautions. Even them visiting makes me uneasy, let alone staying over night. I voiced this to my parents, how I was extremely uncomfortable with them coming and would prefer if they didn’t visit at all. Obviously that got shot down, so I proposed they would ask my older brother to give up his room.

At this point both my parents lost it and began arguing between them, called me all the names under the sun and told me to find somewhere else to live now I’m 18. They told me that they’re staying in my room and that’s final. I obviously retaliated and lost it, I screamed at them about how it was so selfish to break the lockdown rules and putting everyone at risk. My dad then brought up how I am a ‘hypocrite’ as two weeks ago I stayed at a friends house and broke the rules then. (Probably my biggest regret in life). The reason I stayed at my friends was because that morning my mom had disowned me, I was upset and lost and needed to leave. I read up how travel restrictions do not apply domestic abuse victims when in need (I previously had opened up a child abuse case with my dad, which is closed now, as of 2 weeks ago. 

I lost it even more and continued to scream and cry because they were forcing me to partake in breaking the rules and endangering the people around me. I refused again and left to go to my room. My dad then told me that if that’s how I want to play it then fine, I could stay in my room and not leave for the whole duration of the time they’re here, meaning I wouldn’t get to see my cousins. I realized this was the most I was going to get and accepted it. 

5 minutes later he came back upstairs and recanted, because he didn’t think I would actually agree. He told me I could stay at my grandparents for 3 days, i initially said no but then decided to see what would happen if I said yes. I told him I would stay with his parents (who are very high risk) for 3 days, I told him that I still had my cold too.I have no intention of staying with my grandparents as I don’t want to put them in any risk.

565,"When I was in school I was always a rebel of everything, cringe activities, teachers, education etc. I have had an average score throughout the academics, I was pretty famous in my school for my humour everybody wants to seat next to me not because I was an extraordinary person but I was entertainment for them. I started understanding the world and human psychology.
 Then after 11th, I started living isolated. And when I was in college I had no friends not even single friend. I was depressed, I would cry, I was always sad. I didn't know why. I would go to the theatre, a long drive, staying up till 5 am every day, junk food I was ruined. But I was independent, strong and fearless. Then something horrible happened in my life. I was 19yo, one day I was watching a movie, I was going to drink water I was feeling dizzy and I sat down I was unconscious and my cousin was with me then I went to hospital did CT scan and after sometimes this same happened it was Stroke I went to coma. I woke world was different I couldn't speak, write or read. I am 23yo I am still recovering from Stroke. But I am not same I was.
I had big dreams like being tony stark, then entrepreneur, then music artist, having a great job. The more I grow up the less energy I have to accomplish something. Not because I can't achieve something but it is because I am average. 
Now today I regret not having any talent, wealth, IQ. I want to do something great. But I still can't figure out I want, like. I like philosophy, music, stock market but I am nothing. Now I know I will never be wealthy, being called a genius, intellectual. No girl would date me.  I know I will never be an extraordinary person. I don't know how to be happy. I am weak I can't drive. Now I am fragile. I know I won't live a long life. That's how now my mediocre life is. I don't know why I writing this. The only thing I have know is loneliness.

567,"this is just a rant and just... idek just wanted to put it out there instead of it being stuck in my head.

I hope at least one person gets to read this long ass shit.

I've been wanting to get a tattoo since I was 16. planned it, changed the design multiple times, where I'm gonna put it, even told my mom about it which she was a 100% behind as long as I'm 18. I live with my mom btw and my dad's in the US working but he comes home every year and stays long. I don't have a good relationship with him, he thinks we do though. I'm 18 and he still treats me like a kid, whenever I'm quiet and being my teenagery self a few years back, he'll get frustrated and say that he misses when I was a kid and I was talkative. Whenever I state my own opinion or my side on topics like politics or whatever, he feels like I'm disrespecting him just because I didn't side with him. He thinks I'm not capable of serious discussions which I fucking am, he just doesn't really know me because I always only show him my fake happy self, always saying yes, always conforming to what he wants etc... but now I'm about to get a tattoo in 2 days and well shit.

I told him just a couple of hours ago... and I guess I'm the one in the wrong for that, should've told him sooner. I just kinda thought that I'm brave enough to tell him that I'm already about to get it and thought he wouldn't try to oppose to it. turns out that's fucking wrong. He said I was too young, that I was impulsive (and of course he'd think that cuz he never took me seriously bc he still thinks of me as a child), he said I should wait til I'm 21, people will think ill of me or will think my parents just let me do whatever. said he wasn't opposed to ""art"" but I'm just too young. 

Now this rant isn't really about the tattoo, it's about my relationship with my dad.

I have two choices: 
a.) Be disappointed with myself 
because not getting it basically proves that I'm still bound to my dad, that I'm still letting him make decisions for me, that I'm a fucking adult with my own mind but I still let his opinions pressure me which is toxic cause I dont want to be stuck here forever.

b.) Feel guilty and disappointment but with a sense of accomplisment
Feel guilty bc once he finds out that I got it(since I can't fucking lie to save myself), I'd have to tell him why I still did it, finally tell him that I'm a matured person and that he should learn accept that I'm growing up with my own mind, own opinions and decisions that may have consequences that I'm willing to face on my own. And then he'll be distant like what he did when my older brother finally confronted him. Then he'll be sad again bc he has problems and his relationship with his kids is not fucking good and then I'll feel fucking guilty for it and disappointed for being a fucking disappointment to my dad.
But then there's the sense of accomplishment, feeling liberated and one step further to finally letting myself free, letting myself be ME instead of pretending to be someone other people want me to be and conforming to their expectations of me.

But is the feeling of liberation and finding my sense of self really more than my relationship with my own father??

He was going to stay in my room, which I was totally fine with as it was only one night. I had to sleep with my mom in the same bed which I hate because I want to sleep alone. But it was just one night. 

He’s still here. This is the third night. He has shown no signs of any intention to leave. Nobody know when he’s leaving. He’s still in my room. 

Now I don’t have any problem with my uncle. It’s NOTHING to do with him personally. 

But I am an introvert. I really need a space thats MINE. Where I can rest and not be social. I don’t have that anymore. I sleep with my mom and my uncle sleeps in my room. Though we don’t always do stuff together, we’re still all always in the same space. I don’t like it, I’m socially exhausted, I just need some time in my own space which I don’t have anymore. 

When I asked my mom when he’s leaving, she said she doesn’t know, and ”You’ll be fine” in a sort of stop-complaining-and-don’t-be-rude -tone. 

I really don’t know what to do. I just want my room back. I don’t care if he leaves or stays, I would like to suggest he move into another room, but mom said he can’t think he’s a burden.

582,"ok so to start my sister and i are very close and i’ve never talked to any guy she liked or dated before. i dated this guy and i didn’t like him that much and at first i was playing games before i started dating him i was flirting with his bestfriend which my sister randomly decided she liked even tho i was flirting w him i said whatever and we all hungout both boys are my age and my sister is almost 2 years younger, my ex boyfriends bestfriend ended up not liking her back and she got super sour obviously when i was dating the guy his bestfriend would be around all the time i ended up breaking up with the guy and me and his bestfriend still talk all the time i made a joke saying i’d hookup with him and she snooped through my phone to read our conversations which pissed me off and which i didn’t think would make my sister mad because she’s said “i never liked him anyways” “you should go for him” then her story will quickly switch saying she liked him and it’s messed up i still talk to him and she compares it to her talking to a guy ive talked too and frankly i don’t rlly care if she did and it’s different because i knew him before she decided she liked him and he was my ex’s’ best-friend and she switches her story constantly saying she never liked him and blah blah. i don’t think she should be so crazy about this since she’s talked to all her girl-friends ex’s and i don’t even have messed up means when talking to this guy if anything she’s weird for being so obsessed about my ex boyfriends best-friend she won’t give me a straight story on how she feels and constantly switches up and i don’t feel like cutting ties with this guy because his mom likes me and we’re good friends (before my sister even decided she liked him) not to mention it wasn’t a long thing we hung out once and she got rejected it’s not like they talked for a long time or had any sort of relationship or did anything at all",26Dec2020,1
583,"so about a month ago i made a post on reddit about what's been depressing me lately. then a guy sent a message to me to help me and become my friend. we talked a lot about each others problems on that day. at first he told me he would never consider flirting with me so i can be comfortable with him. but then at the same day, he had to talk about his love life because it's been depressing him. so he kindly told me his last relationship ended because of sexual stuff. then few minutes later he started asking me some questions like what turns me on a lot and kept asking till i answer. and i actually told him??????!!!!!! i was really depressed so i couldn't really think straight when that happened. because of that i kept talking with him after this, like nothing happened.

i know it sounds naive but he's been really helping me showing emotional support while he also tells me he fell in love with me, wants a relationship with me and also wants me in sexual way. and whenever i told him that i'm not emotionally available and not looking for a relationship or a hookup, he told me he can wait till i feel ready. at some days we did sexting stuff -i know i'm an idiot, i accepted it bc i was feeling comfortable around him, everybody's been treating me like shit and he was the only person who was being kind with me- and at some days he was telling me some stuff randomly, like he wants me so bad and how i turn him on. i told him that it makes me uncomfortable and he said he'll stop doing this and he actually stopped. but i didn't stop talking with him for some reason. it's like i'm ok with his weird behavior just because he's also kind to me, because everyone around me has been treating me so badly. i know it's not smart but i'm
not in a good mental state.

anyway this situation is making me really uncomfortable. i mean i didn't realize what's been going on till now, i feel so stupid. also i'm really confused because he seem like a very kind and friendly person, he helps me a lot but also when i think of these stuff i end up realizing he was just taking advantage of me. idk if it was smartest thing to do, but i talked about this to him today and he told me he doesn't want me in only sexual way or isn't trying to take advantage of me because sexting isn't even satisfying enough for him and he thinks everything is mutual. i mean wtf? 

what should i do at this point? should i stop talking to him?",26Dec2020,1

585,"I’m 28 (F) and my sister is 24 (F). I moved home about two months ago because I was suddenly laid off due to covid. Part of my compensation package included housing so when I lost my job I also lost my ability to live on my own. My parents (specifically mother) are very toxic and I haven’t lived at home full time since high school &amp; college summers. Growing up my sister and I shared our current room and didn’t have many problems. We don’t fight often it’s more or less we’re just coexisting in a shared space. We have different interests and schedules. My sister is working full time out of our bedroom leaving me with not being able to spend time in my room during working hours. 
I have lived fully on my own for 5 years and since moving back I have been struggling since I enjoy personal space and I am used to not sharing my space. I spoke to my parents about us each having our own rooms and they’ve said no. There are 3 rooms in our house not being used as bedrooms (two are offices and one is a kids game room we no longer use). When asked if we could switch rooms my mother responded saying that our shared room is larger than theirs and if my parents can share a room so can we. I’m frustrated because we have the space, they’re just too stubborn to let us have it. I am planning to move out as soon as I find a job but I would stay here longer if I had my own room.

587,"A few months ago me boyfriend (M19) was messing around with me (F18) and he did something that reminded me of being molested as a kid. usually i’d never think about being molested and it never really affected me anymore so i wasn’t sure how to deal with it. 

anyways after he did that i lost interest in having sex with him because it would make me feel really uncomfortable and remind me of what happened when i was a kid. i have expressed this to him like 3 different times, each balling my eyes out. i asked him to not touch me sexually anymore and told him when i was ready to have sex again i would let him know. i also expressed to him that sometimes i just feel like i can’t say no to him when he tries to touch me, even if i don’t want him to. 

so after i said this to him the second time he tried for a little bit to not touch me, he would accidentally do it because he said it was a habit and then say sorry. then he would ask me if it was okay if he did stuff to me, even after i told him sometimes i feel like i can’t say no. i would say “i guess” because felt like i couldn’t say no, and i wasn’t saying yes so i thought he would take the hint. he still would touch me after i was making it clear through body language i didn’t want that, but i guess he couldn’t take the hint. 

however sometimes i would give him mixed signals and i wouldn’t communicate properly with him when i wanted to have sex and when i didn’t. i would sometimes come on to him and we would have sex, then if the next day i didn’t want to have sex i would just kind of expect him to know that. which i know wasn’t the correct way to handle it. 

anyways it just really bothers me that i had to say it twice for him to even change a little bit. he stopped trying not to touch me after like a week and just totally disregards my feeling about it. he makes me feel dirty and taken advantage of and i really don’t like it. i just need some advise on wether to stay with him and just what you guys think please 🖤",26Dec2020,1

593,"No matter what stage of life I find myself in, I always seem to harbor a crippling attraction to some girl around me. I understand how irrational it is to feel like I'm in love with someone I've hardly or never spoken to. The only thing I know about them is how attractive they are. Though I don't consider them to be above me.

The earliest I can recall this happening was in elementary school. However, it wasn't until middle school when it started to affect me academically. In one case, I've lingered on one girl for four years, despite her only being around for two. Even now, I still haven't forgotten them and physically cringe when I remember (vividly) my interactions with her. My mind becomes so wrapped around the thought of a relationship with them that it becomes difficult to think about anything else.

After finishing high school, I attended a well known university but due to a mix limerence for one girl in my tutoring group, being unprepared academically and therefore slowing her down which made me feel worse, having to commute to campus, and being able to afford the university, I dropped out after the first semester (with debt).

It doesn't help that while not officially diagnosed, I feel that it's obvious that I have a serious social anxiety disorder. To the point where I can't eat in front of people that I find attractive (lunch time in school was hard). Even when I want to approach someone, my body just refuses to go along despite my mind screaming at myself to do it. In most cases, it feels like I'm programmed to not approach them. And I can't think of anyone to actually talk to them besides general greetings. The few times where I have managed to approach them ended in complete failure.

The only time I've been able to rid myself of this is when I turned off (or at least buried) in form of emotion I could have. For a week I was just on a numb autopilot. However, this hurts the family that is close to me and causes more worry.

It seems like it will be better to be alone for a few more years until I'm more financially stable. Hurts to think about but I think it's the better choice. I just can't accept that while still having these feelings.

**A bit about myself below, in case it's needed.**

I'm naturally quiet and introverted with a rather unintentionally serious expression. So I've noticed that a lot of people are generally cautious and occasionally afraid (though that could be mind messing with me). Sometimes it feels like there is a monster on my shoulder that only I can't see. I often wonder where my brother gets that ""spark"" that just brings people towards him with only a greeting.

My main hobbies revolve around story writing and worldbuilding and I find it difficult to talk about it with people I've only just met.

For friends I've made in the past, I always inadvertently gained a reputation as some wise person who is always calm in any situation. However, that's just on the outside because panicking is embarrassing. There are still many in my family who think of me as a genius (I'm not) so if I were to reveal any truth of myself, it would completely reshape everything they know about me.

I work in a pretty bad retail job to take care of myself. Double minimum wage, but far from enough to live on my own. Not many friends outside of my brother and a really nice (platonic) friend I met on reddit recently. I don't feel a need for more friends, just one person to be affectionate with.

Touch-starved (in a romantic or affectionate sense) and hugging a family member does nothing to help this.

I'm starting at a much more affordable college in January and hope to find internships, but I'm worried about my irrational attraction to people getting in the way again. I've tried many times to just avoid thinking about them, but it just comes to a complete stop if they even happen to glance at me and I just melt.

I've recently come to understand after reading through many reddit most and online advice, that trying to form a relationship with co-workers, employees elsewhere, or people just going about there day (like shopping) is generally frowned upon with rare exceptions I suppose.

Another note, my hygiene is good (a traumatic middle school experience made sure of that). I'm pretty skinny but not dangerously so. This post was longer than I thought it was going to be...

tl;dr: I get too attracted to girls to the point where I can't think straight and mess up everything. I just want to stop these feelings.",26Dec2020,1
594,"So I'm mid 20s single guy and never moved away from my hometown. I'm an only child, my mother raised me, both my dad and stepdad abused her, she divorced them both long ago, but that's what I grew up in. I've gotten a job as a teacher, make pretty decent money with this low cost of living. It's a mid-sized city, but mostly Republican and I'm pretty far left politically. In other words, lots of people around here have a very different worldview and different set of values than I do. It's fine here, but if I could choose to have been from somewhere else, I probably would. 

But I would never choose another mother. She put up with my shit, she sacrificed all kind of shit financially so that I could have everything I wanted within reason. She intervened and took the aggro when dad/stepdad were awful to me as a child. I was not always the best son, I argued with her all of the time and could be just absolutely cruel with the shit I said. I can be quick and harsh with criticism. I'm her absolute world. Her identity in large part is just loving me and being a proud mom. She has her sister here, but is not married or in a relationship. After our family unit was broken, it's now 4 of us between her my cousin and my aunt. I know it would hurt her terribly if I moved away. She would never try to stop/manipulate/guilt me, hell she'd even encourage it if it's what I wanted. But I know it would crush her. I moved out into my own apartment a couple months ago, just down the street and it's been a little hard on her.

I have very wealthy uncles. One in this tropical paradise, the other in California. California said if I moved out there, even if I fell on hard times, he ""wouldn't let me fail"". Tropical Uncle has a huge house, said I could move down there and have half the house to myself, he could even set me up teaching with connections to their school system. I love both my uncles dearly.

But here I am in my little bubble, with my mother/aunt/cousin near, teaching in the same school system I grew up in. I just feel like this tremendous opportunity that people would literally kill for, is just wasted on me and I'm an ungrateful shit for not accepting this amazing path opened and paved for me. I just can't imagine taking away her happiness. Her happiness is her responsibility, I know, but after all she did for me and just being as close to perfect as a mother as one can imagine, how could I do that to her? I think about the Hobbit when adventure lands in his lap and he has no intention of going, but does and has legendary adventures.?

596,"So I'm 30 and have been through the toughest year of my life and for complicated reasons it has been important to meet up
and converse with my twin brother,
to build trust.

We're not close, yet he has told me I'm the most important person in his life.

 Anyways, we met up in September and spent the day together and everything went great. We talked about the topics I wanted to, to hear where he's coming from and it was beneficial.

I also suggested that we meet up again and he agreed. All was great between us.

A few things since then happened to have things be quite rocky between us; he visited a family get together in October, and I asked him to talk and he and i drove around in his car and talked about anything on my heart for 30 minutes...

i had other things to address yet he was pushing me to leave because he apparently had work to do, I was crying and I felt he was being insensitive and then I refused to get out of the car when he asked me to leave...

I was crying and he was pressuring me and it was intense...
after a few minutes I did get out of the car and he told me that he would text me about a day that works to meetup, but he never did.

i texted him politely for a few days then gave up, one month went by and he never responded.

Per my request, my parents arranged a group meeting with us and my brother in late November that ended poorly, as I felt they were all against me... I was getting very loud and defensive, as this is a very painful topic for me and my brother wasn't taking my side...
and it ended with me I standing front of my brothers car as he tried to leave early.

So our two interactions since the amazing day in September ended with conflict in October and November.

There was no contact since late november until today on christmas, where he refused to answer some questions I had when I was calm and asked politely... he refused because it's christmas and he doesn't want these conversations today.

I walked away and cried for 30 minutes, then asked him again this time clearly sad and hurt and he still refused..
I then asked him if we could talk on the phone sometime this weekend and he said ""idk, text me""

yet last time he said that he never followed up, and that's probably because we had huge conflict and i wouldn't get out of his car...

this time I was civil and let him leave without getting in his way.

I was crying my eyes out and he wouldn't listen to me or show sensitivity.
We are twins and INFP's...

I need help. This is about a could-be-failed love story.

My girlfriend and I started dating each other 3 months ago, after 9 years of being super duper close friends. I assure myself that I finally succeeded, but, I guess no…

In Vietnam, students who finish high school have to take an examination to decide whether they can get to the university they want or not. I was an exception for that test, since one university gave me a scholarship so I don't have to do that test really well, but she does have to. The result is, her mark isn't high enough for the school she wants, so she was forced to enroll for a school in the middle area of Vietnam while I'm in the South, and to be clear, we are 500 kilometers away. That's what people call a long-distance relationship.

What scares me the most is the fear that she may fall in love with somebody else there, who can stay with her and take care of her, which I cannot do. And it is getting worse since I heard that she is getting along very well with a boy who is her classmate. As far as I know her for 9 years, SHE IS NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO CAN MAKE FRIENDS ESPECIALLY A BOY THAT FUCKING EASILY. And all appears in my head is just: How the fuck can that happen? How?

This is getting so bad that, this Christmas, I told her to Facetime with me but she just said she was busy. (You can guess what she's busy at) - and correct, she was going out with that boy. I was so desperate that I counted every second she became offline (Facebook) that night: from 20:27:57 to 23:59:00. And when she became online again, she FORGOT TO FACETIME ME, OR EVEN MESSAGE ME.

Jesus, I rarely cry, but I did that night.

One thing I forgot to mention, since we parted ways for the studying, she never initiated our chatting - I did all the time. More than that, she NEVER ASKED ME HOW AM I DOING. All she did was just ask me for shits when she got trouble with her English homework. (Was she taking advantage of me, at this point?)

I truly love her, but the way she 'loves' me back and that fact she gets along with another guy just makes me really confused. I'm in a mess, I don't know what to do. Should I continue to live like this? Should I break up with her? Or should I stay quiet, waiting for the day that boy takes her away from me?

Please help me. I'm desperate.

Sorry for my bad English.

My mother, growing up, of course loved me, but she was a very authoritarian / helicopter parent - one of the most recurring values she pushed on me was ""Always compare yourself to better people"". If I got 90s at school, there was a brief congratulations, but the focus was on doing better. That value definitely had some benefits, but I think throughout my childhood and adolescence, it lent to a sense of insecurity and low self-worth; indeed, I was never good enough; there was always someone better. Most of the memories I have of my mother as a kid is her freaking out about laundry/dishes/toilets, threatening divorce, or threatening to give the dog away. Again, I know she loves me, and she would show me that by giving me material things. In my early to late teens, I was rarely supported in my passions (arts, music, traveling) since this strayed away from her idea of a stable, safe, life. I was (and still am) never able to have an objective conversation with my mother, especially if it contends any of her ideas or values. She would literally walk out of the room, slam the door, and plug her ears with her fingers. As a teenager, she would intimidate me, telling me that a detective was following me and that's how she knew I smoked weed. She also logged and read my MSN (throwback!) conversations, often times bringing up pieces of conversations I was having with girls.  


Fast forward to me moving out of the house and living on my own - what a relief! Nevertheless, every time I spent time with her, she was always worried about something, always advised against decisions I made, didn't support my decisions. I'll chalk up the constant worrying as a classic ""mother"" thing, bu when it's been consistently happening for so many years, it becomes exhausting. In the last 10 years, it's been getting worse and worse. I am afraid to speak of anything now at the fear of her lashing out on me. If she asks me a question and I say ""I don't know"" she gets irritated, upset, and makes it seem that I am in the wrong for not knowing. There are SO many more examples of my mom being incredibly negative, wound up, and taking her inner tensions out on me, but I'll spare you the bullshit.

Over the holidays, my mother told me that our family would not be gathering for dinner. Totally understandable given COVID. I showed up Christmas eve morning with gifts. No one was around to be seen so I said ""hello? hello?"". My mother greets me in the entrance of the house with a look of disgust on her face (she was probably upset that I was staying over at a friends house....despite my calm, polite explanation that I feel more comfortable staying there because of COVID). Next, as I saw the dining room table set, I told her I thought she told me that we were not having a Christmas dinner. She got incredibly upset, swore, and made me feel guilty for apparently not knowing we were having dinner (when she clearly told me we were not this year).... I have reached the end of my rope, this type of mental instability on her part, and her constant making me feel bad has reached a breaking point. I have tried on so many occasions to talk calmly to her, and tell her that what she just did or said makes me feel a certain way - but every time I do, it's my fault - I am over reacting, I am in the wrong. It has gotten to the point where, in the last 5 years, when I go home, I say very little, and am barely able to make eye contact with her. I feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells and am afraid to speak.

I want to cut her out of my life - I don't need her toxicity anymore. I need to, once and for all, respect myself.",26Dec2020,1
608,"I have woken up twice now to me touching my girlfriend in ways she doesn't want to be touched. We've been together for two years now and this has never been a problem for most of it. Least I can't remember it happening any other times. In the last few months I've heard of my close friend doing the same thing to his girlfriend. She would tell me she'd wake up to his hand down her pants. She'd yank it out, smack it away and he'd go right back to sleep. It sounded absolutely unbelievable at first. I was extremely upset when I first heard about it. Like there was no way he was actually asleep and accidently sexually assaulting his gf. I wanted to out him and tell all my other friends about what he was doing but his gf asked me not to and out of respect for her I haven't. Then it started happening to me. This most recent time I woke up already on top of her sucking her nipples. It felt like a dream so I continued and went to grab/spread her legs. Once I felt the tenseness I realized it wasn't a dream, retracted, and lied back down. She tells me that it also is almost indiscernible from a dream except her end is terrifying. She has had to ask me both times if I remember the situation too or if she was just dreaming.  She has had an abusive past and I feel absolutely horrible for making her feel this way. Is there anything I can do to help prevent this. I don't want this to continue to happen and make my girlfriend terrified of me.",26Dec2020,1

610,"Hi. So I was walking to the Market, and this homeless guy was making a lot of aggressive movements. He was making gun shot gestures with his hands to a couple people, and I passed by he came a few inches in front of me and did the gesture in which I stopped back up, and said What in a aggressive way. He then got in a kungfu stance, and was ready to swing at me when I then walked a step back, and took my phone out and called the police. As soon as I called the police, he got scared and began walking away. I was on the 911 call anyway so I continued making the report, in which he connected me to the police station. The way he was walking away, was also the same way I was headed for the market, and when I got to the market I told the police officer that I’m losing him from my sight if they could send someone out.  the police officer told me that he’s clearly all not there, and accused me of breaking a law of following him, in which I said I wanted to keep him in my vision to make sure nobody else gets threatened and you guys could stop him, the officer tells me I’m breaking the law and what he’s doing is not breaking the law and made me feel like complete shit. The officer then asked me where I am in which I told her and she made me feel as if I’m going to come arrest me, but then I said well if he didn’t break the law then I guess you guys don’t have to come. She then said okay and we hung up. But am I still going to get in trouble? I don’t think I did anything wrong or did I?

TLDR: Physically Threatening mentally ill homeless person walks away after I call cops, I stay a block behind him on the way to market to keep an eye on him until police arrive, officer tells me he didn’t break any laws and he’s mentally ill and I’m breaking A law by following him even tho it is same direction as me going to market?",26Dec2020,1
611,"Ok, I’ll try to explain this the best I can... here goes..

I’m 31 (M) and have had my fair share of struggles with addiction and mental health issues. These problems have been a constant in my life ever since I can remember. The feeling I have inside can be described as a deep emptiness. The feeling you get after a loved one passes away. The feeling you get after you get your heart shattered into a million pieces. What’s frustrating about my situation is, I can’t trace the feeling I have inside back to any one incident. I remember feeling like this ever since I was a young lad. The feeling will remain looming in the background through happy times and it will obviously amplify during times of sadness and depression.

This past year I’ve managed to keep my addiction at bay. I’ve been taking bupe (4 mg twice a day) and an anti depressant to help balance my mood out. 

During this past year I’ve gone through a lot of life changing events- some good, some tragic. I got divorced, lost my only brother to an overdose, moved back to my home state of jersey, got a new job (best job I’ve ever had by far), bought a condo, and quit smoking cigs. Juggling all these changes on top of the anxiety of the pandemic has my head more fucked up than ever before.

I’m proud of myself for how far I’ve come and I’m happy that I’ve been able to accomplish so much in such a short period of time. Idk why I’m so unhappy. I feel more alone than ever before. I have no friends to talk to and no one to lean on. I feel so alone. Has anyone ever overcome a similar situation to mine? I feel like I’m going crazy over here.

612,"Last night was an eye opener into discovering the type of person my best friend girlfriend is. My buddy Tyler who lives in Oklahoma came to Texas to visit his family for Christmas. Tyler came along with his girlfriend Kaylee and there daughter Emory who is just over a year old. It's 11pm Christmas night and my friend Tyler and I are watching the NBA. Kaylee is upset that she has to be a mom and watch over the baby who is having trouble sleeping. So, what does this women do because she doesn't want to take care of her child? Grabs the keys to the rental Tyler's parents paid for, grabs Emory who is crying and has chest congestion issues, and drives off to Oklahoma at 11:45pm, without any consent to Tyler. This isn't the first something like this has occurred, oh and FYI she's 23, a drug addict who consumes cocaine and already has 4 other kids with 4 different dad's, all who left her for good reason. We ask her to come back and stop being devious on Christmas night. She sends a text around 12 saying I wrecked the rental but you don't care because your watching basketball with your friend. I told Tyler to stand your ground and don't fall into her trap, she fled with there child on Christmas with a car rental that is under Tyler's parents name and not her. She comes back around 12:30 with a car that hasn't been wrecked like she stated. Goes inside Tyler's parents house and grabs Tyler only to say and I quote, ""I'm gonna make up a story and say you sexually assaulted E and there (police) gonna believe me.""

She said I somehow lead her astray from God? When I asked she doesn't specify in what way. Although we are far from getting married, She said the relationship dose not have a future because she can't marry an atheis. I brought up many arguments to convince her, such as the fact that people sin all the time knowing and unknowingly because the Bible is way too strict , yes, I've tried convincing her that the bible is made up and don't make sense to which I succeeded but she replied saying it doesn't have to make sense. Which is a stupid statement in my opinion, but she's not converting into an atheist anytime soon and I'm not converting back into a Christian (I was a Christian because I grew up in a Christian household)

620,So I work at a small hardware store at 17 and make minimum wage. Small meaning on weekdays I work with 3-5 people and average about 18-22 hours a week. Weekdays I usally get 4 hours because of school and weekends 5-8 hours. All people I work with are my age and go to my school. Started hanging out with 2 of them and we talk outside of work now. The only problem is it’s 7.25 per hour and plus i’m the register whore most of the time because the people that work there don’t care. The job is very slow paced averaging around 125-200 customers daily. The problem is on weekdays we’re supposed to only have 2 hour shifts on register and then 2 hours on the floor and customer service. I’m usually the person that has to do a full shift doing register because the other people refuse to do it. I never get to do much other stuff because of that reason and i have less experience doing other work in my store. I get there’s not much you can do at this age but I feel like working there enough makes me crazy. I could work at a large grocery store pushing carts in the snow and doing bagging or stocking and work with middle aged people for 4$+ more an hour and perhaps have a more toxic work environment. The reason I want to leave is because Id like do do something besides register all day and get better pay and work a higher paced job. The only thing I like about this job is the people I work with who I am kinda friends with now and the fact that when we close on weekdays It gets really slow and you can just talk and be on ur phone. Also the only way you can get a pay increase is if you become manager. I’m honestly not sure what to do but thanks for reading,26Dec2020,1
621,"I used to be a pretty chill person (without anxieties) that building friendships and maintaining them wasn't hard. But these days, especially since I've moved to a different country and in a small city, it's been difficult. I think my anxiousness scares away people that I begin appreciating in my life. I'd like to explain to those I enjoy their company and would like to be friends with why I am the way I am so that they could understand me better, but I'm afraid that it would push them away even further.

I've made a comment about this somewhere, and have now thought that maybe I could make a post here to possibly get some advice on how to go about it.

.....

I have a long history of experiencing multiple instances of mental and physical abuse. 

From my first memories of multiple occasions of my brother suffocating me in his room at the age of 3, and throughout my childhood of my dad hitting me over things that were not my fault, being targeted at different private Christian schools by staff (accused of stealing childproof safety plugs for outlets and being tied up to a chair by my teacher in the hallway and criticized and accused a liar during our nap time, I would stand up for myself and tell the teacher it wasn't me to end up getting spanked by the principle for not admitting it; and my brother blaming me for throwing away his homework and getting in trouble with the principle; being accused for talking during prayer when it was the girls next to me while I tried to tell them to be quiet, having the principle dig her fingernail into the top of my head telling my teacher I was being disruptive), throughout my teenager years my dad became an alcoholic and took things out on me even more. I left my family when I was 18 and shortly before I left they started getting involved in heavy drugs (I really dodged that one). I then started dating a narcissist who I fell in love with that ended up becoming an alcoholic and was also abusive to me, and for 3 years I had a hard time with breaking up with him that I had to leave the country. Then trusting a best friend I knew for many years, believing their words that they actually cared about me but only to find out that all they cared about was to lead me on and sleep with me and instantly moving on to other sexual partners instead of communicating with me about it.

I have had many multiple experiences of people taking advantage of me and me having a hard time standing up for myself, and now to this day I struggle with social anxiety and I feel depressed and lonely. Scared to make friends and feel close with people, but I try anyway.

I used to be a mentally strong person, but after so much I've become broken but with a big heart because I understand what it is to feel real pain. 

Therapy is expensive, and hard to access. I have gone through therapy a few times, but because of how hard it is to access it I haven't been able to go back.

627,"TL:DR Dad demands 500$ from me and my brother per month, breaking a verbal agreement and driving a wedge between his children and himself. How do I tell him this isn’t helping our independence the way he thinks it does?
Background:
My dad allowed my brother to move back in,
provided my brother would pay a set amount in rent. This rent would be returned to him when he moved out, the purpose of it is so my dad can hold on to it and give my brother a head start when he moves out. The timeframe was 6 months, from my brother moving in to moving out. This was agreed upon verbally. 
Not even a month later, he demands an extra $350  (original amount was $600 per month, total is now $950 a month) and my brother is understandably upset. He barely found a job again after moving, and as we face yet another lockdown, that job is giving him less hours. My dad also told me that I now NEED to contribute to “the household” $150 a month. 
This came out of nowhere and with no prior instigation. I make minimum wage part time, am a full time student, and my brother is a music teacher. 
I don’t know what to do to tell my dad that this sudden demand for more money every month is ridiculous. If he were truly having money troubles I wouldn’t hesitate, but he continues to brag about eating at any restaurant that’s still open almost every night, as well as the $1,000 a month he uses to “play the stock market” that he has consistently lost money on. 
My mom has been in rehab for alcoholism and is now living with her own mother, my grandmother, to take care of her after she had fallen and hurt herself. My own mother told us that the money my brother and I are supposed to pay in “rent” actually goes to her for an allowance. 
My brother doesn’t make the full $950 my dad is asking for in a month, and $150 is about a quarter of my monthly income from work, and I also pay the phone bill and internet bill.

633,"TLDR; At the bottom.

Let me start of, I'm 17 Male (This is a throw away account btw) and I've turned myself gay, i used to be straight. I'm serious when i say this and genuinely need advice, please don't think I'm joking.

It all started when i first started high school, before then i remember having crushes on girls and never thought in my mind i was gay. When i joined high school i didn't have any friends, i found this girl who i sat next to in class. We'll call her Jess. Jess thought i was funny and wanted to be friends with me, as i had not friends i thought its not too bad then. I thought she was okay, not the friend i was looking for but someone who i could talk to so i'm not alone in the cafeteria. We became friends but the issue was she was my only friend. Without her i would have no one, this was dangerous, as i did ANYTHING to make her like me.

Jess said a lot about how she always wanted to gay best friend (I know \*rolls eyes\*). I saw this as away to make her like me more and stay with me. So i told her one day that i was gay! The look on her face when i ""came out'"" to her, she was so happy, and so was so happy to as it meant she liked me more.

This wasn't the issue tho, as saying your gay doesn't really mean anything, it's what i did to act the part that was the problem. I  started to act gay around her, by that i mean the stereotypical gay person. She loved it and as as long as she loved it i also did as it meant i had a friend. She got more interested with my gay side, and asked me questions about who i liked and all this stuff. What was happening was i was being 'gay' at home too. I used to think about what boys she would like me to like. I watched countless videos about gay guys on YouTube to learn from, so i could replicate it too her. At this point i wouldn't say i was gay, it was still just an act. I still liked girls and did what all teenagers do thinking about girls in my classes. But i soon became obsessed with this act, i wanted her to like me more and more i wanted to make the friendship secure. I was started to become gay, not because i was, to please Jess.

I got obsessed. One day i got curious and decided to watch gay p0rn, it was for research purposes. I clicked play and watched the video. I looked down at the pants and i had a boner. I was a bit confused but in the heat of the moment i started to touch myself. I ended up finishing and turned off the video, i felt kinda weird about it all but i thought it was for research and it wasn't that deep. Until a few day time when i did it again. And again. I enjoyed it. Thinking about it now, i was a horny teenager. Literally anything sorta sex related would have turned me on. At that time i was starting to believe i was gay, as only gay people would find that enjoyable. After a while i started watching gay p0rn instead of any with girls in. This carried on for a while.

This was until me and Jess fell out! We where no longer friends, why we fell out hasn't got anything to do with the story so i wont say why but we where and are no longer friends. At the time i may not have realised but i think i still wanted to be friends with her. As we where not in the same classes and didn't talk any more, i had to show my 'gayness' more obviously, i stared to tell people i was gay and act gay around everyone at school hoping she would notice i guess. Jess didn't care and we didn't become friends again, i started attracting new friends, all good, however they also liked the fact i was gay. And my insecure self thought it was brilliant as long as i had friends. Now my new friends didn't 'require' me to be gay unlike Jess, however at this point i believed i was gay. I kept up this way of acting for a few years. I started to like boys and think about boys in my class while i jerked off. At this point i thought to myself many times that i am genuinely gay, and accepted myself as such. It was no longer an act.

So... Why is this a problem, just be gay. Well. i could my family and new friends would accept me, and to be honest i'm was not too bothered. Then Covid happened, i was off school for 6 months. The year i was in at the time meant i didn't have any online lessons as i had finished exams. I was returning in the summer but it got 6 months off from school. This is when i has time to myself to slow down and actually think about who my true self is. I asked myself if i'm gay, and had a very strange answer:

I'm sexually attracted to boys, i only watch gay p0rn, and want sex with guys, i see hot guys and i'm attracted to them in a sexual way but I wouldn't date a boy, i have never had a 'crush' on a boy . i would never marry a boy. I don't want to go out with a man, but i have a sexual attraction to a men. Would i got out with a woman, yes. But i am not sexual attraction to women.

\^ This is my issue i'm straight and i know i am straight, but I've messed up my sexual desires. I don't get turned on by women. But i only like women.

I need some advice. What can i do, i'm going to try to cut out all p0rn and masturbation for a while, to try and 'rest' myself. Any advice, what can i do? How can i be attracted to women. Please don't tell me that i should accept myself as i gay man, as i know deep down i'm not gay, it doesn't feel right for me to be gay. As i said my family would support me if i was gay, and i'm not trying to change myself in fear of others. I want to change myself for me. I know i'm 100% not gay, I've just confused my growing teenage brain in the sexual department. How can i start liking women again.

TLDR; I'm 17 male, I turned gay in order to make friends in high school. I would never date a man but would date a woman, i'm only sexually attracted to men and can't get hard thinking about women. How can i start liking women again? I'm definitely not gay. I've just confused my growing brain and now i'm stuck. Any advice on how to be straight again.",26Dec2020,1

635,"Hi.

I just graduated from my undergrad this May and I’m very set on going to grad school in the near future. I’d like to apply next year depending on covid. 

Currently, the job I have looks really good on a resume and is in the field I’m interested in. Unfortunately, my responsibilities are extremely small and not fulfilling at all. I don’t actually do work in the field I’m interested in, I basically supply data to someone else who doesn’t share any of it with me. Due to budget cuts (covid and other related) we are in danger of working ourselves out of a job and I’ve been given the task of entering historical data in excel for close to 20 hours a week. While the job looks good on a resume, it’s not at all challenging and doesn’t provide me with any real knowledge I feel. I’ve been here for over a year now.

My supervisor has been able to find other work for us to keep us paid and to slow down some work in our lab until we can hopefully not be in danger anymore. I accepted helping out with a project with someone else in the division that sounds cool. It’s not really my field of study though, but I think it would be good experience and it’s more field work. It would come with no pay increase, just a change of scenery and responsibilities on a different unrelated project. This work is supposed to start in April 2021. 

There’s been a job posting up for a few months now. It sounds extremely interesting to me, and if I didn’t have my current job I would be eagerly applying. However, it seems to be a 6 month position with about a $2.50/hr decrease in pay. For reference, I don’t even make $15/hr now. This other job seems to also give a living stipend so I think I could make my finances work if I needed to. I don’t want to assume I’d get the position before applying, but I’m extremely qualified and I fit a lot of their preferences. I feel I would have a good shot at getting the job. I feel it would also look really good on a resume for grad school apps, especially for some programs I’m looking at. It also says there would be a pathway into careers with them after completion of this job. That’s what I was promised at my current job too but that hasn’t happened... 

I’m currently so unhappy with my current job. My boss sucks and doesn’t care about us at all. I don’t vibe with any of my coworkers and usually sit in silence all day in a room with no windows. And I don’t feel challenged at all. But my schedule is extremely flexible and I write my own hours, that’s really the only benefit. 

I also feel bad for bailing on this woman that I told I was committed to helping with her project in the spring/summer. 

Am I overthinking it? Should I apply? Would I be an asshole and unprofessional to bail on this woman I committed to? I guess I would be applying to grad school after 6 months that this new position would probably end in. I am 24 years old.",26Dec2020,1

638,"! I was just wondering what your opinions are on unique names or if you even consider these names unique

I have a big obsession with symbolic and naturey names haha so I've always had my heart set on naming my child something like

""Solar"" or ""Skyler""

As my boyfriend is korean and I am not we have the liberty to give our child two names. I wanted to incorporate his culture into our decision and give our child a name that had to do with each other in both languages though. so I liked the idea of naming a girl ""하늘 (Haneul)"" which means sky in korean and skyler in english. 
If it would end up being a boy I thought of 화성 (Hwaseong), which means mars and calling him either mars or solar in english. 

What do you guys think? My boyfriend likes both of these names (hes a big space geek too so he likes the idea with mars haha) but we are both scared of our parents reaction to having a grandson called mars...

I'm also scared people might judge our child for it's unique name, thus I wanted advice if you think it's appropriate?

Do you think my child would hate me in the future for their name? 


On the other hand our other english names would've been Theodore and Madeline.

The other korean names would have been 형진 (Hyungjin) and 희제 (Heejae) but neither of these have big significance, we just thought they were pretty.",26Dec2020,1
639,"Hello.

I (F26) have a friend (M22) who has played games with me few times, we chatted about some personal topics etc. We only talk online, never seen each other live. Since there's corona it's even impossible to meet even I had planned to.

He got a girlfriend which I'm super happy about. He lives alone, his childhood was not rainbows and sunshines and he is a good person. I'm very supportive of his relationship.

But. Since he has the girlfriend, there was not a single chance to play a game with him. I always ask him to play with me and my friends, he always says ""ill maybe join/ill tell you later if i have time"" and then always the same.

""im sorry my girlfriend has came so I want to be with her""

I understand he wants to spend a time with her, but he forgot he has friends as well. I even told him to join us with her. I wanted to know her of course. But it seems he is the type of person who dedicates all his life to only his girlfriend.

I'm not upset. I'm worried he will lose her one day and realise, he was not even spending a minute with friends and they already left.",26Dec2020,1
640,"I just transferred to a school in France this year, last semester was my first semester. I came back in April during the first lock down.

I decided to stay home (in the US) this fall because I feared another lock down. Which did end up happening.

I started working and got a full time job at a property management company in November.  I'm still studying full time as well online. 

Half way this month our company sold this property. The new company didn't want to rehire me because I had no experience. I'm not supposed to really know this because it all came from my mom who knows my boss .

To clarify, I didn't get this job because of my mom. I wasn't even the first choice. 

Anyway, I was hired by the new company. All of this happened before there was any information regarding my school and France in general. 

My school is giving us the option to return around February (when schools are set to reopen) but no later than March. 

I don't know if I should leave or not. My mom told me that if I leave, I'll be damaging my relationship with my manager because she did her best to keep me on board. 

Which is true. At the same time, my coworkers are not the best. The other leasing consultant does not communicate important information to me and then I look like an incompetent idiot because I didn't know that. 

I can't really say anything to my manager because there's only 4 of us in this office (including my manager and I). The three of them have worked together for years, so it comes off like I'm the problem.

A while ago I posted in AITA and came to the conclusion I don't want my future child (im currently pregnant) to have a relationship with my mother's husband. (Feel free to pop onto my profile and read all about it, its so long!) The TLDR is basically he is extremely toxic and abusive and has been dead to me for years.

Now that the initial excitement has faded and Christmas is over I need to have a serious discussion with my mother about this. I don't want to come across aggressive but I do not want to leave ANY uncertain terms whatsoever. Honestly, I wouldn't piss on this man if he were on fire.

He got very angry and said ""show me where this guy is at..I will scare the living hell out of him"" and was jsut very pissed and even brought his gun. I didn't like the way he acted honestly but I couldn't stop him and he said what if he does it to another girl? And so I thought yeah he was right for what he is doing.

: where I live there are no covid cases, so covid aside.) 

We have been dating for 4 years and his mom knows my parents and my parents know her. They have met before. We’re both seniors in high school and have really good grades. 

I never go out and party and rarely drink and smoke. When I do go out my parents just tell me to keep them updated and stuff like that. 

Because it is a New Year’s Eve party there will be drinking. My parents want me home by 1:30 am. But it is very dangerous to drive home at that time because there are many drunk drivers, and it’s an hour from my house. 

I think that I should be able to sleepover because they’ve said they that trust me and him as well. Plus it is dangerous for anyone to be driving that late at night on New Year’s Eve.

648,"Well to start off, when I was in school my best friend was this super popular amazing highly extroverted girl (Y) and I was the introvert she adopted. She had tons of these jock friends (all mostly guys because girls didn't like her) and they kinda became friendly with me too. 
I was this super nerdy socially awkward slightly prudish kid with curly hair that was still a bush and braces in my last year of high school that lowered my self esteem like anything.
Now there were these two guys, M and A who were really good friends with each other and Y. I used to have a huge crush on A and on a school trip when Y asked me who I'd date I said A. Nothing much happened and M &amp; A used to randomly keep flirting with me at times but it didn't really mean much.
Now since I had the biggest crush ever on A I used every chance I got to try and talk to him online. He also used to come to my class in the mornings sometimes (we were in diff sections) but then I always came late so that stopped.
One time while chatting with A, he kept asking me who my crush was a bunch of times and I couldn't just straight up tell him it was him and it just ended with him saying leave it (what a dumb mf I was that clearly meant he liked me oof, I will regret this decision forever and why I couldn't just believe he liked me).
After that he just sorta went cold and in a while started dating someone but we still remained friends. Same with M (he even seriously had a crush on Y at one point of time so I never thought he might've liked me). I used to chat with these guys once in a while and then school just ended. (2018)
A few months into college I saw that these two guys had unfollowed me on Instagram and removed me from their followers list also. A had a public account so I just followed it but he never followed me back and M just hasn't accepted my follow request since (altho when I checked with another friend he accepted hers in half an hour).
I just don't get it. What went wrong. I used to be really good friends with M and ok friends with A and I don't understand why I've been blocked out of their life. 2020 is ending now and for some godforsaken reason I can't stop obsessing about it these days and feeling a lil hurt.

650,"So 2 months ago I've discovered my online friend is a full blown diagnosed psychopath, 0 empathy and all the other shit.

So I decided ""let's have some fun he must be faking it just to be edgy"" I was drunk at the time and I've found out what he's done to fuck people over just for fun, putting his family in danger just cuz he could etc, nothing fatal though.

Couple minutes ago he hit me up by saying he found a gun and is thinking if he should just shoot himself or shoot multiple people and then himself, only thing he's waiting for is for his little sister to go to their grandparents house in like 2hrs.

I know I can't stop him and I know he won't listen to me. The issue here is that I've lied to him how I'm a psychopath too, how I understand him and how I would do the same things he did if given the opportunity, I wouldn't, I was drunk and thought he was just being edgy so I was too. if he kills himself, even worse hurts other people, police could go through his phone, go through our chat and connect me to it, not sure but I feel like they could.

What should I do?

To answer some stuff before someone tells me/asks:
I can't call his parents, police at his town or anything, I have no idea where he lives, all I know is his 1st name and Instagram @.

651,"TLDR: pursuing medicine seems like the “grown up” choice but I’m kind of afraid I’d just be pursuing medicine to prove to myself that I’m not childish. But I’m also scared I’m being selfish by not pursuing medicine because I’d be taking the easy way out.

So my parents always said “do what makes you happy” so I basically have free reign of what I can do. It’s not a matter of “my parents are forcing me” but instead it’s a matter of doing what’s right. I’m a pre med major right now and I’m constantly flip flopping on whether or not this is really what I want to do. Sometimes I feel like I’m doing this just because I want to prove that I’m not lazy and I’m willing to work hard. But sometimes, I just wish things could be easier.

I’m not naturally good at math or science. I have to put a lot of time in to being good at it. And sure when I get a good grade in math or science I feel great because I worked so hard. But I start to wonder if it’s worth studying 10 years just to prove that I could. 

I’m naturally good at a lot of things. (This isn’t me being cocky in comparison to others but by my own measure I am good at these things) I’m a good writer. I can write all day and never get bored. I’m good at grasping complex ideas about philosophy, history, and people in general. I’ve had professors tell me I’m a “natural critical thinker.” And not only that. I’m a good artist! I’ve performed off-Broadway and have made costumes for productions too. And I think about what I’m good at and I get to wondering.. why not just do what I’m good at already? What makes me comfortable and happy. If I’m so childish, I must understand kids right? Why not be a therapist? Why not become a costume designer? 

And I’m not saying being a doctor won’t make me happy in the long run. I’m sure it will. But I’m terrified that I’ll be ridden with what if’s all my life if I do. And same if I don’t. My family doesn’t have much money and I’m sure me being a doctor could help them so much. But I don’t even know if I’m doing it for the right reasons. I feel like if I do change my career path I’ll just be taking the easy way out. That I’ll be lazy and childish because I didn’t want to put in the work of being a doctor. I sometimes feel like I’m just trying to run away from growing up and I should just suck it up and get on with it. 

Overall, I feel like I’m wasting time. And I just wish I could make a decision and get a move on already.",26Dec2020,1
652,"hey everyone. i’m having a bit of a dilemma now so i could use some advice. 

my boyfriend and i have been together for about a year now. he’s been very sweet and caring for the most part, and there wasn’t any red flags in the beginning. however, recently he’s been acting a bit more off and has a short temper. he’s been patrolling what i wear, constantly asking who i’m hanging out with and telling me i shouldn’t (obviously i don’t listen to him, but we’ve had plenty of arguments about friends i see.) he never took these arguments to the next level until last night. 

last night, we went to a tiny get together with a few friends. i went to go speak with my best friend (who is a guy) and i didn’t notice at the time, but my boyfriend was keeping a close eye on us. we were just talking though so there was nothing to be upset about. i left with my boyfriend, and we went back to his place. he was a bit drunk and he tends to have a shorter temper while drunk and he asked me why i was acting like such a “whore” just because i was chatting with a friend. i told him he was being ridiculous and insecure, and once i said that he slammed me into the wall and slapped me. really hard. at 5’2 and 100 lbs i was terrified, as he’s much taller and much, much stronger. i thought he was going to hit me again, but then he lowered his arm and shoved me once more before walking away upstairs. i immediately went home and i’ve been crying all night. 

for some reason, i’m not angry at him and i have no idea why. i feel like if he came right now i would take him back in an instant, even though i’m pretty sure what he did was uncalled for. i can’t tell anyone, if i tell my parents they’ll freak out and so will my friends. i feel sad rather than angry. why do i feel this way? what do i do?",26Dec2020,1
653,"I am struggling so bad emotionally. I know everyone is right now due to Covid-19 and I can only hope and pray that things turn around next year for everyone. This year seems to be rather dark for me. About a year ago and a half ago I broken up with my physically abusive boyfriend of 7 years. I was so excited and ready to live my own life. I graduated college, and I was having so much fun. Covid-19 took away my breath of fresh air after about 6 or 7 months. I feel back to square one and so depressed.

 I had never spent much time with my family because they disappoint me a bit. My mother and father let my 20 year old brother get on with no emotional help, he doesn't speak much or talk to anyone. He plays video games all day and is very very depressed. They refused to help him get counseling, well because he refuses on his own and my father cant cope with the fact that his son is different. We aren't close which upsets me. I am a very wholesome person and get excitement from social interaction. There isn't much here. I am getting down on my family life seeing all of my friends and their families having so much fun and interacting and getting into relationships because we are getting older (23F). 

I come home from my 9-5 every single day to see my brother full faced covered laying on the ground with a blanket covering his whole body. I am not sure why he does this but he looks like a corpse, it really disturbs me. My parents are grumpy and don't do much. I feel like I'm losing my sanity living here. I know what makes me happy and I try to get out of the house as much as possible because quite frankly I dislike being here, it almost makes me uncomfortable.

I was working a second job bartending to pay off the rest of my student loan. I only have 5k left and I am so so so so so excited to move out. I have something lined up whenever I can get the student loan paid off so I can afford the rent.  I wont be able to have it paid off for another 5 months and I don't know if I can make it much longer. I actually am contemplating how much my life even means to me. I just want to be alone in my own space. I would get on so much better with my own happy place. Covid ruined my second gig for earning so I have been door dashing. It just isn't enough. I am from Michigan and I am hoping Whitmer opens up the state on January 15th, but I cant bet on anything. I wish I could move out next month but I know I cant.

Does anyone have any advice for me on how to get through this period? Or how to get out of my house sooner, should I move out and struggle for a little while?

So I took that as him telling me he didn’t want a relationship with me, and i figured it wouldn’t work out anyway because I don’t have the confidence to be in a poly relationship. Plus, I’m scared of the commitment that a relationship needs.

I ended up having feelings for him. I stopped going to see him because I didn’t like pretending we were going to be something. Then we sort of just fell off.

A year or so later, he started talking to me again. He‘s in a poly relationship and I have a monogamous fwb situation going on. We caught up and I finally told him why I stopped seeing him.

Turns out he liked me too and he would’ve wanted to work it out. But I just think the different preferences we had towards relationships would’ve ended us from the beginning to the end.

Throwaway since he knows my reddit account.

So I (f16) come from a very religious household. I am the only one in my family who is an atheist. I don’t really talk about what I believe in unless it’s brought up. Two years ago, my brother (27) found his awakening after being non religious for a couple years. 
He’s definitely become the most religious person out of my family. He doesn’t watch any tv shows that show nudity, he doesn’t listen to more sexually explicit songs, he watches religious lectures on a daily basis - and talks about them to me. We hang out every single day. Not an exaggeration. He has shit skills at conversation and I’ll keep asking him to respond to me when I talk to him because he either isn’t listening or just says “damn that’s crazy”. I’ve told him I was tired of constantly fueling conversation with him and that it felt like I was talking to a wall. So instead he turned to either talking about the weather or religion. It’s not that he’s stupid, I know he just isn’t putting in the effort. Religion is what pushed me away from my strict, abusive, god-loving parents so I either can get extremely irritated when religion is brought up. HE KNOWS THAT. I told him a while ago I don’t like talking about religion, clearly, but he’ll still bring it up but instead he’ll be like “okay this is religious so I don’t know if you wanna hear it...” and I’ll say “oh okay no thanks.” and then he’ll act all hurt and like a sad puppy which he knows will get to me. So I feel guilted and I just tell him “fine what is it?” and I’ll hear whatever story he wants to tell me and I’ll just say “ok”.  Another thing he does is constantly make remarks about my clothing. I wore shorts that are short as pajamas but not short enough for my ass cheeks to show; however he’ll still make comments like “those shorts are really short.” “While we’re out let’s get you some longer shorts.” Literally all the time. Not once in a while. Every few hours he’ll make a joke about how short my shorts are- when I think they cover enough. Once I wore a crop top that showed a fucking centimeter of my stomach, and he came into my room then immediately walked out and spoke to me from the door closed so he wouldn’t see me. To be clear, the religion doesn’t even call for that. we’re siblings for fucks sake. Anyway, that time with the crop top I ended up exploding on him that day telling him I was uncomfortable with his shit and I didn’t want to hear a single fucking peep about my clothes from him again. He apologized and we moved on. He stopped making those remarks for a few weeks. Then this one time i wanted to wear shorts to this grocery store near us. We were driving and I took off my sweatpants bc I got hot and I was wearing shorts under them (they were appropriate shorts for a grocery store) and he was like “what the fuck??! We can’t go to the grocery store anymore. It’s embarrassing!!” And I was yelling at him too asking why he was embarrassed of me wearing shorts and then he started bullshitting with the “it’s not you.. I’m embarrassed of me! Walking around with you. It’s just me!!” And then this other time we were going to a different grocery store and I was wearing a tank top with a jacket over it and he was like “close the jacket. I don’t wanna start any trouble” but I told him to fuck off and I kept my jacket open. Another thing he does is when ever I show him memes and a woman’s collarbone is showing (or anything more...god forbid an arm) he’ll be like “WOOOAHH WOAH Nope.” And for some reason that pisses me off to another extent. At first I gave him shit for it and I was like “what the fuck are you sexualizing her arm??????????” And he was like “this doesn’t effect you! I wanna lower my gaze!!” And he was right so I stopped giving him shit for it. Something my brother and I do a lot is watch tv shows together. He does the same thing. He’ll keep his head down until I tell him “the scene with her legs are gone.” Matter of fucking fact, he’ll take his arm and cover the screen if he sees anyone nude or in underwear. If a sex scene comes, he’ll walk out of the room and return 20 minutes later or stop watching the show. It’s not even that I care to watch these scenes, I feel like I just get furious because he’s doing it which I know is stupid. Sometimes during car rides he’ll be like “if ur an atheist you don’t have a religion. You literally don’t believe in anything” in a really purposefully rude way and whatever maybe he’s right and I told him well it’s my beliefs fuck off. This conversation happens a lot and we get into fights sometimes where I’ll tell him “fuck your god! Ur god can suck my dick” because I know full well he’d be furious at that and he’ll be like RESPECT MY BELIEFS and he was right so I stopped saying that kind of thing a while ago but sometimes he’ll still condescendingly be like “you should believe in god. Just to be safe. It’s so weird how u don’t have any beliefs!” And Ill keep saying “can u just stop bringing it up?? Respect my beliefs, I respect yours.” And hell apologize and then 2 days later the same conversation will happen.
Anyway I’m just trying to paint a picture of how religious hes become. It’s definitely put a strain on our friendship. I can’t tell if I’m just being a judgmental asshole or if he’s an asshole. 
Today he came to my room and I was showing him this meme since we had nothing to talk about and he saw this woman’s arm and he was like WOOOOOOOAH and walked away and faced the door to hear the meme. I just exploded. it was ridiculous. I just kept yelling “I fucking hate your religion” and he was apologizing so I would shut up (since he thinks god would me mad at me if I kept saying that) and I told him to just go to his room. I know for a fact I was an asshole in this situation. I apologized a bit later. 
I’m not sure I’m im just sick of him because we hang out all the time to the point of annoyance. I explode on him easily but so does he. I tell him a lot we hang out too much and I need space but then he’ll either guilt me to hang out with him or just ignore my request and stay in my room. Anyway is there anything I can do in this situation? Am I supposed to just stop hanging out with him? How do I set a boundary about religion???? Am I just being plain disrespectful??",26Dec2020,1

664,"My roommates gf and 3yo son decided to basically start living with us, not officially to where the landlord knows- but annoyingly staying with us for free. How do I ask them to politely not hang out in the shared kitchen/ living room and have them hang out in the basement living room (where all of their rooms are anyway?) I didn't sign up for a 3yo when I moved in and frankly I don't want to have to hear it all the time.  
I have told the gf that they have to realize it is 3 people sharing a house and not their house that I and our other roommate just happen to live in. How do you simply tell someone to go downstairs to and shut the hell up? Like, I get that you have a three-year-old kid, but I don't want to have kids for a reason- the constant noise/yelling/screaming/crying IS THE REASON.

665,"I (15f) need advice on my relationship with my dad. He has recently been really toxic towards me and idk what to do. We have had a lot of fights last maybe 2 years and I am not handling this well. First, he took our wifi and replaced it with a router that can have multiple wi-fi networks, with one that is constantly on for him and mom, and the other one for me and my sibling that was on from 5PM to 8PM. Later we bought a second router for online school,which he has taken rn so I don't have internet, but I figured out the password to his wifi so f that haha. He did all of this just because ""when he was my age, they were outside all the time"" and that we are ""addicted to out phones"". He also really pressures me with school and grades, and he said that if u have good grades (I do) he will pay me for data in my phone. The most recent fight was when we were visiting grandma and he told me to sit down, which I didn't because I am sitting all day, so I wanted to be standing. He got really mad and didn't speak to me for a few days. He also told me (the same day, maybe because he was a bit drunk) that ""if his daughter disobeys him, he doesn't need a daughter like that'. it hurt me so much, I cried about it and I feel like a bad person, and it doesn't help that I have a poor self-esteem. we have since had a couple of fights, and yesterday, when he comented ""look at those horrible black nails"" (I have bought fake nails beacuse I want to stop biting my nails and I figured that would be a way to go, but I have never painted my nails before so I didn't do that great), i lost it, and started shouting that he really hurts me saying that, and that that is why I don't even try to be ""friends"" with him, since he always finds something to criticize on me. now I know, this is where I might have been an idiot, but I just can't deal with it anymore. Now, he is a really big fan of hiking, and he took us on a hike today. I didn't want to, but he was already angry, so yeah whatever I will go (I ended up going with my friends a little different route so I enjoyed it). Now that I got home, he took our wifi again, and he said that he is gonna stop paying for my data, and he is going to ""cancel"" my phone. Idk if he meant that he will stop paying for it or if he is going to take it away from me (it might be because I was on the phone for like 15 minutes with my bf during the hike). I am so miserable, my bf and a friend know about him and how he treats me, but idk what to do. I really feel like I am such a bad person, and a terrible daughter. he said that he wants to change this, but I don't know if we can fix this, and he said that we should talk about it. I know I have to talk to him, but he has different opinions (he thinks LGBT ppl are ill and such). I do want to have a better relationship, but he would have to change, and I know he won't. so I wanted to ask: AITA? and please, I really need some advice on this.",26Dec2020,1

As a girl who likes playing video games, I have a couple of guy friends whom I play games and talk with often. Two of my guy friends that I became good friends with (let's call them Jack and Alex) due to playing video games together started liking me. Jack actually told me he had feelings for me in June, and since I didn't share the same feelings, I told him I was flattered - and we moved on after a little bit of awkwardness. We are still good friends.

On the other hand, Alex keeps flirting with me and implying that he has feelings for me, so I try to ignore that and pretend like I don't get what he is trying to do. I am avoiding certain situations so that Alex wouldn't confess his feelings, because I don't even know what to respond if he does. I don't feel the same way, but I don't want to hurt him either.

I started thinking that maybe it's my fault. Because I'm a pretty friendly, caring, and easy-to-talk-to type of person, I'm afraid that I might be overly-caring and giving the wrong message to my guy friends.

I know I am not a great looker, but I do my best by grooming myself well. I keep my beard well trimmed and my hair neatly cut. I take care of my skin, and have recently begun working out. I try to wear fitting clothes, but being skinny fat, there are not a lot of options - hence, the working out.

However, whatever I do, I cannot change my face or my smile. I look ok in the mirror, but I cringe whenever I look at myself in pictures. I have been straight up told by people, including my mom, that I am ugly.

673,"Hello there, I'm looking for some advice regarding how to approach my university work when I am very disappointed in every aspect of my university which is preventing me to even look at anything without flinching back in disgust. Sorry it is long and sorry for the little (longish) rant. 

I am in my 3rd year studying a branch of biology. To make things clear, to be disappointed is to imply I had certain expectations which were not met. I thought that my university would be a source of mentorship, education and care but over the years I have experienced something... different. My lecturers aren't bothered to teach, the material is vague and I do not see how it applies to my degree, student assistance such as disability services and the representative student body is there for the face and not actually functioning to help its students. That's a reoccurring theme in my university. I hate the university environment, its fakeness and purely toxic personnel. I have reached out to all possible places I can, my student officer, my course representative, the student union. It is not worth repeating what was said but most people implied that my experience in lectures and other aspects of my course are due to my own shortcomings as a student. It sucks because I know it is not the case. For the second year in a row we have nearly had walkouts from a few lecturers as a class group, things have not improved and there was a meeting arranged that was supposed to run each week in which all the course lecturers would attend and the student rep could voice the opinions of the students. I think it was worth noting that this meeting entailed each and every year associated with said faculty, all the biologists and biotechnologists. Well, this happened once, and was never repeated. I was not invited as I am not a student rep but I am friends with the student rep and it was told to me that some lecturers left a few minutes into the meeting, all student reps were agitated, promises for change were made. Only- nothing has come of it. I am so angry at everything to do with this university. My money and time has gone down the drain, and so has my health. I mentioned I am in touch with the disability services and it is because of a chronic condition (and as part of the rules of the university, if I want to have access to the disability services I need to make my condition be known to all my lecturers, something I am very sad I have been persuaded to do) . I cannot look at any of my work for uni because of my utter disgust! I really don't know what to do. I would really appreciate someone's advice here. Thank you.",26Dec2020,1

675,"Background: My sister came out as gay 10ish years ago. She’s always preferred pants to dresses, men’s clothes in general, keeps her hair super short, prefers masculine leaning activities, etc. She’s currently married to a bisexual woman. 

Last time we were together she said there’s something she’s been meaning to tell me but she was really nervous to. I told her I’m always available and as long as it isn’t life threatening she can take as much time as she needs. That’s where she wanted to leave it that day but I’m expecting she’s getting ready to come out again, this time as trans.

I won’t know if that’s what it is until she tells me obviously, and I don’t want to force her. But I’ve been thinking about how I would respond if that’s it.

Only when my academic studies suffered so poorly did they realize they really didn't have a choice in the matter. Even though they do fund a portion of tuition costs, they never have supported me emotionally. Every time I talk to them, they ask me to change my career, to become sensible by either choosing a career in the medical field or dentistry.

It was 24 December when we're all opening the gifts and that's when my dad barges in and starts arguing with my other sister (29F). About how she paid for his flight here and she just ignored him the whole time which is ""disrespectful"". She said she didn't want to bother him since they had a really huge fight a long time ago and they haven't spoken to each other in a year.

My dad leaves and goes to his room where he's staying. He calls my (50F) mom who is back home in California and tells him to kick my (22F) sister out of the house. She tells him he did nothing. He didn't provide a reasonable explanation, but rather ""because you're 22 and you're old enough to leave the house."" They also had a fight a few months ago when he yelled at my sister for ""her tone"". My 22-year old sister didn't do anything following to being disowned. She just got kicked out. Just like that. On Christmas.

My dad is really, really abusive (not physically). He hurts everyone and has a narcissistic personality, which is why some in my family really dislike him. I remember when I was around 4 when he pointed a gun at my mom, although I can't really confirm if that was a dream or not. My whole family holds a grudge against my dad now, especially my sisters.

and this year at around june, my friend texted me and told me that I should text her, I did text her and I was so surprised to learn how happy she was to hear from me, I never texted her because I thought she was doing fine without me so trying to crawl back into her life would just land me in an embarrassment. we started talking, she was going through a sad moment in her life and she shared everything with me, at least she made me believe that I changed a bit of how she felt, things went down, mind you; we were still a hundred miles away from each other. we talked everyday and our love got reignited and I fell in love with her so hard, she told me she felt the same way in a precise way, she literally reflected the energy I was giving in, I was so happy with her, she was my happiest place.

ff to ≈2 months ago, I started complaining a lot and ended up apologising and asked her to talk to me whenever there's something, we should make talking the key thing of our relationship and she said she would try, there came a time where she shared one of her sexual expirience and I remembered something sexual she told me and I figured that she may have lied to me, I lost it bc and I was weighed on by the troubles we encountered when I started complaining, I'm emotionally weak and I ended up ghosting her but I wasn't intending to hurt her, I was doing it for my sanity bc I started stressing a lot.

now it's been 2 months since we talked, I blocked her but I still have our chats history, her contact is still saved as ""soulmate"" and now I miss her, I really wish I could text her or call her and talk to her but judging by the way she is, that wouldn't work, the only way it would work is if I talked to her face to face and apologize, try make things up if possible but I can't see her, she's so far away, I wanna see her, I miss her everyday, I want her to know how much I love her, I am so deeply in love with her but I can't be near her bc of the distance, I don't normally cry, especially for a girl but earlier I felt like crying when I thought of her and also thinking that I may never see her anytime soon and the love seems to be getting intense, it hurts.",26Dec2020,1
687,"Bit of a heavy one here, but I NEED advice.
(Also sorry for the spelling and grammar I’m not the smartest when it comes to that stuff.)

So on the first of December I gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl. She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because ‘that’s how babies are designed ‘ , but they didn’t see it , they didn’t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things.
Nevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn’t of helped her.

Fast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.

Now here’s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree! 
Now me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can’t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don’t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can’t enjoy any time with her because I’m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can’t over the past few days. I don’t know what to do , does anybody have advice or has anyone been through similar experience?",26Dec2020,1

690,"my partner and I have been arguing  for months about an issue related to our ""love"" to each other, he finally said I should try asking strangers about it, maybe then, I'll be hopefully convinced that what I believe in is wrong. Even though it's not a matter of right and wrong for me.

as long as I can remember, I never believed in love, people have temporary feelings for each other, they fade away due to one thing or another. and I never wanted that. but, if somehow I do feel that love, I never want it to be put under any label, nor to be admitted in the first place, that ruins it for me, it takes the beauty of it. it's like the beginning of the end. if I love someone, and he loves me back ( I would know that by how things  are going between us ) we should never ask for anything, and simply live by that love, express it endlessly through actions and even words I don't mind! that's almost what happened!

About a year ago, I met this person and we became best friends, we got closer and closer, after about 7/8 months, both of us started having feelings for each other, you could tell that by the way we talk and act, and that made me happy. because I felt like my ideal concept of love is actually happening and it's real. but few months later, He confessed he loved me and made it crystal clear, even though we both knew it already. I cant say it didn't make me happy, but on the other hand, I was afraid my fears will come true. I explained everything to him, I admitted my love, but I didn't want any labels, no beginnings or endings, I would always identify us as friends, and that didn't make sense to him, it probably won't make sense to anyone. but we were still happy, we had everything that couples have actually, I only asked not to label it. But he believes that we have to recognize that achievement by giving it its name, even if it's happening already. He wants me to be his gf, and it must be confusing, because anyone who'd be around us for 10min would probably think we're a couple, and that's beautiful, one might wonder where is the problem?

the problem is I don't wanna feel like I'm being possessed or put under certain concepts, as soon as I feel that way, I freak out and run away, I fear that I will hurt him one day if this ever happens, I wanna be with him because I want to, not because we're engaged in a relationship, I know it makes almost no difference to call it that as he says, but my head plays games and I lose control eventually. as soon as things start having labels and being normalized, I fear I will lose interest in the real thing and start feeling owned and prisoned by feelings and people. it's always better for me to live freely and have no commitments to people, that gets them hurt eventually. well, we always get hurt, I just don't want it to be that way. 

Now we're in love, the only problem is, he wanna give it a name and be officially in a relationship with me. Me, I wanna be with him the way we are under no labels. Do you think I'm wrong? even though I think this is a choice and not a matter of right and wrong. but he says I'm wrong",26Dec2020,1

Hey I need some advice on my relationship. Back story: I’ve been in a 2 year relationship with a guy who I’ve met online since I was 20. I’m 25 now. I always had my doubts about him because he would always text me dirty stuff while he was in  relationships with other girls. So yes that should have been a red flag. His last relationship was an open relationship. He broke it off with her and moved to my state to be with me. I had broken up with my ex right before he came. We were not official and he was still talking to his ex. Yes I did sleep with my ex the first week he came. But yes we were not official until a couple of weeks until he came. Which was still wrong of me I agree. Current story: so now I live with him and we have gotten very close. I vowed that I would never do anything to hurt him again and I didn’t. He would check my phone. Write mean messages about me to his red pill friends. I don’t think he likes woman very much. But on another note I found him sexting girls online from people he knew and didn’t know. Mostly onlyfans girls but others too. He also paid them while I was paying his bills and being faithful to him. I found out this was going on the entire relationship when I didn’t talk to anyone else. I feel like I wasted time. I would ask him sometimes if he was talking to other people and he would always say no and get mad at me. He swore up and down that he would delete it all and start fresh. He still hasn’t deleted everything and he is still talking to other people and trying to find other girls. He even told me a year into the relationship “I don’t believe in monogamy.” Yes I should have left after that. But he would always gaslight me and say he never said it, even though he did. Or he just changes the subject every time. We live together right now. But as of now I need his help paying bills . But I do love him and I really wanted to work it out. But I got mad and created my own onlyfans a couple of weeks ago. I started making some money. Part of me wants to stop and start over with him but he keeps doing it over and over again to me. If I didn’t have all this proof and if I didn’t have signs he was looking I’d want to start over but it’s like after lie with him. I had to dig into his phone to find the full truth. Which he always has had a bunch of passcodes on his phone. I want to stop too but I just can’t trust him anymore. After me finding out he cheated he stated “we are now even” (even though he’s still trying to talk to other people) he has been buying me presents. I feel like to maybe not be kicked out or maybe to make up for what he did?? I can’t tell.",26Dec2020,1

696,"tl;dr: started dating a guy I've known for years, his personality changed drastically (he avoided me constantly) got mad at me for breaking up with him and now he won't talk to me at all

Earlier this year I started dating a guy I've known for years. We had been best friends for a while pretty much and things were normal during the first week of the relationship, but then he started being ""busy"" all of a sudden and wouldn't talk to me or do stuff with me at all. I was understanding at first because, well, he was actually busy (school).

But things got a bit weird when the school year ended and he would still ignore me 24/7, providing explanations that made no sense at all (like how he was still busy with other stuff BUT had just started watching a show during his free time and was already on season 2). Whenever I made plans with him he would either cancel them at the last minute or disappear without any explanation.

I wanted to believe in him, like, hey, maybe he's going through stuff and just doesn't want to see me (or anyone else, for that matter). Two months into the relationship he suddenly picked up a ""secret project"" he would spend all day working on and could tell me nothing about, which meant he couldn't tell me anything about how his day was when I got the rare chance to ask him.

I was honestly feeling pretty shitty at that point so I asked him to talk with me, to solve the situation, to have ""the talk"" pretty much. I had to insist a lot because he ""was busy"" and in the end I managed to get him to call me at 9am. The conversation basically went like ""hey, I can't tell you anything, I'm legit too busy, we'll fix things when I'm not busy, bye"". I felt very happy at first because I finally got to talk to him for once but then as I processed what just happened I felt a bit sad. Like, seriously? You're too busy to think of what to do with the relationship? How can you even do that?

I was feeling pretty depressed at that point because of the relationship, going as far as having a suicide attempt. That's when I realized I had reached my limit, took my phone and sent him a message telling him I needed to break up with him and that I hoped we could still be friends. Silence for the next 24 hours, as usual, then an angry reaction on his behalf and a comment about how fantastic he was, how I was definitely mad at him and how he didn't need me at all. This was the first ""fight"" we ever had, so it surprised me a bit.

We didn't talk for three weeks after that, then I message him again in hopes of talking about what had happened. Telling him he may have not reacted the right way, and commenting on how immature his response was. Immediately he got online, once again mad at me, proceeding to explain how he wasn't angry at all back then, blaming me for everything that's gone wrong with my life, making fun of personal stuff I'm dealing with, treating me like shit overall... before proceeding to block me. Yeah. It's been a few months and all I got from him was an email that went like ""hey, I know we both said horrible stuff to each other, I'm sorry it ended like this"". Now, I had two problems with this reaction: the first one being that I didn't really say anything horrible to him apart from commenting on his reaction being immature, so I wasn't sure what he meant with ""we both did that"". The second thing is I don't feel like he's sorry at all because I replied to him telling him it was okay and we could be friends again and proceeded to ignore it, not even saying a no.

So yeah, a bit bothered by it. He was such a sweet person who was always there for me, and suddenly he stopped caring about me completely. Like, why? Why would someone do something like that? And what should I have done? Even if I don't really get it I think breaking up was definitely the right thing to do, but still the situation bugs me a bit because of how weird it was. My friends hate him and have told me he could have been using me, but I can't say for sure. So, yeah, that's pretty much it.",26Dec2020,1

700,"I know I have posted almost the same post on r/mentalhealth, but this one may be considered as a final update because at this point I just want stupid advice that could ""make my day"" for 3 minutes. 

Let's get to the point this time - yesterday, I have cried myself to sleep, I woke up two times at night, which sum up to almost two hours - I have spent awake during the night but in the end, I have slept 8 hours and 46 minutes ( I have a watch that I wear during the day and night - pulse, steps, hours of activity, hours of sleep, etc.).

While this thing above sums up my mental state right now, before anyone goes to my previous post - at this point, I'm starting to notice so many **wrong** things about myself, but I don't think my state has changed so much since then.

Drawing and writing - my main hobbies. Now, I can't even look up ""art"" on any social media site. When I see a post about how ""great"" the art/the writing is, my jealousy fills my mind as my hands start shaking (situation from today). I know it's wrong and that ""not everyone is on the same level"". I know I'm starting to get toxic here, but every time I see something like this, it beats me up to the ground. It also has a strong connection to my entire childhood, but I'm definitely not going to tell some strangers on the internet my whole life story. I just want to say that I'm sorry about this.

And the elephant in the room everybody! My mental state isn't good. It isn't at it's the worst state, but it isn't at it's best either. My anxiety level has reached the top and since the start of the Holiday Break, I'm counting days to the end of it. The tests I will have to write, everything, people looking at me like they are going to beat me up any minute. Or was it just my imagination at this point? I don't know nor understand myself now.

I don't have anything to do. While when I'm bored, I just want to go to sleep, my mind is going into a full ""I don't know what's going on nor I will remember it later""-mode. Then, I just have to get my focus somewhere, somewhere far from my thoughts. I don't control it anymore. I'm scared of what will happen if I'm going to be left with my thoughts. Or maybe it will be okay? Maybe I'm just avoiding my chance to stand up from my low state when I could go, reach the stars? I try to sound poetic, but at the moment, when I just have to let it all out, it looks so try-hard.

I try to reach out to people, I have been on every website (known to me) where you can talk anonymously. It doesn't help. I feel like I'm lacking anyone to talk to. I'm an introvert, but bottling up my emotions since my childhood isn't helpful - at all. In my class, there are 19 people (including me). Only one person from my class called me this year - once. Excluding the four texts, I got on Christmas from my classmates and one from my grandmother + the text asking for notes and homework (the days, when I was sick) - no one really cared about me. And looking back at my old class, old school, while they haven't tried to even contact me, neither my (old) best friend who knows about my problems - she also didn't even try to call me/message me for (also, what a surprise) over a year.

After all of this, I started self-isolating from my ""friends"" and tried to focus on my studies. I just shape that it can ""swap"" my friends, that it could fulfil me. But sadly, for now, I'm too anxious to even look at my notebooks/books. I just spend almost every day at youtube, listening to music or watching some Minecraft videos, my head blank, my bed made and my mind, whispering through the walls about reality and how many days are left to start again my boring, toxic life.

While pandemic gave me some time to think, exams are coming, even if they are in one and a half of a year. What if I fail? It will be ridiculous, for me to fail. But at the same time, I think that some things got better, some got even worse.

So Reddit, I would like to ask for advice - what should I do? What should I do to keep myself at a stable position at both - my social life and ""my""-life?",26Dec2020,1

712,"I’m a creative person but I have no talent and it makes it depressing to even want to create anything. 

I don’t care about what other people think and I don’t want to impress anyone, I just want to be able to create things that I think are good so I can enjoy them and be proud. 

My hobbies are making music and writing. I’m not terrible at them and people say I have potential but I never make anything that’s actually good in itself. 

I just want to give up because it’s a distraction and its really depressing knowing you’re not good enough, the problem is I cant actually give up, I want to get skilled at them too much to stop trying, but not enough to work really hard, so I’m stuck in perpetual failure. 

Tbh I don’t practise enough and that’s a big part of it, but I have disabilities that impair executive brain function so it’s really not as easy for me as Nike makes it sound. 

I pretty much just want advice on how to let go of this passionate desire to be good at things I’ll probably never be good at so I can put energy into more useful things and stop failing all the time.",26Dec2020,1

715,"Hi, um throwaway account probably since I don't want to get this traced back to me in any way. This is my first time posting on reddit so please give me some leeway.

 So um, a year ago (before corona obviously) in international exams I (16F) ranked top in my country in the English Language subject. It's a big deal, since English is my third language and the curriculum was really difficult since it got changed completely just a few months before the exams. I've always liked reading and writing stories and worked very hard so I suppose that translated into winning such an award. Don't get me wrong, I very happy with this achievement, it's only that after this i've gotten more and more pressured by every one around me. 

Since I won it before, my family expects me to rank top once more in the advanced version of the subject so I've been working on that for a while. I mean, it's hard since I'm taking a lot of other subjects other than English but I'm making do. So either way, one of my oldest friends (18F) was applying to university this year (she's older than me by a few years but was held back a year due to health problems) and she's not very good at the whole application thing. More specifically the essays.

Now usually i wouldn't have had much problem speaking my mind and shutting her down, but my friend has been dealt a pretty bad deck of cards in life. She has immune deficiency and a disease that makes her bones very brittle, thus causing them to break under even the slightest pressure. This had forced her into multiple surgeries from when she was very young and greatly impacted her education since she was too weak to attend school. Which was why she was held back. 

Her father passed away in the line of action in the army a few years back and her mom barely has money to support her and her older sister (who is a downright shitty and entitled person who only takes advantage of her mom and sister).  

She's a good person though and despite struggling with everything, she's bright and she picks things up quickly when she puts her mind to it. I've tutored her over the years and frankly she's pretty smart. It's just that her health and family problems held her back but she's on the road to recovery. I'm so proud of her. 

Now the problem is that I've been at her side for more than five years and I've known her twice as long as that. I know practically everything about her and I know that I'm one of her only remaining friends. She's been hurt by people taking pity on her for so long and has always tried to prove herself as independent. She had no choice but to as well, since her sister apparently refuses to step up and help out. So I know for a fact that I'm somewhat her support system. 

Now a few months after I received the prize last year she approached me, complaining about how hard it was to apply for summer school and how she could barely get by. Our student counselor barely does anything for the students and only pays attention to the students she thinks have a good chance of getting into a university or program that will boost her resume. My friend unfortunately, was not on her good list so she got next to none support from her. 

Since I was already done with my applications I offered to look at hers. Only to realize she had done NOTHING at all. No essays, no basic information, she even forgot her account password making it impossible to access her application. She's always been a bit forgetful- once she didn't realize her passport was expired until she was in front of the examiner in the IELTS exam. I'm a people pleaser admittedly, and I wanted to help her out since I knew she was going through a hard time so I quickly finished the application. I offered to edit the application essay for her since the student counselor barely did anything. She took me up on the offer, though in the end I was writing the majority of them and submitting them since she procrastinated too much. It was seriously hard for me to do all that, since the added pressure of studying well by my parents and I myself, wasn't in a good place back then. I even had to miss classes in order to get it done since she refused to do it without me.

But I still did all of it (around 7 application total i think?) and I breathed out a sigh of relief when it was done since I wouldn't have to do it again. She got a few scholarships last year and I'm might proud of her for that since I know she deserves it.

Flash forward this year, right now I'm in the same boat. It started with simple editing- like replacing small words with bigger ones or correcting grammar. Now it's writing full blown essays under the excuse of just 'replacing' some points into another essay. Now I wouldn't mind all this normally, since it's good practice for me when I'll apply to university myself. But this is really cutting into my time, I barely have time to sleep between school and extra tuition classes I've picked up. I'm doing tow extracurricular courses to boost my student profile. I'm writing a novel and trying to knit my mom a scarf for her birthday. I'm trying to maintain my gpa but it isn't working. Whenever I'm sleeping or studying or attending class, I'm editing and rewriting her essays.

My friend is applying to around 25ish universities abroad, which have around 3 essays each, both long and short. Out of them all, I've edited and rewritten the essays of around 17 universities and am left behind with 8 universities which I have to complete before new years. This was all in the midst of mid term exams. You can see where I'm going. 

I'm stressed out of my mind and I'm tired. I can't wing this since this is the matter of her future since she can't continue her education at all without scholarships. I'm her friend so I can't leave her hanging like this since she has no one to guide her. My grades are fluctuating and suffering because of this and I can't remember the last time I wrote a story out of fun or read a novel. 

When my parents found out about my editing stints they were furious in the beginning. But when they found out about my friends circumstances they've been pestering me to either shut her down or ask her to pay me for doing all this for her. I honestly don't know how to tell her I can't do this anymore since I'm afraid I'll hurt her a lot. I'm not joking when I say I'm one of her biggest supporters and that she relys on me. I've held her when she cried and I've encouraged her when she felt down. I just- she's very dear to me and I don't know what to do. 

The adults around me aren't very reliable or responsible so I can't go to them for advice and each time I go to my parents I get passive aggressive remarks how my declining grades are my fault and my fault only. I don't know what to do so I'm turning to reddit. I mean, this is a last resort. If I ask any of my friends for advice the truth is bound to come out. 

So, any advice for me how to tackle this?",26Dec2020,1

717,"Sorry if I have typos or errors, english is my second language.

I (19M) don't know what to do with my life. I don't think I have depression or anything, and once a few years ago told the doctor what was happening to me and he said I just have some depressive episodes but I am not depressed. I been in this kind of mood for like 3 years, some times it is better but most times just gets worse and I don't know what to do anymore, so I decided to post this here asking for advice. And I don't want to talk to my family or close friends about this because I don't want them to be worrying about me and be a burden since they have they probems also.

I have really low self esteem, don't like my body and have problem socialising because I always been pretty shy and an introvert, I overthink a lot and it gives me anxiety. My gf of 3 years broke up with me a month ago, I was really sad because she was one of the only persons I could talk to and open up truly. But could cry or anything, and I felt horrible for that. I knew she was going to break up with me because I messed up and I was kinda prepared mentally for it but still hurted, but not being able to cry or feel bad made me feel like a piece of sh\*t.

A few weeks ago a friend and I downloaded some dating apps to try and messed around, he got lots of likes and matches but I only got a few likes and almost no matches and that hurted my self esteem pretty bad, I deleted them but I downloaded again a few days ago and the same happend but I tried to ignore it, but I know the thought is there.

I have dropped out of college twice already, because I am not sure if it's what I like. I try to convince myself I like programming and things like that because I was always interested in computers and I used to enjoy doing things related to programming and with computers. But can't stay motivated to study or practice. I lose focus really quick and get easily irritated when things are hard.

And lately, I can't find the motivation or enjoyment to do things I like, like playing videogames or watching youtube videos. I just don't enjoy it anymore, but don't feel like doing anything. I just lay in my bed bored and wondering what should I do, and bad thoughts keep coming, i try to ignore them but it's pretty hard when the only thing I can think about is them and I feel some are right. 

I have thought of self harming myself and even suicide, but never did anything. I know I won't do it because I don't want my family and friends to go through it. I know how it feels because a close friend commited suicide when we were 14. But I just don't know what to do anymore, it is hard to enjoy things and trying to be in a good mood when I don't even know how I feel. It's been difficult hiding it, my family is starting to worry about me and I don't want them to know that I am like this because the will feel guilty and blame it on themselves.",26Dec2020,1

722,"I live in Italy, and I have pretty loud neighbours. They come from a specific city known  here for its exuberant people, I won't say wich one, but any italians reading this will know. They have always been really loud and annoying, but we never really said anything exept for a few times when their big dog was out barking all night. 
Since the first quarantine in march they've gotten a lot worse though, and in the last few months they basically started having ""concerts"" every night. Around 10 PM they always start banging on stuff that I can't identify, screaming things that resemble songs. About once every two days, sometimes even every day, they loudly chant happy birthday. It is clear that there isn't really a birthday, because even if they were all born one day after eachother, there are ""only"" about ten people in that house. Sometimes the concerts last until 1 AM.

Now comes the part where I ask for advice.
 I don't really want to go over there to ask them to stop, because they always just deny that they were making noise, and even if they did stop they would surely start again the next day. Also, the grandma of the family is on house arrest for having something to do with the mafia, so as much as I know nothing too bad would happen to me, I wouldn't like to get on their nerves. 

Since there isn't really a way to make them stop being cheerful southern italians, and if I have to suffer through their noise I'd like to have some fun too, my main question is: what is the loudest, most annoying thing I could possibly do that would be heard over a wall and lots of people screaming?",26Dec2020,1

I filed for a protection order mainly because of his unpredictable behaviors - he smashed his head repeatedly through our kid's bedroom door and tossed items all over in a huge rage/tantrum. He was also having erections with our kid in plain view, not caring that they saw and also asked for me to cover our kid up because he didn't want to see them naked. The order was denied. Since then, he's been messaging me and making fun of me for filing the order - how will the courts view his lack of remorse??

731,"I always read many stories throughout my time on reddit of people, mostly men, being cheated on. I do not understand how these people just deal with it without retaliating. In my view if a woman cheats on you she has won, there is not a whole lot you can do to get even again. She has emasculated you and will have absolutely no qualms with leaving you to suffer alone while she is able to find many partners with ease.

I don't see what a man can do to get even with a girl after this happens. I am not sure if I would ever be able to have a relationship just because I do not know how I would be able to control myself if they cheated, and I feel like there is a decent chance it would happen. I can lose control over slight little things and start raging at people. I have gotten in fights and punched people over little things, it is somewhat restrained in me because I am skinny and am not trained to fight, but if I was I can only imagine how awful I would be. 

I worry about this to be honest. I have absolutely no clue how I would be able to control myself if I got cheated on. If the girl was right in front of me I think all of my senses would shut down and pure rage would take over from there.

I guess the best answers to this question are to become a better person after the relationship so you can feel that you are the better person over them, but the girl would never care about that, I would carry the need to get even with me forever, I would feel completely insulted forever. I would feel completely fine being able to just lay my fists into the girl though, and I know that is definitely very wrong and bad and I would go to jail. How do people cope?

733,"Christmas eve morning my roommate came out of her room who had her girlfriend over for the night and asked for a hairbrush. I don’t even like sharing hairbrushes in the first place so I was already kinda like “uhhh I mean” and she said “but she really needs it”. It was Christmas Eve and I was like alright whatever. 

But a little backstory. Neither of them really even brush their hair or have the kind of hair that needs to be brushed. Their have a very taboo relationship and are heavily involved in kink, I don’t mind it at all. typically if I hear anything usually I just don’t care that much because like whatever it’s not a big deal to me. But what I heard next right after I gave her (MY) hairbrush was loud screaming and inappropriate SLAPPING noises that were suspect of the hairbrush given their lifestyle choices. 

The house is also extremely big and my room is on the other side of the house. They didn’t even keep that in mind the fact that it was Christmas Eve morning and you’re making the loudest noises I’ve ever seen with MY OWN PERSONAL HAIRBRUSH.. WITH your door open and screaming. Whenever The noise has stopped, I come out to the kitchen to get my breakfast and she won’t even make eye contact with me. It’s several days later and the hairbrush is still sitting in her room and she didn’t even care enough to even put it back where she got it from or say a word about it. 

In general she also just leaves a mess everywhere and it’s kind of just a very inconsiderate, negative and judgmental person and doesn’t really seem to think about anybody but themselves. 

I’ve had terrible roommate horror stories and I just thought this one will be better after like the fifth time but apparently not I just need to rant or I need someone to just give me some sort of advice because I don’t wanna go in there and be like hey do I need to buy another hairbrush or not because that’s a really awkward conversation to have to have.

738,"So, to clarify I have really bad GAD and was diagnosed with it two years ago because I had been stalked. Along with BD that I got diagnosed with earlier this year. I tend to get really upset about things and flip between anger and sadness really fast in more depressive states.

Recently I was in a relationship with one of my best friends and we had a few ups and downs but the one thing I asked of him was that he not ignored me on Christmas because of the fact that last year my boyfriend at the time did but had also convinced me that anytime we weren’t speaking I had done something wrong, I stayed as cool as I could that day but it got to the point he was straight up ignoring me even though he wasn’t busy, he just forgot and I got super anxious to the point I kept being sick that night and couldn’t sleep. That Christmas day was awful for me and I didn’t want to have to relive it, especially while still mourning the loss of that partner. So then this year, I do relive it. The only difference is I wake up at 3am and talk to my friend about it, I want to make sure I’m not blowing things out of proportion and my friend said not really but also mentioned that he knew something he wasn’t sure he was supposed to tell me. So I ask obviously and he tells me that my boyfriend had gotten a train to see this girl he has a massive obsessive crush on and was hoping to build a relationship with, that was why he was ignoring me. 

Obviously I feel sick to my stomach, I knew of the girl and I was fine with them meeting as long as he actually told me he was going to. Anyways fast forward to me thinking “Nope I can’t have this guy in my life I’m done” (Multiple times in the past we’ve gotten into arguments where we’ve both upset each other but he’s never apologized, not unless I’ve had to ask him to directly). So I message him saying I never want to speak to him again out of just anger and break things off. Then he sees it gets annoyed and rants out everything to a group chat. Finally he starts talking to me saying that he didn’t want to tell me in case I tried to kill myself and he had to go through doing a welfare check, that he thought I self harmed previously when on drugs (which never happened at all) and basically saying that it shouldn’t have been a big deal to me. Obviously I was confused on why he thought it would be but I guess we weren’t on the same page.  He went on to blame me for him being on sleep medication again saying because I ‘self-harmed’ when I was on drugs (which again never happened). Regardless of the fact he’s always had trouble sleeping, etc. 

We then just continued on arguing and then both of just stopped. He said he didn’t want to be my friend because he didn’t want to put up with me anymore and told me to just block him. I apologized and said goodbye and I just again don’t know if I’m blowing this way out of proportion. I have a tendency to lack the stability to keep healthy and long lasting relationships because of how afraid I get of being hurt or hurting others. I don’t know if I have just lost a friend because of my own idiocy or if this was probably better for me. I just don’t want this to be caused again in the future if I am blowing it out of proportion.",26Dec2020,1
739,"Hello. All my life I've had dreams of being psychic. Or something like that. I have real dreams where it's kind of like I push blood to a certain part of my body and then I am able to move things without actually touching it. Think matilda.  
Phycologist and psychiatrists say that dreams are usually weird and not to worry about it too much. But sometimes I can feel it in my bones. Like there's something in me that wants to get out so bad. And I'm just told that it's a lust for life.
It's hard to describe. I don't know what I should do. The dreams seem so real sometimes it feels like I go to another world. Like a different reality. 
I don't want to feel like this. Its like I'm going to expload. It's the same feeling I have in my dreams. 

I want to know what to do. What to research. What to meditate. Who to go to. I've been to physical doctors and mental doctors who say that I'm fine. But it hurts my soul. I don't know what else to do",26Dec2020,1
740,"Sooo today was my girlfriend and I’s 6 month anniversary and she means the absolute world to me. We went to bob Evans, then made a hand painting, then went downstairs to watch a movie. About halfway through the movie we started cuddling and I fell asleep in her arms. I woke up after like 20 minutes to her on the phone with her uncle. I didn’t hear what he was saying but I figured it was nothing and he was just saying hi or merry Christmas or something. And then she hung up the phone and started bawling her eyes out. Her great grandma had passed away. I hugged her and just comforted her and she went upstairs to tell her mother. (I followed her upstairs) and she was still crying. I had to go home so they could go to her house and I just wanna make sure she’s alright and I don’t know what to do. This year has already been so hard for her and I love her so much. Any advice on how to help? I offered to watch the dogs or water plants but they said it’s alright.  We live 0.4 miles away from eachother. (I’m almost 16).",26Dec2020,1

Since then my nose has a burning sensation and when I have condiments that contain vinegar it flairs up.

744,"I (16F) can’t tell if it’s because I keep trying to define myself thats the issue or if I just straight up do not like myself. It’s probably both tbh.

Basically with college around the corner as a junior I been losing it because I have absolutely no passion for any subject. How am I supposed to make such a big decision when I don’t even know what I like. I don’t wanna make the wrong choice. And, I still don’t even know what people I fit in with. It feels I go through friend groups at super speed. Of course I have my middle school friends who i’ve always stuck by. But, in the past two years I went through theatre kids, stoners, metalheads, gamers, etc. What the fuck is that. Man I dont even know if im straight or bi and I been debating that for literally 5 years.

Onto another wonderful subject is my appearance. I’ve always been a skinny short girl who doesn’t really stand out. I guess I have more of a different style with the music I listen to. I have patch pants and band shirts/sweatshirts. But holy fuck I hate my hair. I been debating for two years if I wanna cut it short because I hate it so so much and its curly asf. (And, yes I know the curly girl method but I simply don’t like my curly hair) I usually wear it in a bun. Oh, and it doesn’t help that for some reason im drawn to androgynous styles. I dont wanna get mistaken for being a boy because I dont wanna get bullied and I don’t want guys to not like me. As superficial as that is, I don’t wanna be alone.",26Dec2020,1
745,"So for a while now I’ve felt like I’m just everyone’s second choice. I jsut recently got out of a near 2 year relationship and throughout that relationship my ex put her sister and her best friend above me with absolutely everything. I got tired of it and being around toxic people like her and her sister so I broke up with her. The part about the break up that hurt the most is I always voiced my concerns to my ex and her sister that I felt uncomfortable about him being around because I always knew that he was waiting until we would break up so you could sneak in and take her from me and they would always tell me no don’t worry about that that would never happen. When my ex and I finally broke up she gives me a call and she starts bragging about how she’s had a crush on him since she’s first met him and that they had sex for two hours and bragging about all the stupid shit and she just really made me feel stupid for trusting them. And made it clear that I really was a second choice to her and her boyfriend and sister. Her and her sister were my best friends for almost 3 years I confided in them about a lot of personal stuff and I did more for them than anyone else in their life. I never expect anything in return when I do something for someone and I’m not expecting a pat on the back but it hurts that I did so much for them and I treated them so good and they lied to me and made me look like a fucking idiot. I’m definitely no angel in the situation but I’ve never experienced such betrayal and utter disrespect from people who I cared for so much.

Now all of my close friends have drifted apart and they are the people that I’ve been closest to for 8+ years. we all used to hang out all the time and talk and do stuff and we’re at the point now we’re none of us even really talk to each other. I know that people have their own lives and I know that I’m not gonna be anyone’s priority and I don’t expect that by any means it just sucks when my friends consistently talk about how they miss me and they want to hang out more but then they do absolutely nothing to change it. I feel like what should’ve been my best friend only everyone to hang out we are going to the bar smoking and if there’s ever drugs or alcohol involved he is always on board other than that I never see him and he never hits me up. And for a few years now he always talk about all these cool vans he went to and all the people he hung out with and he always talks about how much I would’ve loved to of gone and how much fun I would’ve had and how cool all these people are. The part that hurt a lot too was he would always go grab one of his friends that literally lives a two minute walk away from my house and bring him but never ever ever hit me up but then always talk about how I should’ve gone and how much fun I would’ve had.

I’ve tried all the dating apps and all this stuff and it does nothing short of falling through. I’ve been trying really hard to meet new people make new friends and experiences but nothing ever goes through. My roommate goes out to parties and hangs out with people that we both mutually know and our homey‘s with but no one ever invites me and no one ever talks to me and it just makes me feel like shit when he comes home and talks about how fun everything was and no one even tried to hit me up. I’ve acknowledge the fact that if someone doesn’t hit me up then they don’t want me there and I accept that and I realize that’s my reality but it still hurts nonetheless.

I’ve had so many dates planned off of things like tinder or bumble and hinge and nine out of 10 of them bail on me or just don’t even hit me back up and I understand that that’s a part of the whole dating scene especially over social media it’s still just bums me out because my hopes still get stomped on even when I know I shouldn’t expect anything. Aside from my mom I could go days without hearing from anybody, no one ever checks in on me and asks how I’m doing or try to talk to me and it just hurts because I just feel like no one really cares.

I’m not sure what I’m really doing on here I’m just hoping that someone out there has some words of encouragement. I’m used to being alone especially before I got into my relationship with my ex and used to spending days on end at home with no one to talk to and hang out with. I’m happy being by myself and I don’t necessarily need anyone to keep me happy it would just feel nice to feel as though someone actually cared. I’m sick of being lonely and I’m sick of being everyone’s second choice.",26Dec2020,1
746,"Me (19f) and my stepfather (47) have never gotten along. He came into my life when I was 3 and has been trying to control it ever since. He’s a narcissist and all around not a nice guy.

2 years ago I moved out of my house where him and my mother live to temporarily stay with my grandparents until things got better between me and him (the arguments where getting really bad) and I needed to get out the environment 

However I am supposed to be moving back into the house in a few months (this is something I really want to do) I miss being around my mother and dog, and would like to move back. 

However having spent Christmas with them 2 days ago I felt very uncomfortable. He’s always been childish in his jokes however I felt this was very inappropriate. He was making lots of suggestive jokes about sex, about my mother looking a certain way, what they where going to do that night, thanking me for doing her makeup as now he can “enjoy” her later, telling me to kiss his finger that he cut better and putting his finger in my face, and pulling his pants down showing me his bum as a “joke”. 

I told my mother the fact it was weird and I’m not sure I want to move back if he’s going to behave this way, I said it was creepy.

I already didnt like him because he called me being bi ""hot"", but when I told her how much what she did hurt me, she told me she had been compensating for others a lot and that she needed to focus on herself more and then never talked to me again.

I’ve wanted to be a preferable and hot person my whole life and I’ve just got into dating, but I learned not to long ago that tall stature is much more preferable for men than being average or short. I also recently read an article about an operation called limb lengthening that give recipients 3-4 extra inches of height. Assuming I grow a little more, this surgery could make me around 6’0 tall, which seems to be desirable and could help in the dating market.

Sometimes they're cool with it, sometimes they're not, and if they're not I let them know it's cool, and we either remain friends or stop talking.

756,"Throwaway account b/c of justified landlord hate. I get it, really you don’t have to tell me how predatory landlords can be. This isn’t that. 

Today my dad came to me asking for r/Advice on what to do about a tenant of his who bounced a check 3 months ago, and has not been returning phone calls. I wasn’t sure what to tell him, so I’m posting this here to get some feedback. 

The tenant in question (we’ll call him Brad), lives in the upper part of a building, while his brother, brother’s wife, and daughter live in the lower part. His brother has lived in the building for 15 years, and has never had an issue. Brad moved in a couple years ago, and has had a few things problematic come up, but nothing big until a few months ago when the check bounced and my dad lost contact with him. 

Brad works with his brother, landscaping I think, and they see each other everyday. So my dad has tried calling his brother, and they talk and he says he’ll tell Brad to call my dad— but obviously that hasn’t happened for whatever reason. I mean maybe he tells Brad, and Brad just doesn’t follow through.. but either way it’s not happening. 

So now Brad is about to be 3 full months behind on rent, and my dad had an experience in the past where a tenant saved up like 4 months rent then skipped town, and he suspects that might be what’s going on. 

The rent is literally $400/month which is.. I mean I wish my landlord charged me $400/month. It’s not in the best part of town, but the house is well kept, maintained, etc. We know he’s healthy, and working, meaning money is coming in.. Basically this is me saying, even a person who supports the concept of Tenant Unions, and Rent Strikes. It seems pretty unreasonable for Brad to not even give my dad a call. 

My dad told me if he wasn’t working b/c of Covid-19, as long as Brad contacted him he wouldn’t evict him. Or even if he is working, but for whatever reason can’t pay, as long as he reached out and spoke with my dad, he wouldn’t evict. 

I think he feels disrespected (I mean how hard is it really to pick up your phone and call), and today my dad gave Brad’s brother another call, and told him if he didn’t hear from Brad by the new year he would have to start the eviction process. 

Obviously this is a bad situation, the advice I’m looking for is, is there anything else at this point, short of eviction, that my dad could do to get in touch with Brad? And beyond that, what do you think should happen here? I know my dad doesn’t want to evict, but it feels like Brad isn’t giving him much of a choice.

To  give you a brief summary of my situation, my mom and I (m 15) live in a  smaller city in the Western Cape in South Africa, where the Covid  crisis is not too bad, my sister and BIL on the other hand, live in  Johannesburg (which for those of you that don't know, is a fairly  densely populated city) and they are coming down to the city in which me  and my mom live for the new year. Ordinarily I wouldn't have a problem  with this, because even though I disagree with almost everything she and  her husband have to say, they are still family after all...

That  being said... I cannot and will not be fine with it during this  pandemic, because as the title suggests, they are anti-mask and anti-vax  and to them this whole pandemic is some massive hoax. Unfortunately for  me, my mom doesn't share the same opinion and is ecstatic for their  arrival.

I feel it is important to  mention that I am not vulnerable, and my mom is... on the borderline  due to her being over 50, though she also downplays the severity of this  virus. Am I over reacting? I intend on seeing friends over my holiday,  as I haven't seen them in over 9 months due to me needing to be removed  from the boarding school that I went to due to money being tight (as a  direct result of this pandemic) and it would really affect me to not see  them for potentially another few months (they live in the next time  over, so it's pretty difficult to arrange things for the weekends and  shit) due to my sister and BIL, so can anyone give me some advice on what to do about my sister and BIL, I have had the idea to maybe not allow them into my room unless they have sanitized their hands and wear a mask, though I am really unsure as to whether that would work",26Dec2020,1

This blew me away because this was the second time that they said they didn't have it. I sent my letter of recommendation to them twice already, and they even acknowledged that they received it.

I called them the next day, and they were able to find it. That meant that they did not look over my application, so that they couldn't make a decision. I asked how they will inform me, and apparently, they like to send the decision by mail (physical) so that people can have that excited feeling when they get it.

It turns out that a lot of people got their things in the mail three weeks earlier. I asked them if they could just send the decision to me by email because I already waited long enough, I needed to apply to other colleges if I didn't make it in, and mail would be extra slow because of the Christmas holiday. 

They responded, saying:

Good Afternoon, 
Something should be mailed out shortly regarding your decision. I am sorry if this isn't much help. 
If you need anything else, please let us know. 
Thank you!

I got a issue that bothers me lately. Let me explain it. I feel disconected. I feel i cannot form new bonds, and the old ones are rusted and fragile.

I'm a 29 year old science teacher, extorverted and married with no kids. My job push me to interact with hundreds of people every year, so I'm not isolated at all. Basically, i have no problems to find new people and meet them.

The issue here is that the last interpersonal relationship i've form was from 9 years ago (with my wife). In 9 years i've have not make new friends in person. The reason behind this is because the cultural gap between them and i. Let me define ""cultura gap"".

I considere myself as a world citizen, mostly an internet person. I feel interest and emotion for all cultures in the world, but the person around have a strong sense of tradicionalism. They always listen the same music, dress like the same, eat the same things, and celebrate holidays like always been done.

I don't like that, not anymore. And when i want to show them another things, they refuse it and ignore it. I feel really sad, because i don't like them repetitive ways, so i feel apart and disconnected.

During this pandemic isolation, I've been alone the most part of the time, and surprisely I don't felt alone or sad because of that. And to be honest is becoming a little addictive to be this way.

My wife starts to worry because i'm slowly become a isolated person that don't want to get out and socialize with people. I understand her concern, but i feel comfortable and in control this way.

This time lately, I rarely talks or intereact with other person in real life, even in internet. My wife works all day outside, so basically i'm alone all day. I know that human beings are social but i really need to overcome this ""crisis"" or it's ok to be this way?

During my junior year of high school I was going through a really bad breakup, major depression, and just lots of other personal things that my “friend” was well aware of and after a month of me not texting him first I realized not once did he text me to check if I was okay or need help with school or anything of the sorts, so slowly removed myself from his life. I know it sounds a bit petty that I cut him off just because he didn’t text me but i was always there even when we didn’t need me and I just wanted that to be reciprocated and even when I did unadded him from social media he still had my number and my mothers number (that’s how “close” we were) and till this day never reached out...now I’m in my senior year of highschool and he still has my guitar and I’m moving soon so I want to ask him for my guitar back, I just don’t know how and every time I start up the text message I’m paralyzed with anxiety so please, does anyone have advice on how I should go about this?",26Dec2020,1

Anyway, so, for context my sister has been packing for college recently, and we were all pretty excited for her including my mom but right after she actually left, Mom started freaking out and talking about Jackie like she'll never come back, relating her to mom's sister and mother (who have both passed away). I've been trying to offer her ideas on how to calm down, but she says none of them are even going to work. She's been crying all day and now she's started to act kinda manic, she asked me if I want a beer and she would normally hate the notion of me drinking with her.

777,"I am a 17\[M\] living in the United States. For many years, ever since I started to be able to form my own opinions and thoughts really, I have had a rocky relationship with my authoritarian mother. If you don't know what that means, google it. I found an article explaining it and it completely made sense of my situation. I noticed I wasn't able to have or do what the other kids had or could do, I felt as if I was in the wrong but then question it because of outside recourses, seeing how other parents parent their children. I told my mom yesterday, \[Christmas Day\], that she only thinks of herself, but afterwards, I explained how I know and appreciate how hard she works for me and my sister, how she spends almost every penny of it to make sure were happy, and how she makes sure were taken care of, and have a roof over our heads. Later in the argument, she pulled one of her tactics to make me feel guilty, ""You just told me I only think of myself and no one else"". I proceed to explain how I JUST EXPLAINED the above, and she insists that all I said was that she only thinks of herself. I just never feel like I can win. For YEARS, there has been this cloud above my head that's filling my brain with sadness, guilt, severe depression, and suicidal thoughts. And it's the guilt. I call it my cloud. I've been trying to run away from this cloud for so long, and many times I've thought of just getting rid of me instead of my cloud. I feel numb, walking every day. As if I'm a dead man in an alive one's body. I've told her I just want us to have a good relationship, and I've explained how that can't be done with me living with her. I moved out around 4 months ago. I moved into my dads, where he and his wife are on my side. They believe everyone on that side of the family are crazy. But that wouldn't be a good source would it? I just need closure, I want a good, but somewhat distant relationship with my mother. I plan on moving across the country when I turn 18 anyways, it's always been my dream. I've explained to her as well that I will be doing this a year from now anyways \[moving out of her house\] when I'm 18. Her response was, ""well it will be different then because that's how it's supposed to go"". I love my mom, but I just want her to quit making me feel guilty and be happy. I know she hasn't been happy in a long time. I just want that for both of us to we can live our own lives and spend time with each other here and there. Just like normal mother-son relationships.

785,"So, I have always kept my hair short, but I have ale ways wondered how I would look with long hair. If you’ve seen supernatural, I’ve always wanted to grow out my hair to look a bit like Jared Paladecki’s Sam Winchester. Maybe a fan thing or maybe I just liked the look. 

And the quarantine seemed the perfect time for doing it, since, who would care if a 31 year old lawyer grew his hair out? After all I was going to be doing home office until at least June of next year. 

For context when this all began me and the single siblings who still reside in the country moved back in with our parents, at their request. 

Being that they are now older and that most of our workplaces switched to home office (for those of us who managed to keep our jobs).  we agreed to do so. (Me particularly until I find a place to live since I was just relocated to my home state after years away). 

So my hair was getting there and I quite liked how it was going, until these morning. When one of my parents was cutting the other’s hair, they grabbed the clippers and, when I was turned, used them on the center of my friggin head an a very low setting. 

“Now sit so that we may finish the cut and make you look decent”. 

I’m livid. I stormed out and had to finish  myself since they basically left a big af cut dead center in my head that’s impossible to hide. 

I feel like they totally disrespected my identity and self image, as if, “if I don’t look the way they want” they can just go ahead and change that for me. Haven’t left my room all day and I’m moving back out Monday, when a apartment becomes available. 

My siblings think I’m in the wrong here. No one knows I’m moving back out yet. They all just know I’m not talking to my folks. 

Am I in the wrong? Honestly I feel like crying and I really can’t understand why. It’s just hair after all, but still, it’s a mix of anger and depression.

I didn't wish for it and I'm not musically nor does my mother want me to keep them anyhow. Do mind that I gave him one gift, twice as expensive and one selfmade one.

How I feel and think:
I feel like I've been played, but also as if I'm making a way too big deal out of it. But then again, my father had now his 3rd car, which I didn't even know about. I want to cry, simply because I kind of feel alone, which is also connected to some other mental health problems I have at the moment.
It all lead up to me feeling very frustrated and overwhelmed by everything.

Sadly, I am not so hopeful on how much success this will have.
I don't know if I could perhaps text my therapist a SMS, since I have big troubles processing this situation correctly and coping with now and in the future.

On how to cope with this.

TW. mentioning of panic attacks. Suicide and self harming. 


Hi!

(I apologize if my grammar or sentences aren’t perfect, English isn’t my first language.)

So, a little back story first. 
I (14,F) have a pretty big friend group. I don’t want to brag and but I kinda “made” the friend group. It was all very fun and everyone is excepted. Last year a friend ( well call her Catherine) I have been friends with for a long time came to our school and joined the group. There were a few problems but those were solved.  She made friends with two other girls ( we will cal those Marith and Mika) and kinda forgot about me. We have had ups and downs in the past and it happened again. Luckily we worked it all out ( after a lot of tears.) and are more close then ever. 
After about half a year later I became friends with Mika and Marith too. They joined the friend group as well and it was all very good in the beginning, in the meantime Marith and an other friend of mine ( well call her suzan ) became very close. but after 2 months or so it all started. 

They started to kinda change and I have the idea it comes from Marith. Suzan had never behaved this way and I know her for about 3 years now. Here are some things that have happened/that they do. 

- both of them are mentally not stable. Marith has panic attacks and suzan is most likely depressed and both of the girls have self injured before. I try to support them as much as I can. But when I tell them I am tired or that I won’t be on school because I am sick ( what happens pretty often because of a some issues I had as a baby my immune system is more then shitty and my energy level is very low ) they say that I am overreacting and they have started to nag at me that I have too much vitamin A as in “aanstelleritus” ( it’s Dutch for making a fuss basically) 

- I have heard that Marith has been talking bad about me. But I’m not sure since that came from a friend I have had problems with before. 

- they constantly call me. I’m talking about 20-30 calls in one day sometimes. When I say that I’m not available they ask why and I keep replying with that I’m not available. They keep going and call me back literally not even 5 minutes later. My parents are more then done with it since it also happens with dinner and they say it’s just stalking. Which I find kind of a heavy word. 
Once Marith had a panic attack and called us. Both of us didn’t pick up ( which we normally do when she has a panic attack) but this time we didn’t. The next day on school she was very upset and mad at us. Suzan felt really bad about it and I told her that it wasn’t our fault. Later that day we said that it wasn’t normal to have 1-3 panic attacks per day and that she had to get in contact with her coach about her problems. She said she would but I believe that till this day she still hasn’t done it. 

- they constantly say that I’m ugly and that I am flat they have
Pointed out insecurities I’ve never had before. If I would do this to them they would get mad at me. I am overal pretty confident. And I know I’m not perfect, but no one really is. 

- mostly Marith, makes not so nice comments. For example:

A few days  ago we were in a “argument” wether I was a “girly girl” or not. ( my stile is kinda skater girl vibes and a little emo/goth. I don’t really know what it’s called haha. ) they said I was and I replied that I didn’t feel like I was. I asked why they would think why I was a “girly girl” (which I don’t have problems with. It just bothered me that they said I was something that I didn’t feel like. If you’re a girly girl. Good for you! As long as you’re comfortable.) 

Their -well. Mostly Marith’s- arguments where my long hair. Which is dark purple. I proceeded to say that that wasn’t an argument since Mika has long hair and she isn’t a girly girl at all. I did this all in a jokingly way and they know that since Marith is very sarcastic herself. ( which I feel is more leaning to mean sometimes) 

I told her jokingly that if I was an girly girl that she was one for sure. Her response was. “At least I’m not being someone I am not” 

I know what she refers to. Since I am a really kind person and I really care about my friends. When someone who I don’t know says something mean to my I just laugh at them and don’t care but with my friends it’s completely the opposite. 
She constantly makes these comments and I’m just kinda upset with it. 


I could go on for much longer but the text is already very long and I don’t want to make this a rant haha. 
Basically what I’m trying to say is that I don’t know if I’m just overreacting or if they- ( mostly Marith ) are toxic. Marith has said that she doesn’t want to loose me since I kinda ghosted them for about a week because I just couldn’t take it anymore and she felt that something was off. 
And if I were to drop her/them it would be very hard since their both part of the friend group. I would really like some advice on this since my parents say that if this goes on I should stop with talking to them and I agree I just wanted to see it from someone else’s perspective since maybe you see it differently. 

( sorry if the text is long and unclear. I didn’t really know how to explain this. )

WRAP UP: a friend wants me to support them with their problems and rants but when I tell her what’s wrong with me she says I’m overreacting and makes fun of me. She keeps calling and gets kinda mad when I don’t pick up.  makes comments about things I do/how I look. She is pulling an other friend into it as well.",26Dec2020,1

But I, as basically everyone else, would also like to find love one day, however I don't see how I should approach that issue because I'm already draining my social battery with simply talking to a few friends everyday.

Here I am, 21, haven’t had my first kiss yet, haven’t been cuddled by a human (only cats and dogs), and haven’t really been hugged by non family members.

I have no one. I’m sad and alone and I feel isolated by everyone and kinda cut off. I literally look around and see everyone else in a happy relationship. I’m never invited to do anything unless I ask to join. Because it’s usually couples only or something. I’m literally the only one in my family alone.

To make things worse, my family is kinda homophobic and I am gay and no one knows. I keep thinking of this one boy I met and really like but I can’t talk about him for the reason above. Family is homophobic.

801,"I am 19 about to be 20, my sister is 22 about to be 23. We never got along growing up. Not the typical sister rivalry either. Honestly would consider it mental and physical abuse to an extent. We would get in very physical fights which have led to concussions, stitches and my door having a lock put on it due to her threatening to kill me in my sleep. She has ruined many of my things. These arguments which led to these awful fights where over things like me borrowing (in her defense I was a little sister and never asked) a shirt from her, me wanting to tag along with her and her friends. Little stuff like that. Just a little sister looking up to her big sister turned very nasty. I had a tumor back in 2013. A few months ago we got in a dumb argument over laundry or something. She got so overly upset about it she had told me to my face in front of my family members she hopes I get another tumor and die. She has said I was fat an ugly, I would never have any friends or nobody will ever love me. Anytime we have a disagreement on absolutely anything no matter how small it is, it is blown WAY out of the water. I totally get fighting and arguing and being upset about that situation but she can’t ever just argue about that one specific thing. She always has to bring in some really hurtful stuff like our step dad “(name) is gonna leave mom because he hates you so much.” She just has issues and is a really hurtful, mean, hateful, nasty girl. Very childish, very mean, immature and all around pretty awful. Constantly says she hates me and wishes I was gone. I am just at the point now I can’t even be in the same room as her without being annoyed and automatically put in a bad mood. She’s like an on and off switch. You never know what will set her off. Constantly walking on eggshells with her. It used to make me really said because I wanted to have a good relationship with her like “normal” sisters do. I wanted to fix what was left of our relationship. Whatever that is. I just have no desire now. She just isn’t a good person.

It all started when I started binge watching a YouTube channel called Whisky Tribe. I found that the enthusiasm and passion they had for whisky to be interesting to me. At the time I had only really had Jameson and Jack Daniels in terms of whisky and only drank it mixed with coke or ginger ale.  A week after watching these guys videos I went out and bought my first Bourbon. 

At first I was having a hard time drinking even one glass of whisky but after two weeks I was able to drink a couple drinks over ice. Now I was not drinking every day but was drinking 8-12oz on weekends. Now after a month of drinking on the weekends I can drink whisky straight with no ice (The highest I have had is only 90 proof). I am starting on my second bottle of a different brand of bourbon. I have also started on my first bottle of scotch. 

Now getting onto more of my worries about alcohol consumption. I am worried that I may be starting to form an addiction to whisky. Im not too concerned about the 8-12oz I have been having every weekend though I am uncertain if that will affect my health over the long term. I have however been started to crave whisky after the weekends. I have been thinking it over in my head, one side of my is like ""stick to the weekends, its perfectly ok as long as you dont overdo it"". Another side of me is like ""Lets have another glass tonight"" after I already had my fill on the weekend. 

Then I'm reading articles and scowering the internet for a reason to drink more a week. Now  I always associated alcohol abuse with people drinking a bottle a day to mask their mental health issues, mainly depression. I do have a mild form of depression but that is not why I started drinking whisky. I started because I found the world of whisky to be intriguing and I wanted to experience it. I continue to drink because I enjoy the taste/smell of it, the buzz being a happy side affect. 

Now with my wanting to drink more a week I feel might form into a couple glasses a night wich will form into half a bottle into drinking a full bottle every night. I think this way because I associate drinking every day with alcoholics and the craving I have to be leading me down the path of alcohol abuse. Now that I have finished ranting I am wondering what you all think. Am I just overthinking this all and should just enjoy my new love of whisky but just watch that im not drinking like 6oz a day? or should I stick to drinking on weekends?",26Dec2020,1
803,"Throwaway account.

First time posting here. I work with my bf and another girl we'll call A. A and my bf used to be friends with benefits some years ago but that ended after she confessed her feelings to him but he rejected her. She soon after got into a relationship with another guy. I got together with my bf earlier this year. Due to covid and staff being put on payed leave she returned to work around August/September. Some time before that she discovered that my bf and I were together from another co-worker. Ever since her return and discovery her attitude has changed towards me that is hard to describe. She no longer talks to me at all unless it's work related. In the beginning I would talk with her as normal even joking but soon realised she had something against me but for what reason, I don't know. Now I never engage with her in conversation and avoid her unless I have to speak to her, usually related with work. I have spoken to my sister about this and she says that A is jealous and has unresolved feelings for my bf which is plain to see and she often flirts with him at work. What doesn't make sense is that she herself is in a long-term relationship. I also found out from my sister that A always talks about my bf and I whenever she is with a particular friend. Why, I don't know or understand. I am always civil and polite with her at work and do not speak to her often so I don't know what she has to say about me, especially about my relationship when she is an outsider and knows nothing. She is known to be very catty, talking behind people's backs, two faced. I feel uncomfortable working around her and don't know what to do about this. Any advice is much appreciated.",26Dec2020,1
804,"I imagine for many families the holidays can spur all sorts of conflict. I'm very laid back and calm, but have found myself in the crosshairs of my sister this entire break. I've noticed three general themes that have upset me over the last few days: 

(1) Competition olympics: for whatever reason, regardless of the situation, my stories and experiences are always getting one upped. For example, I work in a very demanding industry (finance) and I commented about how I worked 80-100 hours every week this fall. They responded and told me that was ""nothing"" compared to what they had worked. This was a blatant lie. They work as an elementary school teacher. I am sure it requires more than 40 a week, but it certainly doesn't require 80-100. The conversation was extended when it became the stress olympics. Somebody in my family mentioned I must be stressed because of my job. My sibling had to jump in and demand her job was more stressful. Granted, she doesn't know what my job is like cause she never asked. 

&amp;#x200B;

(2) Conversation hijacking: whenever we have a family dinner, they must control the conversation and alpha talk over everyone. Nobody else is allowed to have a moment. Everything must go back to whatever is going on in their life. Other people are certainly aware of this too. It's not fun to be around and it is very exhausting. 

&amp;#x200B;

(3) General cruelness: I bought gifts for my sibling and husband. They decided not to thank me or even acknowledge me when they opened them. This kind of hurt. They're not kids. They also often dismiss my (serious) mental health struggles. I have serious germ and intrusive thought problems. They make comments and point fun at it. This is challenging for me to accept because it ruined much of my childhood and young adult life. There were years when I couldn't even leave my house. In one case, I accidentally sat in their seat and my sibling instructed their husband to pick me up and move me. I'm a 25 year old man. Picking me up and moving me instead of asking me is unacceptable. I don't like anyone coming in my personal space, sometimes not even my wife. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is lengthy, but in sum I've felt like my sibling and their partner have bene quite condescending, rude, and mean to me over the last week. This is not a new issue and I am not happy continuing in this way. I would like some advice. Am I overacting? Can I stop associating with them without ruining other family relationships? Is that worth the sacrifice and so on.",26Dec2020,1
806,"I’ve tried asking my girlfriend (out twice this week. Both times she sounded unsure. Then Thursday when she texted me I brought it up again and same thing, she said her family was going to her uncle’s house to spend the week there until New Years. Then the next day when our texting conversation was ending at night I sent my girlfriend a goodnight night last night and she left me on “seen” the next day. 

I called her today and asked how things were going, and she seemed normal. She then mentioned how they weren’t going to the uncle’s house after all. So I said if she was free the whole break. She then said she was. So I said to her “What do you think my question is?”. She said laughing “When are we going to see each other again?” I said “yes exactly.” She said she was thinking of tomorrow and would ask her mother if they were going to do anything. I brought up how I would like for us to see each other more than just once a week and only spending six hours together at a time. She said kind of in a shocked tone “That’s a lot though!”. Like is it really? To me it’s not. 

I asked what time tomorrow, and she said maybe 4:00pm maybe 5:00pm, but would let me know. I said “Okay, text me when you know”. But basically we agreed for her to text me. I don’t know if something is wrong. Like she just seems more distant. I’m so worried and feel like she doesn’t really care.",26Dec2020,1

808,"Almost two weeks ago I texted a coworker who I haven’t seen about two months ago after quitting my job. I liked her, but I wanted to keep it professional while we were working together. I felt like she showed interest too which is why I decided to ask if she’d be interested in grabbing some coffee together that weekend and asked how she was doing. She responded with “that sounds great” and a lol and emoji in one message. A few minutes of not responding back to her, she sent another message saying “I’ll let you know when I get a day off though! :)” I responded back to her saying something like “yeah I understand it’s the holidays and you’re working Mon-Sat” and I apologize for having left and leaving her with all the workload. She said it was no problem “nothing I can’t handle, I’m just vibin just trying to get through the holiday lol” 

This is where I think I messed up because I didn’t respond back thinking it wouldn’t be a problem and I just waited for her to let me know when she would get a day off, but I haven’t heard back from her for almost two weeks. 

Is she not texting me because I never texted her back, or does it mean she wasn’t actually interested and just didn’t want to say no? 

Sorry, it’s just I’ve been kicking myself for not texting her back after she was texting back to within a 1 minute or 2 of me texting her.",26Dec2020,1
809,"Story goes there was this woman i worked with one time at an old job. She was helping our store out. We got along really well and things seemed to click so i tried my luck which is a rarity. I asked her to dinner. Wasn't trying to pressure it just seemed casual as possible to make her comfortable. We talked and decided on a place. When the time came she stood me up and ghosted me... Completely fucked with my head. What's wrong with me, did i do something wrong? All kinds of questions and self doubt shot through my head for days. Then months later i get a random text from her saying she was sorry. I was a little upset and asked her if she knew how it made me feel and i told her. She said she was sorry and wanted to make amends. We talked a little bit after that but not much. She doesnt seem to reply hardly at all, not really surprised with my luck honestly. We talked about being friends and kind of going from there. Im completely cool with that and told her. The next few days after that talk i tried reaching out. Just basic talk. Hey how are you, stuff like that. Never got a response... suddenly just on Christmas eve im getting ready for work in one hour. She texts me. Says she is out in the cold and couldn'tgo back to her place for the time being. I tell her about work but she can come to my place. I go get her bring her back. Show her the place, make sure she is comfortable and has everything she needs. I get back at midnight from work. She's asleep on the floor next to my bed. I felt so bad she was on the floor. She had my spare pillow i gave her and the extra blanket i had at least. I felt bad so i gently put my other blanket on her to make sure she stayed warm. We woke up in the late morning, had a cup of tea together and talked. She said she  noticed the second blanket and thought it was sweet. It made me blush not going to lie. As we talked though i noticed she was doing a lot of active listening. Kind of crazy and blew me away because im not use to anyone really paying attention to what i say let alone pulling things from throughout the conversation and adding to it. I felt that connection again. When it was time for her to leave she said she wouldnt be back that night but left it open ended that she might need a place to stay in the future. I told her she is always welcome here whether its to hang out or if she needs a place to stay again. Honestly she was an excellent house guest for the little time we spent together. She thanked me so many times. Said how awesome it was for me to let her stay last minute. Place was fine when i came back, she even made my bed right before she left which felt a little weird but i wasnt going to object. I know i probably just got used for a place to crash and i dont care much about that. I'd do that for anyone really. But i felt like it would bring us a little closer? In a sense. Like she would actually talk to me more and what not. I guess nothing changed though. I havent heard from her but once later that day she left asking a few questions about my job because i never really explained it to her. Havent heard from her since... kind of dont think i will either unless its like before a message here and there and long wait times in between with her only contacting me first. I just dont know how to feel about it. I've mostly just kind of let it slide and think of it like a fluke more or less, which it probably was but oh well i guess. I just have this crush on her, she is so cool. She's into photography, has a sweet camera that she brought with her when she left her place. Has a telescope and loves astronomy. That was the first thing that clicked between us. There's just so much more i want to know and learn about her but never seem to get the chance",26Dec2020,1
810,"I need some advice right now on what to do. My boyfriend and I are employed at the same place, he just got fired on the spot for looking “high”. They told him they didn’t want him in front of guests like that. Mind you, everyone and their mothers in this place smoke weed. This is a city where weed should be normal already. He has so many bills to take care of especially during COVID when cards are maxed out. He suffers from severe anxiety and depression and the weed helps him and actually keeps him working at his best. I can’t even tell when he’s high and there’s a chance he didn’t even smoke before work. I feel that they have some sort of vendetta against him I don’t know. There are managers who always joke about smoking weed and how they’re gonna take a fat blunt to the face after their shifts etc. I’m sure they smoke before work and everything but I’m cool with those managers. The big bosses know that too! There are a few more employees who always get special treatment because they’re favored for some reason and every time I see them they are BLASTED. Eyes shot red and voice is raspy they just look like zombies. They hang out like that in front of managers and their service isn’t even that good. I’m a bit younger but I work here too and they were being so secretive about all of it. I just found out he was fired because he texted me. I feel some type of way because no one has told me anything. I understand that we are two separate people, but we’ve been together in a serious relationship for years, he’s my partner. We have both been loyal to the company since the opening, and never left even when hours got cut and wages got dropped. I understand that there are rules and we can’t take back the fact he was fired. But isn’t it fucked up that no one has told me anything? I mean I already feel like leaving this company because of the favoritism, animosity, and the fake atmosphere that the managers have created. I’ve been told before that I need to improve my “voice” because it’s “small”? I’m conflicted and for some reason I feel like confronting management. I feel as if I deserved to at least been given a conversation about the circumstance because it’s really bothering me. My question is, would it be inappropriate for me to go and say “hey, it’s messed up of you guys to do all this and not consider even telling me” or something better along those lines. I have no clue what to do and need guidance because as of now I don’t feel comfortable here and I don’t want to look any managers in their face or take any stupid favors from them. They should fire every drug user in here if they’re going to pick and choose when they want to get rid of people they simply don’t “like” anymore. I really need advice because the whole situation is giving me some anxiety and I’m unsure about how to handle it. I don’t just want to act like it didn’t happen and continue my job as normal when I obviously think there is a deeper issue in the way management handles their employees and operations.

813,"Me (M23) I think that I have a huge commutation issue. 
Before a month ago I met with girl which I never been seen my whole entire my life. I went with her on a date just one time. Actually I wasn't dating ever before. So when we met I was pretty nervous I felt like I'm in kind a job interview or something. I think that I'm introvert I wasn't much talking about myself because I don't have much to talk about myself, I'm 1.80 and my weight is around 60kg either not so horribly looking. I don't have any interests or hobbies I don't do with sports or reading books or anything and I rarely speak to friends or anyone except my father and I also do not working currently. 
So my daily life basically is sitting in the four walls and wasting my time. I Really don't do anything in daily. And yet I'm living alone and I come from village and there is not much people around me. I don't have highest education either. 
So when I met that girl it was so awkward. The girl seemed extrovert and open-minded also talk active 
She was pretty much talking about herself and I was just asking her question I think that I asked her a way to many questions that I even was repeated them because I was so nervous that I just couldn't remember what question I asked her 5 minutes ago and there was sometimes a moment of silence from which I was afraid of. She probably got bored of me. I drove at her with a lousy car. After that evening I came come and and I texted her that this was a first time meeting a girl and told her that I was nervous on and on. She said that she wasn't feeling comfortable with me that night and blocked me. 
And yet and I also rarely speak out my opinions because it's hard to express yourself. Like I don't really want to tell anything inappropriate. I'm living in flat alone around 5 years and rarely go outside except to shop. I grew up without my mother and my father has a Schizophrenia at an easy stage he is living abroad and working in the factory. Well my father is fine he just doesn't make up eye contact with other people. I talk with him quite a lot and he has a opinion for a quite a lot things. He is also a extrovert and open-minded too except that he is a bit nervous sometimes, I don't know why that's so. 
I probably have experienced the most awkward and worst date ever. 
The girl is living 100km apart from me. Well I got over it easily. That's a good sign right? 
I want to learn to communicate with other people and especially girls because it's the hardest thing to find a something common between girl and guy. 
How can I learn to communicate with girls and others for a guy who has low esteem or how exactly should to diagnose me? I really Don't know. How can I find a life back. I think I'm lost. 
Sorry for my horrible English grammar. English is not my native. I'm so sorry I did not even meant to wrote this wall it just happened. 
And I forget to tell that girl is (F17) 
I don't think that it's linked with my father disease. Cause I know about that disease since 17 year old. I have feeling that I'm wasting my whole life, my time, because I can't find a girl. I don't know why I'm acting like this..why does getting the girlfriend is so important to me. It could be because I grew up without mother? 
I want to improve communication skills also self esteem and not to be afraid to fear of expressing the option on and on.

819,"I’m 26F. He’s 27M.
BUTTTT let me bring it back to 2011 when I was a junior in high school dating my first bf, let’s call him Dylan. 
We were only together for a few months and he was my first. Yes first.... lol.
Anyway, he was going to college (he was a grade ahead). So we broke up and no lie I was young so it was a salty break up and it didn’t end smoothly- especially because I knew he loved his ex still. It was just all around a shit show. We didn’t talk for YEARS. We remained social media friends on fb, a few chats here and there after I turned 21 and such. Nothing special.
**Fast forward**, Right before covid, idk WHAT reason but he’s been in my dreams. So I reached out wishing his family to be well (since I got close with them when we dated). I was just saying hey, I had a weird dream telling me to see how you’re doing lol. He responded kindly to it and was wishing my dad good health (he remembered his illness). And we started chatting A LOT for a few weeks. We start playing video games online together. He invited me to see his new house he bought and I went over. No this wasn’t a booty call, we literally just played video games and made dinner. Hahahah. He didn’t make a move at all, we caught up with all the demons and things we went through since we last spoke. 
It was honestly a really good time and before I left he hugged me so tightly and said, “hope to see you soon”.
I left feeling really good overall, and honestly I felt some feelings. Like he’s still very attractive, has a great personality, and a good head on his shoulders. But here’s where shit gets weird....
After he sees me, I never hear from him. I’d send him some snaps, he’d leave it open. A few days later I ask him if he wants to play COD, no answer.
So after a few more weeks I get fed up of wtf is happening and I message him asking “ what is happening?!” And he said “my b been busy with my new job”.... uh??? Yes we are all busy that’s fine lmao but no one just ghosts for weeks and leaves everything on read/opened. So I then said hey, if you don’t want to be friends or if anything was weird for you I’d rather you just tell me so I can at least have an understanding of why I’m ignored. At this age games shouldn’t be played. 
Something along those lines. He left it on read!!! So I removed him off my social media’s so I wouldn’t be tempted to see his stuff and reach out.
**Present time** a year later, today, I dreamt about him last night. He’s occurred in my dreams a few times this year and it makes me feel super uneasy when I wake up and it makes me miss him kinda? I then feel uncomfortable the whole day and can’t shake it.
I just can’t seem to feel at peace or get this guy out of my head without knowing why and that’s a huge problem and flaw that I have. I like closure. 
Does anyone have advice on how to move past this???? Like there’s no way the chemistry in the friendship or whatever it was- was fake. But maybe I was fooled idk. I just hate cowards and he swears it was because he started a new job but I feel that was just a shit excuse. :/ why can’t people just.... be good people. Give closure.",26Dec2020,1

823,"I’m 24F and got a position about 6 months ago as a bank teller. My head teller is 55F and has been there for 30 years and hates me. My branch manager makes excuses for her constantly. My assistant branch manager seems to be afraid to stand up to her and afraid to speak up to the manager. She has made my life hell since day one. She talks down to me, is rude to me, etc. The floating tellers that come through say everyone ends up quitting or transferring because of her and our branch is a revolving door of tellers. 

My branch manager had the week of Christmas off and when she’s not here head teller is always worse. Monday night she was running behind and I did everything to help her catch up, clean, scanned work, emailed our papers to the departments (basically every single end of night task so she didn’t have to). She balanced and just had to put her drawer away and she’s slow AF so at 4:42 I punched out (were scheduled until 445 but I’ve never left at 445 because we’re done quick). I said I was headed out and said goodnight. She snapped on me said “why would you be trying to leave. What do you think you’re doing. You’re not a part of the team. All kind of mean shit” I stood there for 4 minutes and watched her put her drawer away and wipe down her station to appease her then she went to the bathroom so I left. I cried in the car because of how nasty she was. 

Tuesday and Wednesday were similar but just being rude about different things. Thursday she decided to take jobs away from me that I’ve been doing for three months. I order the branch money and do vault and teller reports and she said she’s taking them back because she wants them. She’s also having surgery in 3 weeks and will be gone from 3 weeks-3 months (unsure because of HIPPA) so essentially she’s taking shit away from me to spite me when I’ll be handed them back in 3 weeks. 

I don’t know what the fuck to do. She’s making my life hell. She’s awful to me and work sucks now even though I enjoy the day to day work. I’m afraid to even speak to my manger on Monday for her to make an excuse.

827,"I have an interview for a job in my hometown on Monday. As soon as I got the call and scheduled the interview I realized I can't leave my bf and friends and move back. But my mom won't stop talking about it and I know she is crazy hopeful about it.

We lost my dad to lung cancer this year and it has been a rough transition for everyone. My mom was a stay at home mom so at 61 she has been working for the first time since she was 23 years old. She is struggling financially. I was considering moving home to help out.

But, my hometown is SUPER isolated on the plains. I'm talking 2 hrs from the nearest walmart isolated. My parents were deeply religious and didn't allow me to have friends who didn't see the same way as them so I have no friends in town. I don't have many good memories here. I realized I'd be too lonely if I move and just couldn't survive it mentally. 

I live 7 hrs away and work a low wage job and I have a decent amount of people I can see from day to day and although I'm often super lonely it's not the same soul crushing scary isolation it is out here. It's hard to describe how depressing it is; it's like a constant scream.

 I feel like I have to follow through on the interview and I'm scared they're going to offer me some crazy amount I could never make where I live now and I'm going to have to tell my mom I'm not taking it. I don't want to hurt her feelings or disappoint her and I know that would do both. She is always begging the kids to move back and now I actually took a step towards it and I have to tell her I'm taking a step back.

There's no way to get her to move closer to any of us. We've tried. She grew up in this town, and her mother before her, and my great grandma before that on back to at least the 1850s. It's her ancestral home and I know she's never leaving. 

She's always struggled with mental health so we want to be sensitive during this time of loss. Her brother committed suicide at age 65 so I also want to bear in mind mental illness is real and deserves my respect even if she's technically out of the risk category it did happen with my uncle.

Best case scenario I just don't get an offer.

If I do get a job offer, how do I approach this with her? Pls help. I feel terrible I've put her in this situation at all.",26Dec2020,1
828,"So I work as a security guard for a tech company. Me and another guard guard the door and screen people for COVID. A third guy walks around and patrols the compound and sits behind a desk when there’s downtime. Me and this third guy are regulars at this post but the second door person is sometimes a rotating new employee. 

For whatever reason this third patrol guy is very interested in peoples relationship status and is always asking about it. I told him that I don’t have a gf when I first started working with him, and so now whenever there’s a new person watching the door with me he jokes about it. If it’s a guy employee he asks if the guy has sisters and jokes that I’m single and looking to mingle. If it’s a girl employee he asks if she has girlfriends and jokes that I’m single and looking to mingle. In both cases he asks them as a joke, and it is not a serious inquiry. At first I didn’t care too much bc I thought it would just be a one time thing. I even was cool with him in the beginning, I thought he was a friend and we even exchanged numbers, but I learned that he jokes about my being single and looking to mingle with almost every new employee that comes in. I started getting annoyed with it because I felt it made me look desperate like he was dissing me for being single. I texted him to stop doing it. He agreed to stop, but not 3-4 hours later he jokes about it again to the new girl. I texted him the next day saying that was very disrespectful as I already asked him not to do that. He tells me to “relax”, that it was a joke, that he “forgot” that I asked him to stop, but ultimately he says he is sorry and that he won’t do it anymore. This was early November and since then there have been no problems. However, within this last recent week he has blabbed his mouth again about my relationship status to two other employees. I was in disbelief that he would do this again after I already told him to stop twice and he agreed. It just seems like a direct violation of trust to continue doing it anyways and I feel my anger is justified. Am I overreacting? I really don’t want to be that guy who goes to HR to complain about people but I feel like he’s leaving me no choice. Asking him myself multiple times clearly didn’t do much. I plan to either tell HR about his consistent joking about my relationship status or talk to him again, but I kinda feel like he doesn’t deserve a third chance as I’ve already tried this route twice.",26Dec2020,1
829,"I took my GED test. The only subject I did horrible in was math. The writing was okay but I didn’t pass. The test is broken up to different subjects and my teacher said that I only have to re-do the math. 


I’ve been taking classes 4 days away for 4 hours. I take care of my disability mother and younger brother (cook, clean, Take my mother showers, buy groceries, take my mother to her doctors appointments and take my brother to his psychiatrist appointments) 

then I go to school from 4:00PM-8:00 PM at night. I’ve been attending classes for a year. I worked with different tutors but not everyone is understanding. I worked with tutors who was annoyed because I didn’t understand how to multiple and divide. the tutor was teaching me math and I didn’t understand. I worked with a total of 5 tutors in one year. 4 of them gave up on me. They no longer made the effort to try and help me: one tutor stood with me. After the pandemic she moved to another state but still willing to works with me from zoom (she doesn’t get paid. She does this free) The way she teaches me is easy and since school will be starting again next month I need all the help I can get with my math.

830,"because of covid I’m stuck at home for a while and my family has not been very kind to me since I’ve been back. Ive been struggling with a bit of a mental health crisis for a while and my family is whatever the opposite of supportive is. my mom gets angry at me when I show any negative emotions, and the few times I’ve had complete meltdowns (the kind where I’ve considered admitting myself to a hospital) at home she calls me attention seeking or makes a show of ignoring me. 

my sister has also struggled with mental health in the past, and they treat her so well. they check up on her always, make sure she has all the support she needs, and will drop everything for her if she’s anything but happy. I don’t blame my sister, but the difference in the way they treat me is night and day. They’re so nasty to me in my worst moments and it’s left me feeling completely unlovable my whole life. I’m a good kid mostly, I get good grades and do a lot of community service, but they treat me like they hate me. It breaks my heart seeing them treat her so kindly knowing my mom shouts at me every time I’m unhappy. does this happen to anyone else? how am I supposed to deal with this?",26Dec2020,1

832,"Some facts that I believe are/could be classed as relevant.

• Live and work in the UK in tier three areas and so does the other person.

• We are safe in terms of sexual health.

• First thing since my few years shy of a decade relationship ended (month or so before Covid was in the news).

• Both individuals work in supermarkets and are regularly following guidelines there. I have also been working for the supermarket since the start of the pandemic and they've been working for a couple of years at a different supermarket.

• My mental health has been on a fucking rollercoaster and this person is a positive source for me and I for them.

• We both have a household member who is meant to be shielding (they don't) and we keep are distance from them even before the FWB.

• It's only been going on for a little over a week.

• I'm on the spectrum and they have low ADHD (well at least they downplayed it).

• Everything is consensual.

• I have stronger romantic feelings for a coworker which is never going to happen but I still like this person (FWB) so navigating those emotions has been interesting.

I just wanna know what complete strangers think.

Like the household member (shielding) and a separate friends think it's great I'm happy and as long as I'm safe they are happy, but another household member is giving me the cold shoulder saying I'm putting them at risk. 
And my coworker (who knows about my crush on the coworker) thinks I should admit my feelings for the person at work.

So any thoughts and opinions on the matter would be greatly appreciated as my brain is a bit everywhere.

834,"Hi,

I am 17 and for a while, since the death of my first grandpa 6 years ago, I think about that a lot. It's like episodes for days/week where at least once per day it comes into my mind.

I don't fear dying, I just fear nothingness after death. I am not religious (not atheist, just like I don't know while I am alive so I will never know really), therefore I can't say there is something after death. Like, I know, live your life the fullest, yaddi yadda. However, I just feel like it kinda sucks that you live a not so long life, your last day are miserable and after, boom, nothing. Out of nowhere, you don't exist anymore (for yourself), nothing matters anymore. You don't rest, your consciousness just goes ""bye bye"". Every thing you felt and lived just, gone. What if you lived a good or a bad life, it doesn't matter and nothing, for ever, will matter anymore.

Same thing for the end of the universe, in the general. The universe is doomed and everything that exists and that ever existed will just disappear. Every thing ever built, gone. No legacy, nothing.

I know I shouldn't fear that since it's inevitable and everyone will go through death, but I just don't like the concept and I have a hard time accepting it. 

I just hate that I am not religious. Like, if I was Christian, believed that I would meet God, I wouldn't fear that. I would be convinced that I would live an eternal life after my death, unlimited happiness forever. Even if there is nothing, I will be dead so I would not be disappointed. 

I know I won't know I am dead, just know that I am dying.

Every time I think about that (mainly trigerred by posts/video ""people who died, what did you see blablabla"" and some articles that talk about the universe), I just get a crushing feeling, a downward spiral to panic and sadness. I want to overcome this, I get to stop thinking about it for weeks/months, but it comes back eventually. 

Is it normal or should I see like a specialist to help me understand these feelings?",26Dec2020,1

837,"I’ve always hated cooking. I’m 22 years old and my parents are constantly berating me for not being a better cook. I definitely won’t starve if I’m by myself and can cook basic things like rice or beans, make quesadillas and sandwiches, the like. But I’m too scared to do anything more complicated than that because any time I try and it doesn’t turn out good my dad will tell me I’m stupid or that I can’t do anything right. He’s always been that way and even talks to my mom that way when he doesn’t like what she’s made. I’ve noticed that I get extreme anxiety about what other people think of my food and feel extremely uncomfortable cooking for my boyfriend, for example, because of it.

We never really chatted with him before or after their relationship so it was kinda weird when one time he sent me a meme and the other time asked me to join a Facebook group.My friend doesn't talk to him anymore, because after they broke up he started stalking and spamming her.

839,"So.. this might be a long one. If it is, I'm sorry. Also sorry for being on mobile, so format will suck. 

Right.. going back to give some info. My parents split in 2015 after being married for 25 years, a few months after my dad moved out I(23) saw a text my mum(55) had sent to some bloke about how much she loved him and how great their relationship was. This happened after my dad had left, no affairs here. She moved on from this guy in a few months and dated another guy who turned out to be a little psycho. We had to get the police involved as he started stalking her. We moved and settled close to one of my mum's oldest friend's and also the oldest friend's crush. 

Some bad things then happened. We'll call old friend A and old friend's crush B(50). A slept with B and then was left on her own, B had told her from the start he wanted nothing serious. B and mum started talking to each other. A and mum got in a fight about mum's friendship with B. It was messy. They're no longer friends. Many people think B manipulated the situation to split up the friendship. 

B has done some weird things such as calling my mother and turning up to the house unannounced A LOT. He also drunkenly yelled at my sister(26) and appeared violent. (Note: my sister is high-functioning autistic and may have misread this.) Since then B has not been allowed in the house when sister is there due to her feeling uncomfortable. Sometimes he comes anyway. He has also frequently turned up on the doorstep immediately after sister has left in her car which freaked us all out and made us felt like he was being watched. B often comes over under pretence of doing housework (he's a handyman and does help a lot) but then stays. He also turns up for a cuppa without being asked frequently. 

I've seen my mother and B holding hands/hugging/etc however mum denies any relationship. At one point I asked them both whilst they were in the same room, B said they were and mother said they weren't and was angry at B for manipulating me by saying they were. Mother repeatedly says B pressures her to be in a relationship, refuses to answer his calls, and tells us to tell him she's unavailable when he comes round. This makes me think she really doesn't want to see him. She also claims to need him to do handyman jobs as we have no money to call a professional to come and fix things if/when they break, which is true. 

Tonight B's son came round looking upset and wanted to talk to my mum. This was because he was upset at the way his father had been treated by her. I texted B to ask what was up, he said mother won't talk to him, they need a talk etc. Culminated in him proving my mother had told him she loved him, wanted to buy a house together, told him they were soulmates. Mother denied this until I showed screenshots. 

She has done this before and has lied about more relationships with guys than I can count. We've had so many discussions where I've told her to not lie, but she still does. She's still very cut up over my dad (who is now in a relationship with his PA and insists he cheated. I don't think he did) so I'm not surprised if she doesn't know what she wants. She insists she's scared of being alone and hasn't got a clue what she wants. The thing is the screenshots of messages B sent me of my mum proclaiming her love are almost identical to ones I accidentally found with previous men. She often claims she will end up alone but has one guy repeatedly sending her flowers asking to be together, B who I think she's stringing along, and others who she's been on dates with. Honestly, I'm at a loss. I'm so sick of having to behave like a therapist and try to parent my own mother. 

I'm so sorry for that wall of text, but I'd love any advice. I'm currently living with my mother as I finished my master's a few months ago and couldn't get a job. I plan to move away as soon as possible, but I do feel guilty about leaving her on her own. Please help.

TL;DR Mother keeps lying about relationships with men, I don't know what to do anymore.",26Dec2020,1
840,"After a year of missing my family and seeing other people I know visit their relatives safely, I decided to book a trip home before the holidays. The morning I departed for my trip (from LA to NY), my roommate started exhibiting cold-like symptoms (congestion but no coughing or fever). A couple days later, she went for a test and after several days without news, finally got a positive result. Meanwhile, I was in NY and doing my best to stay isolated from family while her results were still uncertain. There was one night that I did engage with family members after some pressure from them to stop worrying so much. But my worries were validated when her test results came in, revealing that she did have COVID. The amount of shame, guilt and overall stupidity I felt for letting my guard down is indescribable. I rushed back into quarantine and was fortunate to get a negative result from two separate tests a few days later.  
 

Despite feeling underlying anger due to my roommate's nonchalant attitude throughout the pandemic (her colorful dating life, the weekly family gatherings, poor hand hygiene, etc.), I made sure to check in on her all the time. I offered her some of my supplements, asked about her symptoms and encouraged her to reach out anytime. Once back from my trip, I dropped off wine and coffee as a gift. I felt bad she was in isolation and even a bit guilty for not being ready to return home. I chose to wait until her symptoms had subsided for 10 days before going back. This meant staying in a friend's renovated garage on a futon for a week, all while trying to work remotely. My life felt completely out of control for weeks but I was doing my best to hold it together.  
 

When I got home, I set to sanitizing every utensil, bowl, cup in the kitchen for my own peace of mind. As I separated the various pieces of cutlery and dinnerware on the counter, my roommate made a comment: “I can’t help but notice that all your ‘cleaning’ is making the kitchen look messier.” It was meant to be a joke, but we all know those passive aggressive joke/comments very well and under the extremely stressful situation I have just described, it did not hit me as a joke at all. I exploded.  
 

I finally said everything that was weighing on me back in NY: (1) Why weren’t you more careful? (2) How do you expect to stay safe when the guy you’re seeing has four roommates? (3) Why can’t you be honest about your comings and goings? (3) Why do you say you’re staying with your sister when you are actually staying at this guy’s house? (4) Why didn’t you apologize for putting me through all the stress I endured when I got to NY? (5) Why did you think you could “manifest” good health during a global pandemic rather than basing yourself in reality?  
 

It got ugly. It did not go as planned. I am not a great communicator. Now I don't really know what to do. I was brutal to her and realize some type of apology is in order, but I'm still upset about her behavior and disregard of what I went through, too.",26Dec2020,1
