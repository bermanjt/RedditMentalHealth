0,"A company, Tessuti, messed up my order by giving me the wrong item, so I started a return. Tessuti told me that because my return was international, I had to ipay initial shipping charges, but was promised that I’d be reimbursed for the shipping charges along with a refund for the item once the package was received. So I shipped the return through UPS. It cost $200. A couple of days later UPS tells me customs needs to contact Tessuti in order to clear the package; Tessuti never responded to UPS or customs, and eventually UPS sent the package back to me. Now Tessuti Is telling me they will not cover shipping charges for an unsuccessful delivery, only a successful delivery. Not only this, but since Tessuti was and is unwilling to clear the package, I have no way of returning the return. Meaning I won’t get a refund, and I’m out $200 for an unsuccessful shipment. Am I just out $200? I doubt I can sue as legally they’ve done nothing wrong. How should I deal with this",25Jul2020,1
2,"My high school's population is half hispanic lower class kids and half upper middle class white kids. You barely ever see people of different ethnic backgrounds hanging out together, so sometimes it feels like two schools in one. I'm Armenian and German, my parents are well off so I've lived the 'stereotypical privileged white life', but people often mistake me for hispanic because of my tan skin. I only had one friend named Izzie in my PE class last year who was white, so I'd join her team (which consisted of mostly white girls) because she was the only person I knew. However, there was this hispanic girl who'd tell our coach I was on her team (consisted of mostly hispanic girls) even if I never asked to be and obviously didn't want to. One day I joined Izzies team, but our teams were uneven so my PE teacher (a white woman) told us to just separate into teams of white people and people of color. Some girls laughed but I was obviously uncomfortable moving to the 'hispanic team' where I didn't have any friends. The lack of diverse friendships in my school has always bothered me. I'm not proud to say that sometimes I even found myself subconsciously pushing away hispanic people who'd want to be my friend in order to prove a point or something. Again, I'm not proud of that and I haven't cared about the ethnicity of my friends in the past, but as of now, all my friends are white except for one. 

Was my PE teacher racist? And is there anything I can do to make my school seem less separated?",25Jul2020,1
3,"I (21) have a friend who we’ll call C (17), and his ex, J (also 17). She’s not technically his ex, but they had something going and then they had a falling out. I’ve been helping C keep his head above water, as he’s taken this pretty hard. Especially the fact the she’s blocked him. He was really worried about her mental health, so, against a bit of my better judgment, I did go and track her down on insta just to make sure she was alive, though I drew the line and didn’t send her a friend request. 
Last night, C brings up that he’s come up with the idea of creating a fake snap so he can still talk to her. I spent most of this morning trying to talk him out of it. I even posted on this sub for what I should say. 
From the way that conversation ended, it sounded like I hade broke through to him, even if it was just a little. BUT, a few minutes ago, I get a message from C telling me he’s decided to go through with creating a new snap. 
I really don’t agree with what he’s planning to do, but I’m not ready to give up on him as a friend yet because he’s acting out of grief. I know that, if it comes to it, I’ll snitch on him to J, even if end up blocking me because of it. But I know there’s *gotta be* options before I do that, right?

I’ve always wished I was born a boy I would fantasise about it a lot but I just would say “oh well” and leave it at that but there’s always been a huge part of me that just wished so so so much I was born a boy.
I get along with boys so so much better and not in a flirty way at all in like a “one if the guys” kinda way and I love that 
As a kid I’d wear boys clothes and only want boys toys for presents 
I’ve only dated men but I have a strong attraction to other women more so than men, but I don’t really identify with being bi I just don’t feel like it really fits. 
Lately a lot had been going on that is making me scared that I’ll always feel lost and that this feeling will only get worse.

9,"I've been talking to this girl and I really kind of like her, either as a platonic or love interest relationship, I don't really care either way to be honest.

However, back about like 1 - 2 years ago I was a totally different person, I was very conservative in my views, rude and mean, and also slightly misogynistic. This was back in my teen years where my school used to be all boys, and I didn't really speak to much girls then.

Well, I sent quite mean messages ages ago , don't know why, where it was either me being a dick or just slightly politically annoying to people. Let's just say I kind of pissed these people off, and they happen to be quite good friends with this girl I like now, so it's a bit worrisome.

I'm not trying to excuse for what I did, I actually genuinely regret some of the stuff I did, and I do worry about it in a way. I was just different back then and wanted to change. I did apologise later to one of them, but I'm slightly worried that there may be still a bad taste in their mouth.

What should I do?

11,"Hi everyone reading this, I (14M) am stuck in a situation where my entire family is really homophobic and my mental health is really declining, its kind of a long story but I just dont really understand it and idk what I should do.

tl;dr at the bottom

So basically, im the youngest of 4 kids. im the only lgbt person in my family and both my parents and siblings are extremely conservative/chrisitan/homophobic. My parents are kind of abusive as well but its hard to explain and idk if its enought to get me out of my situation.

To start off, there was some physical abuse, especially when i was younger. My dad used to hit me a lot, throw things at me, push me onto the floor, slap me, and he even made my nose bleed on accident once but i had a lot of nose bleeds as a small kid and it was likely a result of my body being the way it was AND him hitting me. each time, it was all because of a really small reason (me not cleaning my room fast enough, leaving dishes out, etc.) or sometimes even no reason at all but it would usually be less severe when there was no reason. It was kind of a rare thing, but it still got to the point where I was scared of my father and couldnt go anywhere alone with him cause i was too scared that he would start yelling at me and possibly hit me.

It all ended when i accidentally broke a light in 7th grade and i had to go tell him, i was literally shaking with fear and when he got mad and started yelling, i kept flinching and almost started crying and i think he realized that I was scared of him and he never purposely hit me again, but he still yells just as much, if not more, and its seriously so hard to deal with. I even told a friend from school at one point and she told me to call the police but I didnt want to cause I didnt think it would be enough for them to do anything and i had no evidence. However, while my dad became less physically abusive, i had incedents with my mother as well.

Last Christmas Eve, i had got into a small argument with my mother and she had been screaming at me like usual and i raised my voice at her so she started hitting me, right there in front of my entire family. She tore out some of my hair, scratched my face and arms and made me bleed, and she knocked me onto the ground and tried to hit me even more but my dad and oldest brother pulled her off and she was cussing at me. This time, since I was older and had been through enough of my parents bullshit, i had fought back but only defensively to try to get her off of me up until she knocked me over. she went upstairs with my dad and oldest brother while my second oldest brother took me outside to yell at me at how my mom is a women and that im not a real man for arguing with her and that it was my fault she had started hitting me. I then had to go apologize to my dad who was mad at me for 'hitting his wife' while I literally had blood coming out of a scratch on my face. Then I had to go upstairs to my moms room and apologize to her and she cleaned up the blood and gave me a half ass apology and told me to never tell anyone because 'its only our business' apparently. Naturally, I told all of my friends but they didnt really know what to say other than my family is shitty.

The worst of all is my older sister. She is 5 years older than me, while my brothers are 8 and 10 years older than me. i dont remember all the details and i dont want to even think about it or talk about it too much but when I was really young, (i think i was 6 or 7 and in 2nd grade), she asked me to play a game with her when my parents were away which basically ended up in her manipulating me into doing something sexual which i didnt understand because my parents had never bothered to explain it to me. i thought it was just a game but i told her that i didnt like it and then she would tell me 'good' as if i was the one who initiated it. she was in 7th grade at the time and i know she knew what she was doing. i still have problems because of that today, and i cant look at girls the same as i used to and i still live with her. ive tried to confront her about it and threaten to tell my parents but im too scared to even talk about it and i think my parents wont believe me. she acts like it never happened and i cant ever forgive her for what she's done.

This entire time, I haven't been too therapy even once. I want to really bad but I don't trust anyone in my family at all and I can't let them know everything about me.

My entire family is extremely homophobic, even my dad said that if one of his children were gay, he would kick them out if they 'act on their urges'. He's already tried to disown my oldest brother for cheating on his wife and living with my grandparents, smoking weed, etc. and i know he'll do the same to me.

I just want away to get out of this situation. I only have 1 best friend right now. Her parents are homophobic, religious, and conservative as well but they literally give her alcohol and have no problem with her drinking or smoking even though she's only 15. I have absolutely nowhere to go and no one to trust other than my best friend, but because of COVID-19, her parents couldnt afford to pay rent and they now have to move really far away so they can be closer to her father's job.

I don't know what to do. I could tell some type of authority figure, but i think it would only make things harder for me as i literally dont know who else i would possibly live with other than my grandparents and oldest brother. My extended family all live far away and we arent very close with them. I have cousins who live in the same city as me, but we had family drama a couple years ago and my mom and my aunt havent talked to each other in years but they have recently reconnected and we even went so see them once to celebrate my oldest cousins graduation but we only briefly met because of coronavirus and it was still really awkward since it was the first time we had all seen each other in years.

I only slightly trust my second oldest brother (the one who said that i'm not a real man) because despite him saying that to me, him and his wife are really nice and i think they would possibly understand my situation even though theyre both homophobic/religious but they're both in the Marines and they wouldnt be able to be there to live with me because of their job.

My parents also volunteer at a church two times a week that im forced to attend where they talk about a lot of really sensitive topics for me, they even had a teaching where they said that all LGBT people are pedophiles and a whole bunch of other horrible stuff.

I literally dont know what to do, i feel like im living in hell. despite everything ive talked about, my family still acts perfectly normal like absolutely nothing is wrong, meanwhile i feel like im literally going insane.

I want to leave my house and never talk to my family again but ill have to sacrifice so much in order to do that and i have no idea what will happen to me. They all act like everything is perfectly fine tho so i guess i jsut have to pretend it is too.

tl:dr my family is every type of abusive, i basically have nobody i trust, my life is literal hell, i dont know if ill even be better off if i tell someone who can help, i desperately need therapy but i dont want my fmaily to find out.

13,"My mom is in her mid 40s and I'm really worried that I'm going to lose her soon, way sooner than anyone should die. She has been smoking for her whole life, and she recently started smoking weed. Back in 2017 my mom got pneumonia that lead to a really bad lung infection that put her in the ICU with a 50/50 shot of living. We were devastated, but when she came out of a 2 week medically induced coma the doctor told her that smoking did not directly cause the problem which allowed her to start smoking again after about 2 month after she was released from the hospital. She also has incredibly bad sleeping problems where she goes days without sleep because she has to have another cigarette. This has gotten so bad to the point that my family and I have walked in on her sleeping standing, on the toilet, leaned over the kitchen counter, and more. She has also told us that many times she has drove to work and when she got there she didn't remember any of her drive becasue she fell asleep. Recently she has also started to not eat regularly. She has dropped probably around 30 pounds during quarantine because she barely eats. It's been really hard not to just give up and stop caring because it seems like she just doesn't care about herself and just lets herself go. I don't know what to do or say at this point to help her get better, she has tried nicorette gum, nicotine patches, vaping, and quiting cold turkey but none of it has worked. Does anyone have any advice on how to go about helping her?

PS: My mom has had multiple neck surgeries and a knee replacement so her body is not where it's supposed to be at the mid forties. She could easily qualify for medical retirement but both her and my dad dont seem to want to go forward with that option though it's easily the smartest move to start helping her get better.",25Jul2020,1
14,"Sorry for the novel; history is important in the story.
Ann has been a friend of my husband Jay &amp; me for 10 years. We became friends w/ her now husband Jon at our wedding. Jay was a groomsman in their wedding &amp; we became friends w/ another groomsmen Bob &amp; his wife Sue. We got so close we had a group text that went on for nearly 5 years. A few months ago Bob seemed to act negative toward Jay but we didn't want to make assumptions. Group texts continued until the March &amp; then they fizzled out.
In March I noticed Bob got distant &amp; unfollowed Jay &amp; me on Twitter. I asked him why &amp; if something's wrong. Said he's dealing w/ a lot, needs some space &amp; it wasn't personal.
In April, Sue said in group text they've been dealing w/ some stuff &amp; need space. Jay &amp; I offer support. At that point I tell Ann privately that I owed Bob an apology for the Twitter issue &amp; she said to wait a bit. Jay's bday came, no one in the group acknowledged it. Jay was sad but let it go.
In May I apologized to Bob for my reactions in March. He thanked me for the apology &amp; wished me &amp; the kids well but didn't mention Jay. Tried not to overthink it. Bob started having friendly text conversations w/ me for a couple weeks &amp; I was hopeful it meant things were improving.
In early June I sent 1st group text in a while &amp; seemed to be a pleasant conversation. 3 days later Sue &amp; Bob unfriended me &amp; Jay on FB/IG w/ no reason. Jay asked Jon if he knew what's going on, said he didn't know anything.
July - my bday comes, no one in the group acknowledges it. The day after my bday Ann unfriends Jay &amp; my sister on FB/IG. Ann hasn't interacted w/ me via text/FB/IG AT ALL since early June which is really unlike her &amp; she's been active on social media w/ others. Jay sends a group text asking what's going on &amp; Bob responds accusing Jay of calling him names at my bday party in 2019. Jay sees Bob like family so that would make no sense for Jay to insult him. Turns out Bob misheard a conversation &amp; just assumed Jay was calling him names. So for a year he's held a grudge against Jay over an assumption &amp; never said anything. Bob also mentioned Sue thinks I attacked her via a FB post in response to her FB post. None of my posts were about her, some were just my own feelings on public issues. Basically they ended a 5+ year friendship over assumptions &amp; never tried to talk to us about it. At this point Ann steps in on the group text &amp; says she's on vacation &amp; is busy (she unfriended Jay &amp; my sister while on said vacation). She says the timing w/ my bday was pure coincidence (we've been friends for 10 years &amp; she knows when my bday is). She asserts she has her reasons for what she did &amp; ""will talk about it when &amp; if she's ready"".
We're in our 40s &amp; this feels like petty high school BS. I'm not sure if I even want to mend the friendships at this point &amp; instead feel like telling them to go F*** themselves.",25Jul2020,1
15,"Hello. I will try to keep this as short as possible. 
All of my life I have felt a bit off. Low self esteem started as early as my memories started to form, I have always been overly-obedient, overly-nice, a people-pleaser...I change my personality depending on who I am with and what I think they want to see/hear. I almost never feel genuine. My feelings get hurt so easily, almost over nothing, which leads me to avoid confrontation in all forms and fix situations before they can even go bad...if that makes sense. When interacting with others my thoughts are nothing but a jumble of constant analyzation of myself and who I am taking to, to the point of it being so exhausting that I LOATHE interacting with anyone besides my spouse and very close family. By loathe I mean full on panic attacks at the thought of it. I have never had a friendship where I truly enjoyed the persons company, I would always rather be alone. I feel I am too self-aware, yet simultaneously know nothing about who I really am...if that makes sense. With all that being said, I do feel empathy towards others and can feel the pain of both humans and animals, so I don’t think I am a sociopath, but I really don’t know. I have just never, ever truly fit in with any type of group/people/etc. Hell, I don’t even feel like I fit in with a gender! Has anyone else experienced anything similar?

It makes me look at him different and I hate it. I started therapy and it dropped the veil about how what is happening isn’t normal. I’ve taken it upon myself to brake up there fights since they listen to me. I feel like a parent parenting two kids.

24,"Asshole apartment managers and what to do?

Okay so I don’t know what to do and I’m at a loss for words

I’ve lived in my apartment complex for four years it’s me my wife and two kids we started off in a one bedroom apartment and this past year moved into a three bedroom apartment I thought everything was amazing considering we didn’t have to pay to pack up all our stuff 

Anyway 

When we moved into three bedroom apartment complex we let the office people know we smoke marijuana ( yes it’s illegal in our state but my wife is a veteran and she uses it medicinally) they told us it didn’t matter to them we do what we want in our apartment. 

Okay now it’s been over six months that we’ve lived in the three bedroom apartment now this apartment is directly on top of the leasing office and since we’ve moved in we’ve had nothing but problems with the people at the office they told us the office smelled like weed and we couldn’t be smoking so we stopped smoking in our apartment. 

Our building caught on fire and one of the walls when up in flames it was due to electrical issues it had nothing to do with my building it was the office side that was severely damaged but the whole building was unlivable due to the fire damage as this was happening our apartment office didn’t want to help us out they told me they would give me an empty unit and to take sleeping bags to sleep in the empty unit as the building gets repaired, they first told me they’d put us up in a hotel room to fit the accommodation of my apartment and then went back and told me to sleep on the floor of another empty apartment because they weren’t going to pay for a hotel room, I was enraged I’m the only tenant in the building, the moment I tried to say anything about accommodations they asked me to terminate my lease if I didn’t want to take the empty unit.

After this they tried to give me a leasing violation for dog poop in front of the office they had no proof that my dog had pooped (I always pick up after my dog she’s a husky with huge poop) but they told me if I didn’t pick it up they would keep the violation on my record. 
They also tried to get rid of my dog and cat 
They gave me another violation for my dog and cat even tho they are ptsd animals for my veteran wife. And yes we have papers for both animals 

Now I feel like I walk on eggshells in my own home just the other day I was smoking in my car because I can’t smoke in my house and they called the cops on me, the cops said it was a waste of time for them to come out that they weren’t going to be arresting people for smoking weed 

All I want to do is leave these apartment ASAP 
But when I presented this to the office she hit me with an early real ease of contract witch I was fine with till I read the description on why

On the paper she put that the contract will be terminated if they find me smoking in or out of my apartment and if they find any animal poop in front of office, I’m just wondering can they do that would it be defamation of character ???

Hi, 
i’m 16 a girl and from the United Kingdom. I’m going into collage soon and i’m dead scared. I’m not in the correct headspace and really all i’m scared about is social life and not the actual studies or anything haven’t gave it a minutes thought. 

So since “high school” i’ve had the worst social life i started out with no friends and now i have a few but really their nothing like me. I have such a different personality and alter ego if you will ( sorry if i used that word wrong haha). But yeah it’s just my last resort really to be with them as no one else will. 

I have the “deadest” by that i don’t mean cool but actually dead, social life online. I have a snap which i legit only used for pictures but i don’t have streaks on it or whatever as people have their phones blown up by snapchat i don’t, the thought that in collage you could be on my phone weirdly scares me because everyone will have people to message etc and i wouldn’t so that’s scary on its own. 

Then i’m a bit of a wierdo and very awkward it’s lessened with age but when i was in elementary/primary i was and i would just be wierd and in my own element and i go to a girls school and i used to be absolutely bullied by boys in my elementary school the thought of them possibly coming to my collage rattles me.

Not so long ago, they asked me if I would like if we met each other in real life. Surprised, I awkwardly changed the topic because I really disliked the thought of it. I think there might be 2 major reasons for this: 


1) They would quickly get bored of me. We usually talk about our respective lives/feelings/center of interests and we share videos/art. The thing is, we don't really share any of those interests. On top of that, they seem to be a really energetic/hysterical person and I am the exact opposite of that, being a total introvert. 


2) I am scared of revealing my identity to someone in general even if he showed me his, I probably still wouldn't want to show myself.

Im a 21 year old female and I hate myself recently, I had a friend tell me they were going to commit suicide and the signs were all there and I didn’t doubt they would attempt. I still didn’t try to help them or even tell anyone else and I just let it happen.

I’m the most two faced person I know, if someone tells me something and begs me not to tell anyone? Straight away I tell my close friends. I just talk crap about the people I’m supposed to care for.

My mum is currently in an abusive relationship and I can tell all she wants is to talk to me sometimes as an escape but I cut her off? Everyone time she tries to tell me something I just reply “oh” over and over again until she stops talking, or I will put my headphones in so she stops.

I’ve done so much more horrible things and I really don’t think I’m going to change. The only time i ever feel like a decent person is when I’m around a close friend off mine. She’s the only person I have never hurt intentionally or spoke bad about.

I don’t know what to do, it’s only recently when so many people I know have cut me off that I’ve reflected on myself and seen what I really am like.

How do I even start to change? I don’t even know if I want to change",25Jul2020,1

I opened the window for fresh air, had music playing in the background, tried to get a drink and a little food, walked around for a bit and tried to make up silly scenarios. Nothing is working. 

Any tips on what else I can do? I usually go for a walk but I can’t tonight",25Jul2020,1

33,"Hi, this might not really be the place to post this, but I find this sub rather nurturing to people’s different situations. I’m a student pilot and haven’t flown since March. I love what I do, and right before everything started happening, I was up for a long solo cross country flight. One solo flight away from getting my private pilot’s license. Our school’s flight program is great, only problem is we aren’t a towered airspace and have so many people flying at once without any control tower to control all of us. We have to trust eachother with our radio calls stating our positions and continuously scan for aircraft in the sky. It can be terrifying, especially flying alone, to watch out for all us inexperienced pilots flying around at the same time, in close proximity. With most of us not flying for awhile, I’m nervous coming this August to get back in the skies again and go up for my 4 1/2 hour solo flight. Myself included, I hope I do the best I can coming back, but I’m more afraid of other people putting me and the aircraft I’m flying at risk. It’s like defensive driving, watching out for other drivers is the most riskiest part. I just have a lot of nerves. Anyone in here can relate to this post?",25Jul2020,1
34,"Yesterday evening our neighbour(19yo) invited me(17yo) and my brother(19yo) to come play video games since we are good friends with him. Anyways 2 or 3 hours later our neighbour decides to get us some food and he leaves, that's when his sister came home from work (22yo). We say hi to her she says hi to us everything is normal, she sits down to talk to us for a couple of minutes then she goes to the washroom. This is where everything went wrong my brother followed her into the washroom I then followed him to see what was going on, he had pushed her into the bathtub and was trying to get her against the bathtub floor and trying to get on top of her. When he undresses her and starts pulling his pants down I try to pull him off of her but he just pushes me to the ground and I just sat there and watched in disbelief that he could do something like this. I left after awhile I dont know how long he wasnt done yet but I just ran home and passed out in my room. I dont know what happened after last night but I haven't left my room all day I'm scared that I can get in trouble too. My brother has been acting like nothing has even happened and even asked me this morning ""why didnt you take your turn"". I'm so scared right now I have no idea what to do. I dont want to ruin his life by telling the police what happened, but if I do tell them can I get in trouble too? I don't want to get in trouble for something I didnt do, and I am having a hard time believing if he actually did this or if it was just a nightmare. What should I do right now? I haven't left my room all day someone please tell me what is the best thing to do at the moment.",25Jul2020,0
37,"Please forgive me, as I am on mobile. Also, this is pretty long, so I’m sorry about that as well.

I need some advice because I really don’t know what to do. My mom and I have been gaslit by my dad for as long as I can remember. He is emotionally and psychologically abusive, and has only gotten worse since 2016. My mother and I are liberal, while he is an extreme right-wing conservative. He called himself a white supremacist and is openly racist while denying that I am, in fact, biracial (I was adopted, but I only recently found out I was biracial because I am white-appearing).

Back when my mom first met my dad, he was apparently all right. Then, when they moved closer to his family, he made her quit and be a stay-at-home wife. Every Sunday, he would encourage his family to sit down with my mom and lecture her for hours about their cultish religion and how she was going to hell for having a degree in Organ. She stopped playing organ and piano for YEARS, but dad eventually let her get a job. Mom ended up being pretty successful and even started her own magazine and gift basket company. My dad, however, had to butt in (his degree is in history or education or whatever) and became CFO. It was around this time that they adopted me

For the first ten years of my life, he was an OK dad. He tended to hide behind newspapers and hole up in his office, but he played catch with me and made me laugh and played with me sometimes, so I guess it was fine.

Then, there was kind of a gradual change. As I got older, his dad humour did not evolve. He kind of became patronising and dismissive of my interests. He often talked to me like a small child. He sometimes would even get me to turn against my mom. I remember one time she did something that annoyed me, so my dad decided to take me to Disney World (we went often as a family) and, quite cruelly, had me rub it in my mom’s face that she was not invited. I remember as my dad and I loaded up in the car, I was snickering how it was just dad and me, and I looked back at my mom. She had the most defeated and sad expression on her face. That event changed me, and I literally remember deciding to never do something like that to her again, because she was my mom and I loved her.

In high school, it got worse. I developed depression and anxiety and had frequent panic attacks, which my dad routinely told me to “get over” and “stop acting up.” To this day, I still don’t think he thinks I have mental illnesses.

He was very hateful during high school, as I was beginning to question my school’s religious teachings. He still talked to me like I was a small child, and he started doing other passive aggressive things, such as being incredibly loud, not doing things around the house, and just not thinking about me and my mom in the long run. When we took a road trip through Canada, he made me cry several times during the trip deliberately. I’ve blocked out what he said, but it was bitingly sarcastic.

When I got into college, I had a lot of health issues, so my parents moved to my college town to help out, but kept our original home. Every now and again, one of them would go to the house and one would stay. One night when my mom was away, I tried to call her and couldn’t reach her. It wasn’t odd, but after several more times, it started to become strange that she wouldn’t answer. I was starting to have a full blown panic attack and was pretty much dissociated with reality. I was hysterical, but my dad watched and did nothing. At this point, I was becoming self-destructive. I was begging him to call the hotel that my mom was staying at and send someone to her room to check on her. I then took a pair of scissors and threatened to hurt myself. My dad looked at me with an expression that said, “Do it.” I broke and began to stab my hand. I passed out and I could hear him yelling at me to get up and get ahold of myself. I had the clarity to demand that he take me to the hospital as my panic attack was continuing and I knew I might hurt myself further. When we got to the hospital, we were finally able to get ahold of my mom. She came straight back. A few days later, I discovered that he knew the entire time where my mom was: she was at a movie theatre watching a movie and had silenced her cell phone. He could have stopped my panic attack by telling me where she was, but he didn’t.

On a different note, he has installed cameras and spyware all over the house and in my mom’s car. Back when she had her company, my dad would listen in on her calls. He put a GPS tracker on her car without telling her, and has even put spyware on her computer. We think he bugged my mom’s car, because one day we were talking about how it’s funny when he yawns, and when we got home he automatically fixed how he yawned. Every now and then, my mom will find random cameras pointed at our cars or in the house in secretive places. Recently, he’s taken to monitoring everyone’s mail and finding our friends on Facebook (whom he doesn’t know) and friending them.

In terms of gaslighting, he is absolutely charming and talkative to everyone we meet, and they all say how wonderful a dad/husband he is. Then, when we get home, he doesn’t speak to us. When he does, it’s either infantilising or sarcastic.

My mom had cancer several years back, and my dad cancelled her insurance and put her on Obamacare right when everything was being pulled back and the policies were basically for catastrophes and not long-term care. He has implied that, if mom dies (unlikely as she’s in remission), that he will force me to cook and clean for him (which my mom already does). He controls our finances, and my mom has told me that she needs to amend her will, because currently, my dad would control my inheritance. She has hinted that if I do something like come out as gay or something just as drastic, he will cut me out of the will. He has very little empathy for anyone, including us.

He is an ever-looming presence who has caused my anxiety to worsen over the past four years and I have had many more panic attacks when I can’t find my mom. It’s because I don’t want to be left alone with him and I wouldn’t have anyone in the world (I have no immediate family or siblings who are close). My mom and I see no end in sight, and I understand her hesitancy to leave him because he is in his 70s and most likely has dementia. Due to my mental and physical problems, it is not advisable for me to live on my own, and I will probably need to be dependent for the foreseeable future. Whenever my mom and I talk about future plans like moving to the UK, we never mention him but we know that we will have to acknowledge him in our future.

Please, help. We don’t know what to do and we don’t know how to get out. My mom and I are both bleeding hearts, but we also know that, on top of everything I have mentioned previously, there are other psychological abuses that we have suffered and will continue to suffer.

If anything is not clear, please ask and I’ll try to clear anything up. I’m sorry this is all over the place, but I needed to get this off my chest.

Tl;dr My adoptive dad is psychologically and emotionally abusive to me and my mom and we just need some advice.",25Jul2020,1

Last night it was my best-friend's birthday. We went to a bar/club with my friends (as all women in 40s). I am a divorced woman by the way,with a 18 year old son i live with. We had already started drinking before we went to the bar and kept drinking there too. I was really drunk later in the night and a moment when i split up from from my friends, i hooked up with a bearded young man who approached me. Soon after,we started making out and his hands were all over me. It was intense. I swear to god he looked pretty older than his age. I thought he was at least 24-25,but unfortunately didn't even ask him.

As i woke up,i received a message from a number. I don't even remember giving him my number. Of course,it was him. We started talking and soon after i asked him how old he is. He said he is 19. I was like OMG. I have felt like shit the whole day. I feel terrible. How can get over it?",25Jul2020,2

42,"Ok so first off I have never gotten a phone on my own before so I will fully admit to being an idiot in this area. I know nothing about in’s and outs, if it’s just moving a plan over to a new phone or there are hidden costs and I don’t fully trust contacting customer services because they are more than likely just going to push for me to get a new one. So seeking answers elsewhere before I make a choice, I can’t switch from Apple currently and it’s an IPhone 7

A few months ago my phone started to act up, home button not work and other small glitches but I could still get it to do the majority of what it needed to so no big deal. Plus it was a hectic time never got the chance to bring it into a shore. Well now it’s gone farther to the point I can’t take or make calls, plus the pervious problems and already got caught in an emergency without it. That made it clear I need to get this taken care of but I’m not sure the right choice. 

Stores are still closed so I can’t just take it by to get fixed. I was planning on sending it in but began to notice the cost to repair were only a few hundred dollars off the new ones ($300+ for repair vs $500+ for new) which seems like a potential better choice long term if this is just going to keep happening.

47,"I've been seeing a girl long-distance for a while, we usually communicate online through texts and video chat, and we connect really well and have lots of the same interests, however there seems to be a bit of mystery around the I love you words.

Now we both have our own issues, she's expressed to me that she's very emotionally closed off due to her childhood so the fact she even does express warmth to me is a really big thing for her because she doesn't do it with a lot of people. Though its like I never explicitly *know* because she's never said it? the first time I told her those words, she responded with something along the lines of ""I just want you to know I'm not ignoring it, it makes me feel adored, I just don't know how to respond"" I'm recalling from my memory so it's almost completely accurate.

I guess it makes me wonder, one time I said to her over text in a playful tone to her teasing me that ""its because you love me"" and she left me on read for a couple hours, like we talking moments before that and then after I said the message she didn't respond and basically acted weird after and also one time texted in a different convo she didn't love me but right after said it was autocorrect so that so awkward considering the mystery around those words.

I will say though her actions say otherwise, as in she does care for me a lot and tries so much for me. So should that be enough? am I selfish for still wanting to verbally hear those words? I'm a words of reaffirmation type of person. I need reassurance, its a big thing for me, not that I want it to be forced of course.

55,"I honestly cant think of a title to explain my feelings. 
And i need help. 
Im going to start with the backstory. And im on mobile so please forgive errors. Also I have exactly what I have seen and heard so forgive bias.
10 years ago my dad married my stepmother, who became a mother to me. 2 years ago, she died from illness. A week later my dad went on a date with a woman. (W) W told dad that she did not want to marry him. 4ish weeks ago, she moved away and they ""broke up"" during the 2 year period, my dad told me many obvious red flags. Some about him, some about her. Some of them include, him wanting to go farther and her refusing (his flag) and her telling him she refused to live with him. (Not serious flag but still something that happened) during that ENTIRE time he was complaining about her saying with her actions and whatever that she doesnt love him. 
Well after she left, he met a new woman. (L) she was honestly not good for him at all because she was angry he had a medical condition and refused to treat it. (There is no treatment yet, just something to slow it down) (I never really understood why he liked her when she was always so rude to him) Well he finally ditched her after I told him how stupid he was. My dad just told me that W is now moving in with us (I also have a medical problem that makes it so I cant live alone and so I am renting from him for honestly really cheap) because all of a sudden ""she misses him and regrets that she refused him before and she cant possible live without him"". (Like she didnt want him coming to visit her before she moved away and now that shes moved states away she suddenly wants him.) I feel really suspicious about her and I dont feel like this is a good choice for him. Yes, I would care a lot less if I didnt live here but my siblings also have expressed discomfort and they dont care as much. 
I tried to tell him that W moving in was a very bad idea but he just waved me away saying ""she says she changed"" and I dont know how to express my concern in a way that he will understand.
I tried to keep this vague on details so if I was too vague i can clarify questions but I just cant figure out how to tell him my concerns. And another detail, I tried expressing concerns back when they were first dating and he brushed me off then too. What should I do? How do I get my concerns across to him?",25Jul2020,1
56,"My partner (25M) and I (23F) have been together for five years, on and off the first two but we’ve been solid for the last three. Throughout our entire relationship he’s personally prescribed himself marijuana as a coping mechanism for anxiety and adhd, but he’s never really pursued any other long term solutions (ie. therapy) for dealing with those experiences. I’ve personally never had a problem with his marijuana use because he’s extremely high functioning/coherent/productive while high, and I’ve honestly never known him without the use.

We’re now heading into the next step in our lives and buying a condo together, which is a significant financial leap for the both of us but important for our relationship. This next step has prompted my partner to re-evaluate his priorities, especially in regard to his finances, and he’s decided that he wants to quit smoking marijuana in order to save the couple hundred dollars he spends each month on it. I’m fully supportive of this plan and try to voice my support as well, but whenever we discuss the logistics of him quitting, it always seems to end with him upset with me. I’m always faced with the accusation that I don’t really understand him or see how he lives on a day to day basis, which is very perplexing to me because I feel like I do. We’ve lived together for two and half years now and it’s difficult for me to imagine that I’m not articulating my understanding of his circumstances.

I’ve asked him what he needs from me in order to initiate quitting because he’s told me that in his past, the only other time he’s quit for a few months, he had his sister with him 24/7 to speak to him and encourage him to be productive with other activities. Fast forward to the present: I wouldn’t be able to be the same figure his sister was because I work two jobs and go to school. He understands that - he even brought it up that he doesn’t expect it from me, but he makes it sound like the only way he’s going to be able to accomplish quitting is if someone is there to almost be a babysitter. That term sounds belittling and I don’t intend it to, but I just mean a person who can be at his side at all times through this emotional process. Anyways, back to me asking him what he needs from me; his response is always something along the lines of, “Asking me that is like asking a heroin addict what they need in order to quit heroin. They just don’t know.”

It triggers me, personally, to think about his association of his marijuana addiction with a heroin addiction because my father is a drug addict, who’s gone to rehab many times with no success throughout my entire life. I try to tell my partner that he isn’t giving himself enough credit for even wanting to quit in the first place and that he may not need this sort of safe bubble in order to quit in the first place. But this is just generalizing and dismissing his problem, according to him.

I don’t have experience with addiction myself, I was too young to observe how my mother supported my father before he split from her and I don’t know what to do now with my partner to be supportive of him. I don’t want to fight anymore and I try to be compassionate, but he just seems to respond negatively to everything I suggest or say.

What can I do to be more supportive?",25Jul2020,1
57,"I desperately need advice. I met this dude through mutual friends a while ago... whenever we first met he was in a relationship so during that time I never considered that I liked him. I even hung out with him and his girlfriend once. We would message each other on and off but mainly just small talk. Later on he expressed to me that he wasn’t doing very well and that him and his girlfriend had recently split up. Eventually we hung out which would be the 2nd time we had ever actually hung out and I brought a friend along with me. The same day me and my friend went to his house and spent the night. Later into the night he expressed to me that he had a crush on me. At the time I felt very overwhelmed and surprised with this because I had no clue that HE would be interested in ME. The same night nothing sexual happened between us... we just kissed. This led to us being in a relationship around a week later and being my first actual relationship. In the beginning I expressed to him that I was a bit concerned and confused about the fact that he had just gotten out of a long term relationship but everything felt okay so I didn’t think much of it. The first month between us was great. I felt so LOVED and in love. I was obsessed with him. He lived 2 hours away from me but we talked every day and I got to see him every week for a couple days at a time whenever he didn’t have to work. Leading up into the ending of the 2nd month of our relationship... things we’re still okay but I could tell towards the end of our relationship that he became distant. I thought everything was okay until one day I was talking to him on the phone and he expressed to me that he didn’t want to be with me anymore because he didn’t think he wanted to be in a relationship right now. He said that he needed time to heal from past abuse and didn’t want things to go too far without his mental health being fixed. The feeling for me was terrible and I was so confused. I tried to express this to him as best as I could but I felt as if no words could fully describe how I felt. All I could feel or think is this person I love so so much doesn’t want to be with me anymore. How am I going to live without them. Part of me feels like a lot of that was from my mental state at the time. I was dealing with a lot of depression and I felt as if he was the only happiness I could experience and I think I was really attached. There was a very big shift between us after this day. We went from talking on the phone and texting everyday from barley talking at all so quickly and he made me feel very weird. I didn’t want to bother him if he needed space but I was confused and it was hard. We talked on and off at least once every other day and he told me that he still wanted to come see me on his days off and that he still wanted me to be in his life. At the time I was still having trouble expressing how I felt because I had never had someone make me feel this way before but I took so much comfort in knowing that I was still going to get to see him. We definitely don’t hangout as much as we used too due to us not being in a relationship anymore but things are still the same between us. We still show affection towards each other whenever we hangout even though sometimes he seems unsure about it. I want things to be the same between us considering I still feel the same way about him and I want to be with him it just feel as if it has made things more confusing between us. I think the 2nd or 3rd time of us not being together but hanging out we started having sex again but he considers us just friends. I’m so confused and I don’t know what to say or do... I just feel like I’m along for the ride and that this is in his hands  but I can’t do that to myself. It’s not okay to feel this way. I’m just sad, I want to be with this person but he doesn’t want to be with me right now but we still have sex? I think I’m also scared that he’s saying he doesn’t want to be in a relationship but I’m gonna have to hear him say one day that he’s seeing someone else... I just need help on what to say to him and how to deal with this and what to think. I would love to think that there’s a chance of us being together in the future...

58,"Okay so... I’m new to Apple products. I’ve never owned one before nor read about them (besides the obvious “iPhone ___ is coming!), so I didn’t know about activation locks. I was selling my phone (Android) so I could buy an iPhone, and someone offered me a trade.

It sounded like a pretty even trade to me so I said sure. This person had it listed for sale and had great reviews on MarketPlace as a seller so I figured it was a safe trade. I have my husband take my phone and meet up with the guy and they exchange phones. They both check that they turn on and are reset and go on their way.

My husband gets home and gives me the phone, so I start setting it up. I got through the language and country before it hit an activation lock. I googled what it is and saw it meant it’s linked to someone’s account and needs to be removed for me to use it, so I ask them to remove it from their account. They say it was their girlfriends so they’ll have her do it when she gets home from work.

I wait and nothing. I message again and they say she’s working on it but doesn’t remember her information so it’s taking awhile. I wait even longer. Now it’s 5 days later and they keep coming up with new excuses for why she can’t/won’t do it. Pretty much any excuse for why they themselves can’t remove the lock.

I ask to trade back and they claim they already traded my phone away so I ask for the price I was selling it for and they take their phone back. They insist that if they connect it to their computer and use a backup from when she used the phone, it will work again and I would be able to use it. So I agree and wait so my husband can go meet up with them to attempt the backup.

Now they refuse to respond and now I’m pretty sure I traded my perfectly good working phone for a stolen phone. Is there anything I can do or am I just out of a phone? This one isn’t marked as stolen but I don’t see why else they’ve been acting so shady. I plan to take this one to the police station and hope they have someone who filled out a stolen device report for this phone. But what can I do about mine since technically mine wasn’t stolen?",25Jul2020,1

I (f15) have had this problem since age 13 and I hate it. It happens randomly when I pee and doesn’t go away until an hour or so. I will use the restroom and then I can’t pee anymore and I try but nothing happens, after I’m done it feels sort of sensitive down there, and I don’t want to walk or sit until it goes away.

I went to the doctors and had a urine test done and even took antibiotics and it didn’t go away. I don’t feel any pain and my urine and discharge look normal. It can’t be an infection because I already got treated for that and nothing changed. The only sign that it could be an infection is that I can’t pee, nothing else.

I got an ultrasound done and they found gallstones so that problem took priority and they told me that there’s something wrong with my muscles used to pee.

I don’t know how to fix this and I’m not sure if the sensitivity in that area after not being able to pee is normal if I do just have muscle problems. Should I go to the doctors again or try to ‘train my muscles’ like they told me to?

81,"Content warning: sex abuse 
This is kind of a long story, and I'll try to keep it as  condensed as possible, but I'm really interested in hearing people's thoughts other than my therapist lol.  
My (28F) dad is a registered sex offender. When I was 18 he was accused of molesting our neighbor/my friend when we were 5. He denied it, was ruled guilty, given 5 years probation, denied it for another year, and then confessed to my mom it was true. She asked him to leave and they separated but didnt divorce. It was so surreal. My family never talked about it. We literally had this life-altering thing happen and never discussed it. He lost his job. We sold our house. He lived in a hotel for the remainder of his probation and my mom got her own place.
During those 5 years, I became kind of distant toward my family, which was not hard to do as I was in college in a different state. But when I would go home for holidays, I would have to pretend everything was fine, because that's just what he unspoken expectation was. But I was so uncomfortable around my dad. 
Around the time my dads probation ended, I got married. My mom ""forgave"" him and they started living together again. I say ""forgave"" because she has never truly processed what happened and refuses to talk about it. 
2 years later, my daughter was born. When I found out I was pregnant, it was like my eyes were opened and I realized how truly disgusting my dads actions were. I was horrified. How had I just gone along with this and swept it under the rug for so long? I've been in intense therapy for over a year with an amazing therapist who has helped me process my trauma and come to accept reality. But since my family has chosen to not speak about any of this, me bringing it up to them (I had to tell my dad he was not welcome to visit me when my daughter was born. I have no interest in him being in her life or mine) has driven a wedge between us. My younger sister is somewhat on my side, but she lives at home with my parents and isn't as passionate about this as I am. My mom is still part of my life, but at a distance because she is SO uncomfortable with confrontation and feels like, since i have chosen not to have a relationship with my dad, she has to choose between us. She chooses him, which is heartbreaking. I love my mom and she deserves so much better than all of this but refuses to face reality. I feel like she is holding a grudge against me. My family makes me feel like I'm crazy for not wanting to have a relationship with him. The dad I knew growing up is honestly kind of dead to me. I'm starting to wonder if my family is toxic for accepting my dad back into their lives so easily, especially since we have never talked about it as a family.

I have tried countless nasal dilators (due to allergies and other issues) and none of them have worked all that great.

Hi all, 

Before I get into this I feel I should say that I have pretty severe anxiety, that’s why I’m so freaked out and why I made a throwaway to post this. I’m especially high strung bc I’m going to college in a month which is pretty scary to me but that’s not the point.

So there’s this girl who ive never even met IRL who is a grade below me and went to the same high school as me. A while back she had an strange obsession with one of my friends despite him never reciprocating, she even started doing drugs just because he smokes weed. She followed my instagram and would reply to my story and sent me a few weird flirty memes which I ignored. I didn’t really think anything of it until a mutual friend told me she liked me. I felt put off so I kind of just ignored it. After that she tried to add my snapchat and tried to start conversations a few times on insta, I just ignored everything hoping she’d lose interest.

NOPE. I saw the yesterday on her insta that she is planning on going to the same college as me now even though she’s a year younger. I panicked and decided to straight up tell her I didn’t like her that way, and I tried to do it nicely. She pretty much gaslighted me, saying she never had a crush and called me a narcissist for thinking she would follow me to college, saying she’s been “scouting it since freshman year.”

This should be all said and done but my anxiety has gotten the better of me and I can’t stop ruminating and catastrophizing. I’m worried that she’s gonna show up and try to take revenge on me somehow, like trying to ruin my reputation next year when she comes  to the school or something. From what my friend has told me she is that kind of person. Or maybe I am crazy and she was just trying to be my friend? My anxiety often causes me to come up with these ideas in my head and it causes me to look for justifications for these kinds of paranoid ideas.

If anyone actually reads through this I would hugely appreciate some advice. Even if it’s just ways to cope with catastrophizing + rumination. Maybe I should apologize for the way I confronted her?

the reason why i mentioned my ethnicity is because growing up, i was never the traditional asian girl. i admit i fucked up when i was 21 and i lied to my mom about going to a classmate’s house to study and do homework when i was really hanging out with my boyfriend at the time. i lost my virginity to him and in my mom’s eyes that basically “destroyed” my future because no good successful asian man would want to marry “damaged goods.” i’ve never been attracted to asian men, and my first boyfriend was mexican and the other guys i’ve dated were white. my mom basically calls me a whore cuz i date all these “loser” guys who aren’t doctors or engineers. 

my mom raised me all by herself when she and my dad got divorced before i turned 2 years old. she has spent her whole life raising me and i do appreciate her for it and i do love her. it’s always been me and her and i currently live with her again after moving out for a little over 3 years. everytime we argue i contemplate moving out again and just cutting ties with her completely for my own mental sanity but i’d feel like a terrible person for abandoning her. but when she makes me feel like shit and tells me that all her friends tell her that her daughter is a slut and they feel so bad for her that it just tears me apart. and i feel like she treats me worse after she talks to her friends, who have daughters who married engineers and have kids. 

her health also isn’t very good so i have to help her out with stuff. so if i cut her out of my life she’d have to struggle with some things. she even blames me for certain health issues, such as insomnia, because she’s “so worried” that i’m gonna die alone.

any advice would be appreciated. i’ve never told anyone my complete struggle before. my closest friend knows the gist and suggested therapy but my mom would never agree to that.

I am a 24yo male from Brazil.  
For a couple years I have been getting some thoughts about college and family.  
I have a dream: go to medical school. I spent all these years since I finished high school (2014) without doing anything productive. I started film college. I started portuguese-english college. I started psychology. But in all of those I didnt feel complete.   


Now i have decided (after a lot of thought) that what I really want is to go to medical school, and that is where my trouble begins.   
If I go to medical school, I have to keep living with my mom (it is just me and her here), and this bothers me because I want to have my own things, and I really want to help her.  


Its been just me and her for all my life. And she always put me first. And if I go to medical school, that\`s another 6 years of my life living with her and only getting like R$350 (which is like $66) from college support.   


And I really want to give everything to her. Im just afraid that I wont be able if I get into medical school. Shes already 59yo and Im afraid that by the time I finish all my studies and can earn real money, she would be gone. I just cant even think about this.

My youngest sister (B) would get a lot of attention from her dad and the second youngest (G) wouldn’t get as much attention from their dad. So B would usually do whatever she wants. Since G doesn’t get a lot of attention from her dad she would be wrongfully accused of many things and I feel bad for her so I give G a lot of my attention to make her feel like she’s wanted. We’re now really close. But because of how close G and I are I think B has gotten really jealous so I also try to make B feel included in what G and I do but because she’s used to getting what she wants from her dad she as a ‘I can do whatever I want’ attitude about her.. she’s become really entitled over the past few years.... it’s gotten to the point where B would deliberately hit G whenever things didn’t go her way or when G would make a sarcastic remark. It isn’t the light slap that you do when you’re with a person you’re comfortable with and they’re making you laugh or anything like that but a FULL ON slap where you can HEAR the sound of hand meeting skin. I don’t agree with anything B has done to G but something deep inside me tells me if I had paid just as much attention to B and I did with G she wouldn’t be like this... but it’s gotten to a point where even if I’m nice to her she’ll continue to be a complete bitch to me and G.. I mean G plays with her all the time and I’ve found myself distancing myself from her.... I feel bad but she’s become really toxic and I don’t know what to do.. I don’t want to let her to continue to grow up like this thinking it’s okay to have an ‘I can do whatever  I want’ attitude but every time I try to be nice and include her she’s an utter bitch to me and G.

100,"Well, I (18y) live in a small town, the ones where everyone knows each other.

  I always had many friends during my teenage years, but as I changed my mind, many friends of mine left me. I started reading, trying to learn about money, I don't smoke, I don't drink... and they do just the opposite of what I do. Not only them, but most of the ""popular"" teenagers who live here in the city. 

  Because of my different interests, they just stopped asking me out and talking to me, excluded me from the group. The problem is that as everyone knows each other, most people have the same circle of friendship, so I end up not going out with any friends, except my girlfriend. 

 I think that, because of all this, it's better for me to stay alone than with bad company and I know that I'm doing the right thing when focusing on studying and doing good habits, but I miss some friends to talk and do stuff. Any advice?",25Jul2020,2

103,"I (20M) started my current job about a year ago now. I made friends with a couple of girls there, S (21F) and H (20F) (using their initials for anonymity). I've gotten pretty close with both of them and as I got to know S more, I learned more about her awful childhood. She grew up in foster care after being abused by her father in...many ways, and neglected by her mother. Her mom's a drug addict to this day but her father died a couple years ago. Her social worker took her in (didn't legally adopt her) around the age of 17 I think. S says that her social worker was mentally abusive to her as well, telling her she was just like her parents when she did anything she saw as wrong. To get away from them, she moved in with her boyfriend when she was 18. Things were apparently good for the first couple of years, but then he started getting abusive. He'd insult her, make her feel like she's ugly which she most definitely isn't, she's truly a stunning girl (I'm not interested in her that way though, I'm gay). It's gotten to the point where he's threatened to burn all of her stuff after she didn't blow him one night and she's came into work with bruises on her face or arms that she's told me and H are from him, but lies about where they came from to anyone else at work who asks. Her and her boyfriend live in a little 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment and never had much money. It's gotten worse because he got fired and wasn't getting a job even though they were struggling financially enough as it is. They almost became homeless because of him but I helped them with rent one month with the promise that she'd pay me back, and she has paid most of it back so far. However, it's gotten to the point where she kept having to ask for money and I didn't want her to starve and I don't really have any bills to pay so I told her to ask me whenever she needed it but that he needed to get a job soon. This has gone on for about 3 months and now she owes me a little over $1000. I don't know if I can keep helping her seeing as she hasn't paid me anything back in a while and her boyfriend still hadn't really put any effort into getting a job. His sister finally got him a job somewhere but he hasn't started yet. On top of everything,  S's sister was found dead yesterday, possibly murdered. S's whole life has been filled with so much pain that no one should ever have to go through. I've offered her help in getting away from her boyfriend and into a better apartment close to work (neither of them have a car or can drive and we live in a more rural area so getting to work can take her about an hour of she walks, I often pick her up on days I work and sometimes on days I don't work) but she won't accept it. She keeps saying her boyfriend just needs to get medicine for his anger issues and that he'll be fine, but me and H feel like she's already been hurt by him enough. I kept trying to help her to understand this, but I feel like he's gotten under her skin. She doesn't want to be alone and she says she's been with him for like 5 years and she feels it'd be a waste to break up with him and have wasted all those years. I told her she should leave him now to avoid wasting anymore time on him. I know she has to really want to help herself before I can really help her get out of the situation she's in, but it sucks that it's starting to look like she won't ever leave because he's manipulate her. She cries at work some days begging him not to be angry with her, apologising for things she shouldn't apologize for. I don't know what to do anymore. Lately she's been slacking at work, being on her phone a lot, even though she's usually a hard worker, and she's been asking for mone a bit more often than usual, I feel like she may be taking advantage of it a little. I really care about her and so does H, but we don't know what more we can do for her, I've offered to get her out, but she won't take the help, only help with bills or when she literally has no food at her house (he also gets more pissy when he's hungry). I was raised in a home with both of my parents who are still married to this day and a brother, no major family drama or abuse. Because of this, I feel like I can't properly relate to and understand her. How can I convince her to acctually leave him. And if she does, can I trust that she won't go back to him? She says that she feels like their relationship won't make it much longer (I hope it doesn't) but she also says she thinks she may end up going back to him if she leaves or cheat with him if she were to get into a relationship with someone else. She's said before that one reason she doesn't want to leave him is because she likes having sex with him, but idk if that's just the only thing she likes about being with him so she's saying she shouldn't leave because of that to convince herself to stay because she fears lonliness or what. She's so confusing sometimes. I wish she'd understand how better off she'd be without him. It hurts sometimes when she doesn't seem to listen to me after I pour my heart out to her about how much me and H care about her and how he's so awful to her and she should leave which she'll agree to and then the next day she's posting about him being the best man in her life. I really don't get it anymore and it's getting so frustrating. What should I do? Should I just wait until she's really ready to leave him?

109,"I feel as if my former employer is messing with me. I quit working for her during the Corona virus lockdown when she chose to open the business in defiance of state and county orders. I know she is one to carry a grudge. Very controlling and essentially a Karen. Examples are telling me which stores I can or cannot shop at based off her views. Insisting that I come to her home on days off to assist her with menial issues. Trying to stop me from going to my grandmother's funeral because I had been to visit her two weeks prior. Not allowing me to take time off unless she was going to be on vacation as well. Posting signs in her shop stating customers could only be Democrats and banning what she calls Republicants (I believe in keeping business and politics separate). These are just a few examples of her behavior. 

I have been putting in multiple resumes daily for well over a month and can't get a call or email back from anyone. I know that the job market is tough now, but I find it hard to believe that I'm getting no interest at all. I believe she is sabotaging me.

122,"So, before I start I just want to say I forgive people if someone owns up to a mistake they have made and also made a change.

 I just graduated and for a graduation party we had a backyard camping thing. We did the typical teenage stuff like eating too much and staying up late. This guy was being completely out of line during the whole thing. I'll be calling him F.

 At the part me and this one girl was mostly cuddling and talking. Same with this other guy who was like a brother. Well when F came everything turned awkward.

 He got mad that I was cuddling with this girl, who was his ex but I didn't find an issue because she moved on and was dating someone.

 F asked me to wear a bra while I slept because if I didn't he would be staring. 

 Then me and two others drank a bit of alcohol and I fell asleep and this boy decided to start rubbing my back. This may not seem bad but I don't like when people touch me without asking and knows. 

 Well recently another friend was living with him to escape from a bad household. F's father is a basic toxic man. His dad always had to be right. Always had to get the last word in.

 F was also a bad roommate. He would watch shows loud late at night. Even when the other friend had work in the morning. 

 The friend living with them got fired and struggled to find another. F did nothing when his father was cutting into his friend and didn't help at all. There's more and I will update with everything if I can. 

 The friend got kicked out because F complained to his parents about being confronted about being a bad friend in the middle of a storm. F did nothing to stop them or try to get them to wait until the morning. 

 There's a lot of times F's parents done stuff to his friend and he sat by and didn't try to stand up to them. Which to me would be what you do for a friend. 

 He only made excuses when confronted about the things he done. Another friend told us to that he didn't do anything wrong.

Look where we are). I mentioned how I’m not that political and a lot of my opinions are based on my moral compass. She says my moral compass sucks. 

We then got on the topic about how when I was 10 I asked my now-dead-dad about his opinions on bi people. He said they’re “greedy” and “don’t exist” and that “you’re either gay or you’re straight”.

I said ‘yeah that’s biphobic. I still love him but it’s still biphobic’ she then called me a coward for not coming out to him and that it was immature to ask him that without clarifying that I was talking about me. I was 10 and didn’t realize I was bi. 

She said she was gonna take away my internet and change my school because clearly that’s where I get it from. A couple hours later we’re still yelling and I’m just tired, I was now crying cause she kept insulting me because I didn’t come out to my dad. We then argued some more and she stormed off.

A couple minutes ago she came into my room and told me I can stay in my school and keep my internet. She’ll feed me and give me a house but she wants nothing to do with me (a freshman btw) and that once I’m 18 I’ll leave. I think she was trying to guilt me? Then she like insulted me and said she wants nothing to do with me and she said I’m not her grandchild and stuff, yknow, as you do.

A couple months ago she also tried to take away my therapist cause I talk about her in therapy.

128,"Hi all! Looking for some help with this situation, and I really hope this doesn't turn political. My father is very 'covid is a hoax'-y and I don't know how to address it or handle it. For the past few months I've just been able to easily dig up evidence against his claims and it usually gets him to just stop yelling at me - but never an apology or anything of the sort. Lately it's turned very 'pro-President'-y.

""The CDC is ran by the democrats and is corrupt so they want to raise the numbers to make elections turn down his favor"" - Even though I've found plenty evidence for hospitals being overwhelmed and hospitals admitting to trying to artificially *lower* numbers.

God, everything feels terrible, there are, like, three upsides to the job, but I still want to leave the place. I feel too stupid/slow to be any good, I'm being trained for several positions (ones I did not, and would not consider applying for). The bosses are... Too nice, and it sounds weird, but I'm genuinely scared that I might open up to them and try and be semi-normal, and then they, ya know, act like bosses and not the friendly people they acted like before. I think we all have that certain field where we just don't fit in internally, for my dad, it's retail, my mom? Probably retail as well, I think my personal field I hate is fast food. I can do hospitality, retail, maybe try a factory, but I just already hate my current job, it feels like a slog.

I can imagine myself working at other fast food places, but this specific place makes me feel insecure, maybe it's the people, but I can't get over this feeling that everyone is laughing behind my back, or waiting for me to make a slip up.

130,"Repost because I'm desperate. 

Boy, do I have a story for you. For context, my dad is deceased.

I saw a post on this thread about long lost family. I decided to do a background check on a girl that my dad always claimed to have adopted. **I'll call her H in this story**. Whenever he talked about it, my mom would just dismiss it saying that it's all false. I did this background check off of details that I remember my dad talking about. All I remembered was H's name, so I looked up my dad's full name along with her first name. What popped up was my dad's full name, H's full name, his ex-wife's name, and who I assume were the landlords/owners of the place at the time. I know that it was his ex-wife's name because one day (years ago) we got a letter addressed to my dad's ex wife. I asked what the name is and my mom explained that whoever sent it thought that my dad was still associated with his ex-wife. She dismissed any further questions.

So far, I've figured out that my dad used to be married with said woman and they adopted a child (H) together. But that's not what surprised me. It took me a while to figure out what stood out so much about this information. The address that they used to live at. It was in California (Not actual location, fake location for purposes of vagueness). Growing up, my mom said that when I was a few months old, I used to live in California but we had to move because of the area. I then realized that my dad's old family used to live in California, as did my mom.

If you haven't already guessed what I was thinking, here it is: my dad cheated on his now ex-wife with my mom. That would explain why she left California with my dad shortly after I was born. The affair he was having could no longer be covered up and he ran away from his family (H and his ex-wife)to be with my mom and raise me.

But my brother is older than me. Why didn't my dad run away from his family upon my brother's birth? Why mine?

This is where I put two and two together once again. For context, my brother was born in Rhode Island (FAKE LOCATION AGAIN). I believe that he was apart of my dad's old family.

So here's my complete theory: My dad and his ex-wife had two children. One was biological (my ""brother"") and the other was adopted (H). They used to live in Rhode Island (where they had my brother) until they moved to California for whatever reason. When they moved to California, my dad met my mom and had an affair. When I was born, the affair could no longer be hidden. Then, my dad's ex-wife either divorced him or he left her to be with my mom. Either way, he took my brother who was too young to remember anything. He either took my brother with him to where we now live because H was old enough to leak the secret to me when I grew up (and he didn't want me knowing) or he lost H in the divorce and could only take my brother.Looking back, it makes sense. When I asked my mom the details about when she gave birth to my brother, her story doesn't add up. There are no details that actually make sense. She says that she was staying with my family that now lives in Rhode Island and that she moved to California. When I ask her why, I don't get any details/subject is change. I believe that she didn't actually give birth to my brother.

This also explains why I could never get an answer when I asked when my mom and dad married. Both would dismiss the subject whenever I asked. They probably don't remember when because the divorce was messy. I asked who attended their wedding, and they say that it was a small wedding and no one was there. This might've been because asking any family members about how they remember the wedding would've added to tons of details not adding up. This is huge. **I NEED ADVICE ASAP!!!**

I look like my brother, but we don't have the same eyes. My eyes are almost identical to my mom's and his are a different shape. Our skin tones are similar, though.

TL;DR: After doing some online research about my now deceased father's past, I discovered that my brother is my half brother and I am the result of an affair. I'm not sure if my brother knows. I don't know what to do.

Update: Ok so I went online and to a county clerk website. ***My dad got a divorce judgement a month after I was conceived, which means he was still legally married when he cheated on his now ex-wife with my mom.

Backstory 36F: rough childhood, isolated and had toxic parents, been no contact for 5 years- had one close friend, best friends since middle school. She died in my early twenties. 

Married abusive spouse, together for 15 years. Finally left after things got scary with a gun, left with my two kids, lived in shelter, started over in new house. ( Yes domestic violence got worse in the pandemic)

I had a co-worker I was friends with, who left today (took about a year to get close with) BUT he's married and being friends outside of work is socially not acceptable. 

For the first time, I truly have no one. No friends or family.

Absolutely, positively no one.

I don't have the best social skills and I prefer male friends but that has its own obstacles. 

I do understand I can use this time to mentally heal, but how do I deal with the loneliness?

No laughs, no friends, No dates, no texts no one to share a life with. And before anyone says, this is the time to focus on the kids, yes I do that, but how do I start a life for myself in the middle of a pandemic.

I know I can pick up hobbies, but geezus Christ, this is killing me. It's nice to have inside jokes and share ideas, thoughts and have a small bit of companionship.

I just want a real life friend.

I feel like I don't exist.

137,"Hey there. Let me give some background really quickly: I am a female in her early twenties. The person who abused me is two years older and my maternal cousin. In this story, I will be referring to her as 'D' as that's what her name starts with.

D was sexually abused by 2-3 adults when she was a child. Of course, I feel very bad for her and I am so sorry for what happened to her, but that doesn't give her an excuse for what she did to me. She would do sexual acts with me that were clearly very sexual in nature, and something someone her age and my age shouldn't know about. I was 8-9 or so when it happened, and she was 10-11. The worst and last time it happened I was 10-11 and she was 12-13. Not to get to into it, she forced herself on me even though I was telling her to stop and to get off of me she didn't. Whenever I discuss my trauma with a therapist, I'm always brought back there. I was diagnosed with PTSD last February, actually. Now, onto my question.

How do I interact with her? She apologized to me a year or two ago, and I told her I accepted. I understand what she did was wrong, and I fault her for it, but she was sexually abused by 2-3 ADULTS. I feel like that's a much different thing than what I went through. I may be wrong, and it may be different for everyone, but that's how I feel.

She and I live about 30 minutes away. Our parents (siblings) are pretty close and even work together, so I don't know how I can avoid her. The thing is, it's nothing necessarily about her I don't want to be around, more of the memories that being around her brings up. I don't know how to feel, I guess, and would like some advice if at all okay. Thank you :)",25Jul2020,1

143,"Back in 2011 I was in High School and I dated this guy Freshman-Junior year. It was a first-love typical high school sweetheart relationship. It ended because I broke it off after my mom died from cancer. I became numb, lost myself and cut off all ties I had with everyone I knew. When I broke up with him I gave him no reason other than I just didn’t love him anymore. It broke his heart, he was trying to get me back for years but I just ignored him. It’s been about 5 years since I’ve last heard from him and since then I’ve had time to heal. I don’t miss him or want him back but for the last year or so I’ve been thinking back on how I hurt him and how unfair it was. I’ve wanted to reach out and apologize but I feel like it’s not my place. How can you hurt someone so badly, make them heal without closure and then bring up the issue years later, you know? But still, I feel like I at least owe it to him to tell him it wasn’t anything he did and that there was nothing he could have done. I do the occasional Facebook stalk and see that he still hasn’t really dated anyone and, not to sound self-absorbed, I hope he’s not damaged from our break up. I’m leaving out details but he was seriously hurt for a long time. I’m with someone so I have no interest in bringing up old feelings from my ex but I also feel like reaching out to him may do just that. So I guess ultimately my question is this, should I send an apology to him or should I just leave it be? If you’ve been in a similar situation but in his position, would you have rather known that it wasn’t your fault or would you rather just move on with your life with the satisfaction of never hearing from the person that hurt you ever again?",25Jul2020,1

148,"I (20F) Have suffered with a fear of dying since my grandad died when I was 6. One day my dad sat me down and told me grandad had gone to heaven and I’d never see him again. My parents allowed me to go to the funeral as they thought it would be good to allow for me to understand death and grief and that it’s a natural part of life. A few months later, the panic attack started. 

It’s taking a lot for me to write this alone but I remember from a young age running to my mam crying, struggling to breath and shaking asking her about dying. She would comfort me and tell me it wouldn’t happen for a long long time and that would soothe me. As I’ve gotten older it got worse. My other grandad died when i was 14 and I didn’t take it well. I took grief out on myself and developed an eating disorder (which I’m still recovering form now). 

Every time the conversation surrounding death or dying comes up I have panic attacks, watching someone die on TV makes me shaky and breathless. Thinking about dying can send me into a panic. It’s consumed my life and I don’t know how to go about dealing with it anymore.

I thought it was a way of showing love and didn’t know, since I just wanted to make her happy. We’ve been doing it for a week until my mother found out and beat me as a punishment. She had us both apologize to each other and knew that my sister probably witnessed her own mother do these sexual activities with random men and probably wanted to test it out on me. 

Since then we talk (she never brought up those nights btw) inconsistently to stay in touch, as she’s now a young mother with a dysfunctional man-repeating her moms path as I’m in a different world with my art, college and fighting with my bipolar depression. We never talked about that night and I’m not sure if it’s worth bringing up to my therapist but wonder if that was the starting point to my “opening up” to other men to do things to me throughout my life.

I am 18 years old and from Argentina, I am only skilled in two things really, one of them being video games and the other being the English language, since my native language is Spanish most people don’t even know how to write English, so I consider this a good skill of mine.
My mother loves me and treats me wonderfully, she would support anything I do as long as it makes me happy.
My problem in life is my dad, I wanted to go to college and hopefully in the future get a job as a professional translator, my dream job, but my dad has different plans for me.

My entire life he has decided everything for me, ranging from what school I go to, to what job I’m supposed to get, he has been a police officer for over 30 years now and wants me to forget about college and that I’m never going to amount to anything in life unless I become a police officer as well. He has threatened to kick me out of the house and perhaps even disown me if I don’t do as he says and join the police force. I really don’t like the police, I just don’t think they do what they should most of the time.
Also I just feel miserable knowing all the time I spent practicing and learning things for a job as a translator is going to waste because of my entitled dad.

Honestly this was more of a vent than anything, and there’s probably not a straight-forward solution to this but even if you have encouraging words that would mean a lot.

It was painful for me because he almost seemed disgusted by me. He’s not going through the best time right now with his health and debt. It could have stemmed from that, but honestly the way that he was making me feel was too hard to handle. He was definitely about to break up with me himself or just seeing how far he can push me. Maybe he was going to continue treating me like this for a while. 

Basically, I decided that I need to break up with him and did so tonight. It went ok, he was cold about the break up as well of course. Just had nothing to say. It was really hard for me because I technically don’t want to, but I feel like I have no choice and everything feels wrong. If he doesn’t want me or love me there’s nothing I can do to change that no matter how much it hurts.

171,"So, this guy, let’s just call him “S” is very hard to deal with. He’s two years younger than me, as the youngest in the group. He constantly starts shit. He’s extremely sensitive, and takes everything as an insult. A lot of the time our friend group kind of likes to jokingly insult each other, but he always gets pissed off, and just starts legitimately insulting people. He has a very “holier than thou” mindset, and it’s straining on the mind. He also is INSANELY defensive about America. He started a random conversation on a group chatabout how communism fails, and asked me to name a single stable communist country besides China. I responded Russia, to which he said “they say they aren’t.” Which is a bullshit excuse, but that’s besides the point. He then said something about their economy not being stable, which I laughed at and said that the US’s economy wasn’t stable, and really no economy is stable. He then proceeded to go about ten minutes just texting “okay” and “here we go” over and over again. And then he was like “ThE sOlDiErS gIvE tHeIr LiVeS fOr ThIs CoUnTrY” and was insistent that by criticizing America, I was disrespecting the military? He then proceeded to be mad about that for days. The real thing that set off a massive red flag, was that my friend was talking about a guy she liked, and that he sort of played with her heart. Then S called her a hoe. In my other friend group, this would probably be somewhat normal, we do that shit all the time as a joke, but it seemed genuine. I was pissed off immensely, but I couldn’t do anything really. Then he goes to apologize to me and my other friend, but not the girl he said it to. Situations like this happen all the time. He fucks up, and then he’s like ”uh oh, I mess up,didn’t I?” then apologizes to everyone but the person who deserves it, and then when he gets to them, he gives some half assed excuse, not an apology.

172,"for some context, i'm extremely close with my mom and i actually consider her to be one of my best friends. when i was younger, my mom did everything for me, she made my life really easy; in fact, she was extremely over-bearing and i was never challenged or learned to do things on my own. so, now that i'm older, tied in with my temperament to be highly agreeable, there a lot of things i have anxiety doing (i can't drive without getting anxious, i'm anxious getting on the bus, i'm anxious talking to men, so on and so forth).

well, i'm starting nursing school this fall and my mom has lost her mind b/c i want to DRIVE. i am TWENTY-THREE (23). she said a few days ago that i better bus (it's a 2-hour bus ride) or i should cancel any thought of going to school and stay at home. my dad said previously when i was 19-20 and wanting to buy a car of my own (and living on my own for school) that if i started driving, and i died that he would blame my mom and never let her live it down. he said he would kill himself, that he would die if i died, etc. so i've gotten extreme anxiety over driving and when i drive alone, i sometimes park and cry on the side because i'm so scared.

side note: my dad was extremely abusive growing up from ages approximating 4 or 5 to 20 or 21 (beat me, yelled at me, frightened me, scared me to death). i have vivid memories of being in grade 8, being just 14 years old, and TERRIFIED to go home because i knew i would beat by my dad. and my mom would raerly stop him. she herself was scared of him. anyway, i digress. needless to say, i don't talk to my dad for said reasons, i actually hate him a lot, but she told my dad i want to drive to school and he said i'm not allowed. and so i've been extremely angry for the past few days bc i'm already embarrassed that i can't drive as well as my peers bc of my anxiety but now she wants to delay that even longer.

so i've not been talking to her for the past 2-3 days, and today i was out on a walk while i knew she would be in my room working out (so i tried to come later so i wouldn't blow up on her out of anger). i end up getting home, and i'm ringing the doorbell for approximately 10 minutes and no one opens up. so i call my mom's number and my sister picks up and scream for her to open the door. my brother comes down by that time and screams at me for ringing the doorbell (him and i don't talk bc my dad did a shit job raising him and he treats women like shit) anyway, i get to my room and i lose it. i fucking lose it. i'm not at all a violent or loud person so i feel extremely guilty and embarrassed for going off on the deep end like that esp with my own mom. but i have so much built-up resentment towards my mom for letting my dad beat me up, for not allowing me to be independent and grow up like normal parents do, for not letting me leave the house when i was younger bc i'm a 'woman', for treating my brothers better than me, etc.

i'm so disgusted with myself to admit this but i said to her 'you're a piece of shit', 'i hate you', 'get out of my room', 'you're disgusting', etc.  and i stopped her work out. and she left the room and so did my sister. my mom just said i'm finally losing my mind and that i'm a crazy person. i could hear her sobbing from her room bc she was probably so sad i said all those things about her. i'm crying while typing this bc i don't know how to control my emotions sometimes, i think i'm enlightened and then i blow up like this.

please don't judge me so harshly, i already feel like shit. i think i need anger management classes. what should i do?

Also content warning for mention of gore/blood, death, and body horror

So for a good amount of time (I would say maybe working on and off this thing for a month or so????) I've been working on what can be considered an animation meme (whether or not it is is a different topic) to the song Oh Klahoma by Jack Stauber for practicing making a full animation to something with some amount of structure. Now a few years ago the inspiration I had for this (which I'm only working on now, oops) was that around the time I discovered the song, I noticed that I have had a lot of dreams that involve someone or something chasing me with the intent to kill me, with a good amount of the time the dreams ending with that someone or something succeeding and being helpless to it. I believed this might have been the result of some sort of stress or fear. Because of this, I interpret the song Oh Klahoma as being about something like that and was inspired to have that be the subject of an animation if I ever made one to the song. You can probably see where this is going (especially if you know the lyrics to the song). 

So now I'm about maybe 80% done with the animation and I'm getting close to having to work on the more ""animation-meme-like"" part of it where my current plan is that the main character (at like a head and shoulders shot) is kind of reacting to being hurt in different ways at the part where the lyrics are repeatedly going ""those aren't meant to bend."" I admittedly havent storyboarded this so some things are undecided (I know it was a poor choice) but at least two out of the couple shots for this are pretty bloody/contain body horror (ex: being stabbed in the eye and in other places and an arm being missing after in a way that suggests it was chopped off). I know a lot of people have posted edgy and bloody animations online many times so I suppose this wont be much different than the content of others, but now recently i remembered that gore/torture porn is a thing that exists unfortunately and I'm worried that the execution of the concept will make people think that this is possibly that. I suppose if I focus on making it look cartoony but still a little gross than perhaps the likelyhood of that will be much slimmer. But god I'm just really worried about people associating me with people who are into that (which I personally think is really creepy and gross for obvious reasons), especially because a lot of projects and ideas I have also involve a lot of bloody/horror stuff (because I'm apparently a person with a stupid edgy brain that also really likes horror concepts and thinks intense animated fight sequences are really cool despite my skin crawling when I see blood irl)

Basically I guess what I'm wondering is am I justified in being really worried about this here (and maybe in general in the future) and I should change things/not finish this or am I just being too paranoid about people thinking I'm into creepy shit???

(Also, just to be clear, I'm not necessarily talking about gorey/horror/body horror art in general or the people that make it, that's usually fine. I'm just talking about people who have like a fetish for gore/torture and get off to it/have an unhealthy obsession with it and shit)",25Jul2020,1

Alright, so. Long story short, I(Male, not sharing age) met this girl online, E.(Female, not sharing age). We all hung out in our online groupchat, and I grew feelings for this other group member, J.(Male, not sharing age). We ended up dating, but, I started bumping into a few issues with E., now that I was seeing everything from a different perspective with everything going on in my life, and me dating J., I started to look at the situation from a different perspective. She actively tried flirting, complementing, etc. with me, and yes, I knew she liked me before I got together with J., but didn't feel the same, since I'm gay, and it just wasn't going to work for that sole reason. She also tried to get with J., although she knew I liked him. She often places the limelight on her, or completely kills the fun of the group when we're having fun, and the conversations grow dark, and about her personal issues, and it makes everyone else really uncomfortable. It's gotten to the point, where, (since I also have depression, like her), I've almost gotten sick because of some of the terrible, and disgusting things shes said. She's mentioned how she ""Likes the taste of human flesh"", and that shes ""Tried it before"", and that she ""Likes the sound of bones breaking/cracking"", etc. But, she has helped me with some very difficult points in my life, but.

182,"Hey, Redditors! I'm 19 and I have some serious confidence issues. I come from a mildly overprotective family which is partly the reason why I don't have faith in myself. I doubt myself far too much. I just don't trust my own judgment. For example, if I'm writing an important email to somebody, or working on a research paper, I constantly rely on my dad to vet it. If I am cooking something or I'm in the kitchen, I get scared of making my own decisions or messing up so I keep asking my mother for help. This behavior is not only restricted to my family but I also do it outside (sometimes). I'm part of an important club in university and I'm one of the project heads. I took this role to push myself from my comfort zone. This has helped me a bit, but I still don't trust myself, I keep asking other heads for small advice (they're very kind and helpful). I think I'm scared of failure, people thinking lowly of me, etc. The thought of others judging me scares me too. I really want to change, and I still have time to do so. HOw can I improve?

183,"I’m 17 years old around 140 lbs and 5’1, I’ve always had remarks about my weight ever since I was a kid and it’s caused a huge part of my low self esteem. 

My weight has never caused me any health problems but I just get down about myself because I feel like no matter how much weight I lose I genuinely feel like it will never be enough for me. 

These remarks have got to me so much I refuse to eat enough when I’m around certain family members and even dictates what I wear around them so much where it takes up most of my time getting ready. I always watch what I say to make sure I don’t give them a reason to bring up my weight and it just gets exhausting after a while but honestly I don’t even realize i’m doing it anymore at this point.

186,"**I'm a 21 year old female.

About a month ago, my boyfriend broke up with me. I didn't see it coming and I was so in love with him (and still am). He explained that he wasn't ready for a serious relationship, amoung a few other things. For the last month, he's been going back and forth on whether or not we have a chance of getting back together. Eventually he said we're not. 

Before I started dating him, I was talking to someone else. We got along super well and ended up hooking up. A week after, he texted me saying he didn't want anything more. Two weeks ago he messaged me again apologizing for what he did and he wanted to be friends. We hung out once and it was fine. Then we hung out again at his house and played games for a while, no sign of anything physical from either of us. Until the last hour I was there, he made a move and we hooked up again. I know that was stupid, but it was/is a vulnerable place for me right now, especially because of what I'm about to say.

I work at my local Domino's and there's a coworker there I've been friends/coworkers with for about 2 years. Really cool guy, we had a lot of little things that were just between him and I that I'll always hold onto. About 2 weeks ago he killed himself. It was heartbreaking news. Ive never been blackout sad until that night. 

At the end of April, my car was stolen while working. I know that was a while ago, but I'm still struggling with it.

With all of this going on, I've been having constant anxiety and depression hitting. I don't have a person to turn to, because my ex was my best friend and that person for me.

187,"We have been dating for almost 1 year and recently we were both playing a game where we confessed or secrets which led to him confessing what he had done in the past. At first he just told me he was currently on probation, which was really surprising because I had no idea he ever even had problems with the law in the past. eventually I convinced him to tell me why he was on probation.

He said it was because when he was 15 yrs old, him and his family went on vacation with their neighbors, who have a 12 year old daughter and he was caught groping her in her sleep by her parents. Her parents pressed charges, which led to him being arrested, and ultimately being put on probation. I don't know much more about the story because he didn't explain anymore except that his parents barely communicate with him anymore, and want him to leave their house when he turns 18.

Even though I was disgusted at what he did I didn't react visibly upset because I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable and stop confessing, which I guess made him feel open to confess more, leading him to tell me about a 6 year old boy he recently baby sat.

He told me he was playing a video game and he convinced the boy to perform oral sex on him so he could get a chance to play the game.

I really am repulsed by what he did, but I don't know what to do, he didn't say who the little boy was, if he did I would try to tell his parents but I have no idea who it was. I do plan on breaking up with him, but I'm not sure if I should try to get more information from him first or just leave now.",25Jul2020,1
188,"Hi all, sorry if this isn’t the right place for this, but here goes.  

I graduated from high school in 2018 and I’ve spent the last two years going to my local community college. I am scheduled to have completed my associates of arts transfer by the end of fall term, which means it’s time for me to pick a finishing program. 

Honestly, it is my dream to become an animator. I love everything from video game art to cartoons like gravity falls. I really want to pick a school that will set me up for success, however I’m terrified of the huge tuitions some of these schools cost to attend. I’m scared of getting out and being unable to find work, and having like 100k + in student loans. 

Another issue is that Oregon (my home state) seems to be lacking in terms of good animation programs. I don’t mind going out of state, but I would prefer to stay either in the Northern California area or the southern- mid Washington at the furthest. Is this doable, or should I just suck it up and apply to some of the Southern California universities? Are there schools in Oregon I have overlooked?

192,"I'm sorry, this will be long but maybe you can relate?

I previously worked as an insurance salesmen, it was a very stressful job in that I never felt like I knew what I was doing (My training was inadequate and our sales goals and terms and conditions changed weekly), however at that job I had a good relationship with my co-workers and my boss. Even so, I had so much anxiety about messing something up and I was reminded monthly by upper management that if I didn't meet sales goals I would be fired. It became to much for me and I quit. I took a hiatus and worked on myself for a few months. I lost weight, found new hobbies, and I was ready to work again. 

I decided to look for a job that was better suited for someone with anxiety and depression so I googled it and came across multiple articles that recommended something I had always thought about, working with animals. So I went to school and landed a job in a vet office, I thought I finally had found my place and that I would be happy. Well it turns out I'm not great at my job. I readily offer to help everyday on the job and they wave me off so I haven't had the opportunity to practice any of my skills. I think they are worried I can't handle the physical aspect of it and maybe I can't because I'm quite meek compared to an excitable German Shepard and such. I've lost my grip too many times already, literally, and had an animal get away from me. No one trust me to work with them now. My new boss though gives me the worst anxiety, he seems to be really happy and the joking type with all my co-workers until I try and talk to him. I try my hardest to start a conversation with him and he gives me one worded answers in a bored, sometimes exhausted tone. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, I'm still learning and I feel like no one is giving me any grace for it. There is a someone who started the same time as me and whenever my boss needs something he calls him instead, both of us had no prior experience.. 

Because of this I have been having trouble getting out of bed on my days off. I have lost interest in everything, including my hobbies. I have been having crying fits in the shower and nightmares about work. 

I'm considering calling it quits but I just started so I'm not sure. I don't want anyone to think poorly of me or to know that something is wrong with me but I just feel more like a liability than an asset at work and I can't stand feeling stupid/invisible.

I knew my girlfriends parents had an abusive history. My dad is a native man, and I'm a native woman. 

So one day my dad helps us out with  my gfs parents car, at her house, and my gfs dad looks at us weirdly. We blow it off.  Didn't seem like micj

But later on after my gf came out as trans I was banned from.the house for a bit, so we moved out for a month. Then when we moved back in and we thought all was well. my gf goes to talk through being trans with her dad. And she asks her mom about her dads racist history towards Asian people, she then states that hes also racist towards indigenous people. 

So my girlfriend goes to the meeting, and she asks him about it and he's like ""oh they're lazy and alcoholics"" and my gf said ""has it changed your perception of OPs dad"" and her dad said ""it doesn't matter"" mind you, he hasn't made any eye contact or looked at me for months, and then she asked if it changed his perception of me, and he said ""doesn't matter"". 

A couple months later, he asks my gf what ""I do"" and she was like ""same thing as me"" and he was like ""what fuck all?"" And she said ""what are you trying to get at"" and he was like ""they're all lazy""

Now, fast forward a few months later, the BLM protests are heating up, and I make a comment about hating Canada for the fact that they often follow along Americas side. He goes ""then leave"" and my girlfriend starts yelling at him because I'm indigenous and literally residing on anishinaabek territory, my tribe. And I started sobbing and I've been terrified since. 

I can't look at his face, and I can barely leave my room. Before I moved bedrooms the bathroom was upstairs and I was downstairs, I'd get so anxious I'd refuse to use the bathroom until after midnight. I also won't eat until he leaves the house Bcs he makes me so nervous. I just want to vomit.

201,"This will require some explanation/backstory:

Ended a 6 month relationship in May with a guy with quite the flirtatious past. He was notorious for being the ""player"" type and my silly self still decided it was a good idea to pursue a relationship with him at the time because he was fun to be around and we had good chemistry.

Halfway into the relationship, I noticed little things that started to bother me, like the fact that he was following so many promiscuous IG pages and constantly liking photos of girls who he barely knew (I get it, celebrities are different. I'm really not a controlling bitch, but I have my limits about what's appropriate in a relationship). I advised him that for his career and future as a professional public figure in his field (not in the entertainment industry), maybe it would be better if he didn't follow pages of half-naked girls. He acknowledged ""You're right, I never thought of that. Half of these girls mean nothing to me and some of the girls I met once or twice were definitely troublemakers anyway."" So he unfollowed a bunch, I appreciated his effort, and life went on, until...

Fast forward 2 weeks post-breakup: I was lonely/upset/hurt about the breakup and was so isolated not seeing anyone during quarantine, I decided to scroll YT and IG and and followed a few new guy pages; NONE of them were promiscuous or anything that would make me look ""bad"", and in fact they posted mostly about their professions, which I really admired. Soon after, my ex messages me ""nice to see you trying to get attention from all these new guys. just letting you know one of my exes actually dated 'guy X' and he's not the greatest dude. but if you want i have a lot of mutual friends, i can ask them to hook you guys up."" OBVIOUSLY saying all of this out of spite because of what I ""made"" him do during our relationship. I got so pissed and told him it's absolutely none of his business what I do after our breakup (I could go full on slut-mode and technically it shouldn't matter), and I told him to buzz off and mind his own business. But he kept insisting that I was a hypocrite for making him unfollow so many people that make him look bad, but somehow following and liking these guys with amazing professional careers (who barely show any skin) makes me a hypocrite? None of these guys compare to the breast-showing, basically naked girls that he used to follow...

Hilariously enough after he ""confronted"" me, he decided to re-follow some of the girls he said were ""bad news / trouble"" and started liking their photos again. Disappointing to see him going back to his old ways, but I never spoke out once about it, because I know it's not my place anymore since we're no longer together.

Fast forward AGAIN to just now (2 months post-breakup), I follow another person (again for his inspiring career posts, and I happen to have many close mutual friends who also know him personally) and my ex messages me yet again ""hey just letting you know again haha i have friends that are friends with this ""guy Y"", fyi"". I am utterly shocked that he is doing this to me a second time. I'm so triggered, but also find it amusing that he still keeps track of me so regularly.

B) if she just stops paying rent, will I have to take her to court???

208,"So, I feel like I know the answer to my issue...but maybe need to process/vent/get validation. I’m a case manager/dean at my school and manage a team of about 15 teachers. 
I have a teacher whose been at my school for years, and is great. She’s worked on different grade level teams and been stipended for her work on testing at our school. 

She has very particular requests for what she teachers/having an extra prep period. She was able to get this the past school year, but it’s not available for the current school year. (Also, prep periods may be a moot issue since we’re most likely remote...)
I told her I would do my best to honor her preferences and tried to keep her updated on the process. 
Long story short, we’re not able to give her her preferences (I guess we technically could, but it would make it messy for the rest of our team, and less efficient overall). I emailed her teaching assignments and she’s upset (and I get why). 

I know I need to LAFT (listen, apologize, fix, thanks) the situation. I know that she is upset and has a right to be, but I just feel super shitty. But I also feel that I can’t put one person’s requests above the rest of the team. I just feel bad for maybe leading her on that I could’ve created her ideal schedule. 

Anyway, I know it will be ok. It has to be. But mainly looking for advice/commiserations on how to deal with similar situations.",25Jul2020,1

I also have super nerdy hobbies (competitive trading card games) that my old friends all new about were chill about but I was don’t think I would have made many friends if I went full nerd one everyone. So I kinda built a fake personality when I went to school and I did make some friends that seem nice.

211,"I'm a 24 ur old guy.  

Believe it or not but I would much rather work 55 hour work weeks in retail then to deal with going to college for a higher paying job.  

So I've tried college several times.  I've hated it each time I set foot on the campus.  My parents want me to go to college and to get a higher paying job. They have nagged me like crazy so I just picked a career path at random and went with it.  I really have no interest in the career but I'm doing it anyways to satisfy my parents.  

This last semester, I failed a few classes due to not wanting to do them in the first place.  This means I'll need to retake the class and also, I won't be eligible for a grant anymore.  Now I need to pay for the next semester out of pocket.  Parents don't know that though.  

Now I have been happily working 2 jobs with the dreaded thought in the back of my mind that I'll need to dump all my hard earned money down the toilet just to make my parents happy.  I don't really want to get student loans but if I need to, I will.  

Now that July is nearly over, my parents are on my case more then ever for me to get classes for the fall.

  I wanna just move out and if I see a need for college, then I'll advance to that...but if I don't, I won't go.  The issue with this though is my parents are hell-bent on me getting a wife and family.  So I couldn't provide for the family if I was working 2 basic jobs. I don't want a wife and kids though so I really don't see a point.  But to my parents, it's evil to not want a wife and kids.  Another issue is that I'm 24 and my dad will go ballistic if I tell him what I really wanna do.

I'm 22 about to start grad school and work a part-time job (15/hr with minimal overtime) and have over $3,000 saved and over $1,000 in stocks and Roth IRAs. I recently met my partner who I can see being with for the rest of my life, but it's still new so I'm not trying to be a ball in chain. We've had unprotected sex twice in the same week and the last time resulted in sperm in my lady parts. I took plan B, but I'm still weighing my options. I might possibly be pregnant - I've been feeling nauseous since we had sex. My partner doesn't have a job and is a convicted felon. With COVID-19 happening, I'm wondering what I should do if I do turn out to be pregnant. Before my partner, I thought I wouldn't be married or have children, but now I'm reconsidering the child part. I'm a firm believer that to be a parent you have to be self-less and an ideal situation would be to have a lot of money. I don't know when I'll ever be ready to be a mom, but for some reason, this possible child seems right. My ideal situation would be that my partner and I have full-time jobs and I graduate out of grad school (in two years). If I were pregnant, I could do my degree from home, pay off the loan while I'm working, live at home till I get a full-time job, and then move out. But COVID is so unpredictable and I don't know what this financial future is looking like. If you were in my situation what would you do? Abortion? Have the child?",25Jul2020,6

218,"I (17F) have grown up around overly sexual comedies (There’s something about Mary, Two and a Half Men, etc) consistently playing on the TV. I knew most things about sex in third grade from these and he never tried to hide anything like this. He’s always making crude jokes that take things too far, slap my moms ass when she gets genuinely angry about it, and more. He used to do this thing where if my mom was on the side of the bed getting ready, he would “jokingly” throw her back on the bed and lay on top of her, but all the while he would be making sexual innuendos and gross comments. My mom was sick of these things and had a long conversation (this is after 20 years of this shit) and he kind of stopped. During this period (about a year) after they talked and had issues, I dug into their phones. Skipping some other personal stuff, my dad had loads of porn. None of it was beastiality or pedophilia or anything like that, but there was one about a college aged girl in the title. Blah blah blah I told my sister, she confronted my parents without me because I thought it would be dumb, and my mom got pissed because she considers porn cheating as you are getting off to another woman. 

Skip ahead about two years to now. My dad still constantly makes comments about other women, most of them extremely young (like college aged), and I am always hearing “jokes” with a sexual nature to them. What really set this up again, though, just happened a couple of days ago. (It’s in a list format to keep it short)

We were at the lake, I was on the boat with only my dad, and the boat needed gas. We stopped at the marina, a young girl came up, and she tied up our boat and started pumping gas. She had a tiny bikini on and a hat with her college on it. The college was local and my dad started talking to her in almost a flirty tone asking her about the school. When we were waiting for a receipt, my dad got out his phone and “subtly” took a picture of this girls ass in a bikini. 

I confronted him in a joking way and he tried to laugh it off saying that he was just sending it to a friend. His excuse was seriously just “yes I, a fifty year old man, am taking a picture of a 20 year olds almost naked ass to send to my fifty-year old friend” and that was supposed to make it better. When I brought up that she was [my sister’s] age, he tried to back peddle and say that the girl was probably older. My sister is in college about to graduate. I then said that she could have been 18 going to school, which would mean I was almost the same age. 

Because I was pissed and disgusted, when the family got together, I “jokingly” brought it up. He again tried to pass it off, this time saying that the girl was asking for attention because of her bikini and that no one who works at Marinas are wearing swimsuits other than for “tips”. At a fucking marina at a ducking lake. 

So now I have to deal with my issues I already had from being exposed to sex my entire life but now I really know that my dad is a few years from being a pedophile. Idk what to do. I find it disgusting and when he gets near I get uncomfortable. I have always been grossed out by sex and kissing and consider myself asexual and I never thought it was because of these issues but this has really thrown me. I’m just obsessed with it and mad at myself for saying it out loud because I think it really hurt my moms feelings like with the porn.

It was dark, silent and late at night. We were making out, when the guy went a little beyond what I was okay with doing sexually. I froze, didnt know what to do. Just waited for the thing to get over and woke up the next day with a bad hangover. Spoke to the guy casually and went on with life. The incident however took its toll on me a few days later, and then kept bothering me for months.

231,"My father has always been a pretty crappy person, and my mom has always defended him. For example he stole my money for drugs for many years, ignores most of his other children, is super manipulative and verbally and emotionally abusive towards all of us, etc. My mom had issues with her father being physically abusive sometimes when her and her siblings were younger. However he stopped, cleaned up his act, and did a full 180. When my father recently physically assaulted me (F20) because I told him he shouldn't be swearing at and threatening my 10 year old brother, my mom used what happened to her as a reason why what happened to me wasn't that bad, that I should just get over everything that's happened in the past, blames me for calling the police on him, etc. 

I love my mom, I really do, but I can't deal with her ridiculous behavior anymore. She says she's hoping for the day her kids (my brother &amp; I) and her husband can all be home together as the court put a protective order against my father for my brother and I who have both been staying with our maternal grandparents. Despite me talking to her about why this is wrong many many times, she continues to make it seem like I'm just exaggerating and that I should apologize to my father for not respecting him and forget about everything. 

This whole situation is just a huge shock to me. There have been a lot of awful things happening in my life recently but this really takes the cake. In this situation, my options basically are:

1) Move in with my grandparents but leave my little brother who I love with our lunatic parents (I would have to replace most of my belongings, might not get to see my brother as much, would probably make my relationship with my mother worse, etc.)

Brother does his own thing and doesnt use money on me unless mom can't afford what I want or if he wants to bond with me and go to a movie or something. My mom is my main source of money. 

All I do is want her to buy things more me. She has the money for it but I still feel guilty. Right now in quarantine, she doesn't get paid enough and the last time she checked her bank account there was only $50 or so (she just got paid Monday though). At the beginning of quarantine, I asked for a Nintendo Switch and the new Animal Crossing, which cost about $270. I wanted to die, it was so expensive for us, and I knew that I'd eventually get uninterested and toss it to the side. A couple years ago, I wanted to build a guitar so I asked her for all the supplies, she brought up a kit that was only $200 but instead I wanted all the shit I had found that went into a guitar that cost a whopping $700. Now I want a tactical shovel ($200) and an Oculus Rift ($300).

All I do is ask her to buy me things and at the time we can afford it but eventually I will have proven to waste her money. She loves me and wants me to be happy but all I do is put her in debt. I can't get a job because I'm too young and I wouldn't even be able to go to an interview because I have such horrible chronic anxiety (I have meds). I want to repay her in cash, I already try and help around the house as much as I can but I only feel worse because it costs money to use electricity to vacuum, water to clean clothes and dishes, and I'm always on my phone and electronics and charging has to cost something I don't know about. I just want to distract myself but everything costs her money. She tells me it's okay but I can't help but feel it's not and I'm disappointing her, she almost never mentions that she has some sort of problem with being poor or not having enough money at all. I keep bringing up disowning me so she doesn't have to pay so much money but of course she thinks I'm just joking and brushes it off.

I'm very tired of feeling guilty and costing money. I want money to stop being a problem for me but I don't know how to get money, no one wants to buy our old shit. 

TL;DR: I keep wanting things that cost money and everything costs money. I want to distract myself but everything for distraction costs money. Money is a huge problem and anxiety trigger for me.

238,"Hey guys, so I recently have been realizing that my family is not so normal compared to my friends' families. I've always known my parents drink a lot more than other families, but recently it has been coming to light a lot more. 

I am going into my senior year of high school and am turning 18 in a few months. Since I was in about fourth or fifth grade, I remember them going outside to our garage to drink and hangout every night. I remember I texted my sisters as a joke that the ""drunks"" were coming inside and my mom took great offense to that. Since then, she swears that she just ""drinks tea"" or ""only drinks half shots."" 

Recently, we had a family zoom call which included our distant relatives that we don't see a lot. My parents did their daily drinking before the family zoom call (which me and my sisters estimate is about 2-3 beers and 2-4 shots a night) Then, they proceeded to drink 8 shots in 20 minutes. I don't drink or smoke or anything but how can your body even handle that? Like what? I watched them walk down the hall way while desperately holding on to each other.  Anyways, the point is that they have been drinking and getting drunk almost every night for about 8 years, and the worst part is that I really cannot talk to them after 5 pm. We have a garage that we call the ""barn"" and I cannot go up to the barn when they are up there or tell them what I'm doing because it is such a pain and I get so fucking pissed that I can't even look at them. 

My mom always either gets sad for no reason or ropes me into talking to her for 30+ minutes about the same exact thing over and over. She repeats herself so much when she's drunk it really pisses me off. Also, I am so embarrassed that I can barely have friends over, and when I have company over, it is only my girlfriend, and whenever we come home and see that they're ""downstairs"" we either leave or sneak up so we cannot be dragged into talking or witnessing them just eating in complete silence. 

Sometimes, they don't even acknowledge me. The past few weeks, I've had to either make myself dinner or buy it. I'm not a chef by any means, and don't really cook all that much, so most of the time I just buy myself food. My parents eat at around 8:30, but cooks their food at like 4:00 - 4:30. But, she asks me what I want to eat at around that time, and I say I'm not hungry, and no one wants to eat that early, or have their food be sitting for 4 hours, but they don't care because they are so drunk every night that I can bet you they cannot even taste it. I've spent over $250 on food in the past few weeks just because my mom wouldn't even ask me if I wanted anything to eat, or, if she did, she wouldn't: make it for me, or would make it 5 hours in advance.

Also, my parents' drinking has caused me a lot of anxiety when I'm out late at night or driving late. Because, if I get into an accident or something were to happen to me, I can't even call them to pick me up because I know they will not be able to drive. So, I always think to myself that if anything happens I'll just call my sisters that live 3 hours away and just tell them. 

It's really fucking annoying that I have to deal with this, but whenever me or my sisters try to talk to them about it, they just either deny it or say that it isn't a problem. 

They have gone through at least 10 bottles of jim beam in the last two months and probably 2 30 packs of miller lite. I'm really not sure what to do, and it's really annoying not having anyone to talk to after 5 pm every night. It really sucks.",25Jul2020,1

I was driving home from my boyfriends with my windows rolled down. The car next to me had his windows rolled down bc he was smoking and I smiled at him be he looked cute and fun and we drove together and kept smiling he even blew a kiss at me and I smiled a genuine smile😁after a few lights I had to turn and he went straight he was upset that I had to turn. Probably bc we drove together for awhile and we kept making faces at each other. He looked at least 19 or 20 and I was 17 almost 18(I’m 18 now). I wish I got his number or something but I also feel really terrible bc it feels like I’m cheating but idk what I would want from that guy besides the knowledge of who he is. If I knew him then I probably wouldn’t be thinking ab it so much because he is an unknown and something new.

243,"TLDR: I have a long  complicated history with this guy who I love deeply. If we break up, I’ll be alone. If I stay with him, he gets to have his cake and eat it too. What should I do?

Started dating 10th grade, broke up when I went to college 1000 miles away, lasted about 2 months before going back to texting/calling everyday, did long distance, didn’t work cause he wanted my attention 24/7 but I was in school, broke up, he broke down and became independent of me which was good, did open relationship for awhile, tried to date other people, neither of us like anyone we dated, I moved halfway across the country to be with him, I moved in with him, and then he acted like he never wanted me to be there to begin with. Trying to work out problems and every time I say there’s something wrong it never gets solved or fixed. I’m in love with someone who can’t love me, it’s like he doesn’t want to involve me fully in his life: makes vacation plans without me, will take off work for things that he wants to do but will say he can’t go to things with me cause he has to work, is mostly only affectionate when he’s drunk, shows up to my house super late unannounced when I wanted him to come over earlier, I feel like I’m begging him to involve me in his life and plans and happiness. But I moved to be with him, so I have very little friends here and I rely on him inviting me places to socialize and he’s basically my only friend. If I dump him I will ultimately be very alone in a pandemic in an American city but if I stay with him I’m forced to lower my expectations to essentially be with a fuck buddy except he won’t let me sleep with other people.

248,"This is my first post so be brutally honesty and critics are very appreciated.

A little back story. For almost all my life i have had a motto of, ""It would be easier to not"". Yes i was lazy, I found every excuse to justify my not wanting to do anything really. I met my now ex of  four years whose motto was ""Do better"". We broke up 4 months ago. She challenged me in every way possible, but the issue was those two personalities can clash, especially as we grow and grew, i no longer think my motto ever and she didn't see the better of who i was, and I had to high of expectations of her to acknowledge the growth. but now today I am very motivated to learn and know all the world has to offer. I chose to learn to speak Norwegian, computer program(Web design, Full stack develop, And python for potentially machine learning), read tons of books about philosophy, and Ted Talks daily. Why not free information for personal betterment?

But the issue I face, is I am singularly focused to such a detriment its debilitating, I learn Norwegian and all i think about is this topic, this stream of focus. To the point where when i come home i Duolingo and listen, watch norwegian netflix shows and listen to Norwegian podcasts just to get the influence of it, regardless how small. Its narrow focused. Then when i feel ""burnt out"" I shift the focus to programming where i eat, breathe and dream about it. And it flip flops from passion to passion. I love learning. Its my crux. I lived this cycle before we broke up to. But with that being said id ignore all the necessities of life, such as  laundry, dishes, cooking, cleaning, its not so terrible you'd be mortified, but I wouldn't move in with a person seeing that lifestyle.

So my personal diagnosis is, that its easier to control the information inputs and that to deal with the emotional pain of my own inner turmoil is too much to look at. My personal discontentment. How do you figure out what and where that stems from? I am aware that this is all a distraction from a burning hole in my existence that i do not know how to fill, nor do i know why this empty void exists. I have not had an extreme amount of adversity influence me, my life has had its challenges but in comparison to the general population its mild. Maybe I need to dig deep and figure this all out

So I ask this. What is your perspective, opinion(No matter how harsh, truly lay in. I need the tough love. I can justify anything), system for shifting the focus to taking care of all the things. How do you balance the passion and life?  And have you had this happen.

If you got this far, thanks for reading, you are the real MVP. Thank you.

249,"My best friend recently got into a new relationship with a person she's been friends with for a couple years.  While they're relationship contains a lot of sex (she talked about this with me when they first started seeing each other), they do go on a couple of dates so she qualifies it as a relationship and not friends with benefits.  Any time me or any of our other friends try to hang out with her she blows us off to hang out with her boyfriend.  She also got her boyfriend a part time job in a field that a lot of our friends have been trying to work in that he is not even close to trying to get a job in. (Yes I do get that this is a person she is trying to be romantically involved in, but there is a difference between taking time to hang out with someone and completely revolving your life around them).
I guess I'm trying to ask, how do i go about talking with her about this? She's not one to talk about her feelings and got super defensive about her relationship to another friend.

My girlfriend then came over after (she was brought by my ex girlfriend) and said we had to talk. She then said that I had made her uncomfortable when we were intimate before. She said one time she had told me to stop for a second and I replied “don’t worry I can fix this” and kept going. She said she had great 100% consensual sex before and after that moment but she felt it was wrong. At the time I didn’t think it was a matter of consent, but really a matter of just trying to make it work. I felt so bad. I always have thought of myself as a feminist and an ally so to know I hurt her was devastating. Then I was contacted by my ex girlfriend and she said I had made her uncomfortable by pressuring her to be intimate early in our relationship, and that we were intimate at times she had previously stated she didn’t want to be. My girlfriend agreed she felt the pressure to be intimate. I never had any intentions of forcing anything on either of them and I always asked if they wanted to beforehand and told them it was completely okay if they didn’t. These two are my favorite people I’ve ever met and it devastates me that I hurt them.

I never had friends to hangout with outside of school because my dad always had to meet the parents which was hard because even if he did he did not trust them.  I took drivers Ed and failed not because I was horrific at driving but because I just needed more practice in some areas. I have gotten better a driving now and have improved but not perfect but when I practice with my mom I always get some sort of warming from my dad that just makes me nervous.

I can't even go on camping trips with family far out into our state without my dad super reluctantly letting me go or not at all because he scared what if we get stranded on the way or it's not safe etc.

I can't even get mad because im told I was raised better than to get mad or just give up for a bit to cool off. I can't have my own side in an argument on something like hanging out with friends at the movies because I have no life experience. I try to get my sister to help out or something but they text and call behind my back which just makes me feel a bit betrayed.

I have for about 2 to 3 years now just gave in to the mentality of just keep my mouth shut and agree and be mad about it in secret to avoid any argument. I just agree with whatever happens and now I have no hopes nor do I keep my expectations high that I will do anything interesting or go somewhere fun. I couldn't even take my own depression medication as my dad cold turkyed me off it saying we ran out because apparently he did not like the side effects.

I am always told to check in with my dad before I do anything and I don't want to but I do or I don't get to do it because I haven't moved out yet I know he does actually love me but he feels and is controlling and uses guilt trips to get me to listen or to apologize after an argument saying stuff like I don't listen anyway or I don't give a rat's ass about what he does to keep a roof over our heads etc. I can't disagree with other family members or my dad gets after me and says im being disrespectful I can't even try to problem solve because he gets stressed and says he deals with enough I was never really allowed to make my own mistakes in life besides a relationship with a girl.

I cant be romantically interested in girls because my dad has instilled that women are gonna hurt me and they could accuse me of rape or abuse for disagreeing with them and then my last relationship happened and that just reinforced it and now I'm kind if scared to be intimate with anyone.

Background info: My (21M) youngest sister (14F) just turned 14, and hosted a joint birthday gathering type thing with a close friend.  Unrelated but relevant, about a week ago my sister (let's call her A) was hanging out with friends and had to call me to pick her up because she'd wet herself. No big deal, all the bathrooms were closed, it was a hot day and they were hydrated, they'd been out for a while, kinda unavoidable. Definitely wasn't her fault, and she laughed it off with her friends, although she was understandably upset on the way home. She didn't want anyone else, including our parents, to know. 

Okay, so a week later, and the party is going well, they've invited about 8 of their closest friends and out parents and the other birthday girls parents are there. Everyone is done with dinner, time to eat cake. We sung happy birthday, the girls blew out individual candles, and we're about to cut the cake when someone says something that reminds the other birthday girl, we'll call her H, hears something that reminds her of the incident, and makes a joke along the lines of ""Haha, it's us when A peed herself the other day."" Out of all the people at the party, only H and one other girl knew, so a couple of girls asked for clarification, which she provided. 

A had been completely frozen, but at this point she turns bright red and looks like she's about to cry. Instead, she turns on H and starts yelling about how mean it was to bring that up. H gets upset, cries, and so her parents freak out. 
 Meanwhile, A has run inside crying. 

So, long story short, I found her in her room, she cried, now she's asleep on me, and the guests left an hour early. 

The thing is, her friend didn't know she was embarrassed and probably thought they were just joking around. She also has a bit of an issue with social cues, and she didn't mean any harm. And now A ended up missing the second half if the party she's been looking forward to for months and our parents know what happened. 

Also, A is bound to be upset with her self for reacting that way and missing her own party, and H is mad at A for yelling at her. 

How do I explain H's side of what happened without sounding like I'm taking sides against A?

What can I do to help her feel better?

The issue is that my rent has been raised recently (I was kicked out of my dads house and let back in and he raised my rent, saying I’d have to pay that if I wanted to live here) and I immediately asked for more hours. He recently has been giving me two 5 hour shifts a week and hasn’t scheduled me for this week. 

Ive been working at this place for over two years now, and now he’s given the newbies who just started working, way more shifts than me. I’ve applied to some other jobs just to pick up more hours. My rent is $400 and that’s how much I make a month...

It’s super frustrating and I don’t know what I should do. I’m not the best employee (I have those days where I make mistakes upon mistakes) but I’m good, dependable, and do my job correctly (most of the time). I’ve always been treated like shit at this job and it’s all catching up. Should I quit? I don’t even know anymore.",25Jul2020,2
273,"I just feel like my life is over, and it hasn't even started, mainly because I'm in so much debt from student loans, and my major isn't in STEM. I graduated with a degree in Journalism in August of 2019, and shortly after got hired for a paid PR internship across the country in the Bay Area, because I wanted to switch into PR as it offers a bit more flexibility than journalism. I'm originally from Delaware which is the capital state of boring in the country because there's literally NOTHING there and 0 prospects of jobs in my industry. So right smack dab in the middle of my first real-world working experience, COVID happened and we went remote in March.

They didn't hire me after the 6-month process because they went on a hiring freeze, so I just ended up getting a 3-month sublet from May-July while I applied for other jobs in hope that I would find something before the lease ended. I got two interviews, one of which was a marketing position for a digital publishing company that was like exactly what I wanted to do. It was such a long process, and they ended up hiring someone else, so I'm not flying back home in a few days since the lease is ending. For the time being, I've been saving my UI benefits, and been paying off my loans which I requested to be reduced temporarily for 6 months, but they're going back up to full price come September.

I don't have any clue where the hell I'm going next. At home, I'll continue to apply, but it just sucks because there's really no options in the communications industry there. I just feel so talentless because my primary experience has been in editorial work and a bit of PR, but other than that I have no real skills.  My plan is to continue to expand my knowledge in digital marketing by taking online courses, and applying for marketing positions since it pays better, and I can do more in that field. But I just feel like a big gigantic failure w/ no future right now. My confidence has lowered significantly due to these rejections, making me feel as though I'm never good enough to get hired by people.  And I just feel so directionless right now. I hate Delaware so much, and I don't want to be back to sharing a room with my 13-year old sister. I just don't know what to do.",25Jul2020,1

275,"Teachers and professors, avert your eyes for this one lol

So, my summer's been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. Me \[f18\] and my boyfriend \[m18\] are both in the same university program, and he, despite being highly math-averse, decided to take condensed math and physics courses this term. This math-aversion, combined with the courses being online and his ADHD, resulted in almost no studying. I felt for him, so every time I saw him (don't want to give my location, but covid's not a rampant issue anymore here) at least 2 or 3 hours were dedicated to me dragging him through the coursework, since I'd already taken both courses. This wasn't enough. I still had to do the vast majority of the work for the quizzes. Then, it turned out that the math course's exams were proctored via webcam. So, we studied really hard for a week, then he wrote the exam himself and failed. Dropped the course. Physics carried on in the same fashion.

Now we're less than a week away from the final. He's been able to do a bit more himself, but I doubt he'd be able to pass. I've been less able to see him in person due to work and my own courses, but over the last week I've been reminding him over and over to study. I have no clue if he did or didn't, but my gut feeling says no. I'm super torn on whether I should help him with the (unproctored) final.

On one hand, this is kind of my fault, isn't it? I enabled this. I approached this the wrong way. I acted as a tutor, but I think what he needed was study strategies. All I did was teach him the content, worked on the stuff he had most trouble with, said ""okay, here's what you should work on"" and left him to his own devices. His own devices, unfortunately, were usually csgo or something similar. Also, the math and physics courses both happened to be expensive as sin, and I think he'd have to pay his parents back for them. Guy doesn't have a job due to covid, so add that entire situation to the guilt pile. On top of that, he genuinely fears that he'd be kicked out if he failed this course. I don't know how true that is, but he also confided to me at a separate time that he'd probably kill himself(!!!) if he was ever kicked out. (I don't view this as manipulative, by the way. I see the issue, but I just think he's highly anxious about the whole thing. Also, subadvice: how does one best help a suicidal boyfriend?) So it's almost like I can't just leave him in the ditch now, after I've set this as the standard.

But on the other hand, he's his own man. I can't be responsible for someone else's actions at the end of the day. This whole thing has really gone against my personal beliefs, to be honest. I dislike people who take advantage of others academically. This has happened to me over and over throughout my life because I'm a massive doormat, but it's never been this soul-crushing. Physics is also going to be key in our degree, so I feel like he'd be super fucked down the road. Like, this is the introductory course, and he genuinely knows none of it. He would benefit from doing it again for real (in person, preferably.) But that brings me back to the previous issue: he doesn't know how to study.

So yeah. I just want people to weigh in on this one. I'm genuinely at a loss here, and this is the only way I'm getting a decision made, since the entire situation sends me into panic. Do I do the final for my boyfriend or not?",25Jul2020,2
276,"So this whole post is kind of a trainwreck and I apologize for that, I have a lot to say and no way to say it. 

I really need to get this off my chest, even if no one cares because I cannot tell the one person I want to. Me and my best friend (we are both 19 year old women) have been practically inseparable since we were six. We have been through so much together, we have both had a few traumatic experiences (her more than me) that we have helped each other through. She is the person I tell everything to, even though I dont have much to tell. As stupid and cheesey as it sounds we really are connected in a way.

 I started kind of crushing on her last year, I didn't think much of it and tried to ignore it (which I did). The crush kind of faded away to where I could just be her friend, but recently it has come back with a vengeance. She came out to me as Bi maybe 5 months ago, and I really got my hopes up for just a minute. And then she told me she was talking to a girl and they were going on a date. Hope crushed. I wished her luck, and gave her all my support, and silently cheered when she came back from her date and told me she wasn't into what's-her-name. 

Skip forward to now, she was talking with another girl but that didn't work out either and we were talking and she told me that she doesn't even care if it's a fling or something more, she just wants to see if she really likes girls or not. And I really feel the same (I'm not sure what my sexuality is, I would rather not label myself without trying out my possibilities). I wanted to offer to test with her but I don't know how she would respond to that, I feel like she'd think I was being weird. Just for more information, I am a virgin (relationship and sex wise) she is not. 

I'm really afraid to tell her that I have actual romantic feelings for her for fear of ruining our friendship, I would love if she would want to let me be her experiment but I also don't know how to go about proposing that. She is very into casual sex I just don't know if she would want that with me, for the obvious friendship ruining reason and the fact that she is way out of my league; she is fucking GORGEOUS and I am just your below average overweight loser. I don't want to suggest we fool around, have her say no, and then have things be awkward. Or if she says yes and things don't go well, that would also be awkward. I don't know if that would break us apart though, I want her in my life no matter what. I just hope she holds me in the same regard.

I would really appreciate some help here. I don't know what to do, or if I should just keep things the way they are and just pretend I'm okay with it.",25Jul2020,1
277,"TL;DR: I have issues with my parents and I want to run away from home but I don't really know what to do.

I'm an 18 year old female thinking about running away from home or going my own way. I don't know if this is a good idea because I haven't finished my last year of senior high yet, I don't know if I can pay for college or my life expenses, and I'm scared. I'm scared because I've been way too dependent on my parents my whole life.

But that's the thing, I don't want to be dead weight on my parents anymore and my mom has been really vocal about it these past few years. As for my dad...I don't really talk to him since he works overseas and my childhood with him was never the best. Not to mention, my mom is quite controlling, she has no regards of my feelings or at least shows no signs of it.

She loves to criticize me in every way I do and stands around to watch me which makes me really anxious. If she doesn't get what she wants, she'd yell at me. She even tells about my failures to her co-workers whom I see most of my school years because they work at the university I'm going to (my mom is a college professor, teaching industrial engineering). Don't get me wrong, I love my mom. I really do. But she contributed a lot to my anxieties and she can be pretty toxic. She also forces a lot of things on me that I don't like and like I've said, she's rather controlling.

My dad meanwhile had said some pretty hurtful stuff that I haven't yet gotten over with even though it's been years already. His clear favorite is my younger sister, he implied that he regrets having a failure like me when I was ten just the night before his departure, implied it again on the day of his departure, has raised a hand on me more than once ever since I was four (and not just the light spanks, he'd slap me, he'd belt me, he'd lock me out of the house over the littlest things). Maybe I'm just too sensitive but it does still affect me up to this day.

However, I think my dad's been making up for it recently or maybe it's just because he lives overseas that he can't really do anything to us. I don't really know.

NONE of my parents ever tried to understand me, never tried reaching out to me, and when I tell them about how I feel, I'd be punished for it.

One more thing to add is that my dad wants me to become an architect even though I don't want to but as soon as I mentioned about having any other careers once, he got a little bit mad. I've told my mom countless of times that I want to pursue a different career BEFORE my dad even had the thought of me becoming an engineer but has somehow forgotten all about it.

My friend said she'd help me but I don't really know what to do. Should I just endure 5-6 years more at home even though the atmosphere suffocates me most of the time? Or should I go my own way as soon as I finish senior high? Can I even afford to pay for my own college fees? Am I going to make the right choice if I don't choose to become an architect like my dad wants me to be?

I don't really know. I don't want to be dead weight to my family anymore and I don't want to be unhappy for the rest of my life by choosing a career path I never wanted, but I am afraid of what would happen to me if I did decide to go my own way. These thoughts have been plaguing my mind for years now and I just recently turned 18 and I still have no idea about what I should do.

EDIT: If it's any help, I live in the Philippines and most of us Filos don't really move away from home as soon as we hit college or turn 18.",25Jul2020,1
278,"I’m going to refer to the friend as B. They’re a wonderful person. Unfortunately, they are in a very bad place. They hardly want to eat, get out of bed, and they don’t find joy in anything anymore, not even their hobbies. B only takes care of themselves if forced. They are too anxious to ask for help publicly (for ex. subreddits like this one) or in groups, and due to past events with others, are too afraid to talk to me or other close friends. They can’t request to see a therapist (parents wouldnt allow it) or seek one out themselves as they are a minor. Most of their issues stem from their horrible treatment at home, if not all of them. B isn’t allowed to leave.

Usually they’ll bottle up their emotions. Once in a while they might vent to themselves in obscure places, but I can never get to them in time to comfort them. It might be days before I learn that B was feeling down,, I hate that I could do nothing. I’m the only one actively reaching out to them. They know I’m there for them whenever they need me, but I think I can do better. What should I do? I know there’s no simple fix for these things, I just wish I could make it a little easier on them.

280,"My mom has recently gotten me a gift that I’ve been asking for for years as a graduation present. Yeezys. Ever since they released I’ve wanted a pair. Now right before I’m supposed to go off to college my Mom and Dad said they wanted to talk to me. They talked about me becoming an adult. Ya know, the talk, stuff that every college student needs to know. Then at the end my mom gives me this box and inside we’re the Yeezys that I’ve been wanting forever. After I calmed down, thanked them, I started to notice some odd things about them such as the coloring of the SPLY portion of the shoe. After some research and asking different subreddits it’s clear that they were fakes. Normally I would let something like this go. Since I don’t want to seem ungrateful. But my mom later told me how she got them. She bought them off of a Facebook seller that consistently sells name brand clothing and items for cheap. According to my mom, “this woman only sells the real stuff not the knock offs.” This is where my problem lays. Should I keep my mouth shut and be happy with my gift, or should I warn her that what she’s buying from this seller is knockoffs. One last thing, I love the shoes. I actually like the SPLY not being colored, so in ways I like them better than the originals, although it’s disappointing they aren’t real it really doesn’t matter to me due to the difficult way my mom went through accruing them for me.

284,"Corona has made wedding planning a nightmare. I (23F) was so disappointed I couldn’t bring my whole gang of girls with me, so I took my moh (24F) to a small family run boutique where you can only be in the store for an hour (thanks to covid). 

MOH has been a bit distracted lately with a new job and planing to move into an apartment next week and has really been uninterested about the whole operation wedding, which is scheduled for next year in July. She hasn’t asked me any questions about it other than what color and style dress I want her to wear. While trying on dresses MOH snapped a few pics of the dress I fell in love with on my phone and starts looking at the bridesmaid dresses, leaving me alone with the lady who was helping us. I got myself out of the dress alone and went to find my MOH. Truth is we spent more time looking at bridesmaids gowns than wedding dresses. I looked at the pictures I was planning to show my family. Each one were sorta awkward. I, after regretting not looking at the pics before the clerk put the dress away, made another appointment to show my mom the dress in person, deleted the pics. 

MOH states she needs to go to a store to buy new items for her apartment. We had originally planned to go back home and start drafting for some DIY wedding decor but I said it was fine. I started playing a few of my “beautiful moment” wedding songs in the car, played the first dance song and she says “oh please do NOT dance to this”. It sort of hurt my feelings... I played another song, one I wanted to play as we entered the reception hall and she said she had a headache and turned off my radio herself... I mentioned to her we planned to get married on the local beach and she goes “are you serious? I hate the beach though. The sand makes me feel uncomfortable. Plus my boyfriend burns so easily.” I just stared at her and said “that’s where I want to get married, so I’m sorry but it’s happening.” She simply sighed and stared out the window. In Walmart, we talked a lot about her plans with her boyfriend and her apartment and new job. I felt myself getting more and more upset because I really wanted this day to be about my wedding. When we finally get back to her place she says her parents are expecting her to be home soon and leaves without saying goodbye. 

She obviously has other stuff going on. I want to have a conversation here but don’t know what to do.",25Jul2020,1
285,"I feel absolutely disgusted about how privileged I have been throughout my life and I don’t know what to do about it.

I am a 20-year-old white female, and I grew up having an upper-middle class family and lifestyle. My whole life, I have been extremely empathetic and eager to volunteer and help people and my community, and I am known in my community as an outspoken liberal activist and volunteer. I also try to donate as much money as I can to non-profits. I want to make people happy and I want to make the world a better place, and I’m not saying these things for a round of applause or for attention- that’s genuinely how I feel. World peace is all I’ve ever wanted my entire life. 

But seeing so many people in pain and seeing so much sadness in this world makes me HATE the privilege that I have. My life has been SO easy in comparison to other people’s. For context, my parents are extremely greedy and flashy with their money; they just bought a second home in Florida and all of our cars are practically brand-new and we’ve taken many exotic vacations. It makes me so upset every time my family’s money or privilege is brought up by my parents or literally anyone because I feel so guilty for the amazing life I’ve had so far. Why do I get an easy life, but other people don’t? What makes me so deserving of all of this fortune?

Those questions keep me up at night, and there have been many times where I have felt so guilty that I get suicidal. I wonder, why should I eat food when someone who is more hungry than me could be eating it? Why does my job pay me this much money; do I deserve it? Why do I get to go to college worry-free? Why me?

I want to make a difference in the world and to make it so that everyone can life happily and comfortably, but it makes me extremely depressed when I recognize that I will never be able to do that. It makes me feel like a waste of space and like me being alive is just lowering the number of resources in the world- resources that could go to someone else who needs them more. 

I guess my questions are the following: am I being overly empathetic or am I being reasonable? What kind of mindset should I have? Besides donating money, how can I use my surplus of privilege to help others? Do you have any other advice for me? I know that there are bigger problems in the world that need solving right now, but I’m spiraling and need some input. Seriously, any and all input is accepted and will be well-received here because I’m desperate and I needed a space where I could rant about my privilege lol.

286,"My boyfriend(M20) and I (F20) have been together for nearly a year. He’s never posted a single picture/video of us or me on any of his social media ever. I’ve posted countless videos and photos of us from dates and other events. I’ve asked him why he hasn’t before and he has told me that I’m his “hidden gem” and he doesn’t want the world to know how special I am, and that he wants to keep me to himself. He has posts on his finsta from before we met of other girls. One of the photos is of a professional snowboarder in which he captioned “I would pound her”. That shows me he’s never had a problem posting pictures of girls before, he even clearly demonstrated how he felt about her. Im starting to feel like the excuse he’s giving me about not posting about our relationship is complete bullshit.  

Every time I bring up the social media thing he immediately makes excuses like “I don’t even go on social media anymore”, or “i don’t want to post a selfie of us, i want to post nice pictures that we didn’t take” (we have a few photos that are not selfies and are of us together). After bringing this topic up, he will suddenly say things like “I don’t talk to anybody on social media, I don’t hang out with other girls, your the only person I see” when I never implied that he was seeing other people in the first place. I’ve been cheated on in both of my prior relationships. The minute he sees a guys name on my phone, weather it’s Snapchat, text or Instagram he gets silent. And will later ask me over text “who is  _____”. And everyone he has ever asked about has been either an old coworker wishing me congrats on the new job, or a friend from high school wishing me a happy birthday. I dropped all other guys the minute my boyfriend and I started talking. I’ve never cheated. Yet I feel like he is so defensive whenever I bring up social media, and is so intrusive when I get any message from a guy that is a simply a friend. He is extremely uncomfortable with me hanging out with guy friends, even tho they have offered numerous times to meet my boyfriend, and I have even invited my boyfriend to hang out with us. 

I’m concerned he is this defensive and worried because he is cheating. As they say, “a cheaters biggest fear is to be cheated on”. And these are signs Similar to the ones I’ve seen when I was cheated on in the past. 

I’ve mentioned nothing of me thinking he’s cheating to him thus far. 

I’m worried I may be overthinking this and letting fear consume me because of my past experience with cheating. Maybe I’m letting small things get to me because I’m afraid of getting cheated on again? Or am I ignoring red flags? 
Should I break it off? Should I straight up ask him? Am I being too pushy?!

It broke my heart that he never tried to apologize to me, or even approach me at all throughout 8th grade.

294,"I dont know exactly when it very first started but I've realized after just looking back at old messages that my parent has been borrowing money from me CONSTANTLY (at least once every month) throughout 2 YEARS.

It'll start off with $200 then more and more gets added. He always pays it back but sometimes he'll pay it back quick and other times it takes a long time and the amount stacks up. Its gotten to a point where he borrowed over $1,800!!! 

I dont mind lending money, its just I realized this is a constant cycle that seems like it wont end unless I say no. Its very tiring to have to constantly take out, put back, and keep track of my money. Its an inconvenience especially because Im planning on buying a car.

There was a time I finally found the perfect car. He borrowed hundreds of dollars and I really needed it back ASAP before the car sold out. He tried to say he can only give me some of my money back which wasn't going to work for me.

I feel guilty because he does favors I ask like taking me to look for cars but then again I dont ask as much as he asks to borrow money. I realized this has been going on for as long as when I started my VERY first job (and Im young)... He definitely has gotten used to borrowing from me when he over spends which is starting to bother me now especially sense Ill have expenses with my potential car.

The thing is, everytime I'll talk about something I found for our shared living space, she'll tell me to not talk about how it's inexpensive or secondhand. 

 I'm offended by this, since its actually what I'm able to afford as a full time student, and I dont have the same luxuries as her. It makes me feel like she doesn't want people to think she's...well..poor. 

Why is it wrong to talk about finding a good deal? Is it really insulting? Am I in the wrong here?

Life could go by so smoothly, but these people keep messing things up.

i have a younger brother who i’ll call jacob and he’s 12 years old. we are current in a bad situation and i don’t know what to do as we each have undiagnosed mental issues that our parents wont do anything about.
our father has become what i think to be abusive, he drinks quite often and yells at me and my brother. one saturday recently while i was at my friend’s house overnight the cops were called because he was yelling.
i am terrified of things escalating. he stopped drinking and smoking cigarettes in 2017 but picked it up again during quarantine. his health is going down again and its terrifying because my dad was the definition of “glow up”. he’s in his 50s and battled his addiction, diabetes and so many other issues for almost three years and its inspiring to me, but at the same time its so scary because he’s drinking and smoking again.
my brother and him share a room, and a bed, and he’s been very weird towards my brother lately especially when drunk and its making me extremely paranoid and sick.

303,"Hi this is my first post on Reddit, I’m looking for some advice. So my friend, we’ll call him Michael, has a crush on me. I know for several reasons; just little things he’s said, or friends have overheard him say to his friends, and the fact that my other friend, we’ll call him Brian, confessed to me. Maybe that wasn’t the best thing for him to do, but it was a very big secret to hold for someone else so I can understand why he told me. Besides, I already was pretty much aware. Anyways, he’s had a crush on me since at least 6th grade. I should mention I’m 14 and entering high school this year. I wanna let him know I know in a way that doesn’t hurt his feelings. I know I cannot wait for him to tell me because I know he never will. I’m scared because I know he suffers a lot from depression and self esteem. I don’t want to make anything for his mental health worse. But I don’t know how I can be comfortably friends with this huge secret. How should I say it? Should I wait? Thanks for any advice in advance, I’m just using reddit to exercise all my options. I’ve been talking about what to do with Brian and getting advise irl as well.

305,"(I’m a Highschool Female)

I know what an edgy joke is. I’m not some SJW stickler who takes everything too seriously. Matter a fact, I love laughing at funny race jokes people make, like John Mulaney, Dave Chappell, all that good stuff, but the keyword is “funny”

There’s this kid in the grade below me. Let’s call him Kenny. Kenny and I are in the same extracurricular and we talk on occasion. But every time he sees me, he insists on making a stupid n-word pass joke, or something like “oh, have I told you that I’m black now” or I don’t know, some joke that’s related to the fact that I’m black. It’s like the only trait he recognizes about me. Just to be clear, he’s not black.

Long story short, our club went on a trip, and I sat in the back of the bus where he and his friends were hanging out. I didn’t say much, but the conversation shifted to being about me. Of course, he makes a stupid joke about n-word passes, and people play off of it, making other stupid jokes. I played along, but then Kenny decided to say “hey OP, do you like picking cotton?”

It went ridiculously silent. Clearly people noticed that it was a bit too far. I tried to laugh it off, cause I hate awkward conversations, and he even apologized about it the same day. But he still makes those black people jokes when he sees me. 

I’d hate to think that someone who isn’t even out of high school is capable of being racist. Maybe it’s just the way he’s brought up at home, maybe not. I just feel uncomfortable when I’m around him. I try to be kind and brush it off, but I end up feeling like I should say something about it.

Is it rational to think he has some kind of prejudice against me?

Note: my school is predominantly white, so I’m normally one of the only black kids around.

Second Note: I’m not a civil rights activist. The last thing I would accuse some one of is being racists, if their actions didn’t fit the criteria.",25Jul2020,1

307,"A little while back, an online friend and I both allowed our friendship to die out. Tonight, when talking with a mutual friend, I heard that my ex-friend had no reason for no longer wanting to be friends anymore.  My reason to break it off with them before was that they were toxic overall, and didn't seem interested in a friendship. I mean, it even got to the extent of dreading checking my text messages from them and finding ways to reply to their ""k.""

Anyway, after hearing that they didn't have anything bad against me, I decided to reach out. We started talking, but we didn't immediately hit it off like we did before. I began worrying that it'll turn into how it used to be; I'm always afraid of their moody behavior. Now, I'm starting to regret re-friending them and initiating a conversation.

I'm not quite sure if I should tell them the ""on second thought..."" in the morning, as some things went fine and it would make no sense to (after all, I was the one who reached out and tried to make things not-so-awkward.) Or, maybe I should just keep going with it and whatever happens, will happen.

310,"Hi, I'm 16 F. Im gona talk about a few things, I just wana know what I should do, so just hear me out-

My dad has anger issues, my mom seems like a narcissist. They dont get along well. My mom owns a business and my dad is the only employee, and she expects alot from him so they are always arguing. When I was about 5 my dad moved to the basement. I barely spend any time with him because he usually only ever comes upstairs to get food or cook dinner. I maybe see him 4 or 5 times a day for like 5 minutes then he goes back downstairs.

Well anyway, I also have anger issues (him more than me) so I get it.  But he gets really angry sometimes. I understand what it's like to get uncontrollably angry.its not as bad as some other people, but sometimes he breaks things or whatever. I know he'd never hurt me but its scary. I usually just try to be helpful and help clean up the mess and fix whatever he broke before my mom comes home. I want him to be less angry.  I feel bad, I used to be as angry as him so I know what it's like. 

When my dad is in a good mood hes really playful and annoying. He still treats me like a little kid, like he'll tickle me and stuff. It makes me uncomfortable. I know he doesn't mean it in a bad way, it just makes me uncomfortable. He also sometimes hurts me, not in a mean way, but like a rough playful way, like how the boys I know mess around with eachother. I'd feel bad telling him to stop because we never actually spend that much time together.  I feel like it's his way of bonding or whatever.

Sometimes he gets like really drunk and goes on rants about politics, but the thing is, he literally hates people so he believes all your basic boomer politics.  When hes drunk he seems to get really mad that I'm ""wasting my life being lazy and not getting out"". Hes mad about that when hes not drunk, but more so when he is. I'm a very depressed person so I tend to stay in my pajamas 24/7 and stay on the couch. I understand I should be getting out but I think it's very annoying when your obviously drunk father is annoying you by poking and trying to tickle you just to go outside. 

I've told him countless times that I want to be a zookeeper, but he says I shouldn't because they dont pay well. He knows it's my dream yet he keeps making me feel like I should pursue it. He says if I want to work with animals I should be a vet which I've told him I dont want to be because of my terrible mental health. He still insists. 

(I've been to scared to say any of this to my therapist)

312,"I (28F) was recently approached for a possible promotion to management, and I am being asked to write my dream job description and negotiate my salary (after they found out I was looking for a second job during this pandemic). We’re a non-profit and pay is very low compared to other similar agencies.

I’ve been working in this unionized law office for the last eight years. We have a staff of about 100 people, eight of which are managers. I was hired when I was 21 as a paralegal but throughout the years I started redefining my role within the agency, thanks in part to my über-supportive managers. We’ve made significant improvements to the agency’s workflow, which thankfully, has been very well-received. 

As far as I know, management and staff have always had a strained relationship. The union has filed multiple grievances for what they believe were “unfair” promotions. After a recent promotion,  some of the comments ranged from “they’re making them management and taking money from our union “ to “I’ve been here 30 years, they’ve been here a hot minute”... not to mention the fact some have purposefully made work more complicated for those promoted. 

I’ve built a rapport with my most of my colleagues in the eight years I’ve been here. I’m now grappling with the possibility that there will probably be some pushback from my fellow staff and possibly some broken relationships, which makes me feel a little sad.

I’m also having to deal with my own personal insecurities. I &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt;I deserve this promotion, but I also think there could be another people better suited for the job. I also worry about my ability to fulfill the expectations in this new role in an extremely demanding and fast paced field. I also would like to see some of my longer standing colleagues being promoted alongside with me.

I’m still young, I’ve held a management position. I’m Worried about expectations and broken relationships at work. My relationship with the people at work has always been one of the things I’ve loved most about my job. 

I need advice on how to get out of my own head, learn to deal with conflict and accept that I can’t expect everyone to like me all the time!

315,"Not really sure how to start this. So, in February, not long before the country began closing down, I decided to move to a new City about 800 miles from home. My reasoning behind moving from home was because I honestly felt lonely, I didn't have to be but due to only what I can presume is undiagnosed depression. I've never taken action to get help for it because even when I have insurance the cost is far more than I can afford on a regular basis and quite frankly, laziness(probably from the depression). 

Well there had been several instances at home where I had been close to having awesome romantic relationships with really amazing people but then when I start to feel like those potential mates are pulling away I start to go into panic mode and feel a dread that if I lose them I'm going to have to go through several more years of crippling loneliness before I might find another person who feels a mutual attraction. Generally within months Ive somehow regressed into a sad puppy dog begging a person to ""give me a chance, please"" followed by several attempts to contact someone who has pretty much already decided I was a bit too much, rightfully so. With my social anxiety and lack of a solid social circle my only outlets for finding relationships have been Grindr, Tinder and more recently Taimi and I dont have to tell most of you how much dating through apps can wear down on a person's self esteem, energy, and general will power to date.

Well between the loneliness, depression and manic ""please love me"" episodes I had come to the conclusion last year that my issues were purely because I had been chronically smoking weed for almost 8 years with honestly no breaks and it had escalated to a unhealthy(for my lungs) amount of concentrate's. With it being legal and a pretty ingrained element of the culture in my home state I had decided the best thing for me was to leave for a state where THC would not be easily accessible. So off I moved.

Well, after the move I was doing alright for a bit, working, talking to coworkers, even going out to the bar with a few, setting the foundations for friendships. I was renting a Lyft car for supplemental income but more importantly to continue exploring and getting to know my new city. I felt like I was starting to build a new life. Was it always perfect? Of course not, but I felt like I was coping with things in a healthy, emotionally mature manner. Well, then the pandemic began to take hold of my new City.

After the state enacted a stay at home order, I returned my Lyft car, began working from home and slowly lost contact with the coworkers I was beginning to befriend. And not so slowly and surely, I have began to feel the crippling loneliness and depression I once blamed on weed to creep back into my mind the only difference is when my mind begins to race I dont have the weed to calm my anxiety like I used to. With all this in mind I really felt like I was still dealing with it all in a pretty calm and collected manner.

So, through all this I have been frequenting those dating apps mentioned above with little to no luck in actually hooking up with anyone, let alone finding a relationship. Through the magic of Grindr I had met this AMAZING human being, we instantly clicked and had chemistry I hadn't felt in years. I was smitten.... I think you might know where this going if you read all the above. I did it again, they have a very complicated life and are currently going through far more than I'm dealing with emotionally and in their life in general and so after a few dates they began so SEEM distant, at least from my perspective and, long story short, I spent a much longer time than we actually spent together spilling all my internalized loneliness and anxiety built up over the last few months, probably years on to the poor, beautiful, unsuspecting soul begging for them to ""ignore my insecurities and give me a chance to show you the real me"". I do want to say this person was kind and patient and talked to me when they weren't dealing with their own shit but it ultimately ended in me saying goodbye and deleting their contact information for both mine and their mental health, but not before causing this person significant emotional turmoil they didn't need in their life, because they honestly did have feelings for me but can't be emotionally available to a needy manbaby. Thats is something I will and need to carry with me until I get help which finally leads me to my point.

I'm considering going home. I want healthy relationships. Since leaving home it has been clear to me I had friends and family who cared and reached out and still reach out to me frequently despite my flakiness and emotional distance and I bailed on that under the guise of ""starting a new life"". But honestly I kinda miss my old one, at least right now. In addition I dont want to even attempt another relationship until i get the help i need to cope with my issues without projecting them on to the person I'm with and I know there are resources to take advantage of at home, I honestly haven't done too much research into resources in my new city. The biggest problem is moving back would require finding a job and apartment  before moving. I'm concerned I'll regret leaving the new city when the pandemic is said and done and making this homeward bound decision may result in regret and me falling back into familiar habits. I kinda want an outside perspective on this. Should I head home and enjoy those who have already been in my life? Or should I try to hang tight and ride this coronavirus storm and try to find resources here to help me achieve  emotional stability. Thank you for reading.",25Jul2020,1

Please read and give your thoughts, although im pretty confident the response from this will be overwhelmingly similar i just need to bring it to the attention of others to figure out what we (my friend group, say 6-7 of us) should do about this situation.

I would define this situation as ""Code Red"" in terms of how much it has shaken my world and broken my heart.

Everything will be anonymous, as i don't want to out anyone and keep the safety of them intact. This could be a case of mental illness and nothing serious may have ever occurred. Let me get into it from the beginning. Please stick with me and read this, I need your help.

&amp;#x200B;

As far back as I can remember ""X"" had some weird mental state, it was never alarming though. He was strange in certain ways and would write in a journal. I never read the journal, I never wanted to. But i have heard things about it, that it was filled with sad poetry about death, suicide, lack of purpose, lack of direction in life. I cant validate these claims, but it is the general consensus. We grew up together, from 7th grade and on.

&amp;#x200B;

This new information was just brought up as the events i will portray later transpired. He had multiple girlfriends after through highschool and after.  I had just learned however that he ""stalked"" one of these girlfriends, leaving notes in her mailbox everyday, leaving gifts constantly after they broke up, and going to her window. After she started ripping them up and telling him to stop he said ""I have them all memorized ill keep rewriting them"" and continued to do so until things fizzled out for him. This is a side note before we get into more serious topics.

His obsession with killing.

This timeline isnt exact so bear with me. He had a frequency to joke about killing people. Which to us was semi-normal, to say the least it never rang alarm bells. One night me and him were taking LSD for the first time together, this was the first big moment that freaked me out. So he took two tabs instead of taking my advice and taking only one. We also smoked a ton of weed. It was great until we got back to his house, where things went south for him. He thought the house was hell, and he was going to die.

After we peaked X was on his couch and looked at me with a huge grin, ""Anyone else wanna kill someone? I feel like i could do it now lets go"" and said it so enthusiastically and cunningly. It was terrifying, and sent me off into a bad trip. MY anxiety took over my body, and we made the choice to smoke more weed to help calm down (Terrible idea on lsd)

Out in a car we were hot boxing, he said it again, and said we should go kill someone. I stepped out of the car and told my friend we had to fucking leave.

After that night he was never the same. He clearly developed a form of psychosis, where he beleived he was stuck in a time loop. Everytime we smoked weed he would freak out saying ""Its happening again, this has all happened before, guys you dont get it, look, this happened before, J this happened before"" This would occur frequently overtime.

One night while we discovered the powerful effects of kratom, he snapped. He got out of the car we were hotboxing, and went out and said he needed to be alone, over the minutes he said we needed to get far away from him, so we obliged. figured it was an anxiety attack, until he came over to us with quite literally a plethora of swords, knives, and a machete. He said we were conspiring to kill him, he didnt know who we were, and kept asking what was going on, where were we, what was happening, who we are. He then got in his car and floored it in reverse and left at an astonishing speed.

&amp;#x200B;

We didnt hear back for 3 days.

Little while after that we were out in the winter exploring a trail as a group, he walked out onto the ice isolating himself and i followed. I heard him muttering scary and bizzare things to himself. At first i couldnt make it out, then I heard him say ""I hate myself, I suck X I suck, I wanna killmyself, Ill Kill them""

This freaked me out and i told the group what had happened.

Time had passed

He would start making ""school shooter jokes"" more and more frequently too, or just killing jokes. To eventually in modern day, where he makes them repeatedly multiple times during any hangout.

On another night we were partying, drinking having a good time. He pulled out salvia

He has had a history of salvia, and it fed into his delusion of him being trapped in a time loop.

While drinking he took the salvia, and started talking about a list of us in the order we were to die, and that it was a prophecy. The notion of the prophecy would become important. Overtime we would notice he was seperating himself, mentally from the group. He said on few occasions he felt he was an outcast, and didnt belong, that we hated him. Which was simply never the case, infact strongly the opposite we love him.

Another night me and another member of our group were drinking. He asked if he could come over and drink, so obviously we said hell yeah. Now i know for you reading, this is a major red flag to any outsider, but as you know if your own friend, or brother were to be saying these things and doing these things its not ""as"" alarming, or at least theres alternate perspectives. Howver, he said he always felt he needed to kill someone, that it was a his lifes goal, that he was to die at the age of 27, that he was to kill someone, and he cried. I was shooken.

My heart was racing and breaking at the same time, my friend is severely depressed or having mental problems. I never imagined he could or would do anything. We knew he seemed to have psychosis, and possibly schitzophrenia so we didn't freak out.

Flash forward today, after years of him bringing it up, having psychosis breaks, and being weird and making jokes of terrible taste we have been hit with something overwhelmingly difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

at 9:51 PM on 7/22/20 he texts the following to the group chat out of the blue with no context

""It's Done""

""filling in the grave rn""

""Shots gonna be a mountain""

Followed by the most somber and sad voice message that seemed to real and set us all off.

The voice message reads as follows ""Iv killed a man and im burying his body in the pouring rain, what a perfectly tragic ending"" rain falls in the backround, and he said it in a voice we never hear him speak in. A voice with profound sadness.

He then follows it up after someone says ""lol. no doubt"" who hadnt taken it seriously

He follows with ""No cap""

""Gotta burn these clothes tomorrow""

My friend tells him to stop talking like that, another says what the fuck.

I say what happened, then jokingly say did it finally happen, knowing his history with these ""jokes"" though this felt more real, and was scary.

He follows with ""The prophecy is complete""

This referring to his delusional prophecy of life.

""Full circle"" - reffereing to the time loop hes stuck in

""Im gonna reset everything now""

""See ya'll on 2013""

We immediate formed a group chat to discuss what the fuck just happened, we weren't sure what to make of it, and even if he didnt kill someone, hes having a mental break.  We discussed what we should do, and put pieces together about his past and opened our eyes. This could very possibly be real, and could very possibly be a mental episode.

We contacted his mother, and told her everything, she against our advice went straight to him.

He packed his bags and left.

&amp;#x200B;

Last we heard from him, or about him he returned home. However we are all deeply worried. He has alchoholism, ontop of the mental issues. And now we have embarrased and exposed him to his parents. We arent sure what to do, whether cops should be involved. This is very serious, and our hearts are breaking over our friend who we grew up with. Even if he didn't commit a crime, hes not in a good headspace.

&amp;#x200B;

Please give us advice on what to do, although im sure 99% will say call the cops, its different when its your brother, best friend. If thats what we need to do we will do it, but I dont want to ruin his life but I want him to get help, and we dont trust him, and are afraid of what he could do.

326,"Hey so I am using a throw away account to keep things somewhat anonymous. I am a film student in college, and ever since quarantine me and some great friends of mine have worked hard to get our own equipment, start building a platform, make consistent content, and even shoot a short film. 

We have all worked so hard, and since we are still relatively small, there isn’t much to be gained other than portfolio work, and building the audience, so I wanted to “reward” them, mainly a “thanks for all the hard work you guys put in, I couldn’t do it without you, and I wouldn’t wanna build a platform and work with anyone else” type thing. 

We are all dudes, and all of us are basically nerds. 3 of us are heavily into anime, the other two are super into marvel, and of course all things film we just love. 

I thought it would be cool to get some art done of each person, some small chibi like art of each of us. I have already ordered the first piece (for one of my friends) and it cost me 50 bucks on fiverr. After I spent the money I kinda worried if this is cringe 😅😅. 

I mean we discussed getting art before, and even looked at artists together but I kinda went on my own, found an artist, and payed out of pocket for all of this. The total price will be 250+ and I am worried that this could be one of the most cringe things I have ever done.",25Jul2020,2

328,I just need to hear someone else’s thoughts other than my home’s echo chamber. In semester one of two i had really good grades and I was having the best junior year pretty much anyone could ask for. In the beginning of semester two covid hit so school closed and all work was now online. I spent my time mainly watching youtube and wasting my life away these past 4 months and eventually failed 6 out of 8 of my subjects. I tried to hide this from my parents but they eventually got my report card in the mail after about a week after school happened and they haven’t treated me the same since. It’s been about a month and my dad finally snapped at me tonight. He took me inside his room and lectured me and basically humiliated me in front of my mom for about an hour and randomly he got up and started beating me heavily to the point where I couldn’t speak. He kept screaming at me to tell my mom i’m an idiot and i’m sorry and i’m a complete fool. I couldn’t even speak at that point as he was on top of me on the bed and every time I spoke it sounded like mumbling because I was freaking out. My mom tried to stop him but he pushed her out of the room and locked the door where he stopped beating me and screamed at me without me saying anything for the next half an hour. This whole thing took about 1 hour and a half but to me it felt like 15min. Now i’m writing this in the pitch black of my room at 3am crying because i have no future. I wish i never wasted these 4 months but every time i tried to work i got so much anxiety and i couldn’t bring myself to complete the work. Now i’m transferring schools and i have a shit gpa and i really don’t see a point in trying in life anymore. I don’t have many friends in school and i haven’t really talked to anyone outside of my siblings and some family friends since quarantine started. I just need some help and people to tell me what can i do from here cuz i don’t see any options for me.,25Jul2020,3
329,"I (F19) work in food service at a fast food restaurant that is busy daily and we are understaffed in the kitchen. i am a cook and the only one willing to open. 

Recently since my summer class ended, i told the owner/manager that i wouldnt mind picking up more hours but that i would still like a couple of days off. when i was first employed i asked for 20-25 hours a week (I worked 10-4 4 days a week). 

the week after i told said manager that i was available, i was scheduled for 5:30-2:00 5 days a week, but because we are so busy (happy hour is 2-4) and the person relieving my shift isn’t scheduled until 4, i will have to work until 4 (and even then i dont want to just fuck over my relief so i will stock their line and reach in freezers for them and tidy up). this ends up totaling to 50+ hours a week!!!!!!  manager doesnt bother asking me to stay later and assumes that i will , doesnt seem to feel bad that i put in way more hours than she schedules me.

last monday i text the manager that i couldnt work so many hours because it was physically exhausting and that i wasnt getting off at my scheduled times. I pointed out the amount of hours I was getting. and she didnt text me back but told me in person that i would get 5- 5hour shifts next week. 

when the next monday rolls around nothing has changed except the schedule physically says 5:30-12 (which is a 6 and a half hour shift and i am still getting off at 4) she tells me in person that shes hired a guy which will help reduce my hours. 

I gave the manager a weeks worth of notice that i wanted to be scheduled for 30 hours a week max. and still ended up being scheduled for more than that (so far ive worked 33 hours and i work two more 9 hour shifts this week) I don’t know if i should wait and see if this new fella will actually help reduce my hours or if i should put in a two weeks notice. I personally think its kind of irresponsible on my managers part for not having the schedule sorted out. its frustrating and i am exhausted from this job. I hate walking in and not knowing what time im going to be leaving.

also when i told her i wanted to pick up some more hours i didnt want to pick up 50+ hours in one week as a part time employee. i keep justifying it to myself that i am getting a good paycheck but ive had to sacrifice most of my free time and i cant hang out with a lot of my friends (via online) or play video games like i used to because on my days off i just want to lay in bed.",25Jul2020,1

I have finally decided to tell my best friend about my Rape (14F). He's(15M). It's something I haven't said aloud yet, and I know it'll be very difficult for me. We have agreed to meet somewhere where we would be alone. (On top of an old fire tower hill, which IS private property but nobody gives a shit) and ride there together on bikes. He'll be the first one I tell. He has started noticing things and I think he already knows, I just need to confirm it. Should I write it out as a backup if I can't get the words out? Should I write a letter and let him read it besides me? Or should I just say it all out loud? I'm so scared, but somebody needs to know, and I trust him above anyone else. I couldn't trust anyone else with this info.

334,"Basically, I (22F) have grown up in a non-denominational Christian household. My mom is a very devout Christian who always took us to church on Sundays, read us children’s books about the Bible, sent us to private Christian schools, etc. I was really into it when I was younger and felt the need for religion and enjoyed the purpose it gave me. As I’ve gotten older, I see more flaws in the church as a whole that are hard for me to ignore. I love the idea of God in terms of spirituality, being able to read scripture and pass my troubles onto Him through prayer. That aspect of Christianity continues to comfort me on a regular basis and helps me feel peace. But I just don’t know if I believe in the idea of salvation as much any more. How can this one religion determine who gets a peaceful afterlife? 

My mother is a beautiful and kind woman and I love her with everything in me, but she is constantly worried about those without salvation. I have been dating a non-Christian (not anti-Christian, just non-Christian) guy for almost 3 years now and she regularly brings up how worried she is about his lack of salvation and how she worries about our future and what his non-salvation would mean for our future kids (will they be raised non-Christian, will they know God, etc.) and she borderline begs me to discuss salvation with him on occasion. But at this point, I don’t even know where I stand with it all and I don’t feel comfortable discussing something with my partner that I don’t even feel 100% certain on just to make my mom feel at ease. 

Idk. How do I explain to my mom that I might not want to be a full fledged Christian anymore? I feel like she’ll be absolutely devastated and will, in turn, begin to stress about my salvation and future as well, and I don’t want to bring that extra stress upon her. And even more so than that, there are certain parts of my life I always envisioned to involve my religion (marriage, raising children, etc.), and now that I’m getting closer to those points in my life while also questioning the religion as a whole, I just feel kind of lost. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to be as devout as I once was, but simultaneously I don’t quite know how to walk through life without these ideas that have been engrained in me since day one. 

Does anyone have any advice on this kind of stuff at all? Is it possible to be “spiritually” Christian while also somewhat denouncing the church as an organization? How can I explain this to my family without absolutely crushing them? It feels scary to walk away from something you’ve known you’re whole life, even if it’s just walking away from parts of it. I don’t want to live my life in fear of not being able to “save” enough people like my mom, I don’t want to picture my friends/family in hell because they decided to believe what they wanted to believe, which I know is what my mom worries about so much. Idk. Really just any advice would be appreciated. Sorry for the long post but I look forward to any responses.",25Jul2020,1

336,"She thinks I'm biased because we're married, but I wouldn't have married someone I'm not attracted to. I love everything about her, but she has body image issues.

There is a nugget of selfishness about this - I want her to reach comfort in her own skin, so that she truly enjoys intimacy and expresses herself, and of course I'd be a collateral benefactor.

Not in a shitty, shallow, porn-influenced way. I just want her to relax and let herself go during sex, and stop thinking about ""me thinking about/being put off by her belly"", which is ludicrous to me. She can't rewire this and I think it limits her willingness to explore and embrace some nice things.

I know it's not really about me at all. To have married her, and the fact she knows I'm here for good isn't enough. Body issues are a societal problem, not a ""her and me"" problem.

It's been 12 years of a situation that I hoped would pass. I don't know the first thing about these issues, as you can tell, but I just want her to be confident, and enjoy all life has to offer as she only gets one of them!

I thought about asking around the area, but I didn't trust a random person to not just say it was theirs when it might not be. I ended up keeping it and not spending any.

349,"(M20) This is independent of the pandemic. 

((Context))

I've been speaking with a therapist, but not about this. I'm nearing the end of what I guess is my therapist's own appointment quota, and I also feel pretty good since I began therapy.  Additionally important information: I feel no anxiety or depression, and I am at peace with being alone as I am right now.

I've started journaling everyday for the past month. I've quit pornography and masturbation. I've done a complete dopamine detox. I meditate literally everyday. Take care of my hygiene and my face. I exercise everyday. I eat healthy portions and sleep a lot everyday; I am in amazing physical shape life despite having a traumatic injury. I have self-care down. I enjoy doing my chores, cleaning and living in a holy and sacred environment. I have an internship that is well-paid, doing work that I literally am in love with; it's been a few weeks already, and everyday is extremely exciting even during the pandemic (pandemic proof industry).

At the moment I live by myself entirely with room and board taken care of by my father, as well as my internship. Despite this I am very rude to him, and I said some objectively reprehensible things to my mother. (They are divorced by the way.) This past week I have exploded and cursed both of them out. I don't feel proud. But truthfully, I don't feel ashamed either. I feel angry, resentful. The ""love"" I feel for them I feel comes from a conditional place (e.g. I love them because of this and that). It doesn't feel real. I can't pretend like it doesn't feel real. 

((Advice seeking begins here))

When I think of them, literally the first thought I have is resent and regret; I think, ""why can't they be more intelligent, read books like me be engineers, doctors, or scientists, like I am; why can't they run a marathon; why does she have to be goddamn smoker and alcoholic and so fucking (precise word I use) fat; and why are they so average."" I don't know how to change these feelings, or if I should even try. It is extremely habitual that these are the first thoughts that rush in my mind. How do I change this?

((somewhat relevant, but admittedly defensive and a bit combative))

\[I don't know what attitude to change exactly. I'm not exactly atheist, but I don't like restricting myself to a word like ""agnostic"": meditation is sort of a religion for me though. Meditation for me has been a medium for emotional exercise. Yet, in terms of trying to understand how to treat my parents with feeling ashamed of them and resenting them, meditation provides no answers. Realistically, ""just stopping"" my being an asshole to them and accepting their flaws feels like a cop out: it's not authentic. It's not genuine way to deal with how I think of them or treat them. Let's not talk about saying that ""I have it better than others;"" I didn't chose my starting point, those ""others"" in worse situations did not either, so there is no comparative discussion to be made here for those thinking that.

353,"Talking about this has been really hard so I thought why not type it out. Some quick back story (this all happened pre-COVID), my ex-girlfriend (21) and I (21) broke up this year in January over her involvement with greek life at our university. At first, I thought it would be a good idea cause she wanted to make new friends and well I just wanted to be a supportive boyfriend, and not tell her who she can and can't hang out with. But while I was trying to be supportive I realized that maybe it wasn't a good idea considering all the bad stigmatism greek life gets but then I kept telling myself I wasn't a controlling boyfriend and tell her what to do. I'd bring it up occasionally because I thought it was important for her to know how I felt about it but we'd constantly argue.

Eventually, we broke up and one night, months later, she came to my apartment screaming and drunk. One of my housemates let her in and while I was trying to calm her down/sober up she tells me a story of what recently happened at one of the parties she went to. She goes on and tells me details of that night at a fraternity house in a nearby city, and my heart shattered. I immediately began to cry, she didn't have to finish her sentence and I, unfortunately, had an idea of what she was going to say. I wouldn't wish that upon anyone so knowing that the person I was with almost every day, and I loved, for 3 years broke my heart.

What's worse is she claims that none of that would have happened if it wasn't for me. If didn't break up with her none of that wouldn't have happened and I believed her. I still do. Its been a while now we're on okay terms but the people around her are not doing anything to help and they're not supportive at all.

358,"So my backyard is filled with gravel to cut down on yard work (really steep hill). When I was outside, I saw a bird just sitting a little ways from a tree we have planted out there. It's odd because normally I'd expect the bird to be perched in the tree. It's not moving around much at all. About 8 hours ago, it was higher up the hill, but in the few times I've checked in on it, it's moved slowly down the hill. It's night time now and he's made his way down into the culvert by our fence, and hasn't flown away.

I suspect the bird flew into the house and hurt itself, but I can't tell if it's just stunned or if it's hurt it's wing. I'm not very well off and can't afford to take it to the vet. But I don't want to just leave it there. I also don't want to touch it and have it freak out and hurt itself more (or have me hurt it accidently). Something also to consider is that I have an older border collie dog. She's a sweet girl though, and she's already been outside once or twice to pee already (I let her out by accident, totally absent-mindedly forgetting about the bird). There's no way that the dog's been outside twice already and not seen the bird, so I don't think she's going to hurt it, but it's a possibility and who knows.

360,"Ok so this has been happening over years, just as I get everything together I just lose everything. Let me explain...its kinda long...

It all started when I was 18 when I ended up with my now exes home, and I stayed there for almost a year walking to and from work to which I buy a car, which is my 1998 Civic, love that car man... jank but good. 

After we broke up though I decided it was best to move in with my dad... and here is where my life goes down. After 3 months I get my current girlfriend, and after 6 months of being together she moves in with me and my dad... I get a job that pays 16 a hour and work my arse off to make money to get a place... but as soon as I start to save and almost get there... my dad tells us we have to go and we have no available places to go to... so we had to spend our money to go to my girls friends home...

When we move there it’s fine ya know, figure I got a car and a job that pays well we can do it... but come a week my car breaks down, well it more like exploded... so I ended up loosing my job... ended up having to use a van to go get a job at a McDonald’s... but the person who I lived with at that time felt she needed to take the van away and lost that job and eventually got kicked out due to some unknown reason ... and was homeless for a day or so.

After selling my sweet baby civic and due to the recent find of my girlfriends family we ended up staying with them since last November, got a job at a Taco Bell and worked up there for a while... but it was great until the landlord did not enjoy the fact we were there and ended up kicking us out, and since last month we moved into my dads... again. Ended up getting a job a week ago at a call center, but after a week I lost it... been almost a month and a half without any income and turned to fb for help with food and toothpaste. Kinda at my lowest right now I’ve ever been...

But the thing is after being so close every time to get somewhere why is it I keep falling down. I get a job... pay the bills that need to be paid and try to save ... I lose my car, relationships , possessions... what am I doing wrong... I just need some guidance on life right now and what to do...",25Jul2020,3

362,Okay so when I got a laptop I just got out of high school. It was on sale so I got it for half off back in 2017. It was still about $150 and it was a really nice laptop. And I had everything on there. Lots of games and things. This replaced my old laptop (it had a cracked screen but could be hooked up to a tv with an hdmi cord. My mother used to demand I keep it in her room at night and then she stepped on it and broke it and refused to get me a new one) but recently due to the corona my little sister was upset because she had a laptop at moms (and she forgot it there) and couldn’t do her schoolwork. I decided to let her borrow my laptop. Now I need it for something. But turns out she lost it. She said it was at moms(i asked mom she doesn’t have it) or it’s downstairs. I looked downstairs I cleaned my room. I can’t find either of my laptops. I use my old laptop as basically a backup but after my brothers open house I realized this is also missing. I really need to either get my laptop back from wherever my sister put it or I need to get a new one but I don’t have a whole lot of money to spare. Is it okay for me to ask her for money to pay for a new one. Since she took mine and lost it?,25Jul2020,2

I am currently on probation for my first DUI, in the state of FL. I have until August 17th until I am supposed to be off probation. I have completed all of my court ordered obligations, except for a few remaining hours of community service work. Those missing hours can cause me to violate my probation but the dilemma is covid. I can't even attempt to complete the remaining hours at the moment due to covid having everything closed down.

Alright, so. Long story short, I(Male, not sharing age) met this girl online, E.(Female, not sharing age). We all hung out in our online groupchat, and I grew feelings for this other group member, J.(Male, not sharing age). We ended up dating, but, I started bumping into a few issues with E., now that I was seeing everything from a different perspective with everything going on in my life, and me dating J., I started to look at the situation from a different perspective. She actively tried flirting, complementing, etc. with me, and yes, I knew she liked me before I got together with J., but didn't feel the same, since I'm gay, and it just wasn't going to work for that sole reason. She also tried to get with J., although she knew I liked him. She often places the limelight on her, or completely kills the fun of the group when we're having fun, and the conversations grow dark, and about her personal issues, and it makes everyone else really uncomfortable. It's gotten to the point, where, (since I also have depression, like her), I've almost gotten sick because of some of the terrible, and disgusting things shes said. She's mentioned how she ""Likes the taste of human flesh"", and that shes ""Tried it before"", and that she ""Likes the sound of bones breaking/cracking"", etc. But, she has helped me with some very difficult points in my life, but. I just don't know what to do. Please, help!

367,"Tl;Dr: I have been obsessed with a social media influencer for 2 years and it has consumed and ruined my life. 

Hi i am 21 years old from the UK sorry if i ramble a bit its quite early in the morning when i am writing this. Around 2018 i started following this Twitch Streamer/Social Media influencer from America, i won't say her real name lets say her name is Melissa. When i followed Melissa for the first time she displayed characteristics that i genuinely look for in a girl, she was funny, loved anime and video games. The more she was on my feed i discovered we had a lot in common, we both suffered depression and ADHD and we shared a birthday literally 1 day apart. Its so weird i started feeling like i was falling in love with her. But it was still rather innocent. I then noticed myself daydreaming about her anytime my head hit a pillow or anywhere i can rest my head.

Around September 2018 I noticed a guy on her social media stories and i convinced myself ""oh he's just a friend no need to worry"". But he started appearing more and more and more to the point where his presence made me sick. This is when this ""crush"" became obsessive. Anytime i would see her and him i would feel sad and just start crying. I started in early 2019 to block her on social media but there would be instances where i would pressure myself to check her IG story, check her Twitter i know that her and this guy are dating but i just wanted to check what she was doing. I almost feel like i wanted to see her and him almost as to punish myself. I would block her, then two days or weeks later unblock her to see how she was and then block her when i got my heart broken. That was the pattern for the rest of the year.  I would daydream a life with her, a literal life with her. We would start dating, get married, have kids, grow old the usual. But then it completely destroyed me when i would go on her social media or her streams and realised i couldn't be with her. 

I sought help from a therapist but was to embarrassed and ashamed to tell them about this. I instead replaced Melissa with an ex girlfriend who i couldn't get over. My therapist told me to move on and taught me self management techniques as well as put me on antidepressants. It still hasn't worked. I really tried this year to forget her and to stop all these thoughts and this obsession but i just can't. I tried this year to completely block her but i just can't help myself from unblocking her.  Whats weird is that my life generally is going fine from an outside perspective. I have a job, I recently aced all my uni exams i have gotten the christmas present i always wanted, but whenever i think about her, it all cmes crashing down, it feels like a big punch in the gut. This is ruining my life, everywhere i look for help they say hang out with friends, spend time with loved ones. Heres the thing i don't have many friends to spend time with and my family members are complete shut ins, its very hard for me to make friends due to my introverted nature. I am helpless, i am ashamed of myself i am embarrassed and i don't know who else i can reach for help. This has made me suicidal and i just want it to end. I don't know what else i can do.",25Jul2020,2

370,"Firstly I didn’t know where to put this as I’m a reddit noob but there’s always lots of thoughtful people here so I’ll drop my story here and run away. 

We met through a group chat on twitter and we just mesh together perfectly. We often joke that we’re the same person but its well balanced too. I started catching feelings quickly... she would mail me personal gifts and take care of me a lot. The kind of person who rejects the idea of emotions but is actually very sweet. 

So this friend of about a year now (21F) and I (19F) met up in person recently and it went really well, like I’ve never felt so comfortable for so long. We’re both gay and we both know this. 

So what’s the problem? Well.. I think I’d like to be more than friends. The easy solution would be to talk about it, but I have some reasons why I haven’t yet. 

We both talk about wanting a girlfriend and all the same things but... it ends there. I’m sure it’s funny for other people to watch. I guess I’m scared of the rejection/loss of friendship that could happen if I even suggest such a thing. 

Such as her not wanting a long distance thing ever (we live a few hours? drive away) or with someone a little bit younger than her etc. 

In my experience getting an outside perspective on these things helps make a judgement. I feel a dread like I know what the answer is, but I just have no idea what to do. 

Upon reading more of this ummm.. server? it seems my questions a bit of a waste among such serious topics. 

Anything is appreciated.

I’ve never been in a relationship and I’m discovering how immature I am with these things. I’m incredibly scared of hurting myself and my best friend- we both have mutual feelings. I’ve decided that because time, going into senior year and going to different colleges, is going to eventually separate us, his past relationship issues, and how much we both value our friendship it’s best if we remain friends. I love him very much and he loves me too, but I can’t help but be sad about this entire thing. I don’t think I’m ready for anything and as much as I tell him that I fear he thinks it’s an issue with him. I have a feeling it’s for the best to wait this out but it hurts the both of us and I never want to hurt him like he has been hurt in the past. It’s rare to find a friendship like ours and I’ve never genuinely felt as openly cared about by someone who is outside of my family.",25Jul2020,1

I’ve (29F) been seeing this guy (29M) for a couple of weeks now and I feel like it’s been going great. We really hit it off immediately, texted constantly, and click so well in person. Lately I’ve been feeling like we’re moving into exclusivity territory. The last time we hung out there was a lot more intimacy, we took a nap together, he was giving me Eskimo kisses, we stared into each other’s eyes for a while (gooey, I know) and before I even showed up he told me he couldn’t wait to see me.

Now I’m wondering if I’m just getting overly excited about it and setting myself up for heartbreak. The past two days, the texts have been farther and fewer in between. He hasn’t been saying goodnight like he did every other day for the past 3 weeks. I get a response about 3-5 hours late. Before it’s always been every 1-2 hours. I’m really sensitive to this change in behavior because it was the first sign when my last relationship was ending and the last guy I dated casually before he called it off.

Do guys back off like this when they start to feel more secure with a lady or is it likely to be that he’s losing interest?",25Jul2020,1

375,"Edit: The two hours sleep was as a result of my reaction, not the noise itself, which stopped around 2am.

So, I have generalised anxiety. For people that don't know, it's kind of mid-range anxiety. I don't get panic attacks but I get bothered by a lot of stuff I shouldn't.

I'm in a place in life where I'm trying to turn stuff around, and with that comes a happier life and much improved anxiety. But right now I have to deal with it as best I can.

I live in the city and since I've been here it's kind of become an obsession to keep my street as quiet as possible, as I like quiet, it makes me feel better, as I'm sure it does a lot of people. So somebody comes along making noise, I leave them a note or, if the situation demands, get in touch with their landlord. People round here are generally OK, so it's maybe two incidents a year, normally resolved without much fuss, and quiet all year round.

The problem is when someone comes along making noise it's incredibly stressful, my anxiety makes it a lot worse than it is. Gotten to the point where I HATE summer, as this is the time when most people are likely to be a nuisance to me.

So somebody came along making noise last night and I'm just stressed. I can't do anything about it until Monday when I'll speak to their landlord, so I have to fight the obsessive thoughts in the meantime, or as my counselor called it, my ''intolerance of uncertainty.''

Just any thoughts or advice to give me a tiny bit of comfort, please.",25Jul2020,2
376,"Hello everybody! **FYI: This girl is from Germany, and i'm from Belgium**. I'm a 21 year old guy who never had a relationship and girlfriend, so I'm asking for guidance. I never had interest in getting a girlfriend before the start of 2020, I was always doing fine on my own. But lately I felt like I was missing a piece, if i make sense? So two weeks ago I made a post on Reddit trying to make friends. So sometime later this girl texts me saying that she wants to be friends, so I accepted the chat. She and I share quite a lot of interests. 2 days later she asked for my whatsapp, and I ofcourse gave it to her. So we talked a lot ofcourse. I've told her that I wanted to travel more, because I've always wanted to but don't have any friends to join me. So she said she was down for, that saying we could rent an airbnb together. I really liked her personality from the start and really enjoy talking to her, and then she asked if we could exchange photo's to see what i looked like. I thought she was going to ghost me, but she didn't :) I'm not the best looking, if i have to be honest, so I was prepared for that. She then sent me multiple photos of herself, and she was really pretty. I didn't fall for her because of her looks if that's what you think. I guess i never connected with someone else like that before. So we kept texting eachother, she left a voice message as a way to take it to the next level of friendship I guess, and I said that my little brother was sleeping in my room, so I could not leave one aswell. I would need to speak English, so I didn't know how to explain that to him. She was with a friend and said that I was probably laying in a bed with a girl, so I responded with a photo of my little brother in my bed, and then she said she believed me. When I was alone I left a voice message, then we called eachother for 2 hours. She asked me if i had a girlfriend and I told her i didn't, I then asked her if she had a boyfriend and she said she didn't. So we kept texting and leaving voice messages, but I think I started getting feelings for her. I did not care what she looked like, because imo I like personalities more, but she's really beautifull so I'll take that as an extra factor that influences my feelings I guess? I do think a lot about this girl I just know for 2 weeks, and feel really confused on what to do. Is this what it's like to be in love? Right now were talking to eachother, but how could I tell her I like her, without getting this special friendship ruined? I could really need some guidance,on what to do right now.If you made it this far, I would like to thank you already for the effort.",25Jul2020,1

My gf and him were sort of close but she always viewed him as a brother and that was the relationship she had with him.

She told him to stop and moved away because she found that really weird. Long story short he ended up grabbing her face and forcing the kiss on her cheek while she pushed away and told him to stop. I found out that this wasnt a single incident but happened a handful of times. He even tried getting her to kiss him on the cheek saying shit like ""dont make it wierd"", ""do it before someone comes."" She never did and got herself out of that but he did grab her face and force a kiss on her cheek multiple times.

379,"The title kind of sums it up.

As of recent, I've been feeling like I may have a personality disorder. I'm not sure if this is true or not. Speculating I may have a personality disorder might be my brains way of diverting my attention from having OCD, as I'm having a hard time accepting that I have OCD (specifically because I see little fault in how I function and I don't want to, I guess). 

I guess I just have a lot of anxiety bringing it up because how my OCD works (how my therapist is kind of making me realize it works). I convince myself I'm making everything up and I just basically degrade myself until I stop thinking about it as much, or I find something else to obsess on and forget about it until I need something to think about or something happens that brings it back again. Even making this post about this is hard because I feel like none of it is true and I shouldn't even be thinking about it.

Last night I was due to meet with my 3 best friends, but when I finished work I had a pounding headache so I let them know I was gonna take a nap to see if it helped and then message them once I’d woke up. Long story short I didn’t feel better, and i was still in pain, so I cancelled on the plans a few hours in advance. 

I sent messages to the group chat apologising, and saying we’d make up for it soon etc , but I also said I was gonna have some painkillers and if they made me feel better I’d come out later. 

They all read the message, and didn’t respond. Not even to say they’d let me know where they were , or to say I hope you’re ok. 

I ended up seeing where they went to from social media...which was really crappy because I ended up feeling better later in the evening and probably would have come out. But out of dignity I thought I’m not going to message because not one of them asked if I was ok. If one of them said they were feeling ill, I’d never even consider ignoring a message telling me that.

Awkward at best, he just says things like “Cum for me baby” and “Your cocks so hot” and crap like that, it sounds like the bad acting in a 80s porno, but also he says it way to early, like a few minutes in and I just don’t wanna be done after 4 minutes of foreplay.

That’s another thing, he needs to slow tf down, it’s all about getting to the finish line (Whether we go all the way or just fool around) and cum as fast as possible.

391,"so lets just give a lil bit of background before i start my post.

my father divorced my mom and left us never to return when i was 2. my brother, who is 7 years older than me started causing a lot of trouble when we got older. he beat my mom, constantly asked for money, would break his laptop and phone when enraged and my mom would buy them again for him. whenever we were alone at home he would beat me up or lock me in a closet or even once he tried choking me with telephone cable. my head has suffered 3 major scars two of which are because of him. he would beat my mom and spit and curse whenever they got in a fight, and due to that i have severe anxiety about her well being and a bit of ptsd. i keep having nightmares even tho im 19 years old. when i was 16, i was taller and bigger than my brother because i got into sports and one time when he tried attacking me i beat him up and his abuse stopped. at least he didnt get physical with me and my mom anymore.

now the real story starts sometime ago, when i left the country to study abroad, leaving him and my mom alone. and i have a bit of inheritance money which i left with my mom which I ask her to give me some every once in a while to pay for tuition and rent, etc. 5 month ago my mom video called me crying and he told me that my brother had attacked her and spit on her and choked her and even threatened to stab her and had demanded my mother give the money to him. my mom with the help of neighbors threw him out of the house and told me she had cut all contact with him(he is 26) which gave me a bit of relief. i got into a big argument with him and told him if he goes near her i would kick his ass, etc.

fast forward to 1 month ago which somehow i deduced that my mother was in fact contacting him and had gave him some money to buy a house( not my money) and i confronted her and she denied  at first but then i showed her that i had proof which she said that she was only helping him get on his own. i got furious, not because she was helping her, but because she had been lying to me and deceiving me all this time. I told her that if she wants to help him i understand but she shouldnt lie to me and under no circumstances should she let him back because he is a threat to her wellbeing and could potentially mortally harm her. she agreed.

then again today i called her and she said that she was thinking of letting him back and that he is changed he cares about me( in all the time i have been gone, even before the fight he hasnt contacted me once to see how i was doing, and suddenly he cares) i told her that he is lying and he just wants to comeback and get my money or just get some house and stop working and keep dating girls and playing games and wasting money on cars and Iphones. she insisted that this is not the case,and that she was considering letting him back. i told her well if thats the case, deposit all my money to my account so i would be sure nothing would happen to it. she refused and after a bit of arguing she finally admitted she had given it to someone to work with it and to give her money. **without asking my permission, and not even telling me. my** **money.** i got angry and told her she had no right, and if she wants to let him back in her life, she will lose me. i told her to deposit my money immediately, and that if she lets him back, he will end up killing her, and im not going to sit by and watch that. if she lets him back, she is dead to me. i will mourn for my dead mother and i will move on with my life. i cant keep getting anxiety attacks when i call her and she doesnt answer.

And im so tired. mentally broken. every night i go to bed, and i have so many nightmares that i wake up even more tired than the night before. im fighting even in my sleep. i dont know what solace feels like.

i need help. i dont want to lose her. but if things keep going this way, im not gonna drown with her. any advice?

EDIT1: just wanted to add that because of my mothers indecisiveness to throw this parasite out of our house years ago, i have problems with relationships, cant trust anybody, i used to trust her but now that i know she lied to me without giving a shit how it would affect me just to help him, i have realised that she always put him first. one time i remember we got in a fight and even tho i beat him i hit my head on the ceiling(i know, ceiling) and i was bleeding really bad. she left with him to go somewhere else and basically left me alone with a big bad wound on my scalp.i was 15 or something. anyone with a scalp wound knows how bad it bleeds. and this is just one example.i feel so terrible about everything.",25Jul2020,1
392,"So yesterday my friend met up with a girl that hes been texting back and fort with from IG for a few years now. Yesterday they took a roadtrip to a different city, booked a hotel and spent the night there. All of this while the girl has a boyfriend of 2 years.
I like my friend, I dont want to ruin it for him or come of like a hater, but I cant help but feel bad for the boyfriend in this situation. She willingly cheated on him, it wasnt like she got drunk and had a one-night stand with a guy, they actually planned this night in advance.

394,"I'm a 16 yr old (F) and my entire life, my dad has been emotionally manipulative to the point where a few weeks ago, I decided I was going to start cutting him out of my life entirely. My plan was to completely cut off all ties with him, because I'm just so tired of all of the BS he's cause me and my family over the years, from cussing out my mom constantly, to telling me that I'm going to kill myself one day because I'll be all alone, covered in tattoos and doing drugs when he's gone, and that I'm going to be a failure in life just like my mom. He's called me weak and handicapped for being bad at math, and so many other things I could make a whole post about it. I finally just got so tired of it that I decided I wanted nothing to do with this guy. Then only about a week ago, I decided I was going to try to move to Hawaii to help my grandpa who is currently suffering from really bad cataract in his eye and can't really see anymore. I was looking forward to helping out my grandpa while also continuing to put distance between my dad and I. However while I'm there, I'm going to need to help get my grandpas car on the road, along with other expenses, and money is pretty tight for my family. I figured I was just going to have to get a job over there asap while I also get my driver license, try to get a driving instructor, start building my art career, all while balancing my online school, helping my grandpa and moving to another state. Needless to say, I've got a lot on my plate, and a lot of this stuff like hiring a driving instructor and getting my grandpas car in working order again could end up costing hundreds. I told my dad that I'm going to be moving and that was that. Of course, he was skeptical. Then the next day, I get a call from him saying that he'll give me $1,000 for the trip and that all I have to do is stop biting my nails. (I have a bad habit of biting them) Immediately my first instinct is to reject the offer and ignore him because I don't want to let him back into my life (he's tried bribing me before, this isn't the first time he's tried using money to get leverage) but the simple fact is that I do need money right now with everything going on, and a thousand dollars would make things easier for my family and my grandpa since he's relying on food stamps. I know that if I take the money, I'm essentially letting him in again to start manipulating me and my family, undoing all the progress I've made and I'm not sure if its worth it. I also really want to be independent and not rely on people like him, but would I be stupid if I didn't just suck it up and grow some keratin for a couple of weeks to make things easier?",25Jul2020,2
395,"Right now, I am about to start freshman year of college. The only problem I see happening is that I am going to be stuck alone for another 4 years. 

Throughout my life, I have been an extreme introvert. I hardly talked to people at my school but it wasn’t that I didn’t want to speak to them. It was because they didn’t want to speak to me. I was the kid that everyone knew but never actually wanted to be friends with. because of this I never really learned how to actually talk to people in person and have a hard time even doing things on any social media.

The thing is, I really want to believe that the reason why people don’t want to talk to me is that I am overweight( and i have been most of my life) but at the same time, if i lose weight and people still don’t want to talk to me then it’s actually me.

I have tried many times over the years to try and lose weight but every time i do, that thought pops up in my head. The thought of it just being me being the problem.

403,"Odd I know, but when I explain it’ll make sense.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half, and quite a few things have happened since we first started seeing each other. But this issue has been a few months coming and I don’t know what to do.

A few months back, I had been experiencing harassment from one of my apparent neighbours. I lived in a basement apartment and he “supposedly” lived upstairs. One night he heard me and my boyfriend having an argument while I was on the fire escape. After I went back inside he followed me downstairs and tried to speak with me. He was trying to convince me to sleep with him, etc. He seemed really out of it and got aggressive towards the end of our conversation, and I felt very threatened.

Ever since that point I had been very weary of him. I’d had a couple more run-ins with him but nothing too scary I guess. Until one night I was having another argument with my boyfriend and I left my apartment to go for a walk while we talked on the phone. I remember specifically locking my door but at the same time I am not entirely sure. I was out walking for over an hour and when I came back, I found my apartment a mess and things everywhere. I saw the guy out of my peripheral vision. I noticed that some of my items were missing and strewn around the apartment.

I was in shock when I first got inside and when I got a bit of a better look at him he seemed completely out of it... high off his ass rummaging through more of my stuff. I wanted to leave my apartment and I told him to leave, but he told me he’d be back. He told me not to call the police. I ran outside.

I called the police and after going through my apartment I told them what I was missing, one of those things being my PS4.

Fast forward a few weeks and my boyfriend is trying to find me a spatula. He opens up one of the cupboards in the back corner of my apartment and he finds my PS4 rolled up in a blanket. He confronts me about it and I tell him I did not have any idea it was there, and I don’t know what it’s there for. I was terrified because the only thing playing back in my head was the guy telling me he was going to come back. I called the police and updated my report, and at the time my boyfriend said he didn’t believe me but he was going to choose to.

Now, a few months later and the issue comes up again. He asks me what happened with my PS4 but my story isn’t changing. I am not lying to him and he won’t believe me. And now he thinks I’ve lied to him about a million others things.

Wtf am I supposed to do? I can’t prove anything to him but I’m not lying... and I don’t want to lose him over this.",25Jul2020,4

406,"Backstory: Way back when the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders had just started and Tiger King was a big deal, I was having Google Hangout ""dates"" with someone I met. We had had a first date in person before the lock down, and then we had a bunch of hilarious online dates before having one last in-person date (I know, I'm sorry, it was dumb, but we both lived alone and weren't interacting with anyone else; so, we went for it). We watched Tiger King ""together"" online and he joked he thought Joe Exotic was a great musician. He had told me that his birthday was coming up, and I joked back that I would get him a Joe Exotic CD for his birthday. 

Well, at some point I was doing some drunk quarantine-depression shopping on Amazon and found a fairly cheap single of ""I Saw A Tiger"". I bought it. I think it made sense to drunk me to actually buy it for him because the guy had previously left me flowers and a small gift in a bag (complete with Lysol wipes!) on my doorstep. Seemed to me like we were in the cheap ""token of affection"" gift stage of dating. We eventually fizzled out though and stopped talking. 

Unfortunately, the CD took quite a while to ship and came in the mail after he and I were out of contact. I was lazy and procrastinated about returning it. It's been a few months now. Honestly, I hardly ever muster up the energy to return online purchases, and because of that I don't buy certain things online, like clothes. I know I won't want to go to the trouble to send them back if I don't like them. 

So, I want to get rid of this CD, and I have some thoughts on what to do with it, but I would like to hear yours too!

The possibilities I've come up with so far:

1. Just suck it up and send the damn thing back for a refund! However, it's been a few months, and I guess I'd have to look into if I even can at this point. My weird laziness about this sort of makes this less of an appealing option. 
2. Create a time capsule with the CD and some other hilarious stuff, and bury it somewhere for future humanity to laugh at. Again, this may be way too much work for my lazy ass. 
3. Leave it in a public place for a lucky person to happen upon (kinda worried this might just end up being littering).
4. Throw it in the trash and forget about the whole thing. 
5. Donate it to a library or the Goodwill.
6. Save it for a White Elephant Christmas party one day and enjoy the explosion of laughs when it gets unwrapped. 
7. Mail it to Joe in prison asking for him to sign it. Include stamped, self-addressed return envelope to make it easy on him to get it back to me. Sell it on Ebay when I get it back . . . who am I kidding? I know I will never do this one.

I think I'm depressed and that I might have ADHD. But neither my mom or dad are doing anything about it. I've been begging them to bring me to a doctor so I can get the help I need very desperately, but they refuse because of financial issues. They couldn't afford to, and they think it's all in my head.

417,"TW: Possible r*pe, sexual assault

17F. I broke up with my ex boyfriend in February, and have been doing some thinking. 

Throughout my childhood (5-16), my mother would constantly expose me to ideas of sexual objectification and r*pe; stuff like not being allowed to hear my hair down because it would make me more desirable to men, not being allowed to sit with my legs apart because it would make men want to rape me (both direct quotes), etc. 

My relationship with my ex was the first one I had ever had. We started dating in April 2019, and for a few months, everything was fine and dandy. I loved spending time with him, cuddling, going on dates, exploring the town. 

After two months, he forced me to kiss him. I thought it would make me a whore if I did so (thanks, mom) but eventually I gave in. This “forcing” continued up until and including my giving him oral sex. I use quotation marks because he did not physically hold my head down there, but he emotionally coerced me into doing so; he said I was a “bad girlfriend,” since I had allowed him to perform oral sex on me and I did not want to reciprocate. He also pushed my shoulders down while making out, even when I resisted. 

I did not enjoy anything more than sensual with him. I’m not sure if this is due to my emotional trauma caused by my mother, or perhaps my ingrained (yet unknown at the time) sexual orientation towards women. I only engaged in these activities because I knew it would make him happy, and I wanted him to be happy. 

I struggle to put a name to my feelings. Was I raped? We never engaged in intercourse. Would it be sexual assault? I don’t think I’m a “wuss,” although my mother did say that everything she did was normal and that I was just a “sensitive child”. 

Needless to say, I broke up with my ex in February 2020, and came out as a proud lesbian during my salutatorian speech at graduation. I guess everything has a way of working out in the end. No more forced blowjobs. :)",25Jul2020,0
418,"I'm going to be specific to provide a clear background: 
I was with my first boyfriend for 10 or so months, I was 17 and he was 21. I didn't want to date him at first but he asked me out multiple times (could've been like 5) and I made the stupid decision to date him. The entire relationship, constantly, he was pressuring me into sex and photos and I would usually say no at first then give in, because he would treat it like a big deal and I thought I wasn't doing ""girlfriend things"" or giving him what he needed. It was pretty gaslighty because he'd also say things like ""tell me if you're ever not comfortable with something"" so I thought what he was doing was ok (clearly his actions didn't match this, but at the time he was in my head) He also would get mad or reluctant and lie about things like getting tested for sti's/ using condoms. 

On Halloween I got drunk and got alcohol poisoning, I was passed out and I think he r**ped me, but I didn't say no. And I was kinda awake I just didn't feel like I could talk or move, but If i really wanted to I probably could've summed up the energy to tell him to fuck off or push him off. I was barely awake and kinda stunned

That same day a girl who was 15 said before we were together he lied and said he was 18 and hooked up with her, and if it wasn't for that I wouldn't even consider coming forward about this. I don't want this to happen to other girls. (he's in a band and he would/is trying to use his clout to get with girls)

I have no proof, and he's a compulsive liar that will just deny things until you believe him, even if it takes lying 1000 times. I'd also feel uncomfortable even typing this anonymously I feel disgusted/ reluctant to post it. So I don't feel like I could talk about it with anyone. If my mom found out I know she would never leave me alone and it would be the most uncomfortable thing on the planet. 

Another band messaged me a couple days ago saying they heard he's lying about his age to other girls, and if I think this is true. They said they could try to keep his band from coming to shows. I said/ showed stuff saying he's a psycho, but I didn't say he pressured me or anything like that because this is just a band of dudes and I'd feel uncomfortable coming to them about it. Maybe it's my only option though? Since they said they would keep me anonymous. Or maybe what I've said is enough, hopefully he will get his karma.",25Jul2020,3
419,"So this problem involves a bit of a back story 

Also, i beg you, don't get political.

Another also, some things here may seem a little like a first world problem but whatever

So i live in Israel, in a small town 20 minutes from the nearest big city. The city i live in is depressing, boring, full of bad people (not criminals, it's mostly a high income city) and this place takes a big mental toll from me. The main problem is, i'm a combat soldier in the IDF. That means, i spend 20 days getting my ass ripped in the army (fun fact- the army treats us just as bad as some of us treat palestinians) and i only get the weekend off in my home. Not every weekend, every third weekend. 

That means i get three days a month to rest and go out and live a little. As i said, the city i live in is trash and there is nothing to do here. Only thing there is to do is go the big city 20 minutes away. Getting there is not much of a hustle for me, a 10 minute walk and a 45 minute bus ride (which isn't ideal but isn't too bad) but it's a big burden after returning home all tired in thursday and being mentally and physically drained from the army. I just don't feel like doing the whole thing. 

And the main problem is, this fucking country is full of Jews. Means everything closes down for the weekend. That means, unless i want to spend a shitload of the little money i get on a cab, i'm stuck at home from friday noon to saturday night. I don't have a drivers license, my parents won't drive me anywhere (understandable, they work hard too) and it's too much to walk or bike. 

On top of all of that, i have nothing to do at home and i hate being home. I love my family and everything but they can get insufferable. My little brother and sister (who i truly do love) drive me crazy and i just want to get away from them sometimes. We don't have a normal tv, computer  even our couches, sofas and chairs are useless and uncomfortable. and on my phone i watched everything there is to watch on Netflix and i'm just left bored out of my mind. 

This boredom, the inabilty to go anywhere most of the time, the pressure in my house, the fucking city i live in and the fact that i have 8 months left in the army, and i have been living like this since i was a kid, just makes me drained, depressed and lost. It's like everything in this country is conspiring against me. As soon as i'm released from the army i'm getting my life together but until then, i need some help.

If it helps, i'm a 21 year old guy.",25Jul2020,1

We are 6 days from the end of July. There are maybe 2 boxes complete. The dad has not bought another house, though may move in with his new girlfriend. My relationship is very new. I’ve been staying at this house to help my SO go through some of their stuff and was recruited by them to help pack. 

How do I encourage much needed, fast organizing, packing, and house searching? How do I do this while also helping to mitigate the emotions of three grown adults losing years of memories and family? After asking those last two questions, I’m now questioning if it’s even my place to be here and help or be support or etc. . . .",25Jul2020,1
422,"I would just like to preface this by saying I love my mother very much and she’s a very honest, considerate and down to earth person. I do not believe that she is trying to con me or steal my money, I would just appreciate advice on how to go about handling the situation.

Now I know that £10,000 is a lot of money, but it’s all money she’s set aside for me to have when I turn 21 (I’m 17 right now). Mum’s a doctor and has a pretty decent salary, but the kitchen extension we’re doing has ended up being a money sink and we’re paying almost twice as much as what it was initially meant to cost.

Well, she sat me down this morning and asked if she could withdraw 10k from my account to help pay for the building work. She said she’d already taken some of her own money out of stocks and shares to pay for part of it, but we have a lot of big bills coming up and she would be really grateful if I let her borrow some of my money. (Honestly, I’m glad she asked me, because legally, I think she could just take it out anyway?) She said she should be able to pay me back within a year.

Now, as a teenager who knows absolutely nothing about bank accounts or loans, does anybody have any advice? Do you think I should lend her the money? And if so, should I try to get some sort of contract to ensure I get the money back? 

Thank you so much for any guidance you can offer! I’ll try to answer any questions you have below.",25Jul2020,3
423,"Hey guys 

Was just wondering how any of you’s would go about getting out of working night shifts. I got a job in a towing company as a dispatcher on April this year. I had 0 experience working in such an environment/job and accepted the night shift because of how shitty my previous two jobs were in a restaurant and warehouse (low pay, split shifts and inconsistent). This job now pays me decent nothing special but it’s a chill job. The only thing is I’ve been working night shifts on the weekends since I started (Friday 11pm-11am) and (Saturday 11pm-11am) and Jesus is it fucking miserable. My entire weekend is basically gone I never get proper sleep inbetween those two shifts and since I’m a student and university will be starting again soon. I don’t want to have to hate the weekends and not be able to look forward to them. I’m not the biggest partier or at clubs and events every weekends but I certainly do have my fair share and all that is made almost impossible unless I go on Sunday nights but even then I’m be exhausted for the shift I just had. 

Basically all I want to know is what is the best way in going about getting these shifts changed/shortened or any other solution anyone can think of. Maybe 1 week I work the night shift and the next someone else does on a sort of rotating roster? I get why they put me on them at first as the nights aren’t as busy as the days and I wouldn’t have been able to handle the days when I first started but I’ve gotten much better now. What’s the best way in going about speaking to the boss about this? Should I send him an email or in person? This is my first actual proper regular job and I haven’t really had to deal with this before so some tips would be great.

One example is, I was playing a game, (Adopt Me), and this random stranger asked me to be their Mum. I said why, they said just said because. So, I let them pick me up. They picked me up, walked to a bridge, and dropped me into the water.

I got super mad by this, but, I tried to play it cool, and said “Lol” “but why doe”, and I lost the person. This literally ruined my day.

426,"I recently moved in with my family due to the whole crisis. I've heard my parents complain to me about this one neighbor for a few years, but I never realized how bad it is until today.

Basically they would host parties until very late at night (2-3 AM) multiple times a week. My mom (who's most affected by this) has knocked on their door several times, but it almost seems like the music is getting louder each time. Considering that it's been a problem since my family moved here 3 years ago, I think it's fair to say that we no longer have the obligation to avoid more confrontational approaches.

Unfortunately, this is a fairly new neighborhood (my family was one of the first households to move in) and the HOA seems useless; no one is working at night, so they can't really shut down these parties. Even the police is unhelpful because they are closed after 11 PM. Even the ones that are supposedly open 24/7 rarely picks up the call.

Today we called 877-ASK-LAPD and asked if they could dispatch an officer to shut the party down. 20 minutes later, an officer called us back, asking if there are any injuries involved. We obviously answered no. The police never came before the party was over.

I'm looking for advice on where to proceed here. It's difficult to be patient with my neighbor because they do this multiple times throughout the week, even on weekdays sometimes. I have to wake up at 6 AM everyday because I work on Eastern time; this is becoming more than just a nuisance at this point.

I plan to visit my local station with evidence of noise my parents have been collecting the past few years. Hopefully that will encourage the police to actually do something about this situation. To my knowledge my neighbor has never been fined or anything for their disturbances. 

I'm here to seek advice on how to best proceed because, after seeing how poorly they have been dealing with our noise complaints, I have very low hopes of getting any help from the police. Should I sue my neighbor? What do I need to do in order to do this, what are the risks, and how much would it all cost? I've never been involved in legal actions before, so I have no clue as to how they work.

Thanks in advance!",25Jul2020,2

433,"[Throwaway]  (note: no worries everyone is getting paid, I'm a dummy not an asshole.) I made a mistake. I wanted to get my sister in law something unique for her birthday so I posted in one of those art subs for a commission of art. It's pretty specific, related to a joke she makes. 

I had seen an artist post whose art I really really loved but they were out of my price range--- 100 plus bucks American. Their art is definitely worth that much, I just can't afford it.  I made my own post looking for and artist and listed a much lower price range for what I could afford.  After several days I looked at the responses and picked an awesome artist.  He got on it right away.

Then I noticed that I'd missed a response! It was the original artist I'd seen. She wanted to work on it and was in agreement with the price I'd listed. I don't know why, blame it on being inside for four months or blame it on me being a dumb dumb but I messaged her and said she was hired. It was like a knee jerk reaction. So now she's working on making one too. Now I'll have two versions to give to my sister in law by two artists, which is cool. But
...

I'm awkward at times and this was definitely one of those times. I realized almost immediately after messaging her that if one of them posted my commission that the other might see it and be offended or even not want to work with me in the future. The art is pretty specific, think something like a T-rex in a dress at a masquerade ball dancing with a sheep in a suit. That sort of recognizable. 

Should I let them know what happened and that I've commissioned two people? I'm anxious that one of them will post theirs and the other will be hurt or angry.",25Jul2020,2
434,"So I (20f) have recently gotten out of a 4 year relationship, and started talking to a guy that I used to speak to in my teenage years, which didn’t work because I was a catholic and he was a Lebanese Muslim, we used to get along amazingly and had the best connection. 
anyway the relationship we have is amazing, we are so close and can both see a future there, and we have spoken about the religion barrier, I have no intention of ever converting, and I’ve told him that and he said that he wouldn’t be pursuing me if he wanted me to change anything about myself, but I know deep down that if I was to be with this person that his family would want our children to follow Muslim traditions, as it always happens that you go with the males traditions, and Whereas I respect that 100% and would want to learn everything about their culture, I would also want to celebrate my traditions as I have most of my life, as would my parents. 
My parents would always respect my decision as to who I want to date, but my dad told me that he doesn’t think it would work and that I will have to always have to respect his religion and follow his culture and that mine will be out the window, and it makes me sad because I know that he is right in someway, I have spoken to this guy about it and he said that he would want to teach them about both religions and that we will work it all out, but I know that it might be different in the future and that makes me so sad because we have never had a connection like this with anyone and I can tell that we’re so serious about each other. 
So what I’m asking is has anyone been in this situation or had anyone you know been in a similar situation? How did it work out?

445,"(This has been posted elsewhere)

I am a first year teacher, my mentor/tutor teacher is by all means a lovely but very, very busy woman. We haven't had a one on one meeting in months. I have been seeking ways to really vamp up my reading program coming into this new term. So I have been doing research and lots reading to find resources that I think would work well for my diverse learners. I have an extreme variety in ability levels in my class (reading levels are from 5 -30) and some very extreme behavioral issues. (violent outbursts, self harm during class, destroying class property etc.)

The other day we had a staff meeting in which the senior staff were responding to numerous staff coming forth with general planning questions. I went along, and we had to write our queries/issues down on this piece of paper. My mentor teacher said, 'write down anything that comes to mind, anything at all. She even commented if the kids were being particularity troublesome to write that down as well. I was sort of writing on behalf of myself and a follow first year teacher on to the piece of paper. 

We have a very experienced former teacher on staff, who specializes in literature. So I approached this staff member after the meeting with gears turning in my head and sought advice. They were lovely and offered that we have a sit down and go over my program and find some resources that I may find useful the very next day.  I left that night feeling very optimistic and looking forward to it.

The next day however while I was teaching in class. I was informed that this staff member was going to watch my students for 15 minutes or so because I had to have a meeting with the principal and deputy principal (whose is also my mentor teacher.) I was of course surprised but it just got worst from there.

The principal started off by stating that it was very brave of me to be so vulnerable and admit that I needed help with this. I don't think I said anything in response I was so surprised. He said that basically that they've heard me at this is on top of their priority list.  That catering to different ability groups is 'teaching' and I must need more support with it. 

I'm sitting there thinking, what the hell did I write? A secret confession that my highest form of education was kindergarten? With the issues in my classroom I thought it would just be natural that I would have these issues (thus, I wrote them down *because I was asked*.)

Then my heart just drops when he says that my mentor teacher will be doing a observation on me on Monday. I felt so crushed, embarrassed and humiliated. I was informed that I was not to meet with the staff member I had approached and that I must only correspond with my mentor teacher on such matters. 

I left feeling very confused and embarrassed, all I wanted to do was have a professional conversation with an expert in the field. A torch light shined in the right direction, not a dam integration spot light shined right into my eyes. I know that observations are a big part of this profession but it is just the reason behind it that has shook me up so much.  I already struggle with 'impostor syndrome' and the feelings of inadequacy  I'm also on a temp contract that expires in August and it was near impossible to find a teaching job in the first place.

456,"Throught years we have been very close and shared about everything (discussionwise). A long friendship started since elementary school. We are near 30y, both male.

We had our ups and down in our friendship, but there has also been some disrespectful and jealousy from his side that I didn't appreciated, but we solved that. It started with arguments, ended with peace after a period not talking to each other. At least there's no disrespectful shown today anymore.

Today he's in bad situation, job and education wise. He couldn't perform well in school so he had to quit the school and look for job to get any income. 
But we're living in a country where he will still get his own roof above head and food in the table, no matter what.

I tried to help him, support him applying to jobs, and he really put an effort looking for multiple jobs, however, he had no luck and no one called him over for interview. After asking for his cover letter, I saw the reason why, it was somewhat terrible mistakes in there, some big no no. So I corrected it so he will have much better shots at jobs, but he won't search anymore because he's simply too angry at the world after his efforts and think it owes him. And now he's pulling excuses not to search jobs anymore just like he did before he went to study. He's almost 30y and still demand his father to provide for him. 

And don't like that mindset. I grew up in a way harder environment, still I dont belive the world owes me anything. You have to do right by yourself. 

However, I'm seeing other behavior I'm not comfortable with at all, which is the main reason for posting this. Whenever he's angry at someone, even for a ridiculous reason, he had spoken to me about how he want to hurt/damage the person by exposing her/him. Examples:

An ex girlfriend? Call her current boyfriend and expose some secret. 

Angry at a guy for a ridiculous reason? Expose him to his friends, true or false claim. 

That's just some example. He actually did the first, the second, no idea if he actually did it but it's unnecessary and that guy didn't really do anything wrong except being angry at my friend.

For this very reason I'm not sharing any Achilles heel with him anymore. And I should maybe have cut him off a long time ago already.

I've finally built my future after a very long hardship in my life, and I want other in my circle to success and be happy as well, but I don't want any toxicity in my life. Should I keep our friendship or should I distance myself from him? 

This post painted him as a monster, which he isn't at all, and there's also reason why he's my best friend. But these behaviour scares me a little. 

Lately he's also shown to be anti-vaccine, believes in 5G conspiracy as well that covid is fake.. And bunch other conspiracy, that it's now actually surprising that he's not an earth-flatener as well. He thinks I'm small minded because I'm not believing in these conspiracy.. just wow..",25Jul2020,1
457,"About 2 weeks ago, I got into a minor argument with my long distance girlfriend, she blew up at me over something that she later admitted was nothing at all. 7 days of space later she called and told me we had to breakup, which before this was completely unexpected. When asked why she said it was to do with doing what's healthy for her, and all the little thing adding up. Of course I was devastated as I absolutely adore her and think od her as perhaps the best person I know.

Fast forward a week from then and we interact as usual, have the same great conversations, call as usual. During this time I'm not doing well though, I sleep most of the day, fallen behind on university and struggle to get through a meal a day. Suicidal ideation is present. I take antidepressants and I keep my regime up however.

Last night though, I lose control of all my intrusive thoughts, and feel the strongest sense of worthlessness and hopelessness that the only reason people talk to me is because they feel sorry for me. That I'm nothing but a burden and that people would be better off without me.
I express all this to her and she tries to reassure me, in my blind self-hatred the last thing I say is ""please don't worry about me, none of this is any of your fault"" before I deactivated my social media. Some stuff happened here next inside my head that I won't talk about but I experienced hallucinations over things I thought I said and did, but turned out didnt which left me rattled.

I wake up the next morning realising what id done and I scream. In the past, one of her exes had tried to kill himself and expressed much suicidal behaviour, leaving her for days glued to her phone waiting to hear if there was a body.  And I realised I had done the same thing to her and put her through that again. 

The most prominent message she sent me was ""to have the last thing you say be to not worry and that things weren't my fault, only to block any contact with you after, leaving me frantically searching for people i could get in touch with who'd be able to get to you, nobody knowing where you are""

Knowing I could do that to the person I care most about in the world has left me wracked with guilt and regret. I dont expect her to want any more contact with mr after that and I cant blame her. She's my only true friend though and losing her would push me so far to the edge. I love her so much, is letting her go the right thing to do?

I dont know why I said any of that to her, things were going okay and I go and sabotage the best thing I have in my life for no reason at all. Such immense guilt and self-hatred at my stupidity

460,"I’m 22(F) most of the girls I hang out with are not regular friends, they’re more like friends that hit me up when there’s a party etc.
I feel like I’m used as a disposable friend as I’m usually the eldest one in the group. 
I’m always being brought around new people and then treated differently.
I also feel like my mental state causes me to feel guilty if somebody displays that they don’t like what I’ve said and/ or acted... even though I never cause the problem, I just speak my annoyance when somebody takes the piss one too many times or when plans get changed(usually because somebody wants to have sex with a random, I thought that is was law; when you go out at night together, you ALL return home together, especially if the plan was to stay at said persons house??) 
I’m the only one that drinks(moderately) and nobody does drugs.

I must admit, I tend to hold grudges and once I’ve had enough with a “friend” I’ve had enough. I will mentally unfriend them but as soon as they call and sweet talk me we’re friends again and the cycle repeats.

Thought I might note, I’m quite a lonely, introverted person and I like it that way, however, I do get bored. It’s not regular that I go out with friends but when I do a problem always arises.

I don’t know if I’ve outgrown these type of friendships or if I’m overreacting in these situations as I tend to get anxious and overthink. Also these friends are the type to call me spontaneously every few months or so to go out again as if nothing happened.",25Jul2020,1
462,"My family has become close over the years with the family that lives next to us. We go out to dinner regularly and have become friends. They are a husband and wife in their mid-50’s, my husband and I are in our 40’s. For years now we have known that the wife is...mouthy. She’s not afraid to say anything. We’ll make an improvement to our yard and she’ll straight up ask us how much it costs and where we got the money from. We hear her occasionally yelling at her husband, bossing him around, etc. We’ve always just chalked it up to her personality and brushed it off.

Recently we got a dog and this woman’s pushy personality has gone into overdrive. She assumes that we are awful dog parents. We had her and her family over for a gathering and she kept saying things like, “This dog needs to be walked!” and “This dog needs to be trained!” and “Does he stay in his cage all day?”

She doesn’t know that our dog gets walked around the neighborhood for 30-45 minutes every morning. And yeah, we have every intention of having the dog trained, but there’s a fucking pandemic going on. And no, he doesn’t stay in his cage all day, we put him in it when we are eating or otherwise can’t give him our full attention. She explained to us that she assumed he was in his cage all the time because she’s working from home due to COVID and she hears him barking. He’s a puppy and he yips when he wants something or when our cats walk by him.

She has mentioned she might randomly stop by sometime to visit the dog, that she had thought about taking him out for exercise, checking on him, etc. 

Her behavior is really starting to bug me. We have a special needs child and pretty much my whole life is taking care of them. I also am the majority caregiver of our dog and our other pets.

If I don't respond then I'll be rude' 'just give them what they want and maybe they'll leave me alone.

467,"Hi! Can someone help explain my emotions, it's really hard. I don't see my counselor for awhile so any help will be appreciated!

I've noticed I put some of my friends on some sort of pedestal, like, I admire them. I get infatuated with some from time to time then it dies down, goes slow, then repeats. It's a really intense platonic love which is hard on me sometimes - I forget my friends even have flaws for example, if one friend mentions they are emotionally driven so they don't react well or they get anxious from time to time I tend to get shocked/surprised! Because l never viewed them that way, I never view them in a negative light!

I never have had this with my partner though- I view him as a flawed human being just like me. I don't get infatuated with him (which is probably a good thing) and it makes me doubt whether I love him or not which is a huge burden on me because why do I get infatuated with friends but not my own partner? Is that weird? Is it normal?

Another interesting thing, I don't know if this is relevant or not but I don't get infatuated with another long time friend either, I've known him for 6 years and I notice one of the differences is that he tells me when things aren't going that great for him. The people I tend to get infatuated with do not speak about their problems as much and when they do it doesn't change how I view them. Maybe because I idolize them or something?",25Jul2020,1

469,"I was in a relationship with a lass for close to 4 years. Not too long ago I broke up with her, this is like, why I guess. So about 3 years and a bit into the relationship in October last year we where just coming out of the  first rough patch our relationship ever rly had. I went to meet her one day and she got straight the the point. She wanted to break up with me. She named all these different reasons that didn’t make sense and then finally she says “I’m a lesbian” that was it. That was the reasoning, she was jus dancing around the point with the other shit she was spouting. I was respectful, I said ok but I need you to look me in the eye and tell me this is over. She did exactly that I said goodbye and walked home. Then on the night of my birthday party I get a phone call off her about how she missed me so much and made a huge mistake and wanted me back. I told her I would meet her the next day at 6 after she got off work. We met and talked for about 2 hours and we got back together and I was so incredibly happy. Things where amazing for a month then everything kind of came at once. She tells me she’s not attracted to me physically just my personality (I don’t think I’m particularly ugly but that’s not the point here) but then a week later she tells me she is physically attracted to me. And every other week she had a new gender or sexuality or whatever and this was going on since about the 2 year mark of the relationship. Then a few weeks go by and i was self conscious and upset she said I should talk to her about it, I said I was confused if she actually found me attractive or not she said she did and I said I couldn’t trust that because how the fuck could I? Then she said “fuck off don’t come to me with stupid questions that don’t have answers” so I jus went home and sat alone and sad for a while until I felt better. Then a few weeks later whenever I tried messaging her She would always say “I’m busy I can’t talk” “I’ll talk to you later” but she never did talk to me later, and whenever I did try and talk to her she would just kill the conversation after about 5 messages. The only replies I would get where “yeah” “ok” And would never be able to go out. After 2 weeks of this I finally got to go meet her for an hour. The whole time she was jus mean to me and idk if she told me this knowingly or not but when she wasn’t able to talk to me she’d in fact been talking to loads of people (not work related) I got home, upset, not badly but still upset and decided. From tomorrow I’m going not going to message her I’ll see how long it takes for her to message me. On the Sunday of the next week she messaged me asking how things where with us I said “things are ok on my end ur the one being dodgy” she reckoned I’d been wanting space that’s why I didn’t message her and claimed I was the one in the wrong here, I’m sorry but I just wasn’t and no chance I was being blamed for this, we ended up in and argument and she said “you either accept I have no time for you or we move on” so I told her to go fuck her self and never come near me again, how can u have a relationship if u have time for every other cunt but the person ur in a relationship with.

478,"Sorry for the long post - 

TLDR: I missed one appointment with my therapist and she discharged me the next day during a time of personal crisis that she knew about. 

Come February, my SAD had hit an all time high, I hadn’t been able to find employment for over year, I’m living at my parents house to save up with my husband in our first year of marriage. And the COVID hits and I’m stuck inside. It was an all around shitty time as most of you I’m sure can relate. 

My psychiatrist and husband both told me I needed to get back into therapy to work out some issues that had reappeared. So I found a new therapist through my HMO ( this is important- she can see all of my health issues and medical records bc they’re all available to every doctor I see in my plan). The first appt went okay. I did see her check her Iwatch about 2 times which kind of made my feel uncomfortable- it’s my time im paying for after all. I chalked it up to her checking the time for my appt. Later on after I hadn’t made an appt in a few weeks due to offices being shutdown for COVID- she sent me a message letting me know she was available for phone calls and video visits if I needed to make an appt. So I did bc my mental state had gone from bad to worse not only bc of the pandemic but bc I was put on Wellbutrin and it made my symptoms go through the roof and caused me to feel suicidal. 

I made an emergency appt with her bc I was having an extremely hard time and told her everything I had been going through. Family issues mixed with medication issues that had caused me to self harm for the first time in almost 14 years. I thought we were finally starting to make a break through during the conversations and let my previous doubts about our patient/doctor relationship slide out of mind. 

About 2 months ago now, right around the time my psych had switched me to a completely different medication for about a week at that time, I missed an appointment with my therapist. It was a late night appt over the phone and it was the first week of my switching meds and I can honestly say I was having brain zaps. I was transitioning off Zoloft after a year. I didn’t even realize I missed the appointment until about 3 weeks later when I checked my HMO app and saw an email about it. And then the next email in my inbox shocked me. It was a discharge letter from the therapist ! It came the day after I had missed the appointment. 

I have been with this HMO for quite some time now. The only other therapist I have been discharged from was one that I didn’t make an appt with for 4 months bc we had gotten me to a good point. I understand that I missed an appointment but I’m honestly angered and confused as to why an educated therapy specialist would discharge a patient in the middle of personal crisis? I told her the appointment before that I had self harmed and was having passive suicidal thoughts and had been on the phone with a suicide hotline. And this is where the HMO part comes into play- she could obviously she that I had just gone off a new medication bc of increased anxiety and depression with passive suicidal thoughts (in the notes from my psych in my chart) and that i had just transitioned from a medication I had been on for over a year to something completely different, which can be a trying and difficult time in it’s own right and a fact she should most definitely know as a mental health professional. 

On top of it all, during an unprecedented pandemic that has left us all mentally rocked. I have let this sit in the back of my mind for 2 months now. Am I wrong to be upset? Am I wrong to feel so angry and neglected by her? Another important detail I want to throw out is that I worked in medical offices for awhile
I completely understand the importance of a doctor’s time and skills. I know there are other patients who could have used my appt time that I missed and I hate myself for doing that and will not use the circumstances of my mental health at the time as an excuse. However, 2 weeks before this happened, I had cleared out my afternoon and taken off an hour early for an appointment she had scheduled with me only for her to message me and hour before and say she accidentally double booked and would have to reschedule. My time is important too and how did she know that that appointment she cancelled on me could have been very important  for me. 

I’m now at the point where I’d like to email her and ask her why and how she thinks that’s an acceptable practice? I have even thought about reporting her over this bc it honestly angers me so much. I feel like it was completely unprofessional, rude, and almost petty. Petty bc she discharged me the day after I missed an appointment and the letter said “you are being discharged bc you have no future appointments set.” Like ... what ?

Here's the story. I've just turned 16 and I'm at a party with my classmates and friends. It's my first time getting drunk, so I way overdo it. At some point in the night a girl I only vaguely know is taking all her clothes off for some reason, and the rest is kind of a blur but I remember being sat on this bed, with her laid next to me totally naked. For some fucked up reason I patted her on the right boob a few times. Not because I was sexually interested in her, I found the whole thing a bit awkward to be honest. But I never asked, and she didn't say anything afterwards. What the hell was I thinking? I have no idea how she felt about this, or whether she dwells on it now. All I do know is I'm a piece of shit who can't move on from what I did.

I probably had some sexist idea in my head that because she was naked it was ok. I know, what an absolute asshole. She wouldn't have wanted that, and I feel awful for subjecting her to it. And yeah, there's probably (I suffer with anxiety) a selfish part of me that is afraid of being sent to jail for it. But the overrding emotion I have is just shame and regret. 

I've grown since then, and all that. But it doesn't excuse what I did. So what should I do?

For example, if a lyric describes I feeling anxious if I listen to it enough I start to feel anxious. 
Maybe it’s possible I’m subconsciously trying to fit into the molds of songs.

Anyway if I am manifesting or subconsciously making myself relate to lyrics could I counter act this by listening to happy lyrics and make myself feel better?

A few days ago my best friend told me that she had feelings for me (we are both girls both bi) and she would like to go our friendship a step a head. I've noticed that she liked to spend more time with me than the with rest of the group and buy me small cute stuff I like , one time she slipped her while talking that she stalks my followers and she asks me continuously the sexualtiy of my friends. 
. 
She has an ex bf that she had planned to go on vacations with , she literally told me ""do I look like I have feelings for him anymore""  when I brought it up. She's an empath and I understand that she wants to clear things up with him. Eventually I told her that I like her too and told me that she chooses to stay with me this summer and therefore she won't go

A few days later she decided to go with him. I was fond of, I didn't object, I trusted her.

One of our internet mutuals , send me the messages they exchanged before and after she confessed. Before the thing, she was convinced that I liked her!! Even tho I value frienships, and I don't know, she misunderstood the friendly gestures towards her, as a love interest (I find her so cool that I had deleted that option, literally out of my league) she texted that mutual that she would never be with me bc I dismiss her??? Even tho that's not true, I always tell her how great she is. Anyways after the confession that friend dmed her again asking how it's going, and she told them that ""I told her she's fine, because if I said, id never be with you, it would offend her"" and then ""I went on vacations with a guy she should understand, and if she expects any other signs from me I'll tell her that"" 

she literally told me that she feels that spark with me?and she fantasizes me a lot? But then I remembered, that when I told her ""let's meet up so I can give you kisses"" 
She told me ""no do that when im yours"" 
And she kept flirting

486,"I've been with my boyfriend for around 3 years, and my self-esteem has gotten very low. I don't feel good about my body anymore. When I was looking into how to change that, I realised that he literally never, not once, actually complimented me or told me I look nice or that he loves my body. 

I know he likes my body - he never tells me to change either. He enjoys being close to me and to look at me. But he never says so. When I ask him if I look nice, if he still likes my body, he won't ever just say ""yes, I like your body"". He kind of turns it into a backhanded comment I guess, or makes it funny. He often says things like ""you know, a few hundred years ago, you would've been treated like a goddess"" or ""but your tummy rolls are so soft! where would I rest my head if I was with someone skinny?"" 

When I asked him if he thought I was at least kinda cute, he told me ""you aren't exactly pretty but I'm with you because of your personality so you don't have to look cute.""

I know he likes me but ... the way he phrases it rarely makes me feel good about myself. Do I need to toughen up and accept that only I can change how I feel about myself? Or do you think he should be nicer to me?",25Jul2020,1
487,"Hello,

My wife is an experienced and talented UX/UI designer. She has also been graphic designing for more than 10 - 15 years and she is only 27. Recently, my dear and closest friend asked if she could help design his Logo and Application Interface. My wife was very happy to do so. She has been feeling that she is not good enough and I want to jump start her confidence a bit. My friend from the get go said he cannot afford to pay the full rate of a designer and so my wife gave him a severely discounted rate. More so because he is my oldest and closest friend for so many years. I trust my friend completely and I wanted to do the following;

My wife’s original standard rate for the above work is about $5000. However, she quotes my friend $500. My friend is very happy with the service and I know that his finances does not grant him the ability to pay the above. That being said; I would like to give him 4.5k that he can transfer to my wife and telling her that he can probably cover that in his next round of fundings. I want her to feel deserving for her hard work. She can surly open her own free lance which I am helping her do but, I have a feeling that this will solidify her confidence in her abilities. I am here to see if anyone sees differently and if this may have a negative effect on my wife’s growth. Also maybe its worth mentioning; my wife is already a UX UI consultant at one of the largest consulting companies in the world. 

TLDR; I want to pay my friend extra money so he can pay my wife her full design rate to increase her confidence. My wife offered him a discount because of his situation (financial) but I can make the above work with my friend.",25Jul2020,2
488," have a hard time making friends. Not in the “I’m shy and I have trouble finding people to hang out with” because that’s not the case. I have people who I can hang out with, hell I even have friends of several years who I can do things with. The problem is I have a hard time strengthening these relationships and connecting with these people. 
For example, take my best friend. I have been friends with her since 2nd grade (I’m 19). I love being around her, but the problem is she’s always too busy for me. I ask to hang out and she always has some excuse why we can’t hang out, so our hang out have to be carefully planned out. We hang out an hour or 2 to maintain our friendship, then go our separate ways. 
For example 2, my other best friend is readily available and I hang out with her a few times a week. But the problem is I can’t be my true self around her. She gets easily offended and is a very “my way or the highway” type of person. 
I could go through example after example of these people who are my “friends” of several years but I can’t truly connect to or be myself around. 
People are always telling me things like
“Be yourself! “It takes a friend to be a friend!” “Put yourself out there!” Etc. Etc. But I am doing all of these things and nothing seems to work. Growing up, it was always hard to see my sister make close friends so easily while I am mostly stuck at home with a few casual friends. 
Several of my friends are very high achievers and are not people I can just chill and be spontaneous around, not to mention I’m mostly the person reaching out and making all the plans. The other friends in my life are people who take advantage of my emotional support and advice giving and aren’t willing to reciprocate the emotional support I provide. I feel forgotten, taken advantage of, and like someone who people like, but not enough to pursue a real friendship with. 
How can I find people I can let my guard down around? It seems like it’s never as easy as just asking new people to hang out. I never seem to get past the initial getting to know the person phase better.",25Jul2020,1

490,"This is my first post like this so forgive me if formatting is odd. 

I (18F) saw my friend a week ago, as we are now allowed to meet others. He texted me two days ago to let me know he has been basically confirmed to have it. While I do not have any symptoms, I did a test and let my manager know, saying that I won’t be able to do the shift while I wait for results.

This is where the concerning part occurred. She texted me to let me know I need to find a cover OR I would HAVE to come and I would just wear a mask and use hand sanitiser. This is extremely against government guidelines and is clearly a health violation. 

Thankfully, I found cover very easily and didn’t have to go through that scenario as either way I wasn’t coming in. I also got my test back also which was negative, thank god. But I am now conflicted whether I should say something to her, should try to report it or just leave it as it ended well. 

A couple things about my situation is, this is my first job and I will be going to uni in a month in which I would most definitely need a job. Trying to find jobs at the uni is very difficult and I don’t know how much a good reference from her would help that situation, I can also come back and work here in the summer. Furthermore she is quite a petty person, so I can see her trying to get back at me by cutting shifts or something of that sort if I report her and she finds out. I can’t really stand confrontation either. 

Any advice would be appreciated.",25Jul2020,1
491,"I have been a regular with a sex worker at a massage parlour. This was my 5th time seeing her this yesterday this month.

I just had a session with her yesterday. Everything was ok but we went for a second go (doggy style) and unbeknownst to me, the condom had slipped off and I ended up ejaculating inside her. This was totally unintentional on my part and I feel so bad it happened. I apologized profusely but she said not to worry or stress and that she will book an appointment. I just feel so bad because I am worried what she thinks of me now. I tipped $90 (all of what I had at the time) on top of the $300 full service to make up for the inconvenience I caused.

She told me not to stress and she seemed not to have been bothered by it. I asked her if she was angry with me and she said no. I feel so bad for the extra stress this may have caused her. I wish I had been more vigilant :(

Ever since today, my anxiety has been making me feel very bad about this. It seems we had developed a connection and I had always been trying my best to be the best client. I would ask before doing anything and I would treat her with the utmost respect that I could show. I also feel bad because during the session before this happened, she was mentioning how she did appreciate me as a client. After this happened, she said she still liked me as a client nonetheless and that I should come see her again. But, I feel bad I was not more vigilant and that this situation happened despite all my attempts to make the experience the most positive for her. It was totally unintentional and a situation I had no control over. It seems I am not able to let go of what happened. I keep telling myself I cannot change what happened but I still have intrusive thoughts and I cannot go about the rest of my day. I would really appreciate any help to deal with this.

Should I go back for another session today to make sure all is ok while being extra vigilant this time? Perhaps a positive last session would make me forget what happened.

I would really appreciate it if no negativity is used in your answer. It would exacerbate the situation and make my anxiety worse. If you have any words that could comfort me, I would truly appreciate it. Thank you so much in advance!

492,"Well yeah, there's this person with whom i had a pretty close relationship but it was always platonic. 

Recently i realized i'm bi so that i theoretically could like them in a romantic way and since that day my mind is 24/7 questioning if i like them. But every thought of us dating makes me extremely uncomfortable and not really happy. But then again, they are constantly on my mind and they are the first person that comes to my mind when i listen to a love song or anything but i don't feel any butterflies or anything it's just that my mind constantly jumps to that person in this context and i'm just like :/
That's supposed to be tHe lOvE of mY LiFe?? Wow, kinda disappointing. 

You know, i've had crushes before and with them i would get happy to see them, i would want to be near them and always look for their attention but with this person it's actually the opposite. When they text me, i don't get excited, there's literally no emotion on my face and then they ask me if we wanna meet (we were/are pretty close friends) and my first thought was 'ah shit here we go again' because i declined one of their offers to meet once before and i still don't feel like seeing them because idk feel like it would be awkward and boring and that i would have to change my attitude to be a more exciting person (because they know me as such) but i don't feel like doing cool stuff atleast not with them. 

Before i started questioning our relationship, it was completely platonic but we were very close and this person made me very happy. But now that my mind is always connecting their name with things like romantic feelings or even love and i'm like 'do i like them that way??' but everytime i come to the conclusion that i would hate the idea of us being in a relationship. It just feels super weird and awkward and also kinda gross in some way idk. Point is, they don't make me happy anymore. In fact, the more my mind forces me to think about us in a relationship the more i dislike this person.

Before you come at me with things like internalized homophobia, no that's not the problem here, i've seen cute guys and cute girls and honestly i would go for it. But just not with this person, i just really don't like it. Then sometimes my brain tries to tell me that maybe this is jealousy or even love or whatever and that i don't accept it but if this is what love feels like please keep it far away from me because it doesn't give me a lot of happiness (not like other crushes i've had). But then again i don't have any clue why this person is constantly on my mind which is why i'm posting this, maybe you guys have any idea. 

My guess is that my mind knows the thought of it makes me extremely uncomfortable which is why it always makes me think about it. Also i feel like i should add that it's LESS  the person that's on my mind, MORE the question IF i like this person. 

Idk i feel like i need objective advice from someone.

TL;DR This person is constantly on mind but i don't like them that way because the thought of us makes me uncomfortable but i also can't figure out how to get them off my mind.",25Jul2020,1

He looked very real and in the dream I was screaming his name to get his attention. He finally looks over and I told him that I miss him. He then begins to cry and I look away.

 I try to go for my jog and run but then I end up in the air and I see him somewhere else in my backyard. My body begins to uncontrollably “fly” towards towards him and as I’m going near him, he begins to pray. He said, “please protect my daughter...” and other things I cannot remember. 

I tried to force myself to wake up but it was hard to. As I’m about to wake up my body kind of jerked for a little bit as if I couldn’t get out of the dream.

B lost 2 sets of her ear rings and  her anklets when she stole them from mom to show off to her school  friend when she was 13, after marriage she got her parts of jewelry. but  wanted more jewelry, so dad gave her 2lakh to buy gold, but she spend  it all in waste. my mom later brought 4 sets of small gold hoops for  everyone other then my sister coz my ears started to hurt for wearing  mom's heavy earring. dad brought 3sets of good designed ear ring for us  three younger daughter to match our chains. it didn't seem like a issue  for B that time.

500,"I tried a lot of things, and I don't know what to do next. So here I am. Here's some context.

First, I think something is wrong with me. I made an appointment to a psychiatrist, and I'm seeing my assigned doctor on a regular basis. Actually, and during some days, I feel really low. Usually, it lasts less than a week. But it seems worse and worse, since these feelings last longer and longer, and the ""free-time"" between two crisis is shorter and shorter. 

So I feel really bad, like a big failure. Everyone of my family and my friends seems to be successful in every moment of their life. I'm a uni student, I'm the only one among my friends to have re-take exams, every year since 2017.
 
I have headaches, suicidal thoughts*, I ruminate a lot*, and I have little to no energy. However, I have to pass my exams, so I have to study. It's really painful, I can't concentrate for more than 10 minutes, and I feel like my head will explode at any moment. Painkillers do nothing about it.

I tried to reduce screentime (max. 1-2 hours/day), caffeine (2 cups). I thought sugars could help me, but it seems not. I drink water (2 liters/day), and avoid snacks like sweets, chocolate bars, etc. I don't like sweetened drink.

Before you ask, my assigned doctor gave me melatonin and etifoxine. He knows everything I wrote, except for suicidal thoughts, since I'm not willing to make a mistake by killing myself, or at least, by killing myself too early, and telling him could be worse than anything.

It helped to talk about my feelings and things got better until I started getting panic attacks and anxiety attacks. Everytime I get an attack I feel so horrible for a period of time, then it gets better until another attack happens.

I started therapy and it did help a lot! In my last therapy, I told my therapist I was sick of allways feeling like something is wrong with me. She then told me two things: that she still thinks I have depressive symptoms and that I should consult a doctor to potentially take antidepressants pills. 

When I told this to my mother she told me that if their is no way to heal me without pills then we will do it but we should try without first, because those pills contain drugs and she doesn’t want me to be addicted to them.

Now I don’t know. I’ve only been in therapy for 6 months now so should I wait? But at the same time I want my pain to end as fast as possibly and I’m scared therapy won’t be enough.

Thanks to this helpful article, I’ve been noticing a pattern I have when it comes to me trying to make friends and connect with people, Like the article says if the relationship feels too easy it doesn’t feel safe/ rewarding enough. 

For me, I guess love had to feel hard and be earned from difficult people that dismiss me or don’t even like me. So, like it was a competition or something lol, I would try so hard to change their minds and accommodate to them to win these difficult people over because I thought I was doing something wrong or something was wrong with me that I couldn’t get to them.

Of course I learned I got this pattern from my unavailability and hard to please mother and father who back then never seemed to (Or at least I felt like they didn’t) think I was good enough or I was always doing something wrong. So I stuffed my thoughts, feelings, pretty much my whole self away because it was unacceptable and tried to do whatever please them.

I’m slowly recognizing my worth that nothing’s wrong with me I was just made to believe that by other people, but I still feel lonely and want people that I naturally care and love for around me without having to do the above and them to do the same for me back. 

Any advice on how I can recognize the right type of people or how an actual healthy relationship should e like is very much appreciated. Thank you 🙏",25Jul2020,1

I was in a relationship and I was abusive towards my ex, not physically, but in the emotional and verbal ways- like really bad. I have ADHD and really bad depression, I got extremely low to the point of which I was hospitalised. After this I took 3 months off of school, but almost two years on I can’t let go of my behaviour, I’m obsessive over it and I can’t even apologise to her or anything...

530,"First thing I want to say is that I'm not diagnosing my dad, he has been officially diagnosed and was at one point on antidepressants. I'm not sure what happened but at some point he stopped taking them and despite experiencing a lot of the same symptoms as he did before that he doesn't think it's depression this time. He keeps saying it's something he just needs to shake, but doesn't seem to realize that last time he dealt with this is a lot like now. 

The pandemic plus a lot of life changes seem to be hitting him pretty hard. On top of that my brother was just diagnosed with depression as well, and I have been diagnosed previously. It seems to run in our family. 

It's just frustrating because on a personal level I know what my dad is going through and I keep trying to get him to see a doctor again so he can get a prescription for antidepressants. I keep trying to mention that a lot of what he says he's experiencing are things I experience with depression, but he always gets kind of odd and quiet when I say that. I'm not sure why, but it seems to make him uncomfortable so I don't want to keep doing it. I just don't know what else to do because this isn't new and he even had a med that was working for him. It's the same one I take - my psychiatrist prescribed it when I mentioned my dad thought it worked well for him - so I can even get him the information about it and everything so he can take it to a psychiatrist where he lives and start back up on that again. He's mentioned that he doesn't want to be on meds which I know a lot of people feel but I've tried making the comparison to meds for a problem like high cholesterol but it didn't seem to work. I also try to mention that lots of people are dealing with depression because of this whole pandemic and all the stress it's causing but I don't want to make it seem like oh yeah everyone's dealing with this and also if doesn't seem to have the intended effect of making him realize this is depression, he still thinks it's just some funk he's got to get himself out of. 

I also try to listen to him talking about what's stressing him out, it sounds a lot like what I experience and I try to empathize and acknowledge his feelings but it sounds like he's just really in the thick of it and struggling. He just got remarried after my mom divorced him and I also don't want it to impact his current marriage because it would just suck for him to go through divorce again, especially since this is a fixable problem. 

I'm just not sure what else to do. He keeps mentioning he's not sure how he's going to make it through this year and I'm worried he's getting towards suicidal but doesn't want to say it. Everyone else on that side of my family gossips like crazy so I don't want to ask them about it because it doesn't seem like he says anything to them (if he did I'd probably hear it from them but I haven't so I'm assuming he hasn't said anything) and if I brought it up to them it'd become this whole big thing, and I don't want him to feel like he can't talk to me.",25Jul2020,1

539,"
A little backstory, my mom got pregnant with me at the young age of 16. I went to the same High School she and Dad went to. Many people expected that I’d end up just like my mother, along with several other sexual rumors about me. Anyway, I graduated High School with honors and even got accepted to my dream University but mom didn’t want me to go there since it was far away from home. (She also cut off contact with me for 3 months after knowing I didn’t enroll to the course that she wanted me to be in).

I was always sexually liberated and made it a point in High School and even until now to educate people on sex because I want to stop the shame that comes along with it. Also take in mind that I’ve been posting sexual jokes on social media for years but like every millennial, I block my family members from seeing these posts.

Tonight my mom got a message from one of her friends who was apparently also friends with me, said friend sent her a screenshot of one of my said sex memes and she started berating me about how I shouldn’t be posting things like that for everyone to see. 

I had a lengthy explanation about how my past has been muddled with so much misinformation about sex and how that paved the way for me to be more sexually liberated. Take in mind that my mom and I joke about sex all the time, but I told her the reason I blocked her on my sexual posts is because of this exact reason that she’d freak out on me saying she’s only looking out for me when she’s only looking out for her reputation of having the perfect daughter. 

I’m 21 and married by choice, have no children and no plans of having any until my husband and I are completely sure we can handle the responsibility. I’ve graduated college and am the bread-winner of the family. I feel like I should have more freedom to do whatever I want on my social media. 

My mother is also the same woman that supports a President that jokes about raping women (not from America). I told her how unfair it was that she’s okay with a President joking about raping women yet is upset when her daughter makes a harmless joke towards herself about being a libra and enjoying sex.

I initially planned on cutting off contact with her because of political differences, but tonights’ argument just made it clear she’s more concerned about what others feel than what her daughter feels. I dunno, should I cut off contact now or wait for her to come around?",25Jul2020,1

Recently, my boyfriend moved out of his mom’s house and in with me. His mom’s house was very bad in a lot of ways, and one of those ways is cat piss. Everywhere. On everything. The litter box never got cleaned often enough.

A lot of the stuff he brought over reeks of it. His clothes, his laundry basket, his misc container, his guitar case— I’ve tried washing some of the stuff, but the smell will not come out. It remains there, very faint even to me, but present. It’s almost indistinguishable from the smell of a dusty attic or new clothes shipped in plastic, but if you have a good enough nose, you can tell.

I don’t know what to do about this. Obviously, I don’t want to ask him to throw some of the only belongings he has out. But the washer WILL NOT get the smell out, and we ran the guitar case twice on the highest and hottest setting.

Anyway, I made a stupid comment about something blm related (she is black and passionate about the cause) and without realizing, my texts sounded really arrogant and privileged after rereading them after the fact. I am definitely not anti-BLM and really just messed up how I worded my sentences. Shouldn’t have involved myself in the conversation to begin with. She blocked me on pretty much everything and I totally understand why because I sounded like a jerk at the time.

Recently I was with a mutual friend who was texting her saying he was with me when I told him not to, and he said she texted that she misses me and was just annoyed. I sorta shrugged it off because I didn’t want to get my hopes up. She still has me blocked and hasn’t messaged me since nor have I to her. I went on tiktok once the other week and saw her post and felt sad that we aren’t in contact any more. I didn’t message her but I thought about it but realized that looks really desperate and almost harassment. 

Is there anything I can do now? I understand why she may not want to talk to me but I just feel like it was so abrupt and it’s been so much time now that we could resume a normal friendship.

A quick summary of my life. I was born in a medium class household, we had our ups and downs, after high school, went to a local college, did my foundation and went to do my degree overseas. I was lucky as my parents could afford it for me at the time. But I've always went with the flow and as I graduated I realised I can't really keep ""going with the flow"". I'm currently an accountant working in a small firm while sitting for my professional papers.

I'm not trying to complain because I am grateful of the opportunities I had. But I kind of feel suffocated? I never really enjoyed accounting in general but at the time that was the path laid out for me. And I have a serious case of Fomo (tried to do a few things on the side which failed) which I'm trying to better manage. Trying to be positive with money I've lost. I rarely seek advice from my parents (or anybody) but whenever I do it's the same thing being ""you are doing better than your peers, it's hard to find a job back home""  which I guess is technically true. (Plus my parents were really poor when they were younger so I tried my best to do what they think was best but they were not super strict tho)

Am I still too naive? Should I be more grateful for what I have despite being unhappy? I know I'm not good at my job but I can't abruptly quit just because of that right?

I'd be great if anybody can offer their opinions and advice.",25Jul2020,1
565,"I was driving with him and talking about women and then he told me. Those “business trips” were actually him going to have an affair. He told me it’s not the first time either and he currently has a girlfriend

What made it worse is that he decided to tell me because he “trusts me”. Cleary he doesn’t not understand me as his son and believes i’m not gonna tell my mom. 

When’s the best time to tell them? Currently they’re both thinking of moving near my dads job after my brother graduates hs. 

I honestly don’t know what to do he’s paying for my college tuition rn and I still live with them. 

Some of you might say get a job, but I really can’t. I just have been so depressed for the past 6 months and just wanted to collapse at my previous job. So please any advice will do",25Jul2020,1
566,"the title says it all, really. whenever someone talks to me in an angry tone or yells at me, i end up flinching. but the thing is, it always makes my mom mad when that happens. every time she gets mad at me (usually at least once every day), i end up doing it, and it just makes her even angrier, which ends up making me feel awful for the rest of the day.   
however, ive been reading about it, and it seems like its a perfectly normal reaction?? but i dont know anymore, i just feel like its unnatural and i hate it. i dont want to make people mad. i just want it to stop.  


is this a normal reaction to have? and even if it is, is there a way to stop it from happening?",25Jul2020,1

568,"So some backstory. My now wife dated a guy for about 5 years. He cheated on her with another girl for 3 months then left her. Fast forward a year she Mets me and we start dating and 8 months later we get married. About 4 months ago her ex and the girl he cheated on her with broke up. 

My wife has this guy blocked on everything. Well about a month and a half ago he sent her an email. My wife told me about it and we read it together and kinda laughed about it. I asked her at that time if she intended on responding. She told me no. About 4 days later we are looking at pictures on her phone together when a email notification comes in from him. Naturally I asked about it and then opened it with her next to me thinking it was going to just be another email from him. As soon as I clicked it she snatched the phone out of my hand and got defensive. I immediately knew something was up. 

She flipped to the other side of the bed and said she was going to sleep. To which I immediately responding telling her that’s not how this works. I could tell by the way she was acting something was up. I convinced her to give me her phone and saw they had been talking through email the last 3 days. Now nothing bad was in these emails. Nothing like “oh I miss you” or anything close along those lines. She actually was even talking about me and the things we do to him. If I wouldn’t have known the guys name I would have just thought it was two old friends catching up.  

I explained to her how I didn’t care what was said in the messages or even the fact that she responded it was the fact that she lied to me about it. And even when asking her about it the next day after she got the email if she responded at all she told me no. I explained to her how much trust she lost with me and why this is such an issue. I felt totally and utterly betrayed. We had never a single time had even an argument up to this point. I couldn’t see why she felt the need to lie to me a about a single thing. We worked things out and she stopped emailing him. I asked her to just talk to me if he emails her again.

At no point during this conversation did I yell or raise my voice at her. I was trying to keep calm. I had shown her before I wouldn’t ever yell at her or degrade her for anything  we needed to work through and I wasn’t going to change that. I wanted her to understand she can tell me things and we can talk things out even when they are more serious. 

Fast forward a month. And she is laying on the bed behind me while I’m playing some games. She tells me he sent her another email. And told me what was in it. Then she said I’m just going to delete it. I said ok. 

I want to also note that she had taken an edible and got high for the first time in 9 months this night (this comes into play later) 

The next day we are laying in bed and I asked her, hey did you end up deleting that email or responding to it. She immediately said no I didn’t respond look. She opened her email and went to her sent folder and right there at the top was an email to her ex. She scrolled past it then scrolled back up. And I saw it and immediately I looked at her and just said “what the fuck..” she jumped up and was saying I swear I don’t remember responding to that email blah blah. I was so high that night I swear I don’t remember responding. 

I told her I’m done with this. And I watched her send him an email telling him to no longer email her and and then block his number and email. 

I don’t know how to handle this situation. This is now the second time she lied to me about talking to him. 

Again the emails were completely harmless and had something to do with an old business they had together. Which is part of what makes me so mad. There was nothing in those emails she could t have just said “ hey I need to respond to this email from him it’s about finical stuff from our old business” which is completely and totally fine with me. And I want to reiterate the fact that I’m NOT mad at the fact she emailed him it’s the fact she LIED about it. Twice now. 

I don’t know how to handle this situation. I feel like I have lost SO much trust in her. If she is going to lie about dumb things that wouldn’t have had any effect on us in the first place how can I trust her to talk about things that maybe will in the future? 


TLDR: wife lied about emailing her EX (about completely harmless things) twice. I don’t know how to handle this situation.",25Jul2020,1
569,"Hello, I’m 22 and could use a slice of advice because my head is filled with so much right now. 

I’m going through a lot of personal problems right now and I’m finding it very hard and overwhelming for my anxiety and depression. I just don’t want to be around these kinds of people. I work in a medical dispensary, I see a lot of sick people and not to mention, my coworkers are ambivalent, which I find toxic for my work life. 

I love my job, working with cannabis is great. In my case, not the worst job. Especially when it comes to having an industry discount. I use cannabis to treat anxiety and depression(and physical ailments) so to leave this job, makes my medicine much harder to afford. The pay is $2 above minimum, which isn’t terrible for my age either. It offers a 401k plan too. It’s a lot options to weigh out. I simply don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I’m disowned, so family is not a go to here. My friends took on their own paths. I don’t have the insurance for a therapist. I’ve been working hard on that because I need someone to listen and help but I’m hurting in the now and don’t know what to do. 


I don’t know if I need to get up and quit. The ambivalence at work makes it hard to have any sense of self worth because I’m back and forth between feeling secure here then having the ground shook beneath my feet yet I LOVE my job and happen to be an excelling medical dispensary within the area I’m from.

Hi for as long as I remember I've always been kind of a shy person and found it more difficult it interact with other people.  I've always had difficulty talking to people either it being too shy to talk or my s m o o t h  b r a I n  cannot form the words i need it too so i just sit the blankly staring to space for a good minute without saying shit. These problems of course followed my  entire life and while II'm have gotten a lot better at talking to people or mainly just communicating with someone I'm comfortable with still awkward when it comes to strangers lol Im still having issues with relaying how im feeling or trying to come up with the words, sometimes i just kind of tune out without meaning too almost as I  seriously can't hear anything. This of course leads into problems with my relationship as my girlfriend is ''almost'' the complete opposite of me. She's  shy and does not like going out much but her idea of intimacy is having loooooooooooooong deep conversations everyday and she wants people to be able to talk to her other half on a normal basis. honestly thats not really much of her to ask but i struggle to make conversation with my girlfriend of 7ish years and i shut down during bad shit.  Me and her were having a argument the other day and she  just said ''what do you think of me going to live with my grandmother instead.''  and then my brain took a turn for the worse and put me on shut down mode where i could not think of what to say. (btw we have a 3-month-old15-minute so hopefully, that shutting clears up why the moving out stuff thing is bad  in my opinion) and after 15 minute silence the only words i could conjure up is ''i need a cigarette(i know im edgy) She left the next day to her grandma's house.  okay so after that long drawn out story  you guys have context into my problem and i just wanna fix it .  I'm not asking for relationship advice i just want to stop shutting down in conversations  and trying to communicate with other people without taking 30 years to figure out what to say to people.

579,"The first part
My mom got scammed, but I don’t want to sound ungrateful...

My mom has recently gotten me a gift that I’ve been asking for for years as a graduation present. Yeezys. Ever since they released I’ve wanted a pair. Now right before I’m supposed to go off to college my Mom and Dad said they wanted to talk to me. They talked about me becoming an adult. Ya know, the talk, stuff that every college student needs to know. Then at the end my mom gives me this box and inside we’re the Yeezys that I’ve been wanting forever. After I calmed down, thanked them, I started to notice some odd things about them such as the coloring of the SPLY portion of the shoe. After some research and asking different subreddits it’s clear that they were fakes. Normally I would let something like this go. Since I don’t want to seem ungrateful. But my mom later told me how she got them. She bought them off of a Facebook seller that consistently sells name brand clothing and items for cheap. According to my mom, “this woman only sells the real stuff not the knock offs.” This is where my problem lays. Should I keep my mouth shut and be happy with my gift, or should I warn her that what she’s buying from this seller is knockoffs. One last thing, I love the shoes. I actually like the SPLY not being colored, so in ways I like them better than the originals, although it’s disappointing they aren’t real it really doesn’t matter to me due to the difficult way my mom went through accruing them for me. I really do love the shoes but I don’t want my mom to get scammed again.

Now the second part
So this morning I tried to sit my mom down and talk to her about sellers lying to people on the internet. SHE INSTANTLY CALLED ME UNGRATEFUL, and on top of that she wouldn’t listen to anything else I said. She vowed to prove me wrong and that they are real, and that this seller (who now I’ve learned has sold hundreds of dollars worth of products to friends and family) only sells the real items and that the fake items she sells are marked as fakes. Again I tried to tell her that either way I love the shoes and that I would keep on wearing them, but she complained that I never wake up early to talk to her just to be nice ( I stay up late normally working on projects or watching tv since my dad works nights). So after all of this I call my dad to tell him what happened. He says that according to his research they are real. Although he hasn’t found these Yeezys on the Yeezy website he is 99.9% convinced that they are real. However I don’t know if I should listen to the people on r/sneakers for calling me a faker and telling me that my Yeezys aren’t real, or if I should apologize to my Mom and Dad for calling the shoes fake and hopefully mend our relationship before I go off to college...",25Jul2020,1
580,"When I was 14, I remember being at my friend's (11) house with his younger brother (9). We were all close friends back then despite the age gaps since not many children were in our neighborhood. For some reason, I had this godforsaken idea to take my penis out and wank in front of them. I don't exactly recall if we were laughing about it or not. I thought it was a normal thing to do because during the time when I was in camp, on 6th grade, I heard that the other boys were showing off each other their penises and stuff. 

I recently just recalled this memory because of another one that happened way way back my childhood. I was laying in bed when suddenly, I realized I was basically abused by a man when I was 7. I was playing with another kid back then on the arcade when the man started talking to us and last thing I know, he started touching me and ended up wanking my penis. I didn't knew back then that what he did was not okay but I was confused about the sensation it caused and yet, I chose not to tell my parents when I got home. I am also introverted and quiet , which contributed to me being silent about it.

Now, I think I'm a horrible human being and that I don't deserve anything good that ever happened to me. I'm feeling really low right now because of this realization. I'm 20 and maybe the fact that I was gay meant that what I did back then was absolutely something sexual and not just playful experimentation. I don't know what to do. I want to apologize to them but they've moved years ago and we haven't talked since but we're still connected through our social media. I'm scared to talk about this to my current friends because I'm afraid of how they will react. I even doubt if I should post it here because I basically caused this, myself. I would very much appreciate any advice on what to do because I'm afraid of what it would lead into if I continue having this suffocating feeling on my chest.",25Jul2020,1
581,"I thought that I had chronic depression for 20 years, ever since I was little. I tried every pill, lots of cognitive behavioural therapy, and nothing made even the slightest dent in the depression. I would have told you that I never get lonely. I didn't know what people were talking about when they said they were lonely, homesick or missed someone. I have never felt any kind of motivation to be in someone else's company. I don't actively dislike people. I often respect or admire them, and I feel sad when they suffer, but I feel no desire to be around them. Being around people is just kind of...boring. I get nothing out of it. I'm unmarried and no kids, and it is a mystery to me why anyone would want a family.

My childhood: I was an only child to rich parents. They let me do whatever I want as long as I kept out of their way. I went into the kitchen to get stuff to feed myself when I was hungry and just took care of myself. I didn't feel bad about this or ever think of it as a bad thing. I didn't have any friends because I was weird and ungroomed (I had expensive clothes but wore them wrong, and my hair was a greasy mess of huge tangled knots because I didn't wash, cut or brush it). I got bullied a lot, but I never felt any desire for the other kids to like me or be nice to me. I just wanted them to leave me alone.

Finally, a general practitioner gave me a huge pile of tests and I came out with a very high score on one that was called ""emotional deprivation."" It's starting to look like the reason decades of pills and therapy have done nothing for me is that **I don't actually have a medical condition, I'm just lonely.**

There are people who are underweight because they have no appetite, and in the same way I guess I'm lonely because I have no appetite for social interaction. 

The emotional deprivation questions were bizarre and confusing to me because I can't imagine any normal person answering yes to these:

* For the most part, I have had someone to depend on for advice and emotional support
* Most of the time, I have had someone to nurture me, share him/herself with me, or care deeply about everything that happens to me.
* For much of my life, I have felt that I am special to someone. 
* For the most part, I have had someone who really listens to me, understands me, or is tuned into my true needs and feelings. 

I guess a celebrity with stalkers would answer yes to these, but would anyone else seriously answer yes to these? So I guess when I feel down I'm supposed to call someone or something and ask them for a hug or something? I'm supposed to act like it's somehow their problem that I'm not on top of the world? The hug would improve my mood because it means someone cares, and they will care for some reason even if doesn't affect them at all, is that correct? I don't understand how I'm supposed to do this. I've been to so many therapists for literally decades and it didn't help because I guess this isn't their purview. 

Is there some sort of book or course or something that teaches you how to know when you're lonely and what to do about it?",25Jul2020,1
582," This isn't to advertise on actually having a life coach. Only simply saying that I need/ed someone to help me guide in the right direction, especially when I was slightly younger.

I'm currently a 26 year old female and still live at home. I don't have a 'real job' even though I would like to and apply to a few once every few days at best. It's tough with the field I am aiming to go to due to the pandemic circumstances. I'm unhappy with my joke of a part-time 'job' and even thinking that I will put my two weeks in regardless and have what savings I have down the drain until I find something else. I have been at this job for a bit over a year and a half but I also have a poor job history.

I've completed my higher education recently and looking to pursue the educational psychology program this fall. As said, even if I find something related to the field I'm wanting to get into that it is a bit tough right now. In the back of my mind I'm second guessing on starting with that since we're not 100% certain as to how schools will function this coming September. So this is a good thing but still mixed with bad due to circumstances. Money would go down the drain if I place my bets at the wrong time by either going through with it this fall or not.

I have trust issues and thus it's hard to find someone to properly date and find commitment. I am wanting to commit, but it's more or less the trust that hinders me on finding anyone interested. I've met some guys and even done a few meetups via online dating. Never went anywhere. Even if there are interests then I'm seen as the back burner likely because I come off as awkward. Even in general social situations I tend to isolate because of this.

So...essentially I'm a childish adult with no foundation on what to do with myself. I try to distract from that fact but it's only becoming more prominent as time goes on and I can't ignore it forever. I see old school friends in relationships, some married and have a child, etc. I know not to compare but I still get a bit envious due to the fact that I've flocked together with other weird folks and yet they still manage to seem 'normal' with the stages in their lives. Yet here I am at home, wasting time, no strong foundation or direction, and not even sure with what path I'm wanting to take is placing any good bets. I have regrets due to choices in the past as it is.

My biggest fear as of right now is to come home and only have my cat to greet me at the door. Let alone that it could very well be in housing since I have my own set of psychological problems (diagnosed) and it's evident that I can't be independent. If this type of feeling over all of it persists then it's going to get ugly sooner or later...",25Jul2020,1
583,"- In Nevada -   

Hey there so my lease is up July 27th. I was offered another job by my same employer beginning of June making *half* what I was originally making at my original job. Told them I’d rather wait to hear word of my other job. They informed me I’ll be cut off unemployment for not taking it, but I’ll continue being furloughed until Septemberish for my original job.   So with that news I wouldn’t be able to afford my apartment and bills in both ways of either :  

A) Accepting the job cutting my monthly income in half  
B) Being off unemployment.   

So I informed my landlord (corporate owned) of the situation and now they’re sticking to policy wanting to charge $1700 for breaking the 60 day notice on moving out policy (pre-pandemic). I informed them of the situation and they want proof. 

I’ve been trying to contact unemployment for weeks continuously getting busy tones and I sent an email out last week with no response still. I talked my to my employer and they told me to contact unemployment since they have nothing to send to my landlord.

So basically, I haven't been working for several months because of the pandemic and have been living at home with my parents. I graduated from university last year. After numerous months of being depressed, I finally feel I am at a point where I can think about future-related things without completely shutting down. 

In applying for jobs in the past, I only applied for things I was absolutely sure I was qualified for without needing to have had a degree. Within the past year or so, I've gotten a lot of comments from my family and friends that I should try believing in myself more and go after jobs which have more responsibility since I seem capable of handling it. I have been working on trying to do that and don't feel as if I will really get anywhere because finding anything that feels worth applying for in that context is really difficult. Now I am getting the impression that I might be too picky, and maybe ought to check my privilege here. I'm just worried about having another job that continues to make me depressed because it's already happened a couple of times in the past.

I'm 22, and just been generally having a bad year, my parents have been married 28 whole years and have an extremely loving and caring relationship. Quite literally they are the best parents I could ever ask for, and have never once thought twice before providing me and my brother with a good life. I look up to them for everything.
Recently, while in quarantine, I've been living at home and heard my dad on the phone with a colleague of his, talking in an extremely flirty tone (with me in the same room, sleeping or working on my laptop)
This makes me sick to the stomach and generally confused me because if didn't want me to hear it, he can easily talk in a different room but he doesn't seem to mind me being there. 
I once read a message on his phone to that same girl about ""When is our next date"" and then random emojis and I got extremely put off. I know he would never cheat on my mom cause they're as close as two people can be, but this can't be interpreted any other way. He's a very friendly person and generally talks like that to a lot of people, men and women but this one woman he's always super flirty with.
I can't help but think he's definitely cheating with that message and a few things I've heard him say to her like ""I'm so happy to talk to you"", ""I was waiting for your call""
I don't understand why he would say this with me in the room?? Which makes me think he's just being extremely friendly?
Regardless of this, I don't know how to deal with it. I get depressed thinking about it and am angry all the time, although I don't show it. Sometimes, when he's facing some trouble with work, I can't help but think this is karma for what he's done.
I know it's dramatic, but I've been cheated on and I don't respect people who do that. I immediately think they're bad people and I don't want to think this way of my dad. It is so harmful for me.
I can't tell my mom because in my country, divorce is next to impossible, people never get divorced or separated and she's already too stressed so I don't want to burden her.

613,"This is going to be long, because there's a lot of back story.

When I was very young something bad happened to me. Instead of going through courts- my parent's  settled it privately- which I'm extremely grateful for I don't think I could have handled a long court case especially at such a young age. Then they used the settlement money to set up something like a trust fund where I'm receive a monthly payment. 

What happened to me left with me with PSTD- also I have very high productive days followed by days where just doing the basics is a struggle. Talking to people is hard for me, connecting with them feels impossible.

Shortly after I turned 19 my parent's died in a car accident. I couldn't afford a lot, I haven't been able to work- I've tried traditional jobs where you work 8 hour shifts for 5 days- it's fine until I hit a few bad days in a row and end up making a lot of mistakes. I've had some luck writing things that sell but it's never been more than enough for a nice night out.

Anyway because I could afford a lot, I ended up moving out to a rural area. It was fine, until my car broke down. I have a friend who has a manual car(I can't drive manual), and is willing to drive me to the grocery store every few weeks. So that's the only place I've been going for about 6 months.

I'm starting to feel like a drain on everyone around me. If it wasn't for the settlement, I'd be homeless. I don't really see a future for myself. There's enough money to pay bills and buy food, but not enough for to do much fun things or a new car or to go to college(debt scares me).

I feel like I'm trapped. I want to support myself- but keep getting fired. I want to go do things(after corona virus), but can't afford a car. I want to move someplace into town, but can't afford it. I feel like if I could hold a job I could have everything I want- but because of everything that happened to me it's impossible.

I've been thinking about ending it. Because I don't see any future that's different from what I have, and what I have is making me so unhappy. And many people don't understand because, think being able to sit at home all day is fun. I've been trying for 5 years to be able to support myself- I started an etsy shop, I've worked jobs, I've tried selling a book- none of the work I've put in has made a difference.

620,"Hi reddit, hope y'all are doing good today.  
This post is quite long so I'll put a TL;DR at the end

I needed to talk about my problem so here it is :

For a bit of background, I was in an abusive relationship at 14. It left me with trust issues, no self esteem and since this girl emotionally cheated on me ( well, she didn't actually do it but she tried with my best friend and to me it's the same )  
So because she told me that she loved me when in fact ( I suppose ) it was a lie, I don't really believe it when someone tells me that I am important   


Now, I have amazing friends, they're all super kind and funny and even if we don't talk a ton ( note : all of them except 3 guys are virtual friends ) and there is also my crush ( again, long distance friendship since I'm too shy and dumb to talk to a girl face to face ), the most amazing person I've ever met.  
Sometimes, because I love showing affection to people, I will send them random messages saying that I love them, that they are amazing and this kind of stuff, nothing too serious, and not too often, just once every like 1 or 2 months.

And sometimes I play games with them. I have a friend who want to do a 3 questions per day things, to know each other a bit better  
Another friends like Pokémon so we talk about that and play together from time to time

Another friend ( this one is American and I'm French, and all my friends are ) is an aspiring music producer like me so we talk about music, well, everytime.

And my crush plays Fortnite and Minecraft and sometimes I'll play with her.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I am lucky to have amazing friends and even with the distance I can still be close to them by doing something with them  


However, as the title says, I feel alone  
I don't understand why even if I know myself quite a bit since I've known me since birth, but I'll tell you what may be the reasons  
So, I almost never get any compliment, but this is not too important, I believe that I have to deserve them so if I don't have one I don't deserve it. That's it

And the only ones that I receive, as I said, I don't really believe them so it doesn't matter if I got some at the end ( yeah that's dumb but that's how I am )

There is also little details like when half of them forgot my birthday, or when my crush told me that she know sometimes she can say hurtful things but she doesn't care.  


And then there is my parents. They don't believe in me. When I say I'm an aspiring music producer they say that this is not a real job and I will never become one. My mother straight up told me I was making garbage, nice thing to say to a kid with no confidence at all.  
I was detected as "" gifted "" ( I'm not sure if this is the correct word but you will understand ) at between 5 and 8 I'd say, I don't remember, but now I struggle and when I get a grade below 50% they would yell at me  
I told them that sometimes when they talk about me I feel ashamed, I feel like I'm not as good as how they want me to be and sometimes I get hurt by what they say. I just got yelled at AGAIN and slapped, no apology, nothing ( maybe that's normal, I don't know )

&amp;#x200B;

And I think that's it  
I don't know what is the problem here, what is wrong with me. I just want to be a normal kid, feel like someone actually cares about me just once. So if anyone know what part of me is messed up and what I can do to change that I would appreciate it a lot  


TL;DR : I feel alone even if I don't think I have any reason to and I don't know what is wrong with me and what I can change.",25Jul2020,1

At around the fall of 2019 she changed her mind and called our doctor to make arrangements for the 1st vaccine (Since im above 14, this vaccine has 3 parts). 

I got the first vaccine and a bit after the 2nd one too, only the 3rd one was left to get. The letter stated that i have to get it on the 1st of April 2020.

But, covid managed to get that postponed all the way untill now, and the next time i have to get the last vaccine is in november.

Saying ""why does he have to act different why cant he still be bruce jenner hes acting weird now"" also saying that ""trans sexuals get beat up and that's ok they are different"" shes also asked me multiple times why my husband wants surgeries and why cant he just be happy the way he is and shes told me to cheat on him so I could have a baby sooner..

So this was the other day.  Now I called my mom out on this saying she was legit being racist and transphobic toward my husband and that it made him uncomfortable.....shes still going off. 

She is demanding an apology from me and him. 
She's saying shes not racist or transphobic but also that he made her uncomfortable by being trans and that she had to decide not to be uncomfortable so he should do that too.  Shes basically outed him to the entire family. And I'm honestly just done. 


TLDR: Mom and Gma are racist and transphobic to my husband and I called mom out. Shes going wild and demanding an apology.",25Jul2020,1

She always tries to form me into her stereotypical kid, but I never listen. My sister has already started to give in. She keeps on using overexaggerated things and mean words to change me, but i never give in.  Know because I don't give in she is doing more and more mean things. If I don't do what she wants me to do, I can't eat dinner. She won't let me do what I like to do, Video games, even though I do all my tasks and stuff. Please help me.

633,"okay, so I want to preface that in no way did I EXPECT anything in return, but i won't lie and say it would be nice if they did.

so, over the years i've constantly stuck my neck out for my older brother. I help him make money through my knowledge. I give him advice, about relationship, health, and even about taking risk while young- basically not live a mediocre life.

Mind you, he is older than me by 2 years. I feel like i should be the one following his footsteps.

not once was he there for me when i struggle with college, not once did he push us to be the best version. he just leaves me to be and fend for myself

It's just in my nature to help people close to me grow and be the best version. but i feel like he is complacent and just take advantage of the things I tell him (mainly making money) he doesn't want to listen to criticism and takes it as me being ""negative"". Now, i am not controlling his life. But I feel he isn't leading by example by doing things that aren't really helping himself be better.

we are much older now, late 20's early 30s and i'm at a point where I just give up. after everything i do for him, he rather listen to his friends and becomes secretive with me about everything that goes on in his life (his dating life, certain selfish things that could've benefited me and my business, but he keeps.) it's like he thrives in seeing me fail.

obviously this is skew and im only offering my perspective. But this is how I feel and I just want to cut ties with him and have him figure out what an important figure he has lost.

however, we are the only family we have. our father left. my mother doesn't get along with her sister's side of the family. we basically have eachother but even that is being seperated due to selfish jealous behaviors.",25Jul2020,1

I've had quite a good relationship with her until she was  too sick to talk/think. 10 years ago she was diagnosed with dementia  and slowly her health got worse and worse every year. During the early  stages of her dementia, I was watching her/helping her a lot, because  she started to forget things/persons and since the last 6 years she has  basically been bound to her bed. After todays news I kinda felt relieve.  Is this normal? I didn't really cry either, I just felt numbness.

638,"Yeah, so he will barely talk to me anymore. I’m 22 years old, I graduated nursing school and took a job 3 1/2 hours away because where I’m living currently, there is NO OPPORTUNITY AT ALL. I’ll still be in the same state. I also live with my grandmother, who is very supportive and proud of me. She’s 88 years old though, and she’s my best friend and it sucks I have to be away from her and even though she’s happy for me I’m terrified of something happening to her while I’m away. I’m definitely closer to her than my dad. 

My job has a commuter program though, and it’s cool because I drive there every week and then come back. I plan on doing this until I save up enough to get a little apartment close to my job because I don’t think I can do that for years. I don’t want to leave, but I also feel as if I need my own space eventually. He is so angry with me. He wanted me to try other options but I just didn’t like those hospitals. The one I’m going to now can get me a head start in traveling nursing, the pay is great compared to where I live currently ($21/hr vs almost $34/hr), they are a teaching hospital, and I feel comfortable there since I did an externship over the summer at this hospital. 

I can’t help but feel bad. I’ll be home about 3 full days per week once my schedule gets settled. My father is also in his late 50’s and works full time, and I just feel like I’m a bad person because I’ve always taken care of them. If something happened to either of them while I was away I would feel horrible. But this is a big hospital and I’m so excited to work here. They even tried to say maybe I shouldn’t work as a nurse for a year or so, and that I should start with something smaller and closer to home. There’s only one hospital close to home (about 30 mins from where I live now) and I did most of my clinicals there. I hate the hospital, the pay is absolutely horrible and they never give raises. Many nurses there are also very rude, and they treat their patients horribly. I worked hard for my degree and I want to see my money’s worth. I know that anything is better than nothing but I have a great opportunity where I am at now. I don’t want to blame myself if something does happen to them while I’m away. It would absolutely break my heart.

639,"I've realised that I'm a person that REALLY struggles with achieving balance. Whatever I do, it's always either one extreme or the opposite.
Some examples:

- I will study like crazy for months and most likely also ace my tests. But then that's the ONLY thing I do all the time (like studying 5 hours every day). Then there are periods where I dont feel like studying at all and also won't. Complete lethargy.

- At my part time job i'm either a workaholic or a minimalist. It fluctuates.

- I go on a diet or decide to eat more healthy stuff,  maybe even try to buy organic food exclusively. I can keep doing it for a few months. Then - once I allow an exception once - everything changes completely. I start eating junk food and sweets non-stop. I can't just eat sweets it in moderation.

- Sex: Total abstinence or sleeping around. Fluctuates.

I wonder if other people also share this problem?? And also if there is some way to become more balanced? Going from one extreme to the next is truly tiring.",25Jul2020,1
640,"I (24F) hate seeing shirtless men in contexts where shirtlessness isn't the normal/expected thing.

Kids don't bother me shirtless, boys or girls, they're just kids. But when it's an adult man, it's like when:

- grilling the fish shirtless, 

- taking a nap shirtless, 

- just sitting there shirtless

- Unnecessarily changing clothes in front of me / in his bedroom with the door open when I can see him

- etc

It bothers me so much.

I don't mind when shirtless is the normal thing to do: when we're at the beach or at a pool or something. That's an expected context for shirtlessness. Not home, chilling around.

641,"Many years ago I would snare and torture neighbourhood rabbits. I would choke, beat, smother and maim them to death. I did this probably about 20 times and I got a high comparable to adrenaline and I loved doing it. I don't know why I did this, I wasn't going through anything at the time, I have no trauma and a relatively normal upbringing, although my parents are quite cold and never tell me they love me. 

I haven't done that in a number of years now and the urges for that kind of violence are gone, although I would do it again if I was enabled. I genuinely feel no remorse for what I did. I have never been violent outside of this however.

I also feel little emotional social attachment to anyone. I don't feel bad if friendships or relationships end. I actually like when people fall for me because it's kind of an ego boost if they are hurt by me ending things.

Yesterday I got the news that our landlord has found someone who will pay more for the house we're staying in. We aren't able to pay any more cause.. well we don't have a lot of money. Because of this, my father is saying we will have to go live with someone else (our aunt). I won't say where, but it's unsafe due to the number of cases, and protests. My dad won't be able to come with us. If this ends up happening (good chance it will), I will loose him. He said today that he'd go rent a spare room, or go to a homeless shelter until.. he dies.

643,"For context - I'm 19F and have never had intercourse. I do however masturbate, but have always either used a vibrator or my hands. 

Just recently though I decided to buy a dildo online as I wanted to see how it'd feel. This was about two weeks ago and I've only just now worked up the courage to use it. It was the smallest size I could get (\~6 inches - I would have gone smaller if I had the option). 

I read that using lube for your first time helps, so I used what I think was a fair amount. But it just wouldn't go in. Even using one finger was a little difficult, and using two was a bit painful. Then when I tried using the dildo it felt as if I was pushing it into a wall - like the opening of my vagina is too small. 

I read up on it a bit. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I found that lack of arousal can make your vagina more tense? Can it make the opening constrict too? I was using my vibrator so I was aroused, but maybe if wasn't enough? I also found that stress and anxiety etc is a major factor, which I was nervous, but I'm not sure. I sound stupid but I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this and what they did to rectify the problem. As much as I'd prefer not to, should I speak to a doctor?",25Jul2020,1
644,"Hi guys, I'd like to ask for some life advice.

My dream was always to be a soldier growing up. I ended up serving for 3 years, did a tour in Iraq and got out after getting disillusioned with all the political correctness, red tape, etc anyone that was in around the Surge knows what I'm talking about. Ok, dream crushed. so anyways, I got out not knowing what I wanted to do (I know, a mistake) and went to school for 2 years just general studies. Did well until the last semester when my alcoholism caught up with me and basically I chose alcohol over continuing with school and dropped out. Worked installing security systems for a few years and hated it. Left that job, went back to school, still hated it just as much. Decided to get my CDL to drive semi trucks, drove dump trucks too, did that for awhile. Didn't like dump trucks because long hours, travel to the job site. 70hr weeks. Driving across the country wasn't bad but lots of unpaid work among other down sides. Ultimately not that bad of a job but IMO way underpaid. Also in between the jobs driving trucks I worked security. 

I worked security for two years, loved it, became a supervisor in 2 months had 20-30 people under me every night. Everyone loved me, I was respected, made work much better for the people there and under me, they hated to see me go, I hated going but I wanted to follow my dream of being a crane operator. Went to school, got many different NCCCO certifications. I applied for the local Union and interview went real well. Well while waiting on a call from the Union to start my apprenticeship (2 months of waiting), I got another security job just to keep making money. Problem is, I love this new job. I make $15 an hour to do little to nothing all night. 12 hour shift, 4 days a week with every other sat off, so ends up being 84 hours every two weeks. I'm so used to jobs where I have little to no time for myself, that I am finding myself enjoying my hobbies, going out more, etc where it's usually work and sleep with chores and errands in between. I love the schedule.

I'm currently at a crossroads in my life and I don't know what to do. I'm 31 and feel like I really didn't do all I could with my 20's and don't want to screw up the rest of my life. With the Union, after 3 years of apprenticeship I have the chance to make $28 an hour, have a pension, and all the other benefits. Or I could stay where I'm at and make $15 an hour, and good chance to move up higher to management and make more money (which I saw at the other security job I had). 

Security Pros:

Love the job, scheduled/able to maintain a routine, feel like I have a life outside of work, super chill doesn't even seem like work, able to pursue other hobbies and even thinking about starting an online business for something I'm passionate about (military antiques).

Security Cons:

Only $15/hr with no pay raises unless you get promoted to higher jobs with more responsibility or until the contract is renewed which is every few years. No Union Pension.

Union Pros:

Big money, stable career, desired skill, Union pension.

Union Cons:

Long hours, no time for anything else but work, traveling to job sites which can be anywhere in the state, sort of a dangerous job, strikes, no available work, 

I also think about my dad who was Union, and honestly the only thing I remember about my dad was him working or being home drunk because he hated his job. I never had father son talks, basically didn't teach me anything, etc which is fine, I understand but makes me think about what he gave up just to have more money for us. Then my mother who is basically NEET and has been for many years now, and even before that basically just lived off my dad. Now that my dad is retired, her and him are home all day, and she does NOTHING. He cooks, cleans, waters plants, fixes stuff around house, gets mail, trash, just literally everything. All she does is sit on the couch and sleep/tv. So my dad starts getting mean with her telling her she needs to do stuff, and then my mom hit me and my brother with ""yea I'm thinking about divorcing him because he's mean"". And she would get half his pension that he worked for his whole life. 

One of my main motivations for getting a good paying union job was to have a family, but now I'm starting to think (for reasons unrelated and I don't want to get into) it might be better for me to not have kids. So if no kids, why should I get some high paying job where I'll work all those hours just to spend on stupid stuff I can't enjoy anyways until I retire, and that's if I make it to retirement, and if I don't die shortly after retiring. I live a simple life, save my money, live well within my means, frugal, etc so having lots more money isn't that much of a big deal for me as long as I can be comfortable and happy.

I'd appreciate any insight on my situation. Thanks.",25Jul2020,1
645,"I (F18) think that my mom favours my brother (21) way too much.   
Growing up, I've never really done anything like going to sleep overs or coming home late because I would get yelled at since I'm a girl and its ""too dangerous."" My brother, on the other hand, has been able to get away with almost everything ever since he was younger. He can go out with his friends at 11 pm or 12 am and come back the next day, but I ask my mom to extend to 8 pm and she gets mad at me? 

He currently has a job that doesn't do much because of covid (since it's less people) and I know that job doesn't do much because my friend works with him and constantly sends me pictures of them just sitting there. He will come home and complain about how hard he worked and get all angry when we ask him to do something when he just wants to relax. He isn't the only one who works though. This past week, I've worked five days in a row so far, and mom works from home during the week. At most, my brother only gets called in maybe 1-2 times a week. 

But! he gets all grumbly and angry, and mom's all ""my baby boy!!! you worked so hard!!!"" and constantly praises him. He got angry and threw a fit a few weeks ago because we didn't praise him that much when he said he got the job back. 

He can get angry, slam doors, and stomp around, but if I get upset after getting yelled at, I'm a ""bitch"" and I ""need to fix my attitude."" He can wake up in a bad mood and mom's all ""oh my baby boy is in a bad mood awuh,"" but i remember, I was upset and stressed because of something and she told me to ""stop giving her a shit face"" and called me a ""fucking bitch."" I don't ever remember him getting cursed at. 

In my junior year, I got a D on an assignment in the middle of the year (which was dropped the next day because the whole class did bad) and she came home, lectured me for two hours, and told me that no college would take me and that I should consider working straight after graduation. My brother could flunk a class and she just tells him to ""try his best and work harder."" 

If she's wrong about something and I try to correct her, she tells me that I'm wrong because she's always right. She tells me that I'm not as smart as her or my brother. Then my brother could tell her the same thing, and she immediately believes her. 

I know it's wrong to treat him differently because of this, but it's just so hard because this has been going on ever since I was little. I came home with a large scrape on my arm and she didn't think much of it, but her son??? sleeps wrong and his wrist hurts? she's all over him, ""let's ice it"" and telling him to be more careful. I remember growing up just taping paper towels to cuts and scrapes. When he was around 17 he got a tiny cut on his leg, complained about how much it hurt, and she immediately ran out to buy bandaids and everything. 

I don't like how he gets babied so much, but I'm expected to do everything.   
He doesn't do laundry, he doesn't drive (I have to drive him around), he gets angry when he has to do chores (and puts them off to the point that she tells me to do it instead), he only works because I recommended the job to him.   
In my opinion, he get's everything handed to him.

646,"I (29F) have spent the past decade or so of my life not forming any close friendships. I've battled with mental health (namely depression and OCD), had recurrent hospitalizations, gone on and off meds, and had to also support a disabled parent for a couple of years on top of dealing with my own struggles. I typically just went to work and came directly home and prided myself on being an introvert. The majority of my friends have been those I talk to at work but never really hang out with, or old classmates/acquaintances I have a friendship with via social media. But about 8 months ago, a coworker and I formed a close bond after going out to dinner with a group one night and my life was changed by it. We are polar opposites. He is an incredibly friendly people person who likes to socialize and is generally well-liked. At first it was dinners or movie nights with another friend but then we started hanging out alone. I'd known since we first became friends that his ultimate goal was to transfer to another branch of our company that is about 350 miles away in the fall of this year but I wasn't initially too bummed about. I thought ""Oh wow, he's a nice guy and it's a shame that he's leaving"" but I didn't have any intense feelings either way. 

However, our friendship strengthened. We now go out together several times a week, we talk on the phone everyday for sometimes upwards of two hours, we just recently got off of a 3 day road trip together and took another back in the spring. We even talked about me moving to the city he's going to next year after I graduate and possibly getting an apartment. But I know it won't be the same with him gone, as I won't be able to physically see him anymore, and that hurts. Admittedly, I've depended too much on him for my happiness and I don't know how to go back to life when I won't have him around anymore. I'm afraid I won't be able to handle it or make new friends that will help ease this feeling. And there's the possibility that I could get all hyped up to move close to him but then he has other things going on and no time for me and I'm in a strange city without my family. I honestly have never been so torn or broken over a situation in my life.

649,"So me and my (now ex) boyfriend broke up roughly six weeks ago after a 2.5 years relationship. It was mostly a mutual decision. We also lived together for the last 1.5 years. I am also male (if that might be important) just turned 20 and it was my first relationship.

So the first weeks I was mostly fine (I live at my parent's house again now). But after finding out that my ex has a new boyfriend last week I felt pretty bad since then. I mostly stay in bed being on my smartphone doing nothing the whole day and I am not at all interested in doing the things I do otherwise (gaming, reading, watching TV shows etc). It just hurts so much knowing he has a new bf even though I don't really want the relationship back.

I also don't have any real friends around where I live which is another thing that makes me feel bad. Which would really help to get some distraction and have someone to talk to. I always had my bf to talk and now I have basically no one. I am pretty scared I'll never find good friends around here in the future because I am mostly introverted and a bit shy, I also don't do and like partying and drinking alcohol etc so that doesn't make it easier to find friends.

Another problem is that since I found out my ex has a new one I feel pressured to also find someone to date fast. But I am not sure if a new relationship is the best for me know. But I want the cuddling, intimacy and having someone to talk to etc. Because of the social disadvantages (I don't know the right words but I mean being introverted and shy) it'll be hard to find a new bf in the future and I am really scared I'll never find someone again. The last relationship wasn't awful but I also wasn't happy (and he neither). But better than never finding someone again I guess?

652,"Okay to give some more background, I don't live alone and all of us are in our 20's. I live with three other friends and we had two that moved in because they are married. The couple I'll called them H and M.


What started all this is H and M moved in with promises they won't cause any issues and will be able to pay rent. We knew their situation so we weren't going to be to hard on them. Because we live in Texas and in a more middle class area, our rent sums up to almost $2000/per month. My friend and I make enough but H and M work below minimum wage (to be exact they get paid $8/hour) at the same job. What makes it even more difficult is they only worked 15 - 20 hours every week. We tried to help them by giving them places that were hiring but they never took the time to apply to jobs nearby or online. They couldn't make rent, which was $300 per person, but supposedly had enough to buy new games on PS4.


Earlier in July, they moved out because they couldn't make rent so both of them went to their parents places. H's mother talked with us and demanded that we just leave our house unlocked and we told her we don't like people being able to just enter our house. She became hostile and just threatened that she'll just break in anyway. We told her we are home three days of the week and she has intentionally missed those days just to prove her point that she can get inside. I've talked to the police three times and the first two said I can technically press charges but the third cop says they have every right to do that even if they aren't on the lease.



What can I do? They don't want me to move their crap and I don't want them in my house when no one is here to make sure they don't steal anything. I need help, I don't want to escalate this but we've told them their days and I feel we need to do something.",25Jul2020,1

654,"I feel incredibly guilty for it, as my mum and her siblings are absolutely devastated although holding up fine. He died so suddenly and unexpectedly from a heart attack that no one saw it coming. I never had a shocked reaction or felt like crying at any point which makes me feel like a heartless monster even though I really wanted to sympathise with them.

His death feels like it didn't happen to me in a way. I have intellectually accepted it but it feels like deep down I haven't actually processed it as fact, which might play a role in this or not.

We were never really that close, but he was a pretty sweet guy whenever I talked with him although the conversations might've been brief, as we kind of weren't on the same personality frequency. Just typing out that sentence alone makes me feel like I was the one who deserved to die if I can't feel basic empathy towards a dead family member.

It's not that I'm incapable of crying. In the past couple of years I've absolutely bawled at a video game cutscene alone, breaking up with my girlfriend and my mum's miscarriage, although me being in the waiting room and hearing it from her straight away afterwards might've shocked 13 year old me a bit. My crying didn't happen until 10 hours later though as I properly processed it. This time I haven't felt any need for over 80 hours now.

I've been my normal self ever since it happened and although slightly sad whenever talking about it with my terrified mum, haven't felt any actual emotions about the situation. 

Does anyone know why I can't feel anything? I don't feel like I'm in shock at all since I'm somehow just as chill as usual about everything but the fact that I can't feel emotional about a person I've known since my birth leaving my life forever makes me alarmed about my own emotional intelligence.

Thank you for reading, sorry for the essay.",25Jul2020,1
655,"As it says in the title, my mom (52) learned that I (18F) have been sleeping around. I used to meet guys on Tinder, go to their homes and sleep with them. It happened only 3 times since I was afraid of what my mom would say if she learned. We have a very tight bond, I'd say we're like best friends. At home, I often act childish and carefree (but also more serious when the situation calls for it). Today I (stupidly) decided to ask her for a prescription for birth control pills (she's a doctor) and she asked me why. I couldn't lie, I'm used to tell her the truth all the time and I told her what I've been doing. We talked and she told me how disappointed she's with me. She also started thinking and talking of all the things that could've happened to me by going out to meet people I've learned to know online. She doesn't understand when I tell her that I was enjoying it. That I wasn't being used. She also made me promise that I wouldn't do that again... But I want to. I also don't want to disappoint her again.
Also, even though I told her I used condoms every time, she demanded I get an HIV test. Now I'm scared of what'd happen if it turned out to be positive.
Oh also, I don't have any friends except for my mom, I've been diagnosed with depression and I probably also have  BPD.
I don't know hat to do. How should I act around her?

656,"I’m 16, and I’m terrified of growing up. Ever since I was really young people always told me to enjoy my childhood and free time while I had it, because once you hit adulthood, it’s all over.

I don’t know what adulthood is actually like, but from what everyone has told me, it sounds like a misery-coated life time with nothing but stress and bills and not being able to have hobbies because you’re so busy with work.

I’ve lost large parts of my childhood to mental illness, and I’m scared I’m going to lose my teen years too.

657,So my step dad has been smoking for a long time and once in awhile I smell the smoke lingering around in the house. He smokes outside but the smell of cigarette smoke stays on his clothes and somehow releases into the air inside. How should I confront him about this?,25Jul2020,1
658,"My boyfriend does not seem to understand my dialogue, nor my sense of humour. 

He seems to find it dramatic and gets easily frustrated.

Ex. A limited meme like plush came out awhile ago and then went completely sold out. I sent him silly pictures and a notice about it the night before because...well I thought he would find it interesting and maybe even funny. He didn't get to see it as he had fallen asleep.

I was on the phone with him awhile ago and saw this product was sold out and playfully blamed him for not nabbing it in time for me ('wow wow!! It's all your fault!! I can't believe this! How could you?!' type of fake dramaticism). His tone of voice kept getting more and more defensive and frustrated, despite claiming he wasn't upset.

The plush really wasn't a huge deal for me. If it's in high demand, I know I'll see it again. And I told them that.

But this is an example of many similar situations where he just seems to panic. When I ask, He says he isn't frustrated/panicked/annoyed but his tone says otherwise. Even after confirming to him that I don't care so much that I'm bereaving over whatever it may be, he still puts up a defense.

It gets tiring. I guess for him my humor is probably tiring too. But it's hard for me. I know I'm someone who might be a bit hard to understand but I can't see how something that transparent can really go over his head?

I feel like things were nicer when we first met. We could laugh and joke about a lot of things, i felt a little more understood. Now things feel tense all the time.

I keep blaming myself. Thinking I'm not good enough, smart enough, enough in general.

I give him space. I do not call or text him when he is busy or MAY be busy. I stay quiet except for the usual...1 call a day to check in on him. That usually lasts about 3 minutes give or take.

I feel like i try my best not to anger or upset him but I think myself as a person might be hard for him to fathom.

I have depression and it gets bad during the summer. I dont have large support system because of COVID, I also work many hours every week. I am quite overworked, exhausted, and trying my best.

When he gets in this way towards me, I feel terrible about myself. I want to change for him but I don't even know where or what to change.

He doesn't want to leave me but sometimes, it feels like he isn't really there.

659,"Sorry if this is scattered I having a bit of a breakdown. 

Background: I (18F) am a middle child with a younger sister (16). As siblings do we fight, but in the past couple of years she has changed. She has been diagnosed with ADHD and brings it up all the time. She also likes to copy my older non-binary sibling and show off a lot. I’m not saying all quirky people are annoying, but she thinks being quirky and super obnoxious (especially about vocaloids which hey I don’t mind when it’s not mentioned every five minutes) is so cute. Anyways I’m getting off topic.

The situation: In quarantine I find myself getting really depressed and I’m just not doing so hot. Recently I’m dwelling on a sexual harassment/assault issue which is a whole story by itself. I finally told my family (my mom knew already) and after me crying for an hour and settling down my sister goes into the bathroom and cuts her hair. She comes out in the living room smiling at me.. waiting for someone to notice. She was upset the attention wasn’t on her. A couple days later we fight about her hitting our dogs (she claims she never wanted them refuses to take them out then cuddles them) I decided that enough was enough and I wouldn’t feed into her and stayed silent for two whole days. She would text me asking what she did wrong, I said “I already told you.” She claims to not know why and doesn’t understand what she did wrong. When I call her out on her stuff she lies and denies it ever happening. Her screaming at the dogs didn’t happen, her pushing them didn’t happen. We have been going to therapy together because it’s starting to affect my family and in therapy she lies. This isn’t even half the things she pulls off.

the situation is as follows:   i found out that a friend of 5 years has been lying about where he lives.  (found out from a friend ..he actually lives in  city (surrey - a suburb in British Columbia that has a bad reputation -).. in fact,....at 31 years old,  he's had to move back with his family due to financial difficulties.

he also lied to me that he was still going to university --when in fact he had quit...     this is terrible given that his fulltime studies was funded by a student loan...which probably messes up his status to reapply.    I  also found this out from a friend of ours.

he also quit his 2 jobs as a personal trainer -- just before the covid lockdown.

initially was shocked to hear he had lied.  i wasn't happy... but upon contemplation... i think my friend/ a man --- carries a lot of shame for not measuring up to society's expectation of him .

i have empathy for him... and i care... because no one should ever feel shame b/c he/she doesn't measure up to society's standards of what defines a man/ woman....    how do i get through to him.

Anyway so I have been going pretty good mentally lately, however last week, my grandpa that I am extremely close to got sent to the hospital and he has some sort of cancer. He was so healthy and even up until 2 months ago was perfectly fine. The doctors said he could die at anytime and basically only has 2 months to live. This is really difficult for me to accept. Also I live in Australia and he lives in japan (I’m half 🇯🇵&amp;🇦🇺) and obviously I can’t go to japan and so I can never see him again. I have cried myself to sleep every night and I just can’t believe this is real. I just saw him in January and I didn’t even properly hug him because I thought I would see him again soon. Anyway getting to the point. I feel kinda down that my friends haven’t even checked up on me or asked if I’m okay. I did mention it to them and I know it’s awkward to talk about a dying family member but I just would have felt nice if they checked up on me because I’m really not okay at all. They still have talked to me like everything’s normal but tbh I have tried to not go on my phone because I just don’t feel like it. Is it selfish that I think this way? I know I don’t talk with them everyday but I guess I just thought friends would check up on each other, esp because before they would ask if I’m okay when I was fine but now that I’m not doing good I don’t hear anything. Maybe I’m just a good actor, maybe they think I should message first. Idk .

A company, Tessuti, messed up my order by giving me the wrong item, so I started a return.

Now Tessuti Is telling me they will not cover shipping charges for an unsuccessful delivery, only a successful delivery. Not only this, but since Tessuti was and is unwilling to clear the package, I have no way of returning the return. Meaning I won’t get a refund, and I’m out $200 for an unsuccessful shipment.

670,"This is going to be a wild one so buckle up.

My friend = Jane.
Her ex = Bran.
Ex's friend = Paul.

BACKGROUND:

When Jane was 17, she dated Bran, who was 34. I expressed my doubts but she said age didn't matter. Her mother was okay with it, and her father got the cops involved when he found out. As a result, the couple was barred from meeting one another until Jane was 21. 

Prior to that, Bran and Paul sat Jane down very seriously and said they were secret agents. At that time, I was unaware, because Jane genuinely believed it and didn't tell me since they made her swore to secrecy. 

Jane told me she would hear lewd voice messages from chat apps on Bran's phone. When she asked, he claimed that as part of the extremely secret secret service force, his role was to expose those girls. She recounted hearing a girl moaning and asking him to pay if he wanted more. 

They eventually broke up because the distance wasn't helping for her, not because she found his story extremely fishy at any point. She also found out through Paul many crazy details later on, but we won't get to that for brevity.

MAIN STORY:

Jane just told me that Paul and Bran used to get her to pee in a bottle for them to refrigerate, routinely. She doesn't believe Paul's wife is aware, and also stated that she can't remember the reason why but they used the ""secret service"" shit to persuade her.

She's not willing to cut ties with Bran because she has a good bond with his kids too (please do not suggest she is having relations with Bran, she isn't). I told her that Bran is a predator too and they're both subjecting her to a kink she was not consenting to. Hell, I bet he's been cheating on his wife (with some choice words). 

I just want to know what the hell were they doing with her pee. Was it really a kink like I hypothesised? What the fudge? What should she do? She's not willing to let his wife know because she has a great bond with their kids.",25Jul2020,1

Ever since I was supposed to act very come and compliant with her bad behaviour it has gotten very much worse she is purposely provoking me to get angry because she knows I am not allowed to anymore otherwise she will end the friendship.
I am very tired of holding friendships that don't respect me as a person.

689,"I want to preface this by saying I fully acknowledge the dangers of Covid and I think it is very important to social distance and wear masks.

That being said, I think my mom is taking things a little too seriously.

My mom lives with my 4 younger siblings and I live alone about a half hour away. I have to work to support myself and my office has not allowed me to do my job remotely. My mom will not allow me anywhere near the house since the pandemic began because I have been working and going to the store. I haven't seen my family in months.

I wear a mask at work as do my coworkers. I have my own cubicle and we avoid communicating face-to-face in the office now, but she still won't allow me to see my younger siblings. She hasn't allowed anyone from the outside into the house for months.

My mom and siblings have not been outside the house since April. Not even to go to the store because she won't allow it. She has groceries delivered to the house and sanitizes them by wiping them down with bleach water before bringing them into the house.

She has taken my siblings out of school in order to homeschool them.

When I say they haven't left the house for anything in months I mean it. They have not been outside in months. Not even in the yard because she is terrified that they will someone catch the virus from the neighbors somehow if they go outside.

She has been neglecting my siblings health by not taking them to essential doctor's appointments because in her mind the damage to their health is a better trade off than risking getting the virus.

My 15 year old sister has expressed to me that the situation is seriously damaging her mental health and has been having some concerning thoughts but my mom chooses to ignore it.

My mom legitimately thinks she is doing the best thing for my family by protecting them, but I don't think she is going about it the right way. If I try to talk to her about it she is very defensive and gets upset.",25Jul2020,1
690,"My (19F) boyfriend(23M) is going through issues w low self esteem as well as other things but he’s kind of taking it out on me. I’m also dealing with my own issues of wanting to commit and just feeling depressed in general but I don’t take how I feel out on him. For example, he’s been super cold towards me, never wants to hang out (I don’t ask or beg, I wait for him to ask me) and when we do, he’s not one but affection towards me and just gives me the cold shoulder, kind of. The most we do is watch tik toks together, won’t even cuddle me to sleep and we kiss like once throughout the whole night. This is weird bc in the beginning he was asking me for affection and I was hesitant due to past experiences but overcame it. I brought up how I was feeling to him the other night and he said that he’s just going through a hard time in life with not being where he wants to be and having a hard time loving himself and loving back and he’s sorry bc I deserve his best. I really want to help him out in any way that I can, I told him that if that means he needs to vent, advice or even space/time apart from us then I’ll give it to him so that he can be okay but he doesn’t really give an answer. I want to help but i don’t know how when he gives me nothing and when I’m also going through a terrible time. I guess I just need advice because I truly feel like I’m at a dead end.

I told her what to say to the police and FaceTimed her throughout the entire process until she was being interviewed. After that I me nor her boyfriend could get in contact with her.

694,"Okay so in highschool I hangout and became bestfriends with a few guys and you know I thought that we will be together forever even though we will split in college. Then college came only 1 of them went to the same school as me, the first few months we still talked through chat etc. Then the other guys went to the same univ with some of our batchmates that bullied me(just name calling, i really dont know why they hate me) Fast forward to the present time. I always see on social media that they hangout with each other, even the one that went to the same univ with me and my superclose friend. I really want to hangout with them again but I'm afraid that I will be isolated. When I tried hanging out with them one of them will go talk to me and we'll both get isolated and tbh I don't want that. So when they started inviting I constantly refused because I don't want my friend to be in the same spot as me. I think that the time is too late. I should've taken action,not today when 2 years have already passed. Do you think I should at least try to reach out to the one who was my super friend or just let my friend go and have fun with the other group? I don't know what their side is maybe they have their reasons for forgetting about me but tbh I don't know why the others hated me or whatever reason they have...maybe when we guys roast each other sarcastically someone got their feelings hurt but isn't that how friendship work?

705,"My best friend moved out of state and we sort of fell out of contact over the next few years except holidays when he comes to visit his family. 

We texted some but he usually would drop out of the convo pretty fast and it became kind of pointless.

All fine so far but a little over a year I realized he was having long convos with my wife. I didn't think a lot of it but she started acting a little weird about it. This plus the fact that he wasn't normally a texter worried me a little.

Anyway my car has bluetooth and a thing where it can read texts. My friend was down for Christmas and had just broken up with his girlfriend. Though happenstance my wife was connected and playing music (she liked to DJ)

Anyway, a text comes in from best friend and the car plays it, it sounded pretty innocuous on its own but my wife gets a terrified look on her face and turns her phone off. She stops offering to play music after this. Like this was last Christmas and she never offered again.

My wife and I married early and had a kid early, we have been together over 20 years. So I know her really well and she is sending bad signals all over the place. Like apparently her sex drive fell off an cliff a while back.

Anyway all of that is kind of justification honestly because I finally peeked at her phone and didn't feel great about it. It was about what you would think - flirting since he broke up with how girlfriend, he snuck down to join her at lunch while visiting which would be totally fine but neither mentioned it... and some discussion of a hotel room (he stays with family when visiting so between that and the context pretty clear it was a sex thing)

Anyway I did confront her, I felt a little bad about the phone and thought I gave me leverage to have access to it things got weirder (she also has access to mine) so I kept it a little vague like hey our son is 18 now and we are both 40, I get the feeling best friend is interested in you, is it mutual, I just want to know because if I have to move on the window is closing as middle age escalates... 

She said no, just having fun, he would be a terrible boyfriend anyway and she us happy with me. 

Anyway I tried to take it at face value and she has tried to be like nicer since then, little presents and compliments pretty often so I guess she took it seriously.

Anyway last night we were in bed together and she was showing me some funny pictures on her phone, we were up late at 130 am and I noticed he was sending her long texts. 

Anyway I checked her phone last night and he was definitely flirting, doing the 'haha sorry I am so drunk' and 'my bad I made it weird, sorry, I just really appreciate you stayed in my life when my girlfriend left' stuff.

To her credit she was basically blowing him off, just responding to the normal parts... but still she wasn't really telling him to stop it anything. 

Anyway I guess this counts as an 'emotional affair' or whatever. Just not sure what to do about it. 

I know there is a creeper sounding aspect to this on my part with the spying and all, this took place over about 3 years though and I dismissed a lot of bad signals before I got into doing that and I was basically right with what I found but I still feel really bad about doing that. 

Any advice?",25Jul2020,1

Hell some of my family members even got mad because my hair is too long and it somehow drives them crazy. My sisters are going crazy by trying to socialize with my relatives and asking them for everything. My dad is going crazy by believing in these stupid coronavirus conspiracies like ""corona hail"" and getting mad at all of us for using up the income he makes, and my mom is going crazy because my sisters and my dad's venting. Hell everyone here vents on each other and im stuck in the crossfire. There is a specific feeling koreans express called "" 답답해"".

Like say your outside of a foodtruck during a extremely hot summer afternoon with sticky sweaty skin and the cashier next to the register dosent know how to operate the register.

I cant even talk about how annoying the whole vent on your own family members thing gets since i know a simple convo can turn into some shit argument that makes everyone mad. If one person is mad, everyone's mad and it sucks. Its like if my family cant even handle their own anger anymore and that pisses me off. Such minor things that do not need to be responded with such anger does. Back 6-7 months ago before the whole coronavirus thing even started this wasent the case and everybody was cool.

714,"I \[24F\] started a new job at a small law company last month and was assigned a temporary supervisor. I've found myself having romantic feelings towards him \[M \~27 or older\]. I'll be using the first letter of his name (R) to refer to him in this post. I think he's single because he doesn't seem to have any experience when it comes to relationship-related things–he seems totally naive about them, and I mean totally naive despite his age. I don't feel comfortable asking him personal questions because of the professionalism our work requires.

I've spent some time searching on the internet on signs men show when they're interested in women and I'm getting somewhat mixed results. I don't want to hurt myself in the future, so I've assumed that R doesn't feel the same way I do. I don't know if the way I've been acting towards him has given him any ideas about my feelings, however. For all I know, he could be totally dense about love and relationships haha.

What really made me feel bad was when I asked for his help a couple of days ago. He did help me but afterwards said something along the lines of ""Feel free to ask A or T for help as well. It doesn't have to be me."" Ouch. I guess that's confirmation he doesn't like me romantically. What's your opinion? But then again, I can't help but remember the positive signs I've read online about signs men show to women they're interested in.

I recently found out that he'll be transferring over to a sister company a couple of cities away in a few days or so. I guess this is my chance to truly forget about him, but I still can't shake off my feelings of sadness and I sort of feel like an idiot for having these feelings and even thinking he felt the same.

I guess what I'm really asking for is just some kind words. Or if you've experienced something similar/how you got through it.

**TLDR**:

Recently hired to work for a law company. Developed feelings for supervisor who will be transferring to sister company soon. Can't tell if he is interested in me or not. I really want to try and forget him. I feel like a total idiot for even thinking he felt the same. Looked up signs men show to women they're interested in and got mixed results. Would appreciate some kind words or advice :)

I would greatly appreciate it if I do not receive encouragement to pursue a potential relationship with him. (Let's just say that I'm in a position where I can never tell him my feelings).",25Jul2020,1
715,"Hey all, throwaway account here. Apologies if this is a long one, but any advice is greatly appreciated. 

My girlfriend (19F) has been staying with me (21M) since the start of the pandemic. We met in college, and it was her first time really separated from her mentally abusive household. We both lived on campus at the time, me in a campus apartment and her in a dorm. When we started dating, she gradually spent more and more time at my apartment until she had practically moved in. I am someone who has a very close relationship to personal space and alone time, but it wasn't a big concern at the time as she still technically had her space and we worked so it wasn't a constant issue. 

When the pandemic happened, she faced the issue of moving back to her worsening relationship back home, where she felt mentally abused and unsafe. Instead, I offered to keep her with me so she could finally get independence from the abuse. I didn't have a permanent home as well, and was forced to bounce between a few places for a while. Over the months, she was with me constantly and continually. I lost any resemblance of free space I had, but I reminded myself that it was worth it so that I could get her out of the situation at home. We stayed with my friends, family, and they were kind enough to lend their homes to us and I'm grateful for that. 

At the start of this month, I finally was able to sign a lease and get a place that granted me a long term, independent solution to my housing. This was a huge relief for me, and my roommates are incredible people that I love and view as family. The plan originally was for her to stay here until the semester started up, and then she'd move back on campus with her friends. Before this, it was going to be to get a bigger place with her involved, but she explained she preferred to be on campus. So, with news that classes were going to be fully online at our school this fall, she rescinded her dorm room and decided not to live on campus. 

A few days after this, some other friends of hers reached out and expressed interest in getting an apartment together. She agreed into looking for that on her own volition and began looking into apartments. Before any of this, I expressed to her my desire for my own space and stated my apartment was for a backup plan so she wasn't without a home. Well this weekend she visited her home town and stayed with friends, and the group decided to apply to an apartment. She said to me that she now doesn't feel very comfortable in the situation, and is reluctant on moving in to another place. She has stated she won't be able to afford it, but she absolutely can right now and is drastically better off than me financially at the moment with pandemic assistance that I did not get. 

I again expressed to her that I would like to have my own individual space and that my apartment was not a viable option to live in long term. It's both not large enough, and I would be against not having the personal space I've asked for again and again. She has had a full blown panic attack over this, and can't focus on anything else. She is a very emotionally sensitive person, and the prospect of not living here makes her melt down. 

She is saying that the apartment feels like her home and we feel like her family now, which I appreciate and still want to be the case. But she is guilting me into trying to let her live here permanently saying I don't want to live with her and I'm forcing her away. I don't want to budge on this. I need my personal space and I feel like I'm being drained having someone constantly with me, it's just not how I'm designed. I'm not personally ready to have a partner fully living with me long term. I recharge and am able to have self reflection and feel creatively inspired only when I'm by myself, and I haven't felt those in months. I asked my roommates and they expressed that the apartment feels somewhat cramped with all of us in the small space as well. 

I don't want to make her feel that she's being removed from her home, and I want us both to be happy long term with any solution. But she's stating there's no other way for her to be happy besides being here, but I'm not happy with this arrangement now. I want a space dedicated only to me, and I feel run down and exhausted without it. I can't get her on board, and I feel like I don't have any options in regards to my own home.

I’ve always had a hard time staying up late, but this never bothered me. However, whenever I wake up, I still feel so tired, sometimes more so than when I went to bed. And it seems no matter how much I sleep, I still have a bit of exhaustion. I took an hour long nap yesterday, and I could barely keep my eyes open. I felt a bit sluggish for the rest of the day.

I'm beginning to realise things about myself and idk how I feel about them and wanted an outsider's (you guys) opinion on it. I don't know why but for some reason I've created this ideal world in my head according to which I would make decisions that I thought were right and I got from people a lot that I was impractical and overly optimistic at times as well. Ig with the growing hate around me in this world I've grown a stronger zeal to put out good but in the process of being so focused on a perfect world, I lost the ability to stay close to my reality. This makes me question for the 100th time but more seriously what my definition of what's right even is? When we think we're doing the right thing are we doing it cause it's ethically right or cause we think that's the right thing to do in that situation?I'm starting to withdraw into an 'ideal' world of mine and can't think practically and burden myself with doing what's ideally right.

Hi, I’m a teen guy and lately for some reason I’ve had this identity crisis I should say? I might come across as a little strange when I’ve explained  everything but please bear with me, here’s everything, so basically I’ve been really unhappy with myself with my body, confidence. I don’t feel like the main character in my life at all and I just don’t feel in control of my life. An even stranger thing happened, I rewatched one of my favorite childhood movies, such a masterpiece, The Lion King. But after watching I felt this sense of jealousy looking at simbas life. He is the ruler of a kingdom, everyone loves him, and he has a great love life, strong, brave, everything I could ever want. And In the past few days I’ve just almost have this little obsession over it. I want to be just like simba, brave, strong, loving. I never felt this way towards any sort of character from a movie or tv show before. Like I said before I don’t feel in control of my life and I want to feel like I’m the main character.

724,"It is been 3 years since my boyfriend is preparing for upsc exam. Before this lockdown happened, he usually use to visit me and his friends ( staying 2 hours from his place) once in 1-2 months to take a break from studies. But due to this lockdown he has not been able to do so and has shifted to his hometown temporarily.

725,"So I'm in a bit of a conundrum. I am talking to this girl that I really like as well as she is also she is also a very close friend. She lives by herself and goes to med school full-time, works her job full-time at the hospital when school is out, and has numerous financial expenses to worry about per month. She was planning on getting her car paid off before school starts back up in September so she can start saving money to pay towards her student loans, but was informed from her hospital that their hours are getting cut in August due to ""lower patient volume"" (which that, in itself, is bs because they have been getting slammed like crazy with more patients but I digress).

So she's really stressing out about the lack of hours and tried to get credentialed at a nearby hospital, which initially was looking good when she talked to the regional director (I believe that's the person's title she talked to) and they said that other hospital may need help because they are shorthanded right now. So things were potentially looking up, however, she was informed via email last night that the other hospital does not need any help. So she was very upset after hearing that of course. I hate seeing people I care about going through things that negatively affect them like this because I want to help them out but I normally can't do anything to help but be there for them for moral support. In THIS situation, however, I can definitely help and would be more than happy to. Although I am currently unemployed until I retake my test for my local carpenter's union in September, I do Uber in the meantime and make more than enough money to support my own needs financially AND still have enough left over that I am building up my money (even IF I were to give her the 500 dollars I was planning on giving her).

I emphasized to her that she is not alone in this situation and I will gladly help her out, but she is very reluctant as she kept saying she doesn't want to take my money because she will feel obligated to pay me back. I reassured her numerous times that she does not have to pay me back, just the fact that she is happy and has less weight on her shoulders would be payment enough. But she says she doesn't like asking people for help like that. She'd much rather do this on her own, which hurts to see because she's hurting herself in the long run both financially AND mentally. I told her that many people are very independent and they like to face situations like this alone because they feel almost ""weak"" or ""dependent"" or like they ""owe that person"" if they ask for help, that's not the truth at all. Asking for help doesn't show ""dependency"" or ""weakness"" or especially for me ""having to owe me back"", but instead it shows courage for being able to identify when you clearly need help and are able to ask for it.

My main issue with this is I want to help her but I also don't want to badger her with offering to help and thus, I was actually thinking of just writing the check for a few hundred dollars like I was planning on doing and just giving it to her either upfront or sneakily (adding my usual sense of humor to make it easier as well). I am working double time with my hours for Uber now just to build up as much money as I can because I genuinely want her to see that there is no reason to worry about if I have enough money or am ""financially stable"". If there is one thing I can do very very well, it's budget my money. So she doesn't have to worry about my financial well-being. I just really want to help her out and I feel bad that she feels that she has to face this alone. Should I just sit back and watch this unfold? Should I just go through with my plan and help her even though she says she doesn't like getting help? What do I do?",25Jul2020,1

I finally had the courage bc i am in the process of making changes in my life to better myself and hopefully my future so i figured this had to be aired out so i can feel free to pursue any relationajips i want. When i ask to talk to her i was stumbling alot to say it until she figured it out and guess. When i nodded it seemed she died inside. And kind of was freaking out but not at me. she was shock big time. HOWEVER..i didnt get to explain myself. That i am bi and I like both. She said we will talk about it soon (which the anxiety is too much to think about rn) and then i can explain myself better,  but i already know her thought process. Shes gonna say I am confused as she mentioned before and that its just bc I havent been in an intimate relationship with a girl. I never brought home anyone I dated but she know i dated a girl before. And i hinted i was intimate with a guy but i dont want to go into details with her of my history with others. She just doesnt understand its possible to like both and starts spewing the internet and my friends are convincing me i am when rly it was something i discovered myself. Her reaction was what I had expexted before my little optimism came about but i still wasnt prepared for. I didnt leave my room at all last night and today since she stepped out i took the time to brush up and shower and now just holing myself in my room. I feel more anxious more regretful and scared by the minute..I feel like my entire perception and life is possibly changed to where i cant go back.. maybe things might work out but now even if it does anything referencing something gay or so when she is around will make me feel uncomfortable. Shes about tradition and always rambled on about wanting granchildren and what sucks is i am an only child. Explaining to her im bi feels like shes gonna latch on hoping i will be with a girl and she will deny the pososbility of me being with another boy. Idk if i should even explain my preferences. As I like femboys and am one myself but i feel she would find that extra weird a feminine guy. I'm rly anxious can somebody walk me thru or any advice for when we rly sit down and talk. she seemd rly shocked and sad for the rest of last night. I just hope she keeps it between us for now though I don't thunk she did. She probably told her bf and me and him don't like each other at all.

I dunno what to do. She says that if she is pregnant, she'll tell our parents, but if she's not, she won't say anything.

Should I tell them? Or try to get her a pregnancy test? The really concerning thing is that she did it for money. She's 15 and the guy is 21. That's illegal. And if she did it for money, I'm quite sure she's not responsible enough to raise a child.

They would call me a moocher and berate me for not having a job— even though my mom and dad have both said that I didn’t need to support myself yet. And now that I just got a job babysitting some neighbors and helping them do their homework (for a good pay) and instead of saying good job, or even taking a little dig like “took you long enough” they’re just straight up “the daughter said she wanted *me* to do it but I’m too young,” or “are you even qualified to babysit?

In August I got a job at Jiffy Lube working with some friends and it was a blast, I was at probably the emotional high point of my life thus far, I had everything going for me. Fast forward to October when I got cheated on and dumped, she led me on and continued breaking my heart over and over and over again until about March. In that time I started getting into drinking and smoking cigarettes and other shit I probably shouldn’t have been doing. She left but the emotional damage she dealt really didn’t so I continued to drink and smoke and wait for the Marine Corps to get back to me about my waiver, I had gotten them everything they needed and they just kept finding more shit for me to get, last month I was drinking with my friend and we decided to get in the car. So anyways after I got out of jail and came home to my family the sense of genuine shame and discontent only grew, I figured I could start smoking weed for a little bit and that helped so fuckin much dude it was unbelievable, I was attempting to clean up my act but now Im less than 30 days away from my court date so I had to stop and I feel the worst I ever have.

I’m really scared, that people I love will turn backs on me and I will be left alone forever. If anyone got any advice how I can forgive myself and be a better person, please tell.

751,"Alright Reddit, this is my story.


I've had shit massive crush on this girl for so long and about a month ago we started dating. This has been amazing.


A few days ago she texted me saying she wanted to kill herself and shit and I was obviously freaking out about this and and then she stoped texting me because apparently I was just making her feel like shit. I assumed this was just went to sleep because we both pulled all nighters on facetime.


Turns out she wasn't just asleep, but she was sleeping with her ex.. the stupid bitch had unprotected sex with her fucking ex!!!


She told me this and was like ""oh promise you won't get mad"" and shit like that and then after I just stoped talking to her for a few hours because I was just feeling so depressed. 


When I talk to her again she tells me if my fault for not not accepting her. And she says shit like she can't help it because her brain works different or some bullshit like that. And then she just said if I tried to talk to her again she would just block me.
This was last night.



I messaged her goodmorning today and she just left me on delivered.

752,"So I found a ring at work now about two months ago, probably a little over. My boss and I both went above and beyond to put it simply to try to locate the owner- asking around the business, letting the owner of the building know, posting online and in the papers lost and found. A few people tried to claim the ring but couldn’t describe it. Anyways my boss gave it to me a week ago to do what I want with it since it’s been so long and I would just like to sell it. No one has contacted me about the ring since 2 weeks after I’d found it so it’s been silent for quite some time. Anyways, I know when you go to sell the item they ask where you got it- and I don’t want to lie at all but I also don’t know if telling them “I found it at work and my boss said I could keep it” would be good enough.

758,"I could waffle on and give loads of detail but the bottom line is, my partner and I have stopped having sex and I don't really understand why.

The facts:

*We've been together just under 2 years, lived together 1 year
*The relationship is healthy and fulfilling-no other issues
*He's 35, I'm 31F
*He lost his sex drive initially around December due to HATING his job. He said it drains the life out of him and he feels stressed and tired all the time.
*We get on brilliantly and the affectionate between us is no different
*I initially accepted his sex drive declined due to external factors but I know he has recently started to masturbate and ocassionally watches porn so it's not like he has NO sex drive.
*Him not wanting to have sex with me (having previously been very keen and highly sexed) has knocked my confidence. He knows I miss how we used to be but it's like we're now both too shy to initiate sex
*I'm worried he sees me as his best friend and companion rather than a sexual being. I feel like I've forgotten how to be sexual or how to seduce him so we're just going round in circles.
*We HAVE had an open conversation about this (twice) and he just says we've settled into a long term realtionship and have stressful jobs, he does still fancy me and I'm worrying too much. But If this is the case, why does he prefer to masturbate than make the effort?
*I have a fairly high sex drive and I also believe sex bonds a couple. I feel powerful when I have sex but his lack of interest is really knocking my confidence
*He shows me he loves me in all kinds of ways but I'm worried I've become cute to him rather than sexy and I don't know how to get it back. 
*How can a man who previously couldn't keep his hands off me now be happy with just cuddles every night?

759,"In terms of a little background: I'm 28 years old, I've had my share of relationships, messed some of them up due to bad decisions, taking the person for granted, not being happy with myself in general, etc. I've since been working to improve myself, but here's where I'm hitting bedrock.

From my experience in talking about this with people, the consensus is that you can't rely on other people for happiness, you should first be happy yourself and only then can you enter in, say, a healthy relationship with another individual. I'm trying a lot of things to be happy, took in some plants and taking care of them, taught myself to be at half-decent chef, devote my free time to my favourite hobbies like reading and gaming, practise meditation, go running three times a week.

But it doesn't seem enough. It doesn't make me happy, content at times, but even that isn't consistent. It seems such a taboo to say that I want another person in my life to achieve happiness; could someone provide some insight into this? I feel like I'm relying too much on the ""generally accepted psychological discourse"" and it's messing me up inside.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",25Jul2020,1

I feel gross when she's near me, like almost repulsed.

However, I was thinking about when this feeling originated, and really, it goes back to when I was a child. She creeped me out in a way. She scared me in the normal ways that come with living with an abusive parent, but also, I felt weird around her. I felt that she was too comfortable with me and would regularly be naked around me. She would discuss sexual things that made me uncomfortable like just mention things about sex or something, nothing too pressing. That same feeling I have now about her touching me was similar back then, it repulsed me at times.

Is this normal? Am I overreacting?

767,"TL;DR- I feel like people don't respect me and have a lot of examples of this. I don't know whether: a) everyone feels like this b) I have some idea of how I should be treated that just isn't how people treat each other c) I'm doing something wrong that I don't realise I'm doing that makes people not respect me 

Long version:

I'm mid 20s, single and work as a sports coach and fitness consultant. I'm a relatively smart guy- got a good degree and a masters and everything and am regarded as a leader in my field. I make good money: more than a lot of my friends although they don't necessarily realise it. 

I feel like people don't respect me. I don't know if this is a universal experience or something I can fix? I kind of don't know what respect would look like- or if maybe I'm expecting too much of people. 

How it manifests: 

- Family will talk down to me like I'm a kid, which they don't do for my (married, professional) siblings. 

- I'll often be talking and people will start  ""Talking under me""- Like I'll be saying something in the main conversation and people will choose that moment to check if anyone wants another drink or ask how the food is. Like in a way that's like ""Oh I am listening but..."" - they don't do this for other people. 

- Housemates will ask me to do simple jobs but when I say/ suggest/ do a way I think is better they'll just be annoyed and do it their way themselves (I do more than my share of housework: I'm talking more, when an unusual problem needs solving). They're not nasty about it- but there's a bit of a ""its not that hard, I'll just do it, I was only trying to include you"" vibe. 

- My friends don't seem to care for my input on intellectual discussions. I get it if its my 2 doctor friends discussing doctor stuff but often its a doctor and an engineer talking about politics or history and I'm not saying anything less insightful than they are. Or I'll be left to talk to have a light-hearted chat with the friends new partner who no-one knows as well, whilst the friends I've known for years discuss serious things going on in their lives that I'm interested in, without me. Like they want each others advice but not mine. 

- People I've actually worked with will respect me after a couple of hours: but I always find when I first walk into a room I'm a little talked down to and people try to 'explain things in a simple way'. In a professional setting with adults this generally stops as soon as I get an opportunity to show them I know what I'm doing- but I'm clearly giving off a vibe. 

- I feel like people don't even register that dating me is an option- even when I talk to someone for hours at a party or getting texts from someone several times a day- its like no registration that dating is an option. I even kissed a girl at a party, matched with them on tinder that week,  messaged them on tinder to get drinks and when we met they were shocked I thought it was a date and similar things have happened a few times. 

- I used to work with children, and they would listen- but I never really felt like they respected me like they did their class teachers. 

I am pretty agreeable and laid back. I care more about people around me being happy then things being done the way I think is best so I'll often just let things go and let them do them their way.  I don't really make efforts to show off, prove myself or win arguments in the way some people do. 

Do most people feel respected or am I over-sensitive to this?
Does anyone have any tips to being or feeling more respected?",25Jul2020,1

770,"(ML- mother in law, SL- sister in law, BL- brother in law, FL- father in law)

I'm leaving today to spend some extended time with my inlaws and the usual anxiety over my relationship with them is brewing, so I could use some advice. 

For background: (buckle up, its long)
My husband and I have been married for 2 years but together for 10. When we first started dating (literally 2 weeks into dating) we got arrested for possession of marijuana (it's not on our records and is decriminalized in our state now) but this was the first time I met his parents.  We were 17, just stupid kids but first impressions matter and I blew it. 

My brother in law and sister in law got married six months after meeting eachother, and instantly the abuse from my inlaws towards me got worse. Because I was just my husbands girlfriend they would ask me not to be in holiday photos or invite me to events because ""we dont know how long this (our relationship ) will last."" Now that we are married it's a little better but there is still some resentment towards me because weve decided to be childfree, and my BL and SL spawned a crotch-goblin as soon as possible for them. 

We also rented from my inlaws for 3 years and everytime something would break they would blame it on me. Kitchen sink was clogged- it was because I washed my hair in the sink. Heat went out- I put boxes infront of the vents and broke it. Plumbing went in the toilet- I didnt know not to flush tampons or paper towels. Really the place was a shit hole, but what was worse because it was ""my fault"" they wouldn't fix it. We had to get my Dad to come over to make repairs. 

There are also little things, one year they had thanksgiving a day early so they could black Friday shop. I was in retail at the time and worked a 10 hour shift coming over once I got off at 8. They didnt save me a plate and were haughty I didnt take the day off to spend with them. Another year for christmas I made cookies and my ML and SL thought I was outside and I caught them making fun of them in the kitchen. 

My inlaws are a higher social class than my family. My FL is a navy hot shot, my dads a felon. My ML has a masters degree, my moms a yoga instructor. They have a lake house, my parents got their first brand new car 2 years ago. I dont believe in that kind of shit but I feel like they do and its part of the problem. 



I'm trying to have a relationship with them for my husband because my husband is worth it. But as you can see it's really hard. I feel I've grown alot as a person in the past ten years and want to  show them that and honestly just get them to like and respect me. How do I do this?",25Jul2020,1
771,"So.. throwaway for obvious reasons. Not really sure what to do/think so looking for some advice. Got in a heated debate with a friend who is experiencing this and could use your thoughts.

Let’s call my friend Joe.

Basically, Joe’s dad is gay, and cheating on his wife (my friends mom). Joe found this out over 10 years ago, after looking at the father’s phone to play a game (12yo at the time), and finding explicit pictures and messages from father to another man.

Joe chose NOT to say it to his mother, as he felt that whatever was going on his parent’s relationship was their issue to work through, not his. Joe’s sister (let’s call her Mary) found out shortly after, and the stress of keeping the secret in was massively taking a toll on her. Joe and Mary had a discussion when they were 18 and 17 respectively, and Joe forced Mary to not tell their mother. 

Joe, while making a decision that I believe to be incredibly mature for a 12 year old, still suffers from relationship issues to this day. Mary does too.

I’m enquiring on behalf of Joe. What do you guys think the correct decision was? What do you think should be done going forward?

776,"This is a bit of rant but also I need help. I’ve been going through it. TRIGGER WARNING The love of my life broke things off a little over a year ago. Before I met her I’d been planning suicide, with her things go better I had a life to plan, and while I wasn’t 100% better I wasn’t suicidal anymore. Then she broke it off, didn’t give me a reason, and cut contact. I tried to commit suicide. My best friend at the time abandoned me even though I had always been there for her and was there for her after she was caught in her own attempt (hers was before mine for similar reasons) when she “came back” and started talking to me again she blamed me for triggering her. Now if she’d needed time away because she couldn’t deal with what I was going through that’s a different thing but she just ghosted me and any time I said I needed a friend or someone to talk to she made excuses. I looked over our friendship and talked to my therapist and realized a lot of what she did was abusive. After realizing these patterns I began blocking her on everything FIRST because I knew the moment I told her “I’m cutting contact” she’d look for blackmail on any social media of mine she had. She caught me half way through my blocking spree and asked what the hell I was doing. ( I think from the things I’d said she could tell the end was near and was already looking for blackmail because she was on my Twitter when I blocked her and she never usually goes there also I have no real life friends on there except her so I post about whatever I want) I told her I wish her the best, that she needs medical help, and I don’t want to be friends. 

In the aftermath she tried many ways to get my attention. She messaged my cousins and other friend. She called my brother and tried to get him to side with her (they used to date), she snap chatted my younger sister multiple times, and the best of all she got her mother to message my mother and tell her that I had a cigarette addiction and other horrible things (all lies) so that my conservative family would be mad at me and so my mother (also my boss) would fire me from my job teaching at a Christian school. 

Once she was out of my life I felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders. I’m still depressed and suicidal, but I’m so thankful she isn’t in my life. I was scared after she made her mom message my mom. I deleted all my social media and got new accounts where I used fake names (all except Facebook because I’m not on there much and I have family on there so I don’t post things she could use against me anyway) I kept my head down, I was cautious. In December I bought a house and moved. I didn’t make a big deal about it specifically because I didn’t want her knowing. She dated my brother on and off for 9 years I’ve seen her vindictive side, the side that excuses all her behavior because she doesn’t like to take responsibility. I fully expected her to show up at my old house at some point and try to make my parents tell her where I moved. 

Now she’s found my address because my neighbors told her and she’s mailed me a letter. The letter is full of manipulation and totally brushes over what she did. I called my mom crying and while my mom felt bad for me she kinda said “it was bound to happen”. 

I’m scared but most of all I’m angry. It’s taking all my will power not to unblock her and tell her sentence by sentence how stupid and wrong her letter is. I need help I feel like I’m going to explode with anger. I’m mad at her and the world for how life has been going lately I want to stab something I don’t want to hurt anyone but I feel so angry and scared. Is there a healthy way to get my anger out, how do I deal with knowing she has my address, how do I move on from this. Also I feel slightly guilty if I didn’t know her tactics this would look like a good letter. I feel like a bad person for not giving her a millionth chance she’s had one of the shittiest lives you can imagine and for a long time I let that excuse her behavior but now she’s turning into the people who hurt her and she has no one to drag her out of the mire I used to be that for her and now I feel guilty I’m not that for her anymore. 

Also side note she moved too so she holds all the power she knows where I live I have no idea where she is. She didn’t sign a return label on her letter because “she couldn’t bare seeing it be returned to sender” or whatever the fuck lie.",25Jul2020,1

He missed our call yesterday and I’m a little upset because it happened twice already this week. I understand work and he’s tired but like I have some expectations too... I’m studying for LSAT but I make sure I’m done with studying before we call eachother at night. We text here and there and Snapchat too. We don’t do anything together besides once in a blue moon watch a show together. I know I shouldn’t be upset but I am and I told him about it and he told me I had right to be annoyed. He is my best friend and I tell him how I feel about things and he does too I guess. I just feel like if he’s so busy with work then he must not have time for a relationship...what are your thoughts?",25Jul2020,1
778,"My(22, F) parents divorced when I was four years old, after which I lived with my mother. For the first few years up until my dad got remarried and had one of his two kids... my dad paid a bare minimum of 100 euros to my mother for my upbringing a month. I should add here that my parents were migrant workers without any edu degrees in a first world country who worked/work working class jobs. Up until this very day my father never paid a penny for my upbringing. 
What happened today is, i made a messenger group with all of my uncles, aunts,(paternal side) and dad, and simply sent a video where I talked about my life update: that I'm finally moving out of my maternal uncle's family. (Despite my mother, father, and paternal side of the family having migrated to western countries, I still live in a developing country away from then since I was very young) 

Half an hour after I sent this message, there's a call on the group and everyone is present. My grandmother is also present and despite having tubes all around her(she's been recovering from an operation and is in the ICU) she reacted very happily seeing me. She blew me kisses and was extra energetic just by seeing me. This made everyone very emotional. 
Next, one of my uncles who is quite well off, who would shower me with presents every time he came to the home country, messaged me separately after the call.  He asked for my bank details. And I provided the information. He said he'd like to send me some money now and then. He told me not to tell anyone.(my father had paid for his college education despite being a migrant worker so I suppose he feels a kind of accountability towards helping me financially)

An hour passed from that, and suddenly I see my dad accepted my fb friend request... Which I had sent to him three years ago... Lol
He then calls me, and also asks for my bank details. He wants to send money now and then. 
And I don't exactly know why, but this leaves me wondering if I should mention this to my uncle? I feel weird because I don't want my uncle to think he should pay extra since my dad doesn't pay a penny, but then again does it even matter to let him know?",25Jul2020,1

795,"Hey how are you doing thanks for scrolling through Reddit and taking the time to read my post, I appreciate it.

Where do I begin? I am 20 years old I am currently finishing college. Been at it for 4 years now, some of my friends and family who entered the same time I did have graduated already and I haven't. I dont mind taking a longer time but I worry when I will graduate due to my own disappointments like retaking classes and switching majors after 2 years in. From CE to Acct. Which is my reason for this post, I dont feel as pursuing Acct is the way to go, honestly I entered college after highschool because I had no other plans, first generation student. I have no family in white color jobs, they all work in trades like lanscaping, electrician, painter, construction so there was that aspect but it wasn't as if they were mentoring anyone it was more like a Dad working to support his family type of deal.

The way I see my situation is I entered college not having a goal or  pursuing an interest, I fell behing on grades and ended up switching majors to something, ""easier"" and here I am thinking ""Im close to graduating but I dont like my new major"" thankfully I dont have student loans or debt of any kind (car, cards, notes ect) nothing so money isnt whats making this hole im stuck in deeper as time goes on. 

I like to analyze myself to maybe find an explanation of my lack of wants. From what I have been able to summarize, keep in mind im not looking to blame anyone, my faults are completely my own I have nothing to blame anything on and I am happy with that realization. However when I think back to my childhood I see how I was completely spoiled and privileged. 

Spoiled in how I never needed anything, clothes, food, toys, ect. My dad worked hard and always made enough to pay for the bills and for my wants. (Really quickly no my dad is not wealthy, he made what the average landscaper makes according to bls.gov.) 

Privileged in the fact that I grew up with two parents a mom and dad who respected me which in turn I respected them and never hid anything from them. I grew up like an only child and got all their attention. However I am not the only child, all my siblings are much older than me, by the time I was 3 my youngest sister was already pregnant and moving in with her now husband, just as an example. So I lived the life of an only child at home but with the experience of having older siblings. 

So for me I view myself as never needed to work for what I wanted. So because of that im still so naive and still think everything will be fine, because I still havent found myself in a dark place where there are two exits the one back or the one forward. Im just here taking it easy, and mayne thats my problem. 

I currently live with roommates, I pay rent and all my bills, I moved out in December of 2019, and when quarantine hit I wasnt worried, I knew I would be fine and I am so im thankful for that. I dont have a job currently since campuses are closed. Classes are starting soon and graduation is near for me and thats means adulthood and having a career I should enjoy but I dont know that I will. 

That is where my headspace is at, sorry for the long read. I hope I made sense with my post, one of my faults is I am terrible at explaining things. Keep on keeping on!",25Jul2020,1

800,"So background my parents have verbally abused me for years and while my grandmother was alive should made sure my feelings were acknowledged but now she's dead I'm apparently a bossy, attention seeking child.

My two younger brothers are autistic and to be honest have been neglected emotionally by both of my parents since they refuse to parent them and spoil them rotten and because of this the oldest of the two (s we'll call him) has been nothing but difficult and absolutely horrible.

S has never been punished for any of his actions and in some cases he has been even rewarded for bad behaviour, my younger brother has hit me, called me names and has wished death upon me and has started to exhibit sexual behaviour towards the youngest (c we'll call him). My parents shrug it off and he even tried it with me but I wasn't going to put up with it.

My parents practically have to ask permission to do anything from him and I have pointed it out multiple times but there excuse is ""he's autistic he doesn't know any better"" which by that logic my stalker should be allowed to harass me still (whole other story). I had to literally fight my parents (not physically but it was a screaming war) to make S wash properly because he would (thankfully I broke that habit) purposefully pee on the floor and on himself and my parents would let him fester in it.

C always has to give into S constantly and considering he has some form of anxiety (my parents refuse to get him a therapist) he has started hit the wall as a comfort which my parents won't do anything about. I myself cannot parent him any longer since I have some illness undiagnosed (epilepsy or stress disorder not sure) so I've had to focus on myself more. My parents thankfully treat my illness properly and have improved how they treat me but not enough to where they consider my input valuable (I'm 18). 

S's behaviour has gotten so bad and the amount of stress he puts me through my hair has started turning white (I look like rouge from X-Men). What's surprising is that my dad fully expects me to disappear and not come back and although it's tempting I'd feel guilty since my parents aren't 100% bad and I'll be leaving C alone with S. However my other family members have always guilted me in having an opinion on my parents parenting skills and refuse to acknowledge the abuse I went through. 

So what I'm asking is when I eventually able to move out should I cut them somewhat out of my life or just stay in their lives because I don't know what to do anymore.

She goes above and beyond for me and does things for me which most parents wouldn’t, furthermore, she literally does everything in her power to make me happy and to have a great life from working longer and scraping money to buy me something I really want to driving for hours to buy a puppy to surprise me with. However, its like she changes to a completely different person whenever she’s with her partner. My parents got a divorce when I was 7 and I moved away with my mum, and soon after she meet her partner. Looking back now, 10 years later, I’m honestly quite heartbroken and upset by the way I was treated when she is around him.

At first everything was fine, he’d stay over a few days and we’d all watch movies or play games, but then he started to move in and that’s when it all started. She began treating me differently and undermined things I said. For example, he is a smoker and smoked frequently on our balcony. My room was right next to the balcony and had a vent leading outside, I told my mum countless times that I could smell it (the house was an old build and the vent was practically a decorated hole so the smell comming through was quite strong) and she would tell me I’m over reacting or being sill. It wasn't until months later that she realised I was telling the truth and covered the hole. Additionally, she began acting very sarcastically toward me. For example, I was looking out the balcony when I saw someone drive his car away, so I ran over to tell my mum and ask if it’s going to get fixed (it was broken) and she said ’noo someone’s stealing it’ i didn’t know if she was joking or not so I asked if she was serious and she said yeah. I got really concerned and said someone should call the police. She just laughed and continued to tell me that someone stole it, I stopped caring once I realised they didn’t care about someone stealing their car. This happed constantly with everything, I eventually stopped asking my mum things because I didn’t know whether to believe her. Can I just remind you at this time I was a child, who didn’t understand sarcasm, till now I don’t know what she gained by essentially lying to me about certain things and continuing with the lie for sometimes days. But what’s weird is that as soon as he is away, she’s back to normal.

Furthermore, whenever he was home, she spent every living second with him. I don’t remember spending time alone with my mum for most of my younger years, it would either be all of us or I’d be alone. She likes to say that I’m very independent and have been since a young age, however, I now know I was just left alone. The majority of the time I was alone was because they were having s\*x in their room. It would be the same everyday, come home talk for 20 minutes and they’d go to their room, ‘mum can u play with me.’ ‘Later okay’ and then giggle off to her room. At the time I didn’t  understand what they were doing and that she was essentially choosing to have sleep with him again and again Instead of spending time with me. Even in the shower, they’d shower together for hours giggling about how their saving water when they know that’s bs and im left agin on my own. Although I didn’t know what they were doing, I hated being at home because I was alone, so I started to go to the park everyday after school with a bad crowd of kids. She says I had my ‘teenage’ years early and that I was horrible to her. I don’t remember being as bad as she says but I do remember hating to be home as this was the time I started to piece things together. I told her once how I felt she wasn't nice to me when she is with him and she started to cry said she was sorry her happiness is making me sad, she defended him saying I can’t take a joke that she would stop joking with me and ignored most thing I said. After that argument I told myself I would never complain about him because she won’t listen. Later when I was older she told me that I was so horrible to her that she called my dad BEGGING to come take me. This made me realise she’d literally be happier with out me.

I decided that maybe I was overreacting and ignored everything bad, until a few years later when she fell pregnant. I just want to note within these few years she and I became really close, so I was heartbroken when I had to ask her if she was pregnant and found out that I was the last to know. She even told her in laws, who she didn’t like before me, my aunts and uncles before her own daughter. I don’t know if I’m overreacting but we were really close, I’d tell her EVERYTHING and thought she’d do the same. While she was pregnant we flew to my birth country to see our family. The there of us took a picture outside a bus stop and I later found that she cropped me out the image. I confronted her about it and she said she doesn’t have a picture with just him and that I was no big deal. We found the picture a few years later and I told her if she remembers and she claims she never did that and never would, but I still remember. A few years later my step mum fell pregnant and asked if I wanted to come to the ultrasound with her to see my sister, that was the first time I wast ever taken to an ultrasound, when my mum was pregnant i just waited outside while they went to the ultrasound. I cried when I came back because I felt that maybe if my mum didn’t include me, she didn’t want me inner ‘new family’. I know now that that’s not true and whenever its me, my mum and my little sister we have a great time but whenever he is involved it’s like it’s them there and I’m just tagging along. I feel the same with my dad and my step mum but only from my step mums family, not with my dad or her.

I totally understand why my mum and dad divorced, they mad each other miserable and my mum wanted to take me away from that atmosphere. She tells me that he really brought down her self-esteem and that her new partner makes her feel confident and has helped her stop feeling this way and start to stand up for herself, which I love and I truly wish her all the best and hope she grows more confident, but I don’t think he’s as great as a person as she thinks or maybe she just ignores it. Don’t get me wrong he has brought me a lot of things, very nice things but the actions of buying my nice things are constantly overshadowed by things he has done. Once I was eating a pastry and left for a bit and came back to finish it, I saw that there were crumbs on the container so I picked it up to eat I’m and instead of stopping me he said ’ewwww that was a small peel off my foot’ he laughed and till this day I don’t know if he was joking or not but why. Who puts something from their foot next to someone’s food? When we left to go to my birth country he saw me and told me why I had put make up on and that I looked stupid with it. I had no make up on, my cheeks were red from the heat and he thought I put blush on. I remember telling my mum and she said she wouldn’t say that but I remember him saying it was stupid or disgusting. When I was younger he also used to call me stinky and other names I told him to stop and my mum said he was only joking. I didn’t like it at first but got used to it later even send names back. My dad saw it once and told him to never talk that way to me and at first I was confused as he was just joking but those were mainly my mums thoughts. Now I’m glad he said that because who does that to a young girl. I didn’t like it at first and thats where it should’ve stopped. Additionally, whenever me or my mum argue he gives me this glance look of spite, I don’t get it because I did nothing to him but he will give me this look and all of a sudden it feels like the whole house is against me. In addition, we have this beautiful dog who he’s unnecessarily not nice to at times. Most of the time he’s lovely with him and spoils him but everyone and then he’ll just be abusive. For example our dog was walking through the door when he just kicked him in. I looke dat my mum with concern and she just gave me an Oh well it okay look when she Now’s I get upset when she shout at the dog. Another thing that happened was that there was miscommunication with a resort worker. She asked if we were going on an outing, as I understood it she meant out side the resort, they both thought she meant around the resort but we were at the exit gate so of course she thought we were leaving the resort. He meant to have asked to be let back in if we turn around to go back to our cabin to leave the dog there while we go do an activity but he said it weirdly in a way that she understood for us to leave the dog in the cabin while we left the resort. She said that’s not allowed and he started to get angry and the miscommunication escalated, she checked to see if we even had a dog in the car and our cabin number ect. After she let us back through he called her racist (he’s Indian) and if he were a white huh she would’ve let us through no problem. I tried to correct him and say how she’s just doing what she had to and he just undermined everything I said. I later tried to explain to my mum how we were in the wrong and there was no need to be rude to her once she was gone and once agin she defended him saying that they complained about the place not her. This was the moment I realised she will always defend him, unless she’s the one that disagrees. Recently she told me that she feels split between everyone and what confuses me is that she feels split but still spends more time with him. I don’t know maybe I’m jealous that my mum hasn’t spent much time with me on this holiday but if she feels torn why doesn’t she make us all do something together or spend sometime playing with her daughters? Instead she spent the time with him and when I tried to get us to do something together I had to ask her multiple times because she didn’t want to. The majority of the trip wasn’t like this but the parts that were sucked. Yet I was the cause of the unhappy few days and we missed an activity because I was upset. She doesn‘t know why but it’s because I felt like I was just tagging along onto their family holiday.

.I love my mum A LOT and want nothing but the best for her, she literally is my world, so it pains me to feel like I’m not part of their family when he is around and to realise that her happiness comes at the cost of mine and mine at the cost of hers. I don’t hate her just the things she has done, I don’t think any less of her, nor do any of this change my opinion of her being the best, but I feel like our relationship is toxic and I’m scared to go away for uni only to find out I was right and that she is happier without me. I don’t know how to tell her any of this or If I ever should, I know no ones going to read this insanely long post but I just had to get this off my chest. What should I do? Do I tell her or not? if so, how?",25Jul2020,1

815,"Art's been a passion of mine since I was in 5th grade. I remember spending all of my time drawing, I especially loved Character Design, and so I created hundreds of characters over the years. I've just always loved art. 

I've never been good at it though, and I didn't exactly get better over the years. I was so focused on character design and making new characters, that it's essentially all I drew, and constantly in the same manner. Every single 'drawing' of a character I drew was essentially a copy of the last, except for the hair and outfit. There was no concept of anatomy or originality, and as I kept drawing that way, I cemented the way I drew. My art style became the style of a child's. I'm actually embarrassed of my art. I'm in my 20s now, but if I showed you one of my Ocs, you'd think I was 12. Hell, 12 year olds are better than I am. I also completely lack creativity, I can't come up with different body types, or different face shapes, or unique outfits... I always end up going back to my 5th grade style, where I drew the same body over and over and over, which was in no way good. 

My entire life my family has told me I was good at art. My father encouraged me to pursue art in college, and it's embarrassing because I know I'm not good, and how do you tell that to people who've been saying otherwise for years. I wish I could draw Oc's and Fanarts of characters I love, but I just can't. I struggle learning anatomy, and unless I get a detailed explanation of every way of drawing the body, I'll never quite understand. Even then, I don't even have the motivation to really pursue anything, even if that thing is my 'passion'. I think certain people are just born with a certain degree of skills, and I wasn't one of those people.

I've considered just quitting art permanently, at least that form of it. That way art wouldn't distract me anymore, and I could focus on a useful degree, or something.",25Jul2020,1

I hung out with my cousin after years and drank together for the first time (white claws) and her girlfriend picked her up while I covered for her for the night this. She only came out to me and I’m happy to help their relationship blossom so she left her phone and had me add her girlfriend as a contact. 
When she dropped her off (so I could drop her off in my car) she texted me thanks for being cool and she heard a lot about me and was nice so I said of course and it was nice to meet maybe we will all hangout one day. 

Same night she texts me that my cousin shared how I’m bi (still in the closet) but have been debating dating girls. She asks my type and sorta educated me on lingo lol which was cool and she said I needed an Asian stud (she’s an Asian stud) and I said I was dating someone but maybe one day and she then said she would set me up. 

Fast forward to the day of my date. He flaked on me so I text her “maybe I will need help with that setup” and then I was kind of buzzed from the wine I treated myself to and she mentioned “you need some 🐱🐱😂” which I said maybe I do to and that’s it- no flirting. I had already planned to see my cousin again so said maybe we can all get dinner and the following day she texts me about dinner later and I said I confused the dates so we would have to rain check and she was asking about the next night then forgot she had work and she said “I’m getting so excited I totally forgot” so I don’t know......she does seem nice and everything but I don’t want to ruin anything between my cousin and I because I’m not sure if she’s flirting or friendly? Like it seemed fine until those comments (you need some pussy, an Asian stud and I was so excited) so I’m not sure if it’s all like little hints?? She even said “oh you’re 23? You look good” and I don’t want to possibly incite anything if that makes sense??

837,"(This is RECENTLY, something I just got out of. I'm still 14) I need help, to make sure I'm not overreacting, since these are serious accusations that I'm thinking of. This is also a throwaway account. 

Only recently once my friend and I cut ties over political differences, did I start to notice the flaws that we previously had in our friendship. I turned 14 in March so I've been 12/13 the majority of my friendship with the person I'll call X. He's an adult, 18/19 during this timeframe.

X called me cute a lot, complimented my physical appearance (he even had a photo I sent him as his phone lockscreen for a while), admitted to having a sexual fantasy about me, implied several times about sexual situations with me, has told me he ""loves me"" (not in a serious confession or romantic way), has flirted with me, sent me nsfw images of feral animals, has joked about p*dophilia around me, said I was ""mature for my age"", has joked about me being sexually involved with my family, etc..

Additionally treated me like a child, belittled me and got angry with me whenever I talked about him to other people if he didn't supervise it..Also implied I was neurodivergent (specifically ADHD), and despite his belief treated me in a de-humanizing matter.

There are probably deeper issues, as I could always feel something was wrong but I've never known what. I feel like I'm delusional and going crazy by asking these questions. I need somebody to affirm I'm not just a Tumblr sjw trying to find controversy in everything. I'm worried I'm just upset over this because I disagree with him. I'm not sure of anything anymore.

839,"\[M22\] here. So me and my gf \[F20\] had a discussion recently about our relationship. She said she was with friends recently and one of the friends said that during our relationship I had slept with said friend on two accounts (we have slept together before and it was consensual and it was before I knew my gf) One being back in May and that it was consensual between both parties and the other in October (both being last year). The second time I allegedly did it the friend was messed up on drugs and was in bed and couldn't move, I apparently got in bed with said person and did things. I know for a fact I did neither of those, especially the 2nd accusation as that's a horrific thing to do and I had a gf.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously my gf gets upset and confronts me about it and basically says I need to admit I did it or she will break up with me. So we discuss it and all I get are vague details about both accusations.

Now, when I go outside, I freak out when it feels like anything is touching me, even when nothing's there.

845,"[SEE THE THREE KEY ITEMS THAT MATTER](https://drpsychological.com/harvard-study-reveals-the-3-ingredients-to-true-happiness/)

In a recent TED talk, Psychiatrist Robert Waldinger described some of the secrets to happiness, which was revealed in a recently released 75-year-long Harvard Study.

Apparently, we should value love above all else. It’s the main thing in life that brings us happiness. Once you see what really made people happy over three-quarters of a century, you won’t need to assume what will make you happy, and you may change your ways.

Psychiatrist George Vaillant, who led the study from 1972 to 2004, wrote about this important study with humor. He said, “The 75 years and 20 million dollars expended on the Grant Study points … to a straightforward five-word conclusion: ‘Happiness is love. Full stop.’ “

The study followed two sets of white men: 268 Harvard sophomores were part of the “Grant Study” led by Harvard psychiatrist George Vaillant and 456 12- to 16-year-old boys who grew up in inner-city Boston were part of the “Glueck Study” led by Harvard Law School professor Sheldon Glueck.

Researchers surveyed the men about their jobs, relationships, and health over 75 years.

The greatest takeaway from the study was the revelation that relationships bring us the most joy. Good relationships bring us the most happiness.

But it’s more complicated than that.",25Jul2020,1

I do suffer from anxiety and depression and it definitely gets worse when those are heightened BUT even if I am completely happy and relaxed, I still play with my hair: 
I don’t pull it out, I just twirl it etc. which often does result in it falling out. I am desperate to stop, but the problem is that most the time I don’t even know that I’m doing it!! How do I make myself aware of it?
If I tie my hair back then I generally still play with it until it’s lose again (irrelevant of how it is tied), and if I can’t play with it then I end up scratching the side of my face... which often is so bad that I end up bleeding and making a scar. 
I have tried to use fidget spinners etc. but because the habit is so bad and I’m often unaware that I’m doing it, the ‘distraction’ doesn’t seem to work for long.

858,"Seriously starting to get worried over what I've gotten myself into and thinking my friend is likely to end up not being my friend anymore after this. Had a friend who had to leave where he was living and couldn't get a new place because he was unemployed due to covid and no one would rent to someone on unemployment. He asked if he could stay at my place while he found a job, making it sound like a short term thing. Now, here I was admittedly an idiot by making assumptions instead of just asking, but I was thinking like a couple weeks, maybe a month, while he applied to every job in a 100 mile radius.  


He gets here and proceeds to spend the next two weeks just playing video games (on my computer) and watching Netflix, saying he's limited in what he can apply to because his resume is on his computer which would arrive later. (That was already starting to sound like BS to me, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt because he's been my friend for a long time now.) Now his computer is here, been here a week, and he's applied to 5 things, five, all within my small town. My small town which I warned him there was no place to actually move to because the apt complex probably has a 3mo waitlist minimum, and he just.... keeps playing video games and watching streams. If it wasn't for the fact that most places require you to apply online, I'd just take my router with me to work so he couldn't watch Netflix etc.

Starting to think this is gonna come down to his stuff getting left on the porch and him locked out the door. (But even that I'm not sure how I'd pull off since he never actually leaves other than a few minutes to walk to a nearby restaurant and back.)

Is there another option? Or am I just stuck with waiting on him to either finally start looking for a job or leaving his stuff outside? (I'd probably at least pay for a month of a nearby storage locker.)",25Jul2020,2

I did clarify it was a joke but he just seemed to ignore that so he's either messing or he's genuinely asking for my address and I have 1 friend who knows my address for sure and 2 who know roughly, one didn't say anything, the other said no don't beat him up he's my g (half sincere half messing), and my other friend there doesn't say much but I message him privately and he just says don't worry he won't do anything just turn on ghost mode and you'll be fine, I trust this person alot he's a good friend I've known for years.

862,"32F here! First, some backstory: I endured a lot of emotional trauma when I was growing up: horrendous bullying at school, an emotionally unavailable mother who was also manipulative and verbally abusive (sometimes physical abuse, tho it was more rare), a passive father who enabled my mother, zero friends at all, etc. I have diagnoses of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and several body focused repetitive behaviors (trichotillomania and dermatillomania). I began self injuring at age 11 and started seeing a therapist when I was 13 or so. I saw this same therapist for close to ten years and I grew very close and attached to her.  I believe she saved my life. I stopped seeing her in my early 20s when I moved away.

Fast forward to now and I’m 32. Married with young children. Still no friends at all and I struggle with relating to others. I’ve been living in my new state for 10 years now and have tried numerous therapists over the past decade but none measured up against my strict standards. I didn’t click with anyone like I did with my first therapist. I’ve been struggling lately so I decided to try *again* to find a therapist, and I finally found someone that I really click and connect with!! I started weekly sessions with her about 6 weeks ago. 

Here’s my problem: I have very become attached to her. I count down the days until our sessions together, I think about her all the time, I will email her when I’m having a particularly rough time (she encourages this as a way to vent and get feelings out but stresses that there’s no expectation of a reply prior to our session). I just love that someone seems to truly care about me and my struggles, and who is supportive and wants to help me on my journey.  What I don’t fully understand is *why* I feel this still, as a 32 year old adult. It made sense when I was younger because I literally had no other support or outlet. But now, I’m married to a wonderful man who is supportive and caring. But it’s not quite the same, I guess.  I don’t know how to *not* feel close/attached to her. I’ve sorta mentioned this to her and she seems unconcerned and has said that she’s helping me to practice opening up and being vulnerable with others, so that I can eventually do it on my own and have meaningful relationships (friendships) with people aside from my husband. She’s also helping me challenge 20 years of thoughts and feelings of  self hatred and of being inadequate.  But I really worry that I’m trying too hard to show her that I’m broken and in need of her help. I want her to *really* see and understand how much I need her. But is that normal? Do other people do this? Or am I just some kind of messed up??

So when I was younger my mother left my father and married my stepfather. Through my entire childhood he kept treating me like I was a complete idiot and that I wouldn't amount to anything and become a construction worker like him (nothing against it just have no passion towards it). With his constant yelling I developed a major anxiety disorder when it comes to conflict and mostly with travel . Later on my mother ended up leaving him after finding out that he was cheating and also doing drugs (he ended up taking put a loan to buy her out of her half of the house). We moved out into another place and everything was okay for about 2 years. We were in contact with him but it wasn't that big of a thing.

So this past year our landlord was planning to sell her place so we had to move out and he had offered to let us stay at his place. Over the last 2 years we had a relationship where we could stand each other. He had been showing some improvement and had us convinced that he was clean. I had read texts that he was still talking to other girls and giving them money. We were remodeling a few rooms at the place until one day he took a massive heart attack and passed away. While the rest of the family was crying I was speechless and couldn't say anything. I never liked  guy but was able to help family through it. So we schedule his service for about a week later (he was cremated).

Now I already had anxiety mainly when it comes to travel (started with him...another story).. So on the day I was having constant panic attacks and couldn't do it. So off of family went while I stayed there and beat the crap out of myself for being such an idiot (been trying to do better and get past it ). 

So from what I hear the service went great and everything was fine and we ended up moving into his house. A few months later we realize that he had been taking out more loans and been telling the loan sharks that we would be paying it off. This is about $100,000 and possibly even more and was saying how we worked things out and we agreed upon it. That we had all gotten back together and that my mom was gonna help pay it off. All of this is untrue and we were on the hook for it all or we would lose the house. If i had to guess he was giving it to her in exchange for sex or drugs etc.

So about 2 months ago I messaged my cousin to talk about just random things and he basically was trying to refusing to talk to me calling me an asshole for not going to the service. And saying how much of a dick I was Etc.

Well I hate talking to people because I hate telling them I’m not interested. I usually hang out with the
 And talk with them for a week and by then I have usually made my decision.

The most recent guy I talked to was the one I was most excited for. On the surface he checked off everything out my list. He was bigger but not fat. He was supper nice and he likes to go and do stuff. That was u til I hung out with him.

He’s 25 and I’m 19 and he hasn’t been in a relationship in 2 years. So naturally when he was told a girl thought he was cute he kinda went over board. 

He kept asking how fast I wanted to go and I told him not fast at all. He kinda threw that out the window. He asked if he could stay the night at my place and just cuddle so I said why not. Later he pushed me to do a little more and I kept telling him no. He took no as an answer but he asked three times in one night, after I told him I wanted to go slow.

Also when we were cuddling he kept stroking my body which also made me really uncomfortable.

He apologized the next morning saying he just hasn’t had much physical contact in two years so he was a little eager. It still creeped me out a little. 

I dint want to hurt his feelings because he was so excited when I started talking to him and his friends think I would be good for him. I just don’t know what to do and It’s giving me anxiety.",25Jul2020,1
870,"Hi I'm 19, currently in University studying an Meng course going onto 2nd year. From the age 13-17 I was in the ATC (air training corps). I didn't have much choice in this as my father has always wanted me to become a pilot for the air force. I don't regret it though, made a loads of friends and got to do stuff very few kids my age were given the opportunity to do. My father was in the Portuguese air force and my grandfather was in the army. Saying that they both didn't enjoy being in the military and didn't stay past the minimum required service. I grew up hearing stories from both of them. Neither of them faced combat they were both engineers stationed home but some stuff theyd tell me carry a variety of emotions mostly positive. 

Before I applied to Uni I needed to make up my mind wether or not Id join the military or go to uni how my parents were expecting me to. My parents have always looked down upon kids my age who have joined the military especially the army and marines saying ""they fell for the propaganda/advertisement"". Ive come to the realisation that I want to join the Marines but my parents don't know. I've tried to slip it into conversation and even used a friend in place of my own situation and the response has from my parents had always been against it. The truth is my Dad and my grandfather sold the military life to me and I want it. Being scared to tell them is one thing but id also have to apply for my countrues citizenship which would draw me back £1000+ and it would be over a year till I'd get it. It's a little extreme but my fear is that my family and extended would not approve of me doing this especially my dad. I'm old enough to make my own decisions I know that and there are people in worse situations in life than me. How do I tell them.

Open for further questions if the info will help but I'll be selective in what I share.

I'll be happy with any advice you guys have. Thanks",25Jul2020,1
872,"So my mom is a absolute Karen. She would start a scene if someone gets her mad and she would wanna tlak to the manager. She talked to my sister about her and my dad having sex. She’s so rude to other people. Like for example I one time saw a guy with a pink bag. And she started bashing him talking to me about it saying that it’s weird that he has a pink bag. Okay and? Let him be. She contained to bash other people and when she watched tv she did that. It had enough and stood up for these people and told her off. She got mad at me and said “You gonna be like that? I’m just having  a conversation with you. I won’t do it again, I’m done talking to you about stuff” she took it out of context. I’m mad that she’s making fun of people. That’s not right. 
And I had a amazing day today then she ruined it. 
And mom filed for this thing where I and my sister get money each week. I didn’t ask for that, and my sister told my mom she would file for herself cuz she know my mom would ask for money.
I can’t say how much I got but it’s a ton. And my mom wants me to give her 400 for just doing it. All she did was file for the stuff that’s it. I didn’t even ask for this and she’s gonna take the money. My sister got pissed cuz she knew this would happen. And she says this is a way so she can get money. But my mom says she did this so we don’t have to work. I’m a lazy person but I do want to work. At least have experience in the field of working. My mom wants to be a achieve in life and she’s gonna close off the opportunity to not get a job? And I said I wanted working papers but she brought up that I said I didn’t to. But I do now. Idk what’s the hell is wring with my mom but Ik once I’m out of the house and prepared I’m dipping. She wants me to go to college but not on what I truly want to do.

874,"Hello all! I am a 23F who is initially from NY, living in VA. I have been living here for roughly a year but just recently became a full resident due to work. Since I am 23, I am still covered under my parents insurance until I am 25. That being said, I have been NEEDING to go to a dentist and only have coverage for dental in NY ( literally everything else is covered across the country except for Dental). I have put it off for far too long and am experiencing physical discomfort and am worried of it getting worse. 

I was initially planning on driving up to NY this weekend. I was going to be staying with my family for 5 days, so I had enough time to make an appointment, and a second one incase I needed any work done. Then, on the 21st, VA got added to the NY restriction list. Unfortunately I do not have enough PTO to self quarantine for my job. On top of that, my job will not allow it unless we use PTO. I am nervous of driving home and having issues due to my car being registered in VA. That, and if I did happen to have issues with law enforcement, I feel like me saying I needed to come to NY for a dentist appointment sounds so faulty. I got nervous and canceled my trip and appointment. But like I stated earlier, each day I am in more and more pain. Not sure what to do.

880,"I recently moved into a house with two roommates. They had a spare bedroom upstairs and offered it to me for $500/month. I noticed I was getting bit the third day after I moved in. It wasnt anything serious, just a couple of bites here and there so I ignored it.

About a week ago, I woke up and found 20+ bites in a patch on my upper back. Later that day, I got 20+ more on my lower back. I asked my roommates about it and they told me that there had been a bed bug problem in that room before and the previous roommate moved out because of it.

I am furious that they didn't tell me about this before I moved in. I now have bites from my upper back all the way down to my ankles. I've also spent over $100 trying to remove them myself. I am still getting bit.

I had an exterminator come in and they told me it'll be roughly $700 to spray the place. I asked my roommates to split the bill because they're spraying the entire house and not just my room and they said no. It was out of their price range.

I feel like this entire situation is completely unfair to me. They should have either told me about the problem before I moved in or already had the problem fixed.

I refuse to pay the $700 and am considering just moving again. The problem with moving again is I'll have to buy all new furniture because I don't know what the bugs have gotten into. That would cost me around $500 and that doesn't include the Uhaul or any other costs of moving.

I am at a loss of what to do.

881,"This will be a long post and I have no clue how comprehensive it'll actually be.

Four years ago I met a girl and after a few months I fell in love with her. We were classmates and still go to the same school and so I saw her pretty often. She didn't share my feelings when I told her a few months after falling for her. It was the only time I've ever been in love and I was very overwhelmed. 

We started texting about two months after I confessed my feelings. She quickly became one of my best friends and we just kind of clicked. It was not a rare occurence that we'd stay up until 3 am just texting and she knows me better than any other person ever could.

After one and a half years of being in love with her I felt like my feelings for her were slowly disappearing and at that time she was my best friend. I've never really had a best friend before and she's probably the most important person in my life. 

Fast forward a few months and I had a bad evening while drinking and we argued a few days later. I've never felt as shitty as in those days where we didn't talk to each other. So she came to my house, we talked it out and made up.

My mental health was at a low point, I had self confidence issues and anxiety mixed with my father being burnt out. It was shitty to say the least. So a few weeks after our big fight I started therapy. It was a weird experience and I neglected our friendship. The atmosphere was just off after our fight and I was kind of scared about being as dependent on her as I was. I didn't really push her aways but our steady texting got less. Later i learned that her mental health was also declining at this point.

My biggest mistake was probably my reaction to her going to our school counselor. She visited me before class and told me that she went to see him and that they talked about her mental health issues. I'd had a bad experience with this guy so I reacted all wrong and basically told her that it was a bad idea and that he's weird. I want to scream at my past self and pretty much start crying when thinking about how she must have felt about my reaction.

After that we didn't really text and we had another big fight about pretty much nothing. There was just so much conflict between us and we were both in dark places. Fast forward a few months we kind of made up and are around each other more often. She told me that she was diagnosed with depression and is on antidepressants. We didn't talk about it at that point because some friends were coming and we had a small party with a lot of alcohol. 

At one point we were pretty drunk and started making out with each other...We somehow ended up on her bed making out and giving each other hickeys. Then we went back to our friends and just carried on without really talking about it. We also both made out with other people at this party.

After this party I was feeling shittier than ever in my life. Nothing was making sense and I just knew that I had fucked up. I should've encouraged her when she came to tell me that she had gotten the help she so clearly needed. And instead I reacted all wrong and abandoned her while she was dealing with depression. 
Somehow that evening also made my feelings come back and right now I'm just a mess. I randomly burst out in tears and feel lonely as f*ck. But I also can't really cry properly? Like I'll cry for a few seconds and then just feel numb again? I know that it was all my fault and I feel like I f*cked up the most important thing in my life. But nothing makes sense anymore. I don't know what's wrong with me because one second I'm feeling shitty and crying and the other I'm pretty okay and am feeling like an imposter. I secretly kind of wish it was worse so it'd at least be constant and I'd know what was up.

So now I'm still in love with my best friend who I abandoned when she needed me the most and I have absolutely nobody to talk to. I'm currently changing therapists and the one person I'd always tell everything is the one I'm in love with. Everything's just gone to shit and I have no clue what's going on anymore.

So what do you say, how do I get over her? And how do I get out of this mess?",25Jul2020,1

883,"     So I am 20 years old, living with both my parents and 2 younger siblings. We’ve had this situation for a while now where one sibling (usually the youngest) starts messing with the other sibling (usually the middle child). It’s normal for us to mess with each other, normal sibling behavior. But you know how a sibling can do too much sometimes to where you get pissed and raise your voice to tell them to leave you alone? That’s also normal. What’s not normal is the youngest sibling still not listening, not matter who tells him to stop.
      As the oldest, I’ve felt that I’ve always had the responsibility to watch over my brothers. My dad said that when I was younger, I would take it too far and try to “parent” them. I’m like, ok, I don’t remember that, but I probably did. Now that I’m older, I don’t necessarily have to watch over them like I did when I was younger so I don’t have much of a responsibility like I used to so I try not to “parent” them anymore. Thing is, the youngest just doesn’t listen.
       The youngest is 14, middle is 15. If they start fighting or arguing or messing with each other, I usually say “leave him alone” “stop!” “Stop messing with him” “shut up,” “just go to your room and be quiet,” things like that. Besides that last one, I thought that those things were normal things to say as the oldest sibling, but apparently I’m still trying to be their “mom.” And I’m lowkey a little offended cuz the last thing I would ever wanna be is their mom.
       When they mess with each other, the youngest usually starts it by touching (poking the arm, hitting) the other, touching his butt, or talking when it’s obvious no one wants to talk to him. Normal sibling behavior, but he does all throughout the day, including morning and night. Imagine someone continuously bothering you even after you tell them to leave you alone, even after you yell at them. And you’re obviously serious yet this person keeps going. Idk bout anyone else, but I’d get stressed. And the middle sibling shares a room with the youngest so they’re around each other a lot. The middle doesn’t say much when he’s messed with, so I try to say something like leave him alone and all that stuff, but I’m getting tired of it.
      And me and the youngest get into these heated arguments every so often because I tell him to leave his brother alone and he doesn’t like that I’m the oldest sibling telling him what to do, but he won’t listen! I mentioned their ages earlier cuz I feel like they’re old enough to understand what stop and leave me alone means, especially when the person is obviously being serious. 
       So my question is, what should I do in these situations. I’m tired of getting told I’m trying to be their “mom.” My parents said that if they start fighting, to tell them what’s going on, but that means I’d be telling them all throughout the day, including mornings and nights. That means I’d most likely be waking them up just to tell them what my siblings are doing. But it pisses me off because I would be trying to sleep and they’re loud, and idk about anyone else, but hearing someone repeatedly say stop or leave me alone would drive me crazy. Do I just need to sit back and not say anything anymore? Or am I being too much? This quarantine is going to be going on for a little while longer so I’m stuck here for now and there’s not too many places I can go. 
       Sorry this was pretty long but I hope someone can help:)",25Jul2020,1

890,So when I was between the ages 10-13 I was experiencing with girls and not any of that ooou me and my best friend kissed. Like actually having sex with girls (only 2) But I still thought some boys were attractive. But I’ve only had sex with a guy once and we were both drunk so I don’t think it was that great.  But I find the idea of putting some guys dick in my mouth somewhat disgusting. But the idea of having sex with a guy sounds enjoyable (kinda). I always using “chicken” out when I get the chance too though. Like I always say no before anything happens.     And the thought of going down on a girl sounds hot. But I don’t get many chances as I do with guys.   And right now I’m in relationship with a guy. And honestly I do not wanna have sex with him at all.  But I do wanna be in a relationship with him.

893,"Obligatory notice, I'm writing from my phone. 

Alright guys. I know there's things that I need to improve on and I really just need direction. I've been in a relationship for two years. Lately my fiance has been getting really irritated and annoyed with me. It's made me pretty sad honestly. I've tried talking to him about it but to no avail. I've realized the problem probably lies within myself. Lately when we've been talking, before I get a chance to explain how I feel he calls me bratty or spoiled. I am aware that I do spend more money than he does, but I am working on building a comfortable home environment. Its always stuff for us. I always discuss any purchase with him before I make it. I also am the primary income. So I assume it has to he more attitude based? Sometimes ill ask him to do something and he'll say something along the lines of ""why?"" Or ""i don't wanna get up.""
So I'll just get up and do it myself, or if I asked him because it was hard for me to do ill just spend extra time trying to figure it out. I dont get upset with him for not doing it but he seems to think I do. Today he told me every time he says something, I always just do it myself. I told him I feel like that puts me in a really weird spot. How am I supposed to address it if he doesn't want to do it but he also doesn't want me to do it? 
He told me I develop a negative attitude when this happens. I've paid attention and of course there are times I get upset, but I can usually explain them. I feel as though he gets irritated with me for asking, and even more upset when I do it myself after asking.

894,"So long story short my dad wanted me to go to the beach with my aunt and so I said fine. He said we had to leave like at 12 or 1, but today my sister wakes me up at 10ish and says we have to leave to the beach now. I normally wake up around 12, so I was just so tired.

My sister told my dad I didn’t want to go it’s too early and my dad comes to my room starts pushes me while I’m sleeping, yelling a whole bunch of shit like at the top of his lungs (practically screaming), he starts throwing shit at me, I don’t even understand what’s happening, and then he snatches my phone and starts running off with it so I caught up to me and he starts pushing me and so I pushed him back, but then he just gave me my phone back.


And like as I type this out I don’t understand like when he’s in a bad mood or something he just goes off, and the history of my relationship with my dad has never been good.

Anyways, I’m not close with him, this kind of shit has happened before, and I’m 20 years old and over I’d say the last 2 years I’ve been really working on my childhood trauma and shit. This kind of triggered all these past feelings, and I felt like a flood of old emotions and I just hate it. I started to just revert back to old habits and I felt so helpless and angry that I’ve had to deal with this on so many levels throughout my life and I’m still working though the after effects of how my dad treats me.

And I can go on and on about how this shit is fucked and the dumb bullshit I have to deal with, but I hate how I just feel helpless and angry, and like it brought me back to my childhood, and made me realize like all the fucked up habits (self esteem issues, anxiety, etc) relate to these experiences, and is just overall sad how much my dads actions affect me negatively.

And the worst part is he went from screaming and threatening hell, to wanting to play wrestle and wanting to go get a smoothie. Like he thinks I’m just some dumb little kid and at least I have the fact that I can see through his bullshit. It’s just at its core manipulative and it’s some good cop, bad cop shit that when I was younger would fall for. 

I also smoked a bunch of weed after this happened just bc I just wanted to numb these feelings and not focus on them. It happened today and I’m just at the beach high af with my family members taking to me and shit.

895,"Hey Reddit, I’ve recently had a bit of an epiphany about my friend group and I’m seeking advice on what to do moving forward.

To give some context I’m 19 turning 20 in September and ai’ve been with this friend group since around the time I turned 16. In high school things were great, I was popular enough and had multiple circles, but was most active in the aforementioned one, they introduced me to many things such as D&amp;D, Debate and a girl I dated for nearly three years.

After high school things definitely got different though, and I suppose as much is expected we all went off to our own Universities, I went to a big uni near my home city and had a handful of people in the dame friend group stay in the nearby area (either attending the same uni, going to the community college or working.). 

Over these past few years I rarely get invited out for anything, it’s only scheduled D&amp;D, video games at night or rarely a dinner ever month or three. Last night I went to one such D&amp;D session and my ex GF was there, not participating but just hanging out (we had broken up roughly two and a half months ago) through just casual conversation I overheard as we played or hung out before we started, I picked up on the fact that she was hanging out with this group a-lot, which is fine. My Ex and I met through this social group, I’m not childish enough to push an ultimatum on them to choose one of us. But now ai’m realizing these people I was considered my closest friends only speak to me if we are going to play d&amp;d or occasionally video games, and I hadn’t been invited out for months leading up to quarantine.

I just don’t know what to do anymore guys, I feel so empty and betrayed, mad at myself even for just following this group blindly as I got little to nothing in return, I’ve helped house some of these people, picked them up when they were hours away when their car broke down and I cannot even be asked to hang out and watch a movie outside of D&amp;D? It’s ridiculous and makes me feel terrible. And I’m sorry for my rambling emotions are high right now but I just don’t know what to do, D&amp;D is very fun and It has brought much joy to my life, but I don’t know if I can continue to just be in the background or an afterthought in a group like this.

Regardless, thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read this, and if you have any advice or insights whatsoever please don’t be afraid to comment below.

896,"Class just ended and I was waiting for my father to pick me up when I got a text from my friend whom I was still in an unresolved fight with. She texted me that she's going to die from an overdose and that she loved me. When I got that text, my phone ran out of data and at first I thought I'd just wait until I got home but then I kept thinking that what if she's dead? I need to stop her. I was already starting to panic and couldn't breathe properly, so I ran to my friend with data and asked him if I could borrow his phone. 

I begged her through the chat to not do it and I thought she was going to commit suicide because of our fight. So I thought it was my fault and kept on apologizing but she wouldn't answer. I tried to call her multiple times too. Her account wasn't active so I thought she had already died, and it was also all my fault my best friend died. 

So I couldn't hold it in anymore and started breaking down in public, crying on the floor in front of my 2 worried friends. I even asked my other friend to try and contact her. Then she went active on messenger, but I thought it was her mom going through her phone until she finally replied after an hour of me flooding her messages and crying. 

She told me she was fine and she was just feeling depressed, and it wasn't because of me. While I was relieved, I was confused because I know calls still go through in messenger regardless of whether you're muted or not. And I just don't understand why she didn't answer the moment I started asking if she was fine. Ever since that incident things in our friendship haven't been the same.",25Jul2020,1
897,"I'm sure this is not uncommon considering the current state of the world.

I have always struggled with anxiety and depression. Earlier this year I got a new job in a new industry and it has been extremely challenging, but also rewarding. There are a lot of triggers at work for my anxiety, however, and the terrible things happening every day around the world, with no end in sight, have deeply affected me. I don't have the coping skills I need to be able to function and take care of myself, so I feel like all I can do right now is take some time off and get help. I tried doing both (working and getting help), but my anxiety has spiraled out of control and I don't feel like I can face my responsibilities anymore.

I'm in the USA and haven't work for my current employer for a year yet, so I don't qualify for FMLA. But there is the Americans with Disabilities Act, which I feel I definitely currently fall under, but I don't know if my employer has to abide by it if they would rather just cut me loose. I really don't want to lose this job because I'm so lucky to have it and it will help me down the road, but I'm also entirely consumed by my anxiety and depression to the point where I break down crying trying to imagine going back to work. The stress has become physically painful and I'm starting to worry about not only my mental but my physical health.

Is any job worth the daily mental and physical pain? I don't care about anything anymore and all I want is to care and feel like myself again. Am I taking the easy way out if I try to get leave? I know a lot of us are hurting right now, so it's hard to have perspective, but I truly feel that I have nothing left to keep me going. I'm not suicidal, but I feel utterly empty and hopeless.",25Jul2020,1
898,"Hello. I shall introduce myself - I am an 18 year old girl, who's friendless, hence the asking for advice here haha. I have relatively many siblings and a mom and a dad. I have questions I'd like advice from in the TLDR. This is just really extensive context. A tenth call to advice, 9/10ths rant, if you will.

They had an arranged marriage very young, both from really poor families. They immigrated to a first world country, my dad by boat, my mum by plane. When I see their wedding photos, I notice my dad is super skinny, and my mum is visibly uncomfortable. She said leaving her home made her cry so much, she didn't like my dad and didn't want to marry him. He was much too talkative and odd (?). She felt indebted to him because he basically got her into the country, so she stayed with him, and they ended up having me and my siblings. We were poor but growing up my mum buffered any sort of suffering from me, and she gave me a childhood I can look back at fondly. 

My mum is I'd say, ambitious and goal-oriented. She was always working, and having to mother several children, cook food for her husband early in the morning, and clean the house, but she still managed to budget for a new car. And when my younger sibling was born, she eventually got us a new home in an upper-middle class neighborhood. She always wanted the best for us, and values formal education so much. She's said she's envious of the educated women she knows, who have 'much more beautiful handwriting' than hers. She says educated people are just different. She left high school in grade 7, and apprenticed to become a seamstress in the city. That's led to more black and white thinking though, like study hard and get these grades, or what?- do you want to work in the farms? -kinda mentality towards me. But I understand she doesn't want me to suffer financially, so I am in college doing CS.

I don't have many memories with my parents very young, since they had to work a lot. But my dad was especially absent I'd say? He had a gambling addiction that brought my mum to the verge of divorce, but then my sibling was born, so she postponed the thought of it. Sometimes he'd provide none of his income towards living costs, and she'd have to work so much to make up for it. We're talking maybe over 150K idk, more, betting on horses religiously after work, over the course of 20+ years. I remember her taking me (I'm like 5-6 maybe?) with her to the centre some days, begging him to come home, but he wouldn't listen. Still, he was a loving dad to me, probably more so because I was his first daughter. He'd spoil me with sweets, and I'd occasionally get pocket money. He had the tendency to lash out though, like if I dropped a glass cup, he'd yell, or if I fell down, he'd be like, why did you do that. And when I'd cry, he'd say, 'stop crying!' which has made me uncomfortable crying in front of others, especially my siblings.

Ok, so we're moved in to the new house, I'm like 10. One day in the car on my way home from school, my mum asked, 'how would you feel if me and dad broke up?' and I said 'well, does dad want to break up too?' and her response is hazy, but I just shrugged my shoulders and said, 'I guess it'd be fine'. At the new house, my mum started working less, and assuming more of a stay at home mum position. She actually had postpartum depression, which I guess is just depression now, that she takes antidepressants for. After the birth of my sibling, she actually stayed at the hospital a bit longer, and I couldn't quite understand back then, it was just said that mum's not well. Later on I found out it was severe, to the point of not wanting to look at her newborn, having crazy thoughts like killing it. She came back home when she recovered I guess, a few weeks later.

Anyhow, frequently I'd come home from school to see rearranged furniture. Now I know it was because she was so bored at home. She'd always want to go shopping too, and gradually she'd be hanging out with her friends more. She always wanted to go out but my dad would never accompany her. Never. So she went out dancing on her own, and every week she'd dress up and look so excited, and she'd tell us she'd be back at x time. 

I don't remember exact details, but one day, I'm \~14, my mum and dad are arguing real hard. Yelling. I'm scared, my sibling and I are in our room, getting ready to sleep when we hear this. My sibling starts crying, and then I cry too. Suddenly mum's not home anymore. 

I wake up one day and see my siblings in the living room around my mum, she starts sobbing, explaining everything. She met another man, and dad was threatening her, so she couldn't be around the house. In fact, one time I had opened the garage to see a pile of her clothes with a note: 'kill yourself before I do'. My heart jolted. I had asked dad a bit later about it... damn I'm getting tired narrating my own story. Cheers if you've gotten this far.

He said that he wrote it in a way that was ambiguous, so that it couldn't be traced to him as a death threat. It was so weird how he explained it, I was so shocked. He became depressed, I wouldn't see him home actually. He'd eat crappy noodles every day, and drink a bit. He'd come home from work and lash out on me for small things, notably when he opened the fridge and saw two cans of dog food open, he'd yell, 'WHY ARE THERE TWO CANS IN THERE?!?! THERE'S ALREADY ONE, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT, YOU NEED TO BE MORE ATTENTIVE!' but that'd be the end of it. I'd go to my room and cry about it, thinking why did he have to be so mean to me. 

Every week, he would take me shopping for groceries. One time on the drive to the supermarket, he said that I looked too much like my mum, I remind him of her, and it gets me upset til this day. Sometimes he'd blame me for the divorce, or he'd say stuff like mum's boyfriend is manipulating her, that's why she's doing all this. So he painted her to be horrible, saying she didn't love me anymore, and it made me resent her. I am gullible and poorly enough, I was the messenger between them a lot of the times. So I was confused, my mum's saying this, and he's saying that. It made me depressed, and I coped by eating my feelings, listening to lofi music in the toilet and crying, and hanging out with my pets.

A year after this mess, I've gotten used to things a little, but then mum and dad decide to sell the house and split the money, and basically the siblings. I was gutted, and when we actually moved, I didn't get out the car, started crying uncontrollably. My mum just looked at me irritated, and told me to stop crying. She said, 'you're not a baby, are you a baby? Stop crying!' My dad made me believe she abandoned us, and suddenly she's taking me in and saying these things. I was seriously hurt, I never cried so hard since. I fell asleep crying, that's how much I cried XD.

The house I moved into was in a notoriously scary neighborhood, it just looked janky as. The house was  small and janky too. I hated my mum's boyfriend, just because I blamed him for all this, so I had to go and visit  my dad every weekend, for my sanity. My mum would be against it, saying we'd be a burden, but I had to go. Around this time, my dad and I were in the car driving somewhere and he told me to be careful around mum's boyfriend, because I am grown after all - you never know what he might do to you. This made me very uncomfortable around my mum's boyfriend, and I got a bit paranoid. I wanted a lock on my bedroom door and my mum got genuinely concerned. I guess now I perceive this to be a ploy from my dad.

Things started to get more relaxed, and comfortable. I go to my dad's house, mostly to hang out with my siblings, and I spend new years there. That morning I was walking their dog, and my dad was out gardening, and he said 'can you come over a little less often? Like once a month?'. I was shocked. I just said 'ok', and then balled my eyes out on my walk. 

That same year I was over his house again, and he lashed out again. He rambled a lot of things, but I know he said he wished I stopped coming over. I tried to keep it in, but as I was doing my homework, tears start welling up, and I sob. This validated his hatred for me, and in my head, how I was a burden.

Ok that's it. I have a better relationship with him, but we don't talk to each other unless I'm coming over to hang out with my siblings. And I don't know how to converse with him. He seems more at peace now, and he softened a lot after the death of his father. I had only seen my dad cry then, and when he explained the divorce, how the family was broken, things wouldn't be the same anymore. He's told me he can't trust any woman anymore, besides his mum. Not even his current girlfriend, who's really nice. Seems like he's run out of money to gamble, so that problem's eased up too.

I used to just glance at my parents' photos together and feel like crying, now not so much. But thinking about the divorce still hurts me, and I'm still affected by it. How do I get over it? Sometimes I think, 'my parent's divorce was so painful, so how bad would a breakup hurt?'. Sometimes I think about my first relationship, how I want it to be my only one. I never want to break up with someone if it hurts more than this. Is that too idealistic or can I make that happen? XD. 

Also I want a stronger relationship with my dad. I am conflicted, because I understand he hurt me because he was hurt, he's done cruel things, but I love him and I miss him. I just don't know how to rebuild things. I want him to have a stronger presence in my life. I wonder about your thoughts on this? And if I'll always have daddy issues, and how it'll affect my future love life.

While I'm here, my mum's boyfriend is unsurprisingly like my dad. He can be nice, but also mean. I don't know how to interpret it. They have a child together, so my mum must love him to some extent, I think. Before that my mum said they'd argue so much, she'd say she's gonna leave, but then they reconcile again. Which I've now identified to be unhealthy according to things I've read. It happened once during her pregnancy, again maybe twice after the birth.  But he can be so mean to my mum, like he has no tact. He'd raise his voice and argue about small shit. The volatility was uncomfortable for me. When they argue seriously, sometimes i see my mum crying and I get mad. I despise him for hurting my mum, I hate seeing her cry, cos she never does, so it means all the more. Or when he's clearly stressed, he'd yell at my baby sibling, tell it to stop crying. He stares at it scarily, and sometimes it just screams so bad, I feel bad for witnessing this and doing nothing about it. Mum says just to let him be, otherwise they'd argue, and I know that's iffy as. I don't know if he'll be more severe as my sibling gets older or what. Often though, I see him holding the baby and it looks like he loves my sibling. And he really wanted a baby too, he does care for and take care of it. He does make good food, and sometimes I see mum and him talking and bonding and they look happy. I think we are also a bit financially dependent on him, but I'd say he pays as much as he would if he rented out a room in the house. They've had fights about money too. So exhausting.

Thank you for reading this if you've read all this. I definitely looked at long posts and replies and wondered how the user even typed so much, but this alone is really cathartic. And I am quite ok so don't worry if you do XD.

TLDR; the questions i have are:

* how do i get over my parents' divorce? 
* can I get into a relationship and have it be my last or is that wayyy to idealised? Is there such thing as a soul mate?
* will I always have daddy issues? how will this affect my future relationships?
* Is my dad insinuating I could be raped by my mum's boyfriend something I should worry about? He said it still fresh from the divorce so I want to overlook it. He's only said it once but it has impacted me. This is just an addon, but I lowkey fear being raped when I'm out in public. That sounds really bad, but just when I'm outside walking alone, maybe at night, I get those underlying thoughts. Is that just me growing out of my naivety, growing healthy caution that all women experience? 
* how do i deal with my dad? I love him, but he's done and said some bad stuff. Even so I want to patch things up because I miss him. Is this right?
* What's up with my mum's boyfriend? He's rude and almost(?) verbally abusive to his own baby sometimes, but he also seems to bond with my mum sometimes and they seem to love each other. Is there even such thing as good or bad people? Maybe he's just on the further side of bad than good???

899,"So I'm finding it hard as of lately to devote and lose myself in the story, action, and fun of video games and tv shows. If I'm not working, taking care of chores and dog, I'm often mindlessly jumping between YouTube videos that are usually tech reviews or dumb guys trying dumb things, but I can't sit for a long time to watch or play something. I'm often in a haze or become annoyed that I'm not being pulled into the game or show like I once was. 

For context, I've gotten out of a serious relationship as of 3.5 weeks ago and even just before we officially separated and planned to move into separate spaces, I had spent 3 weeks not even touching my consoles or consuming any media other than mindlessly scrolling through Facebook and napping. 

So my question is how can I get back into the things I loved so much? Does anyone have any mindfulness exercises, things they tell themselves, or phases they utilize to prepare/psyche themselves up to get into those activities?",25Jul2020,1
900,"My grandmother is a toxic Christian (not all Christians are bad, but she is...). She disowned me when I started wearing ""boys clothes"" and got my hair cut short. I didn't even come out as gay (I'm bi) but she just assumed I was and disowned me. I've recently come to terms that I'm trans (Female to Male)  and I want to move in with my mom full time until I'm 18.  But I feel I should come out to my grandmother, because of me moving in with my mom. 

On the other side, if I stay 50/50, I'll need to come out to my (future?) stepfamily. I love them all as family and feel they might be able to get my father to be more understanding of me. Of course I won't need to come out to them if I move to my mom's 100%. What would be the best solution?

901,"Last week I (40F) was invited to a bachelorette party on 12/12/20 and a bridal shower on 12/19/20. A lot of advanced notice right? Here’s the thing, I don’t want to go to either. First of all, the person asking me is a coworker (CW) who considers us friends, but I consider her a friendly coworker, not a close friend. CW is the one hosting the parties for her own daughter. I know that’s not good etiquette, but I’m not going to be the one to tell her. I’ve met the daughter once for about 2 minutes. 

Anyway, I told her, You know those are the two weekends before Christmas? That’s a busy time. 

CW says, Well, you have advanced notice so you can’t say you’ll be busy. 

I told her, Actually I can because my brother is trying to visit in December. Due to the quarantine, he couldn’t visit in May like he planned. I already know that there are Christmas parties planned, kids’ parties, and family obligations. 
Info: He lives abroad so he was unable to visit before. CW knows this. 

CW says, Too bad. I told you first. You’re promised to me first. Just bring your family to the parties. 

WTH?  I obviously didn’t promise anything. I didn’t even say yes. I made excuses, and she’s still insisting that since she told me first, that I’m obligated to go.

How do I diplomatically tell her No, once and for all? I have to work with this woman, and I don’t want things to get awkward at work. 

I admit I’m feeling annoyed and resentful that she is putting me on the spot. Who plans a bridal shower the last weekend before Christmas? Am I being unrealistic and this is normal? I guess holidays are just sacred family time for me so I shouldn’t judge her based on my experience. 

Bottom line though, I don’t want to go so how do I nicely get out of it? Should I just wait until it’s closer to the party dates and then make my excuses? I don’t want to have her believe for over 4 months that I’m attending.",25Jul2020,1
902,"I'm reposting BC I used the wrong forum


Have I been raped? I let my friend's boyfriend go down on me, but I was very intoxicated, and as self deprecating as this sounds, my friend was sleeping nearby and I didn't want her awakened by me fighting her boyfriend off of me. When her boyfriend touched my genitals, I was unconscious. It started with a leg rub. I was massaging my ankle and leg since the XTC had them vibrating and cramping. He often flirts and bc of that I keep my distance, but XTC and he convinced me that that boundary was superficial. He said over and again, ""to just chill, no one is trying to fuck you,"" and laughed. He massaged like a sports trainer, and I relaxed. Not sensual. Thats when I lost a minute or a few minutes. I started going in and out of consciousness. Perhaps the excessive alcohol and lack of sleep - 3 days little sleep bc of through MDMA. We never have been physical, hugged or even had a moment. I am in a monogamous relationship. Hes met my partner. I really dont think I was passed out long. When I became fully aware, I was horrified and aroused at the same time. He was not massaging anymore. He was performing aggressive oral and fingering. As first it was like waking up with my partner. But it turned ugly for me once I was actually awake. Is it normal to still be turned on when sex is nonconsenting? He had started gently before painful overstimulation and toothy sucks . I pushed him away which only encouraged him, and I remember saying ouch bc it hurt. That pain was what moved me into reality. I dont remember it starting, but when he increased pressure and sucked hard, it was like a rake. Now I was up, but couldnt stop him easily. I pushed, he clamped down which hurt more. I tried to stand, he pulled me down taking my underwear and pinned me to the couch. I kept yanking back and telling him it hurt, stop. Ouch, stop. He ignored or missed it. I remember thinking my friend would be so hurt if I woke her up to this shitshow, and I shouldnt punch or yell bc that was overly dramatic and would make it worse. It couldnt have been worse. She woke up while I was trying to push his hands off, and immediately lost it. She forced him off bc he didnt want to stop. She literally pulled him away. I was too frozen to talk. I think I said I was wrong, and tried to escape while they argued. I was on MDMA, cannibus and had perhaps 5 or 6 shots of vodka drank quickly. I couldn't feel the alcohol bc of the MDMA, and I hadn't slept much in 3 days.  I never said no. There was some pleasure, and I was passive. Was this a rape? I know the boyfriend doesn't think so BC he told me that he thought I wanted it, and I didn't say No. He wasn't aware of the MDMA, just the alcohol. He said he was surprised by my openness, and had hoped for it. He is in love with me and my friend, and doesn't regret going down on me. He's upset I told him I felt violated, and apologized, but he said it was worth it. Since my friend demanded that he go, and I felt very guilty, I drove him back to his old place. He told me about his love and lack of remorse during that car ride. I tried to return home without him and he wouldn't leave the car. Finally I refused to drive and he got out. I feel upside down and unsafe at home now. I'm afraid to tell my boyfriend bc I don't want him to experience my suffering or feel helpless to protect me ( we are long distance). He gave me the pills, and we took them together. I was just coming down. I don't want the shared trauma in my relationship, and again, my boyfriend is in another state. I haven't spoken to my friend yet. She's just so hurt and angry. We had been friends for 5 years. The boyfriend was a one year relationship so far. I know I would have never reacted so passively and slowly without the high I was on, but I willingly took the drug mix. I didn't feel alarm bells when he touched me like I usually would have. We had never touched beyond high fives. I want to be buried. I feel depressed and used. Lost.",25Jul2020,1

911,"A few years back I fell into a Major Depression. I was suicidal, and hurting deeply. I don't know the extent of what my mother said to this side of the family about it. What they know, or the amount they chose to care. 

My grandmother had a stroke a few years back. And as her only daughter, my mother had to host her since. I am not ashamed of my grandmother and what happened to her. Saddened. But never ashamed. My mother has two brothers, G, who belittles her often. He has no money to speak of and he's like a teenager, despite being well on his fifties. He smokes weed like a rebellious child and probably has NPD.

The other, E, has become a money giver for the family, giving money for my grandmother. He and his wife criticize my mother often. He and my father had an argument years back, as my father puts it he found out through a mutual friend that my uncle badmouthed him often. 

That and the way my uncle responded to an asked favor of my father. Which is irrelevant and too private, related to another family member set them irrevocably apart. My uncle takes issue with my father's Inability to get a job despite my father's various attempts. My father is also a more present caregiver to my grandmother than her sons, G and E are. With my father looking after her after her stroke in the hospital while both my uncles were absent.

But to my mother 'E' does a lot for the family, so she often tries to please him. She speaks often of how well off they are. And they manipulate her, gaslighting her and eroding her self-esteem. They sometimes make her feel she's bad a mother to me, and my father has said to me my aunt has my mother trained. It's true that sometimes my mother will end up repeating my aunt's words. And it pisses me off.

Recently my aunt questioned me repeatedly what would I do if my mom died. My mother, in her early 50s does not have any reason to keel over dead just yet. And it was upsetting and very bothersome to try to get her to stop... so I know she can create and thrive on other people's stress.

When I was little I was humiliated by E, his wife and G, a lot as ""lessons"". Which of course left me a bitter taste. My cousins, their children, are three girls. And they always treat me as a bit of a pet. Once in a trip, I was little mind you, they would choose my clothes for me. And am a guy, fuck it! Now when I dress ""well"", they seem to take credit... despite the fact that I just throw whatever's clean on. They criticize my appearance often.

The work I have is demanding and very complicated. It is also a risk I choose to take, because I chose this over college. It is something ambitious, and my family on this side has made no secret on how little they believe of it. I tried to be less judgmental than them and accept their point of view. But their own attempts to destroy what I do and make me seem incompetent have been burning at my nerves. I studied psychology for six semesters before giving it up, and when it came time to do practices. I realized it wasn't for me.

I would say psychologists are crazy. In a good way. And that I wasn't crazy enough to be one. But, still I know how people manipulate others. I've seen it. And I won't let me be tied down and dominated by anyone.

That side of the family compare me often to my other uncle, G. Who is very rude. It drives me crazy... in fact, after today I have realized, by Introspection that I have failed to avoid manipulation as much as I'd like. I am compared a lot. It takes my identity and forces me to see myself in a less than flattering light. I am also mocked, but I swallow my words. I've failed to be less affected by them that I wanted.

Today my mother took me with her to my uncle's house. She had made no food for our own home. Because they invited her there... I wasn't happy with it. They don't let me work there. When I got my uncle immediately took a task for himself and wanted me to follow up, I complained to my mother. Told her I had work to do and that I couldn't just do as they wanted and that she knew... my mother tried to convince my uncle, low-key that she didn't need that done and that she wanted it done later. But E had made up his mind. My mom, picked up my backpack. With my computer in it. And put in her back as she moved my grandmother... I didn't think much of it, I was going with my uncle all over the city, probably coding in my phone the work I have to do so it made sense that she'd take that stuff up to his apartment.  I just thanked her... UNTIL she accidentally banged it against a wall. I begged her to be careful, that my laptop (all my work) was in there. My uncle got upset  asking why she was carrying it, that I was young and I didn't help at all.

But I've yet to see him lift his mother off the floor, or shower her. He thinks money is more than enough. My mother's back has been fragmented physically, her back is literally cracked, by lifting my grandmother when she fell, because I couldn't help enough while I was at college. 

I snapped and told him he is not my family, took my stuff, and then screamed at him that my family would know me and of my depression and he doesn't because he's not family. He just went up the elevator... I walked home, having decided that, they were no longer gonna be family. Now am concerned what kind of ammunition this will give them to use against my poor mother. Who stayed.

I suppose this is more of a rant than a question for advice. 

But I do have a question on whether to go from here. 

Part of me feels a bit more free. Standing up to the toxic family behavior. But I don't entirely know where I should stand in this... I don't have any friends as of now. Not here physically. And hence, no one to talk to.

I feel like this stress is really bothering me. And I want advice on where to proceed from here. I don't think I want a relationship with that family... I think, blood or not, that they have to earn me. But I also don't want to hurt my mother... who may be meak. But is also a kind woman. 

I certainly don't want to reflect either side of my family. And I would rather stride out on my own. 

So, what do I do know. What position do you suggest I take.",25Jul2020,1

915,"hey guys this is my first time posting on here so please be gentle aha 

so i’ve been dating my first ever girlfriend for almost a year now and honestly we haven’t done anything further for hand holding because i get VERY uncomfortable (keep in mind that we’re both pretty young like 14) 
i thought it was just a simple issue that i wasn’t ready yet until i realised that i’d be a lot more open to it if i were dating a guy and then came to the conclusion that i wish i were dating a guy. 
i’m definitely sure that i’m not bisexual because i had been thinking that for a while but now i’m sure that i have absolutely no interest in dating girls. 
the problem is deciding what to do from here on.. because i’m not sure if i’m ready to come out at all right now never mind to my current girlfriend. i know she’s been having an extremely tough time right now due to her mental health and i just can’t do that to her when she’s like this but at the same time i feel like an asshole for keeping it a secret. i’m also extremely worried about losing her as a friend because i do love her it’s just nothing romantic and i just don’t know what i’d do without her. 
please help",25Jul2020,1
916,"Since about 2 or 3 weeks ago a lot of the time when I am happy, angry or upset I feel the need to physically move, I don't have to but it makes me feel incredibly tense if I don't move in some degree. It tends to happen when either specific things are mentioned or when I have a lot of trouble expressing words (sometimes I feel like I have a physical block in my throat that prevents certain talk). Is this a bad thing?

I have 'twitched' for a couple years on and off, small things that I could kind of ignore but now my hands will shake pretty bad and my knees can jerk, I can also hit myself lightly on impulse or by accident or tap things. I also noticed I count a lot of things?? If I'm stressed or worried I'll tap each finger to the opposite one and other similar things like biting the skin around my nail on each side.

If I'm upset or tense I often jerk around a lot, it lasts between 20 seconds to 2 minutes or longer- should I be concerned about this? It feels better if I do it compared to if I don't, is this an abnormal thing? One of my friends used to 'twitch' like I did but they've never gotten like I have recently

Is this possibly a symptom of anxiety? I get quite short of breath at some things and it feels like pressure is being put on my heart/ lungs but I don't really move around when this happens, is it something different? I can't think of why I would do this at positive and negative emotions, is it something I should try to stop? Or tell someone about?",25Jul2020,1
917,"About a year ago, I cut out a toxic person (J). When I say toxic, we had lived together and during the course of our cohabitation they: moved in their partner without even telling me; left rubbish and rotting food in the fridge and around communal areas; brought up my triggers repeatedly (I had multiple conversations with them asking them not to and explaining why); along with gaslighting me whenever I raised an issue with any of these things and making drama when I tried to socialise out with J.

Due to us living together, we had a group of mutual friends. I lost contact with almost all of them when I cut out J, which I didn't mind at the time as my mental health was in such a bad place (low self esteem, not trusting my own perceptions, etc) through living with J that I just needed to do whatever was nessesary to be away from that toxicity. I also told the friends at the time but they didn't believe me, or said it couldn't be 'that bad' so I decided it was best just to politely decline invites to socialise. 

Now that some time has passed, I want to start reconnecting with the friends, but absolutely not J. My partner (S) also has mutual friends in that group (S really doesn't like J either due to J verbally abusing S numerous times &amp; seeing the impact J had on me). S is more keen to reconnect than me but isn't pressuring me too. We've both agreed that a solution without J being involved would be optimal. 

However, we can't think of a way to see our friends without J being part of the equation as they are a very close knit group who insist on doing things as a group. I'm also worried that trying to explain about living with J to the friends again after a year mia would create a bigger division but my wonderfully optimistic partner thinks the fact I've taken a step back for months might make them finally take it seriously. 

We'd tolerate being around J for bigger social events (e.g. a birthday party) but I'm definitely not the kind to want to politely sit and catch up with J. 

Any advice on how to connect with our friends from am outsiders perspective would be much appreciated as we're just too close to it to come up with a solution xx",25Jul2020,1

My dad walked in our room and was talking a bunch of stuff about how my mom should only work in the kitchen and mumbling some stuff. My dad then said something that made me not want to fall asleep. My dad basically said that he will kill us if we ever escape then walked out of the room. 

I think it took a while for me to fall asleep that night. I told my mom in the morning what my dad said last night and my brother agreed that he said those stuff. I don't know if he doesn't remember or he was telling a lie but he denied it. My mom believed us because she knew we wouldn't make up stuff like that. My mom said that he sometimes denies whatever he said for some reason and was like this after they lived together. 

Me and my dads relationship wasn't really great when I was younger then it turned a bit more sour when I found out he cheated on my my mom and I have a little sister (very nice person) and it has been turning more and more sour as I learn more of him and what he really is from my mom. I think right now I don't  really see him as a father anymore but it might be due to hormones (I learned of my sister in 5th grade and im now going to 8th grade).

928,"I am currently creating a storyline set in an alternate ww1. The story itself is affected by the violence, as its a fundamental part of the war. I just wonder if its worth going for uncensored.

As of now, I still depict violence: people getting shot, stabbed, strangled, blown to pieces, burned, gassed etc. My point is if detailing all of this would add value.

I dont want to go for cheap shock. I already go in detail if something important that affects a character happens, but perhaps it would be inconsistent for the book to have segments and segments.

So, what I mean by uncensoring doesnt mean full on gore. I dont think its necesarry. Rather, take the following passage:

A) He saw his body laying in the pool of mud. His soulless eyes watched the ground now soaked with blood. Alfred notices his notebook nearby. He goes on to pick it, but its interrupted by a furious artilery shell. He falls on his back, in a ditch.

After the wizzling noise in his ear is gone, he goes over the top to find emptiness:the notebook was all but shredded, with the fragile paper already soaking in the pool of dirt and human waste. His friends body, was nowhere to be seen.

B) He saw his body laying in a pool of mud, now combined with his blood, leaking from his wound. He steps on the mushy field, feeling the effect of the bombardment. At one point, Alfred touches something stiff. He dares not look down, for he knows its a bone. An adrenaline rush makes him go faster forward, as he feels movement below his feet and a hardly distincive cry. 

But as he gets closer to his buddy, he makes a mistake he instanly regrets: he had looked back. The man he stepped one was trying to crawl out of a communal grave, which the greyed uniforms masked. 

He checks on his friend. The notebook, in which he wrote all of the memories of the war, was open near his body, having fell after he dropped. A specific whoosing freezes Alfred, as he desperately seeks cover. In his instinct, he jumps in the grave over which he previously passed. As a last desperate resort for more safety, he drags a random body over him, but the painfull screaming of the earlier wounded indicates he caught on him. The next moment the shell hits furiously a few meters ahead of him, and mud, dirt, and human remains splatter above his head. The crying is no more.

Ending similar to choice A.

I might be a bit biased in this comparison, as it tends to show I put more effort in the second variant, but nothing is changed in the way I tackle it, the way I feel.

Objectively speaking, would it be a plus? Does it add any value, or the specifics might turn people away(money isnt the most important but still count).

So some back story. I (22F) came from a poor family which was rough at times with lots of arguing, alcohol abuse and a generally toxic environment. I must say though that I have no recollection of being physically hurt or abused and my parents were (and still are) lovely people despite their flaws.  

From the age of about 14, I've had a fascination with BDSM and I used to have tumblr. I would often spend hours scrolling through blogs looking at NSFW content that a 14 year old should definitely not be looking at. I'm not certain of whether rape fantasies are a part of BDSM but I did see this quite often and when I would see content of this sort, it would freak me out and I would get a deep sense of guilt and shame but I would also get a small flutter although I have to clarify that it did not fully turn me on.

Over the past 6 months I've had a weird feeling where I feel like my skin is crawling from the inside and I feel dirty and guilty and horrible thoughts (such as rape fantasies - me being raped) come and go. I have been sexually abused by a guy 2 years ago where he forced/pressured me into giving him oral as well as groping me and shaming me but this feels different to that and I feel like I have processed what happened to me when I was 20.

I don't know why this is happening to me and its really scaring me. I dont want to talk to anyone about it because it's such a strong accusation/statement to make and I can't think of anyone that has been in my life that would be capable of doing that to me but I can't shake the feeling.

931,"This is a throwaway account.

About ten days ago I met a girl from my same town online when we matched on a dating app. She is 19 years old, and I just turned 26 a couple weeks ago.  


We share a great many interests: we have the same niche taste in music, and both design clothes in our spare time (we have a similar, 'unorthodox' style of dress). We have other commonalities as well. We like the same old movies, the same TV shows, the same directors and the same comedians. Additionally-- and maybe this goes without saying-- I do find her to be attractive.   


We have been talking online for about a week and a half, and our conversation up until this point has been strictly topical. Not romantic. However, yesterday afternoon she asked me out on a date. I felt a bit uncertain because of our age gap, so I told a white lie, saying I was busy so as to decline politely.   


I know that 'on paper' a romantic relationship between us would be legal, and that 7 year age gaps between romantic partners are not unheard of, but I am worried that at our two ages a 7 year age disparity would be pronounced enough that us dating would be a shade unethical, or somehow manipulative, and, again, maybe this goes without saying, but I am not interested in any kind of relationship like that. Until now I have always dated partners that were my age plus or minus two years.   


Am I correct in my reservations, am I overreacting, or is the truth somewhere in between?  


Thanks in advance.

934,"So i yesterday I came out to my mom bc i felt pretty optimistic that day as for over the course of months this has been weighing heavly on my mind. Many times i wanted to tell her i never the courage too and always vaguely told her ""theres something i rly need to say but i cant"" and always backed out. I finally had the courage bc i am in the process of making changes in my life to better myself and hopefully my future so i figured this had to be aired out so i can feel free to pursue any relationajips i want. When i ask to talk to her i was stumbling alot to say it until she figured it out and guess. When i nodded it seemed she died inside. And kind of was freaking out but not at me. she was shock big time. HOWEVER..i didnt get to explain myself. That i am bi and I like both. She said we will talk about it soon (which the anxiety is too much to think about rn) and then i can explain myself better,  but i already know her thought process. Shes gonna say I am confused as she mentioned before and that its just bc I havent been in an intimate relationship with a girl. I never brought home anyone I dated but she know i dated a girl before. And i hinted i was intimate with a guy but i dont want to go into details with her of my history with others. She just doesnt understand its possible to like both and starts spewing the internet and my friends are convincing me i am when rly it was something i discovered myself. Her reaction was what I had expexted before my little optimism came about but i still wasnt prepared for. I didnt leave my room at all last night and today since she stepped out i took the time to brush up and shower and now just holing myself in my room. I feel more anxious more regretful and scared by the minute..I feel like my entire perception and life is possibly changed to where i cant go back.. maybe things might work out but now even if it does anything referencing something gay or so when she is around will make me feel uncomfortable. Shes about tradition and always rambled on about wanting granchildren and what sucks is i am an only child. Explaining to her im bi feels like shes gonna latch on hoping i will be with a girl and she will deny the pososbility of me being with another boy. Idk if i should even explain my preferences. As I like femboys and am one myself but i feel she would find that extra weird a feminine guy. I'm rly anxious can somebody walk me thru or any advice for when we rly sit down and talk. she seemd rly shocked and sad for the rest of last night. I just hope she keeps it between us for now though I don't thunk she did. She probably told her bf and me and him don't like each other at all. So to have someone u rly dislike know ur business rly upsets me bc i don't need another reason to be looked even more down on. Anyways thanks for reading all this and giving any advice!

943,"(Throw away because personal issue). This is a very long story, so I’m gonna shorten it up. My parents got divorced when I was 11, my dad immediately married another woman and got her pregnant. At this time, I was obviously younger and thought a lot more higher of my father. Well my dad turned out to be an asshat. He physically assaulted me and (I don’t know if this was his intent) could have killed me. He tried to suffocate me and then tried to strangle me (all the while my step mom was watching and even laughing at me). Even worse, my younger (full) sister was watching in horror. This was about a year ago and I am now 14. And before you ask, yes I did contact CPS. At this time my (half) baby sister was like 4 months old. Also my stepmom was drinking while breastfeeding so...

So CPS blew up in my face and failed me. And my dad, being the big brain he is, and get this, “Shocked and appalled by the things I have done.” I have literally done nothing to him. You may be wondering “What provoked that attack” well, he got drunk, started to twerk on me (yes I know) told me “I know this is what you wanna do to -Crushes Name- and wouldn’t stop when I repeatedly begged him to. So I did the only thing I could do. I kicked him off me. And that’s what got him mad. 😐 

Anyway, one day I was really missing my dad. I know I know, but I do crave a father figure sometimes. So I asked him if there was any way I could visit him again, because I stayed at my moms house for the past year. But he doesn’t like that. He believes that I targeted him, and I was the monster in the situation. And when he told me that I responded in a well mannered way. Then he refused to respond. So I sent him a message on what I think about him in a not so polite way. I wish I could share the texts with you, but I deleted the conversation from my phone. I do have screenshots, but I can’t attach them here. Regardless, later he told my sister that I am not allowed over his house ever again because I called him out on what he is. A manipulative, abusive, and alcoholic.

The thing is, I really love my sister. She is adorable and sweet and so so so smart. The last time I saw her in person was when she was about 5 months old. I hate watching other babies on YouTube age and know I’ll never be there to hit those milestones with her. I hate how she is walking now and Im not there to help her. She is about a year and two months right now. It’s really sad for me to see her on pictures but never able to interact with her. Especially when she lives in that crappy environment. I really don’t know what to do, and knowing I’ll never see her again, I think I need advice on how to deal with the “loss” of her.",25Jul2020,1
944,"(This is my first time posting on Reddit!)

I (25F) just left my job of 3 years, where the hours were long and there was frequent relocation. That combined with me being a very shy person resulted in not really getting to know anyone. I just moved back to the US (where I am from, and where I lived up to me getting my last job) and am living in a new place about to start a new job. This job won’t have travel and I see it as a great opportunity to try to get to know some people in this area.

My new home is in a suburban area and I don’t know anyone here. I don’t have social media and I don’t have anyone’s contact information except for my parents. Before my last job I had to cut contact with the people I knew because of a safety issue (which is also the reason I am not on social media and have a minimal digital footprint). I don’t feel comfortable trying to find or reach out to any of them.

I wouldn’t call myself a bored or depressed person, I find things to do on my own and honestly would be ok if I never made friends again. However I do feel lonely and would prefer having some people, besides my parents, in my life! Has anyone been in this situation before and found a way to turn it around? What is your story? Do you recommend any books or online courses that have specific advice or help improve social skills?

I see a lot of replies along the lines of “meet people through a hobby”, if someone has experience with this can you please be specific about which hobby and how you were able to do this? I like going to spin/dance/etc classes (before covid!) and I would try to make conversation with the other people I regularly see in the class. They would be polite but turn away quickly, like they’re not interested in talking. I don’t know if it’s not a good environment to meet people or if I am doing something wrong. (I’m pretty out of shape and maybe they noticed me struggle in the class and felt awkward about it? Maybe I shouldn’t try fitness communities until I make a bit more progress on my own fitness..)

Please let me know what you think and thank you in advance!",25Jul2020,1

947,"not entirely sure how reddit works, but i posted a comment on here awhile ago about a situation with my ex that's happened a couple weeks ago, i think if you read that this one will make more sense?
anyways, my long distance ex boyfriend, after ive blocked him on everything basically, is still stalking me even though ive made it clear *politely* that i dont want to be friends/have anything to do w him. because ever since ive broken up with him, hes just been so rude, disrespectful and gross towards me. well he doesent like that i dont wanna be friends with him or have him in my life anymore. so he messaged one of my friends yesterday going into detail about what we did together privately(sexually), also calling me a h*e, calling my friend the n word and a d*rty mexican,(my ex is white fyi), called me a liar and low life, basically making up some lies and throwing that in there too, my friend sent me screenshots of what he said about me so thats how i found out. i unblocked my ex, and called him straight away going off on him and he starts crying and shit saying hes sorry and will leave me alone for the rest of my life now, but i honestly dont know what to do now. im so embarrassed that he would even tell my friends what we did in private when i NEVER did anything like that to him, because i know that's wrong and disgusting to do. i just need advice, anything at all :(",25Jul2020,1
948,"I've had conversations with my mother where she would try explaining the lyrics/storyline of some old Korean ballad that she's playing through her phone speakers (she's from Korea and I was born in the states/don't speak Korean well) and she would try to explain the song by saying ""Okay, so imagine I was your girlfriend and you were my boyfriend, . . . .""     
She's done this on at least three occasions.  

When I'm sitting next to my mom, she sometimes just puts her hand on my forearm and says things like ""your arms have grown a lot of hair"" (rough translation from Korean).  She says the same things about my legs and whatnot.  

Sometimes if I'm doing something in a room, my mom will just look at me across the room smiling, without saying anything.  I sometimes ask her why she's looking at me and she just says, still smiling and not breaking eye contact, ""just because.""  It used to not really bother me much before, but nowadays it just makes my skin kind of crawl.   

When I was younger, my mom would **occasionally ask me to show her my penis** (in a joking but not joking way).  This would continue until I was around late elementary school, where as I got older I often would refuse.  I don't ever recall her touching me.

I wouldn't consider my mom a helicopter parent, but she'd make me give my friends' phone numbers to her and always make me call her once I got to a friend's place or if I was changing locations with my friend group etc.  

Also, I dont' know if I'm just getting all in my head, but I also feel as though she talks to me like I'm a baby sometimes when we have one on one conversations.    
Me:  ""This soup is pretty good, mom.""  
Mom:  ""Do you like spicy foods, /u/wassertrinket?""

 I feel this tone/response is kind of stupid because yes of course I like spicy foods, we're Korean, and this isn't the first time you've asked this.  She has mentioned a few times through the years how she longs for the days when I was a ""cute little baby,"" and I wonder if this is some fantasy she's sort of role playing in real-time.  

Aside from these things, my mother is a wonderful person who's supported me emotionally, going to college, etc.  It's just that when I take a step back, some things just seem a bit weird.  I've wondered if my social ineptitude is the result of these things.  Is my mom weird?  Is this just some cultural difference thing?  Any and all responses are appreciated, thanks.",25Jul2020,1

951,"Hi

I've been sick for over 6 months, starting at the beginning of 2020. I'm making this post to seek advice on how to move forward and how to get better.

Before I get into the illness, I need to clarify something which I believe to be important. In December, I decided I would try to grow mushrooms in my place. I'm fairly educated on the process now, but at the time I made a mistake. At the start of a grow, one needs to sterilize some grain in order to grow the mushrooms. Grain is food, and if it is contaminated by bacterial or fungus, can grow some bad stuff. I, naively, opened some contaminated grain jars to be reused for a future grow, however I breathed in the putrid fumes coming out of the contaminated jars. This did gave me a sinus infection which was treated within the month of it happening via antibiotics.

Now to the next/current incidence which started occuring in February of 2020. Initially, I had a swollen right testicle and sharp abdominal pain. The area near my groin felt very strange, I wouldn't say it hurt, but it made me walk differently which was very unsettling to me. I went to an urgent care facility and they diagnosed me with epididymitis, took a blood and urine test, and gave me an antibiotic shot as well as some pills to take. I finished the course of the antibiotics and my symptoms began to improve until about two weeks later when my abdominal pain resurfaced, as well as some sharp flank pain in my back sides. They didn't let up and I began to speculate the possibilities (tapeworms, GI Virus, STD, etc) and I scheduled an appointment with my PCP. He took a stool test for parasites, a blood test, and a urine test. He also ordered for a complete abdominal ultrasound. All tests came back normal, except the ultrasound showed some slight kidney inflammation. At this point, my symptoms persisted but more showed up. The pain began moving up my abdomen to my stomach area and I started getting nauseous, as well as excess flatulence, way more than before. My testicle was not as swollen as before, but it still hurt sometimes and it felt like there was some pain inside my rectum (Prostate maybe). I didn't think the symptoms were related though, so I thought it would make sense to knock them out one at a time, starting with the digestive stuff. My PCP stated that he believed it to be a GI Virus that would improve in about one month. If symptoms still persisted, he advised to see a Gastroenterologist.

 In mid April, I became very anxious and fearful and I had an anxiety attack for the first time in my life. I didn't know what to do so I drove to the emergency room. I explained to them everything that had/was happening. They did a CT Scan, a urine test, and another abdominal ultrasound to check my kidneys. The three tests came back normal. The doctor diagnosed me with having some intestinal cramping as well as excess acid in the stomach and prescribed me with Dicylcomine for the cramping, some nausea medicine, and some acid reducer. I took these medications for a week and a half with no improvements besides the decreased nausea. At this point, my symptoms began having fluctuating periods of activity. For four days, I would feel fine, and then the next six I would have various symptoms in certain areas. A new symptom emerged at night when I would sleep. Whenever I would turn my body a certain way, I would feel a certain tightness in my chest, perhaps in my esophagus. It really only seemed to bother me at night when I slept, and this started happening before I went to the ER which is why the doctor believed I had excess acid. At this point I decided it was time to see a Gastroenterologist. I visited one in early May and told my story to him up to this point. His plan of action was to test for a couple possible explanations (Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis) and if those came up negative to just try antibiotics. I went in and did the lab tests, they came back negative. I then took the recommended probiotics for two and a half weeks out of the total four, and I stopped because it didn't seem like my symptoms had changed at all. I then had a follow up appointment with the Gastroenterologist at the beginning of June to talk about how I was doing. I told him I stopped the probiotics because they weren't helping. He suggested three courses of action. 1 we do nothing and monitor what's going on 2 I take more smooth muscle relaxants as needed or 3 I get and endoscopy. At the time I accepted option 2 as it seemed my symptoms were getting better on their own and I might've finally been on the mend. My testicle was still hurting on and off, but nothing too bad and I did tell this to the GI doc. He advised me to talk to my PCP about that. I scheduled an appointment with my PCP and some new symptom began occuring. I was having some sharp chest pains on my left side and then on my right side, and I kept having this foul taste in the back of my throat. This was concerning because then I started to think ""maybe I have an invasive fungal infection which spread through my GI tract to my lungs/heart"". My kidneys were hurting a bit too, more than before. When I did see my PCP, I told him of my new symptoms as well as the ones which persisted and he suggested I see a urologist for the testicle and did some XRays for my chest and sinuses (some infections can cause drainage and results in the foul taste). At this point, I thought ""if all these symptoms are caused from the same thing, maybe it would shed some light if I got an Endocsopy"", thinking to the possibility of a fungal infection. I just got my Endoscopy done on the 21st and everything came up normal. The doctor did take some biopsies for analysis which will be available on the 4th of August.

Current Symptoms: Nausea, Foul Taste in throat, Drainage in throat, Slight Anxiety, Bloated feeling in chest (esophagus perhaps), slight tingle/pain underneath pubic bone.

Further thoughts. I do think it's possible that I got Covid and that caused the chest pains and foul taste. I haven't had any breathing problems or fevers so I don't conclusively believe I got Covid. Since the endoscopy showed that everything looked normal, I'm inferring that a fungal infection is not likely as it would've been visibly apparent I think. I do think it's an eccentric case, and it freaks me out that the doctors still don't know what's going on. The fact that it seems so uncommon points me to the contaminated grain jars that I breathed in. In the mushroom growing community, this is a big no no, which sucks that I learned this after the fact. I have been considering the thought that I could not wake up in the morning after going to sleep. I'm not used to being in a position like this as I've pretty much known what was going on my entire life. It's made me anxious and slightly depressed, but I know that my headspace will get better once this stuff is resolved. 

Advice. Currently the plan is to wait until the biopsy results come back and await instruction from the Gastroenterologist. Before the endoscopy, my mom did discuss seeing a Doctor of Internal Medicine. What do you suggest? What do you speculate could be going on? If you read all of this, I sincerely appreciate your generosity and kindness.",25Jul2020,1
952,"I 22F haven’t gone for a proper walk in days. I haven’t showered in days. I have a faint memory of enjoying things when I was in high school but doing those things does nothing for me anymore. I’m on anti depressants, anti anxiety medication, and using a medication to help quit smoking. I have a therapist and I feel like I lie to her by continually telling her things are generally good. When I talk to her I forget the days I spent on the couch, and focus on finding the “right answer.” I know everything I’m doing is because I’m depressed and anxious about everything. But the more I know about depression and anxiety, the more I get bogged down by it. I’m also incredibly self conscious and have bad self esteem (I’m trying to lose weight and it’s going slowly). I drink too much and eat too much. I feel like there’s a way to be depressed in a “cute” way and I’m not “doing it right.” I know that’s insane. I feel so hopeless alone all day during these beautiful summer days while my extremely loving, caring, funny boyfriend 32M still has work. He is so positive and active and has never experienced depression. I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I’m desperate for advice. I feel like a failure all day and I sleep all afternoon so I don’t have to think about it. I try to talk to my friends/bf/family about it but no one has it this way and they keep telling me to just go for a walk but I can’t get out of the house and I don’t know why. It’s only been this way since my unemployment began (March) and I realized I haven’t had time to myself (aka unemployment) since I was 15. Any advice on taking the first step towards feeling okay about myself would mean so, so much to me. Also, side note... I’m terrible at “self positive talk”. I never believe myself saying nice things to myself. I don’t know how to move in any direction with all these frustrating mental blocks.

953,"Things have been tense in my house for the past few days. My family has been trying to sell our house before we have to leave because I start school in August, and my mom has been freaking out. When she gets flustered, she gets annoyed, and when she’s annoyed, she gets angry, and when she’s angry, she yells. She takes her anger out on everyone, and we’re (my sisters, dad and I) all sick of it. The last straw was today.
It was my sister (3)’s high school graduation today. And, we had a house showing right before, so my mom was going crazy cleaning. Through all of the chaos, my mom and dad started fighting. I’m not really sure what about, but it made my mom pretty mad. This fight led to a 10 min screaming match between my my mom, dad, and oldest sisters (1 &amp; 2). 

It was about how my mom was treating all of us. She was acting like we weren’t helping her clean the house, when we were. She was acting as if the house looked disgusting, when it looked fine. We had been deep cleaning it everyday for weeks because of the showings we had. She was acting as if this showing was more important than the fact that her daughter was graduating from high school today. She legit said “Today’s not about 3, it’s about the house.” 3 was crying because they were all fighting, and made this morning awful for her.

Through all the craziness, 3 early for the graduation on her own, I went w/ 1 &amp; 2, and my parents went separately in their own cars. 

My mom didn’t even sit with us at the graduation ceremony, and then we had the most awkward post-ceremony pictures. Upon getting food and getting home, I knew what was waiting for all of us once we got home, 5 private talks from our mom, one for each of us. It’s what she does every time we all fight.

The thing is, in mine, she refused to apologize for this morning, even though it was all her fault. I told her how I felt about this morning. How I felt about seeing them all screaming at each other, but she wouldn’t listen, and told me to not get into grown up business. I told her that if that was the case, and that if I’d have to see her and my dad fight for the next 4 years, I’d interpret it anyway I wanted, and could side with whoever I thought was right. 

She took this as me “hating” her for some reason and now we aren’t talking. 

But, this Thursday, she and I are traveling together (ik ik graveling during the pandemic is bad but we’re going to look at my new school), and I really don’t want to have to go through that with us fighting. 

How can I make amends, without excusing her behavior, making it worse, and getting through to her.",25Jul2020,1

This is in a small city in Texas.

My house was raided a year and a half ago. They found 3.5 oz of weed and 2 half gram vape cartridges. They took 17k in cash took my phone too. They said I sold to a snitch. Idk who it was cuz I only fucked with a few people I think someone got pulled over and fucked me to get out of it.   The lead cop was douche of the year. He told me that if I got a lawyer it would make it worse and that i wouldn't need one. There were like 5 cops total. They were low key and were  gone really fast. The whole thing took like an hour. A couple weeks later I got a summons over the money but never showed up to it.

Fast forward today I got a love letter from the D.A. saying that I forfeited the money for not showing up to it. But I've never heard another word about the weed the carts or from any cops or anything.

957,"So a couple of months ago, I matched with girl on tinder, we are both in our early 20s. We went on quite a few dates, and we clicked instantly personality wise. Despite that, nothing ever happened physically between us. She also goes to school in a different city and didn’t want a relationship (partially due to the distance). Last week we texted and she said she didn’t want to do whatever we were doing anymore. I told her the reason I hadn’t made a move was because I wasn’t sure if she liked me in the same way that I liked her, and that I genuinely enjoyed spending time with her so much that I didn’t want to risk making her uncomfortable. This was true however I do regret not making a move as this could potentially have played out differently. She said she does like me and there is feelings there but she wasn’t in the headspace for anything at the moment. She suggested being friends to which I initially declined and we said all the best etc and I assumed that was that. We ended up continuing to talk because it was clear both of us didn’t want to stop spending time with the other. So now we are friends. I told her I wasn’t trying to change her mind about a relationship by being her friend and hoping she would change her mind. This is and was 100% true. I just weighed up the fact that I’d rather be her friend than lose her completely, because in the short time we’ve known eachother spending time with her (even platonically) has made me feel so much better. 

My issue here is, I really really like this girl. Of course she must know this considering it’s only been a week since we discussed just being friends. We hung out as friends yesterday for a few hours, and although I loved spending time with her, I know these feelings aren’t gonna go away if we remain just friends. 

I’m really not sure what to do, the thought of losing her completely makes me feel like shit, because I don’t really consider most of my friends to be close friends, yet I could talk to her about things that I wouldn’t talk to my other friends about even though I have known them for years.

I know for sure I am not telling her how I feel yet, because we are only hanging out once more before she leaves for a month or so. We’ve spent so much time talking in the last couple of months, and she is just perfect. Everything she does makes me smile, every time her name pops up on my phone I smile, and I just don’t know if I could go on indefinitely just being friends. If I was able to lose my feelings for her it would be fine, but being honest, I don’t want to lose the feelings I have for her. I know at some point I will tell her, I just don’t know when. To be honest this is more of me just getting this off my chest rather than asking for advice, but I just needed to write this out to clear my head.",25Jul2020,1

964,"My friend called me tonight and I was really confused, because we haven't spoken since lockdown began. She was with another of my friends and they told me some really dark stuff.

The friend in question- F

The friend who left- R

The Friends who called me- E and N

The other friend I have- D

For context, we have been in a close friend group with a kinda unstable person for about four years now. At the start of our friendship, F actively hurt the guys in our group and manipulated us all, eventually leading to three of us (myself and R included) getting really messed up over it, our parents and school involved and F was told to stay away from us. A few months went by and R suddenly left the group. R and I were really close, and I was really confused and concerned when they suddenly ditched us. Around that time, F slowly started joining our friend group again. The others seemed to trust F again, but I was always wary. Other than a few weird episodes and suspicious things happening (I suspected F of threatening R into leaving, because they treated R the worst out of all of us and R was genuinely terrified of F), everything seemed fine. There were rumours that F had raped his girlfriend (who was two years younger), but the charges were dropped very quickly and F convinced the rest of us that it was their girlfriend's friends who had made the claims, not her. 

Fast forward to tonight. Two hours ago, my E called me and when I picked up, asked if I was alone. I was, and they and N went on to explain that the ex girlfriend was raped, and they have screenshots of F threatening her at another point in their relationship. The two also explain that F threatened her into dropping charges, and has been going behind my back, telling my friends lies about me and in return telling me lies about them, to the point that I have only F and D left as friends, the other all grouping together and forming their own group (without R), basically isolating me from my friends. Everything suddenly started to make sense; almost all of the guys I've been close to or dated (including R) have left the group, seemingly for no reason. F had an open crush on me for a while, but I had assumed that crush was now long dead. My old friends all came together, after F had convinced me they all hated me, and were genuinely concerned for my safety and wanted to make sure I was okay. I still have another friend I am close to, D, and they don't know about any of this yet. 

This wouldn't be so bad, except me and F are going to college together in a month, just the two of us. My friends are scared that they are going to try and hurt me somehow, and now I am too. At this point neither of us can change colleges and I can't talk to F about it because they have no idea their ex has said anything, and I don't want to put anyone in danger. I feel paranoid, I'm terrified that F is going to try and do something to me, and I'm scared of what they will do to others if I say anything.

965,"Hi, this situation is actually about my SIL, not myself. She's prone to making on-the-fly decisions very quickly in response to crappy situations instead of sitting put and riding it out. She joined the military straight out of HS, then moved in with her dad, then moved to a national park, then moved back home, then moved in with a new out-of-state boyfriend forever away. Within months, she fell pregnant, and they decided to keep and raise the baby. I advised her not to, but once she had made the decision for herself I relented and said nothing else.  

   

  

She hasn't been working since, and especially with Covid-19 and no nearby support network she has been with the baby nonstop since she was born (not even three months ago), and as with many parents of newborn babies, the stress is starting to get to her. Her boyfriend works, and comes home to game the rest of his time away, then works, etc. No matter how she tries to get him to give her some time off, he isn't getting it. I don't know that he is ready for this, nevermind the fact that collectively they were not ready - she hasn't even had time to stand up on her own two feet as an adult yet!  Beyond that, they lived together in their apartment with his mother, who I have heard is not pleasant

   

   

Now today she is asking ""hypothetical"" questions about what if she needed to move back home, like if she would be welcome here or if we'd be open to getting a bigger place at some point...I don't really want to move, but I don't think there's space in my apartment for her and a baby. My younger sister is living with me herself, as she has come out of high school not ready to start life yet either. I don't know what to tell SIL beyond I can't support her, and to not make rash decisions right now. I know motherhood is hard, and she is learning that the hard way (while she learns LTRs can be a struggle too). What do I say? What do I do? What options are even available to her at this point?  



 **TLDR Flighty SIL prone to making quick decisions kind of rushed into an out-of-state relationship, got pregnant quickly, and kept the child. Her SO isn't pulling his weight, she has been stuck at home with baby nonstop because COVID, and now she's having doubts about their relationship (she's talking ultimatums). She seems to want to lean on me for support but I have no idea what to tell her, and I don't have the resources to do anything. What do I say/do?**",25Jul2020,1
967,"I know the title sounds bad, but just hear me out. I (18F) dated a guy a couple of months back. We had been talking for a week, but we really clicked and started dating really soon(dated after talking for 1 week soon). He told me about his ex, and I had a gut feeling that he still wasn't over her, but I chose to ignore it since our mutual friends convinced me he's done with her. After about 2 weeks of talking, he broke up with me when he realized that he still felt for her, which is actually a good move and I can't blame him for this.

Fast forward to a few days back, when he texted me that he missed me and wants me back. Now, I know I shouldn't have even considered talking to him, but he was really good to me while we were dating, and I somehow had a feeling that if the ex shit wouldn't have happened, we would have lasted for a long time. He told me how his ex lost feelings for him 5 months back, and after a while he didn't feel for her either, but they are best friends now, which bothers me a bit but is not a deal breaker for me. I think that his ex is really toxic for him, but she is important to him and I don't want to rip him off a good friend. Anyways, he's been trying really hard to prove to me that he is all in, and I believe him but I'm really scared to get back with him for obvious reasons. I doubt him that maybe he is just with me because he got dumped, but we live almost 2000kms apart, and he says that if I wasn't sure that I wanted to be with you, I wouldn't even consider long distance. 

Any advice on what I should do on this? I'm really confused and need a non-biased opinion.",25Jul2020,1

970,"I’m a 21F and I was good acquaintances with M21 for our freshman and sophomore years in uni. Junior year i transferred schools we kept in touch (an occasional meme or text but just very causal), until one day i messaged him because i saw something that really reminded me of him and we ended up talking nonstop. Eventually we were video calling everyday, texting/snapping all the time, hung out a few times irl before quarantine really hit in March. By May we had kinda developed little crushes on each other and had talked about waiting to properly go on a date in person after quarantine lifted (in my country quarantine is now ‘over’ and bars/restaurants are open) which i was perfectly okay with, because while we did know each other from classes and stuff we never really hung out or talked too much while i still went to the same university as him and i wanted to see him more in person before fully committing to a relationship. June and now July come around and he’s become distance (he’s been swamped with work). I understand being busy but he’s put a lot of distance between us. I barely get messages now we haven’t video chatted in a long time and it kinda hurts my heart because i really do like him a lot. I’ve brought up my want to talk more like we used to but he always says he’s super busy with work or tired from his long hours (7am-4/5pm) but even on his days off he’s still a little distant and even goes out to have a beer with some mutual friends. 
I know he’s busy and completely understand being busy, exhausted, and wanting time to oneself to decompress (he’s fairly introverted and I’m fairly extroverted) but i can’t help but feel like he doesn’t like me the way i like him anymore. I still want to remain good friends but I’m not sure how to do so while trying to get over my crush.

To sum up the situation, I (18F) had a few cases of sleeping with strangers I've met through the internet. My mom learned about this. We are very close and when she asked outright I couldn't tell her a lie.

I got some advice to just behave like normal, that I'm already an adult and I'm bound to make mistakes.

Thing is, both me and my mom are very emotional. In addition, I have been diagnosed with depression (and have suspected BPD) and, even though I don't have any confirmation my mom suffers from anxiety (she takes meds for it). We also both tend to overthink stuff and overly care about things that are important to us.

It's almost 1am atm and an hour ago I went to kitchen to see my mom having an anxiety/panic attack. She told me she's terrified. She doesn't know what to do.

And I don't know either. I'm just 18 for fucks sake.

She also said that she's terrified I'd do that stuff again. For her it's as if I was selling my body. And she knows that for me it's not a big deal, that's what makes her so terrified.

Either of us don't have anyone to talk to about this. I used to go to therapy but it got cancelled because I no longer qualified for it.

I advised my mom to call a support line to talk about it. Though it might've seemed hypocritical coming from me because I've been declining doing that.

As I said in my previous post, I don't know how to act around her. Acting as if nothing has happened helped only for a while until mom mom got an opportunity to think about it more. Then it all went to shit again. Please help.",25Jul2020,1
973,"howdy, folks. 

I (24m) just moved into an attic apartment (my first one bedroom!) in upstate NY, near Woodstock. My apartment is a little sketchy (kitchen sink in the bathroom, steep stairs, a little bit of spackle needed) but for the most part very nice. It's a great deal that I got from a friend of a family friend, 750/mo all utilities included, and I'm very happy and grateful. 

That said, I'm a night owl. I'm a writer artist and musician and I do most of my creative work in the wee hours of the morning (12am-4am) because what the circadian rhythm wants the circadian rhythm gets. When I moved in my landlord told me to use his brother (my downstairz neighbor)'s wifi instead of getting my own and gave me the password. I've been here a little over a week and I'm very happy but I've noticed that the wifi goes out every night at 1AM like clockwork and doesn't turn back on until 9am. 

Today I texted my landlord to ask about it and he put me through to his brother's wife who also lives downstairs. I asked her about the outages (and offered to send her some money for the bill each month) and she said that she turns the wifi off every night at 1AM and declined my offer for help with the bill. She didn't give me a reason why she turns it off but because of my proximity to Woodstock it's a safe bet that she thinks 5g is giving her cancer. I was warned by my parents before I moved into this place that the people who live here are very nice but also somewhat crazy, so I'm hesitant to push the issue with her because I don't want to end up alienating my neighbors, especially considering she's my landlord's sister-in-law. I want to ask my landlord if we can install wifi in the attic just for me, but I'm concerned that he'll want to know why I'm not just working it out with her. 

I know this seems like a silly problem but I'm a high functioning autistic with a lot of anxiety and what with the pandemic and the housing market where it is I really don't want to mess anything up with this apartment. There is no coaxial hookup in the attic, and I've tried looking into alternative wifi options but google has not been helpful. Any advice?",25Jul2020,1
974,"I apologize, this is a super complicated issue for me, so this will be very long winded.
I’m a 20 year old young man in college. My girlfriend is 21 and she has a lot of mental health challenges, including ED and OCD. Dating someone like this presents extra challenges, but our relationship hasn’t wavered in the 1.5 years we’re been together.
At the beginning of the spring 2019 semester, I moved in with one of my really good friends-who also happens to be my best friends girlfriend- and her two twin brothers. She was 18, they were 20. There was some roommate drama because the two 20 year olds acted like children, but that’s not super important.
Toward the middle of our lease, really the beginning of the spring 2020 semester, the girl started being rude and disrespectful to all 3 of us. We were getting tired of it, especially considering all of us had talked to her about certain behaviors before. But even that’s not the super important part.
The super important part is that she’s bad for my girlfriends mental health. She consistently comments about her body and food intake, which is a mean thing to do in general but to someone with anorexia it’s NOT good at all. My girlfriend also came to my apartment while I wasn’t there, and asked for my roommates help because she was feeling like self-harming, and possibly taking that further. My roommate said “I won’t be out to talk to you, I’ll just stay in my room”. 
I’ve completely stopped talking to her, and have urged my girlfriend to do the same. The girl has now taken it upon herself to block me on everything, and getting her family for doing the same. Her boyfriend has been acting odd to me lately as well, and there’s now tension whenever she’s brought up because some our mutual friends don’t want to drop her because she hasn’t don’t anything bad to THEM; but I refuse to put me and my girlfriend in a situation where we could be disrespected/triggered/etc. 

AITA?

TL;DR One of my friends of almost 4 years now thinks I’m a bad person because I’m cutting her out of my and my girlfriends life for being rude and triggering.

976,"Yesterday during dinner my sister made a joke about sending money to a friend. My parents got all mad, not seeing she was joking, and she quickly reacts with a “well it’s my money, so can’t I do what I want with it?” My mom goes on about how all her money comes from people who worked hard for it (you heard it here folks, you can’t spend birthday/holiday money because you didn’t work for it). Now I have a job, and I work hard. So to make my sister feel better after getting yelled at, I said “hey, I have money I worked hard for! That means I can send the money.” Obviously, still joking because I don’t have a credit card or PayPal or anything. Then a whole argument starts. I say that it was just a joke, and they need to calm down because it’s not our fault they have no sense of humor. Then my dad try’s to pull a “we’ll just turn off the WiFi for 2 weeks” in an attempt to be funny since our joke was of “sensitive topics.” So I told him that there’s a difference between a threat and a joke. Now he pulls the same card he pull everyday when he sees me just sitting around all depressed. “Why are you like this, why aren’t you your normal bubbly self.” Then a nice added “I don’t know where all this attitude came from, but you need to stop talking back miss.” Then thing is, he never talks to me. I only see him during dinner, and he always tells me to shut up and eat. So of course you haven’t realize, but I’m a depressed teenager who’s going through hard times right now. I don’t know how my futures gonna look because you people are kinda ruining it. So I told him that I’ll just never talk to him then since he doesn’t wanna hear me speak. Now I love my parents, except they’re kinda really bad parents. But that’s another story. I don’t wanna ignore them forever because like, that’s annoying, but I don’t wanna be seen like my older sister. She would cause and throw tantrums. Slam doors and scream at people. I’ve never done that. I’ve always tried to be respectable, but when your not treated me like a human, then I’m not treating you like a human. My mom told me I should just apologize to my dad because he’s having a hard time with my grandma, but that doesn’t give him a right to be rude to me. Like I know he’s the adult, but I should have the freedom to speak my mind, and be upset when it’s a situation where I should obviously be upset. I don’t wanna say I’m sorry for talking about a sensitive subject especially when I know what he’s dealing with a lot from grandma (my mom told me to tell him this) because that’s just and unfair statement that makes it seem like he’s the only one stressed out in this house (I’m doing online college prep classes this month, and I have adhd and have gotten no help from them), and it also gives him the satisfaction of “being right,” because right after he’ll just act as if he didn’t say anything to me. He’s done it before. He used to scream and yell at my sister for the littlest things and even flipped a chair I was in because I was crying because I didn’t feel good (I had a fever, he knew, and I was also 4 or 5 at the time), and claims im making it up, but everyone claimed they remember it well until recently when he brought up how I keep lying about to people, then my mom takes his side for it and my sister just doesn’t remember anything at all from any time. This is really long, I’m really upset about this still, but I hate awkward silence. I just wanna cry and I’m done with this whole thing.

977,"About 2.5 years ago I commissioned a local fabricator to make 3 sets of shelves. Price was negotiated 7k for all 3 ($1600 for one, $4400 for the other 2 ). I paid $4k up front.

I became friendly with this fabricator 'F', who is a man approx 20 years my junior, and later with his wife 'W' who has since had their first child. There is no sex or romance scandal in this story, just FYI.

About a year ago, I was having lunch with W and she confided in me that she felt she had been tricked into marrying F, that his personality changed drastically when they married.  She described controlling and obsessively jealous behaviour, and some violence. She has no idea how much money they have, he regularly looks through her phone/texts, and has essentially isolated her so that she is now practically friendless. W is extremely attractive (underwear model level), and F is very insecure as a result. I advised her to seek counseling, but I doubt she has. W told me that she has had to get on F's case often to finish my shelves, as he was not working on them. I suspect F knows about W and I's conversation as 'lunch' turned out to be a nearly 6 hour event, and W was very upset by the time we parted company. I also gave her a sizable check in the event of an emergency,  cashing it conditional on her seeking professional counseling (She has not cashed it). I suspect F knows about that. Before this, F and I often texted about our mutual interests, and I have spent several days in his shop working on these shelves, and he's taught me a few things. We genuinely liked each other, and W has confirmed that he used to speak favorably about me.  Since W confided her marital woes to me, we have not discussed it. I do not mention F or my shelves to her ever (he reads her texts), but we text often. 

Back to the shelves....I neglected to get a completion date as part of our contract. After 2 years, I started asking if there was a problem, and if F ever answered my texts, the response was either one word, or unlikely excuses as to why the shelves aren't complete.  I finally pinned him down to give me a completion date, and we settled on April 1 2020. In April, I received the first set, and I'm very happy with it. It is now almost August, and upon request,  he sent me a photo  of 2 nearly complete shelves. I sent a text requesting completion date, and he has not responded...again. I wonder if he is goading me in a passive aggressive way so I'll tell him to forget about the shelves, and he'll just keep the $2k that he would owe me. It's too small an amount to sue over, but I have reached the limit of my patience. 

A small, not very nice part of me wants to wait for him to complete the shelves, and then just refuse to pay him the balance. Of course, he would keep the shelves, and the 2k he rightfully owes me. I'm angry enough about this that I wonder if I'm going to be pissed every time I look at them anyways. I'm reluctant to do this as W and their baby will have to contend with the fallout as well. I don't know...

981,"**tl;dr**: I don't identify with my ethnic name, want to change it after i graduate but family disapproves.

This has been on my mind for quite some time...

So basically I have an ethnic name which purely for this post will be ""Namakaeha Momoa"". (Mine is even more difficult to pronounce).

Anyways my mother is a very cultural person and named myself and my siblings distinctive ethnic names, my father was indifferent to the names.

Throughout my life there has not been a single person able to pronounce my ethnic name correctly who has not been from the very culture from which the name comes from. And this culture is a very small percentage and not popular globally so basically almost everyone i meet cant pronounce my name. 

So I usually go by my last name ""Momoa"" as its easier to pronounce.

The problem comes in now that im older, and about to graduate from university, I want to change my name so that it will not hold me back from anything in life. (jobs, relationships etc.) And in the business world people usually are using their full names.

On top of that i personally do not agree with my culture in a religious sense so whenever i meet someone from my ethnic-religion it causes confusion because they treat me as if I am part of the religion because of my name but I really don't identify with it. ( imagine being called Mohammed while you identify as Mormon, it just causes too much confusion and you have to explain to everyone ""yes my name is Muhammed but im mormon lol). 

So yeah, i would prefer if I were to be called ""Jason Momoa"" and live happily ever after, i have brought this up slightly with my mother and siblings but they see it as being a traitor to my ethnicity and wanting to be more western (even though I only want to change my first name). The ironic part is my mother has a western name.

So yeah how should i approach being called ""Jason Momoa""",25Jul2020,1

987,"Last week my best friend of 7 years flew down (she used to live local) so we could have a girls weekend before my wedding (kind of like a bachelorette, but just the two of us due to covid). 

We got a hotel room for two nights together. She was supposed to pay for one night, but didn’t and I wound up paying almost $600. However, in all fairness she did pay for all of our meals except one, all of the bachelorette favors, a mani and pedi, and drinks over the weekend. 

During the weekend, she kept wanting to invite over friends I didn’t know to the point I was getting really frustrated. I didn’t get why she couldn’t have fun with just me and this is something she always does when she visits and it drives me nuts. She also kept snapchatting everything and I felt like she was taking photos of us that only made her look good and then posting them. I don’t have any social media though so maybe I’m biased, but it seemed like she was on it 24/7. 

Anyways, she then wound up inviting over some guy friend of hers while we were out and about only to get upset because he wasn’t going to buy her drinks and had us ditch him. The next night she dragged me out on the town despite me not wanting to go (I was worried about COVID and not really into drinking) and she got drunk and started a huge fight with me when I wanted to leave. She basically yelled about how I was acting like a loser and then she ran off for several hours leaving me alone. She finally showed back up to the hotel room around 5am and continued arguing with me before we both gave up and just went to sleep. 

The rest of the weekend and during my wedding she was great and part of me feels like maybe I’m being a bit dramatic, but I just don’t want to keep being friends with her now.

&amp;#x200B;

Several months ago my old chemistry teacher got my phone number and messaged me saying: “let me know if you have an interest in our addvertising, marketing and online accounts”. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had no idea what he was talking about. So I politely asked him to clarify what he meant. He than said “That is a very good question. The goal would be to promote our renewable energy services and products. Pellet stoves, solar lights, fireplace doors. But i think we would have great success with solar. I have a catalog for one of our product lines. If you are interested. We would also be able to offer paid training through...“. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know why he asked me,because the last time I had talked to him was 6 YEARS ago. In high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt weird but my parents encouraged me to have a sit down chat with him to discuss the possibility of working for him on this “project”. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I had a sit down conversation with him and this is how it went: he showed up looking like he just woke up after being stuck in a Well for three days. I asked him a few questions and immediately I could tell he had no set plan for this project and it was just an idea he’s had in his head for a very long time. He said he had some people he talked to about it that he thought would be a good crew. I asked him if they had agreed to his proposal and found out they had not. I also asked him why did he consider me, to which he said that he thought we connected well in high school (we did not. He was a chaperone for a club I conducted but we did not connect that much at all). So I told him I would think about it. He then asked me if I wanted to see this solar panel in his car. I said okay without thinking. But we were in a public area so that was good. He then he showed me how to put it together (in the parking lot). I felt really awkward because it didn’t look complicated. He then said I could take it home with me and I told him that was okay. Then he left. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn’t reach out to him for a long time and then he texted me, and instead of asking what my thoughts were, he acted as though I was already on board with his project. I then asked for clarification (again) about what he meant in his text training and other things. He replied, not answering my question, and said that he thought it would be best if we visited the company he texted me about. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I feel like I’ve been dragged aboard this idea without even being asked if I would like to join.

990,"Hi. My mom recently asked me to find the measurement of the old fence in our backyard, so she knows how much new fence she should order. She told me to write it down on a piece of paper. I agreed to do it. I went outside to find the measurements, memorized it, and went inside to tell my mom. 

I told my mom the measurement. But she asked, ""You didn't write it down?"" I replied that I memorized and thought it'd be easier to just tell her right away so she can figure it out. Now she was a bit aggravated before then, and apparently me not following the latter half of her instruction correctly was the tipping point of her anger.

She gave me a lecture telling me that when it was rude of me asking why. That when I go into the workplace, when I'm given an order, I should just follow the order and not ask why. I was told the exact same thing by one of my previous bosses. In my opinion, I just hate that rule. I don't want to mindlessly follow orders without understanding the reasoning behind it. I want to know why the order was given. If my alternative solution (in this case, me just telling her straight up without writing it down) was wrong, I would be happy to admit that I was wrong. I just want to understand why. I don't want to be a mindless employee. I think many don't want to either.

My ask for help would be **how to ask why in the nicest way possible.** How would one do that? And, should people really not ask why when given commands? Thank you all in advance.",25Jul2020,1
991,"Hi there. I'm nearly 18 years old, headed to college. Ever since I've graduated I have felt like something is missing... my family. For the vast majority of my 18 years of life, I was mentally and emotionally abused by my immediate family as I began to open up about my sexuality (Homosexual). I was depressed, anxious, suicidal, and every plea for help was ignored by my mother; I think she ignores the reality of mental illness. Anyways, when I was 14 years old in Nashville, TN, I attempted suicide as my bucket of water overflowed and I couldn't contain it all anymore. I was hospitalized for 11 days and made the executive decision to move away to live with my grandmother, father's mom, in Monterey, CA. Over the past  3 1/2 years, I've lived here, I have had quarrel after quarrel and at this point, my immediate family believes I have been brainwashed and manipulated to believe a false narrative...the narrative I constructed...my story. The last time I talked to my mother and four immediate siblings was this past Thanksgiving and it ended with me balling my eyes out in front of my aunt, uncle, grandmother, father, and half-sisters. Only two of my four siblings talked to me and the other two refused to speak with me out of spite and hatred against me. The narrative my mother constructed for my siblings is that my grandmother and father have filled my heads with lies and false memories to make her look like a bad parent (she is) and I don't know what to do. I miss my siblings. My sister told me she has no respect for me, brother hates me, stepfather never reaches out, and my mother's side of my family despises me for trying to ""ruin"" my mother's reputation.

I don't know how to rebuild this bridge.

tl;dr my immediate family hates me for leaving them after attempting suicide.",25Jul2020,1
992,"Title sounds awful, but please read. 

I’ve been friends with this person for close to 3 years, and they helped me get through some of the toughest moments in my life. When we first met we instantly hit things off, we never had problems and would always have each other to fall back on for help.

Around a year ago, things started to crack. We would fight constantly and block each other all the time, but we could never let each other go. It would happen almost every month and... it was just horrible. 

It got to the point where we wanted to hurt the other person and blame them for all our problems, when really it was both of ours. I never did quite get out of that rough spot in my life, and this just made any progress vanish instantly. Me and my friend have very toxic families to deal with along with this shit.

During these fights, whenever we each showed signs of leaving the other, my friend would instantly get suicidal and tell me how they were going to do it. My friend doesn’t realize it, but this upsets me greatly. I’d tell them I would never leave them, we’d take a break and things would be back to normal...

I know this isn’t healthy looking back, but at the time I didn’t know how to handle it; I still don’t know how to handle it. If the other person refuses to listen to your pleas, what more can you do? They kept expecting me to give them some kind of answer but I never could. I’m just as drained as them, just because I don’t outwardly declare my suicide does not mean I am okay in the slightest.

Then my friend started mixing in guilt along with everything else. They’d say things like “I don’t have any friends who care” “no one loves/cares about me” “you never try anyway, there’s no point”. It makes me mad, sad, basically every bad emotion you can think of. I’m so so tired of it, of me, of them, of everything.

And now today. Another fight, suicidal acts, etc etc. I got tired of talking and I just blocked them and told them to stop talking. I don’t know what to do now. They haven’t responded since. I don’t know what to do, but I know that I can’t move past this shit if I’m still friends with them. I know they aren’t using this as an excuse but it is so draining to have to deal with everything and pretend it’s fine when it’s not. Please help me.",25Jul2020,1
993,"Over the past 2 weeks I fell pretty hard for a girl I knew online but lived in another country. It was a hard oneitis(intense attraction that consumes you) Yet the past week we had communication issues and it burned so hard that I had to force myself to move on but I found out it wasn’t that she didn’t want to talk to me, and the reasons for communicating issues were valid (I even had them verified myself from a 3rd party and find them to be accurate) but now I think I may have lost all feelings because of how much I had to force myself to move on even if she is really interested in talking to me (our conversations get really flirty sometimes). 

At the loss of this attraction I realized that I never “loved” anyone in my life, not even my family unless they were in pain than I maybe had some sympathy. One of my best friends died a while back and I felt nothing. My sister had a window fall on her hand and she recurved stictches and I didn’t really care, my mom cut herself deep with a knife onetime and was gushing blood and we had to call an ambulance but again I thought “ehh she’ll get over it no big deal” and went on with my business.

This might be because I have moved over 29 times in my 25 year life and so I never once kept friends for longer than a year before I was forced to move on and start again, never forming long term bonds. I’m realizing iv never felt love or care for anyone and at a whim will let anyone walk out of my life because I have no emotional attachments. Also the fact that my dad never let me see friends until I was an adult probably didn’t help either as he had this “us vs them” attitude.
I really don’t think I can ever get married either because of this.

And it’s such a shame because this girl I mentioned may have the sweetest, and bubbliest personality I have ever seen, and I have met many people, but I just can’t stop feeling indifferent towards her like I do to everyone else in my life now and am loosing motivations to even speak with her after the intense attraction was gone. This is how I lost every friend, My mind wants to get with her or at the very least remain friends but a big part of me feels nothing towards anyone including her.

What do I do? Am I forced to live without ever feeling anything for someone? My mom wants me to see a therapist. I am thinking about it but I need any advice I can get.",25Jul2020,1

996,"So about three years ago I started drinking energy drinks. It used to be just one a week or so if I felt too tired during class, but then I got used to the fact that if I slept less I could compensate with a Monster can or a 5-hour energy and I'd be good to go. That's when I started drinking at least an energy drink per day (I say at least because then I discovered pre-workouts for the gym and that's a whole different story).

All in all, I've been drinking a can of energy drinks or more a day for about two years (I occasionally tried to stop, but I could never go more than a couple days). It has gotten to the point where I legitimately cannot go through the day if I don't get an energy drink, but now even when I drink one I'm tired ALL day. It's gotten unbearable, I can't do any meaningful work after 11 am because I'll be really tired.

I really want to stop, but I don't know how! I really can't even start my day without my energy drink because I just feel terrible. 

I'm asking for advice because I am also worried. I know I could try to just drink a little less over time, but there's been a few occasions where I've felt mild tingly sensations on my arms (with regular energy drinks, not pre-workouts) and others where I've felt my heart skipping a beat.

I've read these kinds of drinks can cause high blood pressure and I'm really scared to continue drinking them, I'm 20 and don't want to be facing these health problems so young! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

when we have talked about it before he’s said he has no expectations, doing it with a friend is almost ideal, and he knows the first time isnt the best, but i still would like him to enjoy it and himself regardless of his expectations.

We discussed habits like how often we drink, smoke, have people over, etc. She said she rarely has people over and I'm the same as I don't know many people here, and she never mentioned smoking. She doesn't have a lot of things for the apt, I brought things not really knowing what roommates usually share.

It's been a couple days of living there and her boyfriend literally has not left. He's there even when she isn't. She let me know a few days before we moved in (which didn't help) that she smokes but only does it in her room. I don't really care occasional smoking but there's literally plates of weed in the living room, at the kitchen table...the place reeeeeks of weed. I'm only in my room all the time because her and her bf are always in the living room.

She also is using every single thing I brought (even washcloths and my towels) and I'm now regretting bringing anything I'm not prepared to get ruined.

1011,"Hello there. I (18 F) talked about this situation quite a lot on this sub, but let me summarize it:
Last year, my friends introduced me to this friend of theirs, that used to be close to them but separated from them when he got expelled from school (18 M) (at the time we were both 17). Lets call him James. James flirted with me all night long. He told me how he’d never met a girl like me, we talked about things we both liked, made me laugh, he played with my hair, and rest his head on my stomach while we were looking at the stars. Then, out of nowhere, he stopped talking to me. I think this was when my friends told him I’m bisexual. A few months passed by and we met again, he barely talked to me. Then, another time we met, he didn’t even look my way. 

Btw, he still talked to us on Messenger, so he made a lot of jokes about how I’m bisexual, an angry feminist, etc, etc.
Last December, I held a small gathering at my house. Not only he was rude to me (he told me my room was weird because of my decorations, he threw up on my bathroom). 
He was the last one to go, and I accompanied him to his Uber. There were some men who were catcalling me, so he walked me back to my house, and hugged me. 
Again, this didn’t mean anything cause he was being mean again. So I called him out, and then took a break from social media.
We hung out again, in January. He’d apologized (only because our friends told him to). And, I was the one that talked to him in the first place, cause he wouldn’t even look my way. 
I told him it was okay, just as long as he didn’t joke about me anymore. 
That same day, my friend (lets call her Jenny) announced that she was dating James. (She started dating him even before he apologized to me)
Then, the jokes started again, and I told him to please stop. He told me to “go and fuck myself”.
In all caps. Then blocked me. I had to talk to my friends to beg James if he could unblock me. Then he did. Then I told him what he said wasn’t right, and that it’s best if we stop talking to each other. He said okay.

Ever since that fight, I’ve told my friends, both in person and on messenger about how I feel betrayed by them that they didn’t defend me, and that how Jenny took his side over mine when she started dating him. They’ve all told me “what do you want me to do?” “Are we supposed to pick sides?” “That’s just how he is”.
During quarantine, I’ve talked to them about it twice, and Jenny said she was going to take a break from social media, because she felt tired of this discussion.

And I’m tired too. I want to keep my friends, and it’s my fault that I still can’t get over James. Cause I think I like him, but I’m not entirely sure.
I just want us to be normal again. I’m thinking we could both (just James and me) talk about it, and fix our issues. Or I don’t know what to do.
What should I do?

i was sat with my whole family and they said nothing so i just said to him ‘wow thanks dad this is a great time to bring this up, and is really great for my self esteem’ and just held back the tears.

i think what’s the worst is we were in such and nice place and it’s been tainted by him pointing out something embarrassing and that i can’t stop... also they don’t even look that bad at the moment, i’ve been working really hard to let them heal. i’m frustrated and angry... even though it’s such a small thing.

i don’t want to bring it up again, it will just end up being super passive aggressive, i just wish he’d apologise and realise this is not ok. we’re also on holiday and i don’t want to ruin it with an argument, and we’re staying in a caravan so i can’t really escape him if we have one. it’s a big old mess and i’m feeling shitty over it- also he bites his nails and smoked for 35 years so he’s not one to call out a ‘disgusting’ habit.",25Jul2020,1

He used to be a policeman and seems to consider himself a bit of an 'expert' on cars, anyways he just starts completely shitting on the car saying how I'm gonna get pulled over loads and starts saying how it looks like it could've been in an accident and legit asked me to pop the bonnet (hood) so he could look for damage to which I just came up with an excuse about it being broken and you can't open it.

I found it all really rude and insulting, as he didn't have a single nice thing to say about it, secondly basically implying that I don't know anything about cars and thirdly as I was obviously very happy and excited about it but he felt the need to bring me down a peg or two, its not like he was buying it I don't see why he needed to go round it like that, he could've just said like 'nice I like the colour' and that would've done.

My friend apologised profusely and even bought me lunch to make up for it, he also texted his mum saying how much it had upset me and she sent a message back apologising for both of them.

However I've never been very good when people are mean to me and it gave me this feeling in the bottom of my stomach which almost feels like being nervous idk it's the same feeling I'd get if someone at school ever made fun of me. 

Since it happened I keep thinking about the situation and getting the same feeling and I can't seem to shake it off, some parts of the day I'm like I don't care at all but then like when I'm lying in bed trying to get to sleep I'll get the feeling again, and the fact I'm feeling the feeling makes me feel bad as well.


It's stupid cause I don't really care what he thinks, I've had loads of people tell me the car is cool af and he's a dick for saying what he did and whenever I drive it I absolutely love it  but the negative feeling sticks with me and it's legit been like 3 weeks and I still keep thinking about it and feeling this way. In a way I don't feel the negative feeling about what he said I have it about how it made me feel. I think by thinking about the feeling as well it's making it a bigger deal which is making it harder to shake off if that makes sense.

So I would like some advice on how to just basically let it go, I'm sure as time goes on I'll eventually stop caring but atm it's still effecting me. I would also like some advice on how to not really care what people say or think, cause I can logically think why it doesn't matter but I can't put it into practice.



Anyways thanks a bunch for reading and I really appreciate any advice.",25Jul2020,1
1018,"TL;DR at the bottom.

Yesterday I (19F) had a date with a man (21M) that I had been talking to him for somewhat over a month. I really liked him A LOT—which is rare for me—so I was over the moon when he said yes when I asked him out and ended up spending hours telling my friends how strong my good feeling about him was. 

Anyway, we agreed on going to a place he suggested downtown that he was more familair with. When the day came I had asked him if he could pick me up from the train station because there was a chance of rain and I didn't have an umbrella (mom lost hers so she took mine w/her to work) and it would easier to find each other outside of the station than at the park. He had agreed but after a couple of minutes of walking he said it was farther than he thought. I sent a joke and followed-up with saying that I could start walking in his direction if that helped.

Silence on his end.

Maybe 10 miniutes later he texted that it was disrespectful of me to not meet him at the place that I had picked for the date (which I didn't) and expect him to come pick me up (although he said would); so he opted to ""end this right now."" I again asked him for his location to see if I could meet him halfway since Google Maps had sorely underestimated the length of the walk (9 mins, but at that point it was over 20 mins). No response. So I apologized again and took the hint and let him know I was just gonna go home.

Que hours of waterworks and stress. That evening, I sent a long apology recognizing and taking responsibility for the impact of my actions and for not preparing an umbrella the night before, asking him to come get me instead of walking there myself, and just ruining the date entirely. I sent him money to cover the cost of his commute as well. Today I sent a text just asking him to say something but at this point I really doubt I'll get a response.

I spoke with some friends about this whole thing and it helped me calm down... until now. I feel like moist, flaming hot shit (crying, overheating, and just feeling bad about what I did) again. I don't want to burden my friends with redundance, so my question is what are some ways that I can handle my anxiety from this on my own?

TL;DR: I (19F) ruined a date by asking him (21M) to come pick me up from the train station instead of meeting him at a place we agreed to meet. It's been tearing me apart over the last few hours and I want to know how can I manage the anxiety associated with this w/o relying completely on my friends.",25Jul2020,1
1019,"I live in that one famous city where some riots are happening and people are being pulled off the street. I don't want to post the name of the city so people can't search it. I feel as thought my summer and my youth is being wasted. I'm 28 and haven't been on a date in years.  


I have to wear a mask if I go anywhere, and even then, it's risky to even do things like go to the grocery store. I've been exercising but there's a limit to how much I can push my body, and so today is a ""rest day"".  


On top of all this, I haven't started my job. We're still closed, and I'm wondering if I should just go search for a new one. It seems like the rest of the world has opened up already and I'm being lazy. Traffic is still going all day, the supermarket is always full of people. No one is social distancing, though everyone is wearing a mask.  


I'm sick of being in the house, but my only options appear to involve drinking, or staying inside. Bars are open, but places like pools are not. I don't have a car so I can't just drive to a river or a beach or something. The only things I can do are walk around the block, drink and play video games.  


So I guess I need some advice. Should I be working? Should I be staying inside? Should I be looking for some outdoor activity? It seems like no one is taking the situation seriously and I'm train.",25Jul2020,1
1020,"I'm 13 years old, i have just discovered many pages in my dad's search history mostly around hentai haven and a lot of lolicon hentai. This isn't the first time this has happened either, a year ago I found folders full of porn again mostly being lolicon hentai but he soon deleted it. I don't know what I should do about it.",25Jul2020,1

1023,"Hey everyone reading this, I need an advice. I am a 20 something female. A guy that I barely know (and he barely knows me) told me that he was interested in me. We were just random acquaintances with never having had a very personal chat or anything. I told him very politely that I wasn't. He was heartbroken apparently and kept writing sad things on his social networking account for days. Due to this fact I felt really guilty as I thought I hadn't clarified the reason I declined his advances so I messaged him after a few days clarifying my position. I don't know if he read that message or not and he hasn't responded to it either. It was a polite message apologising for not feeling the same way about him. He still seems pretty sad on his social networking profile, being either sad of absent from it. I do not have any such interest in him but I feel really guilty and terrible for breaking someone's heart and disturbing their peace of mind but I can't do anything differently than what I did because I am genuinely not interested in him. Anyway, I just want to know if I should message him again to ask him if he has read my message etc. I just wanted to put his mind at rest that he wasn't ""rejected"" by someone for ""not being good enough""..which was the reason for my first message to him. With no response to that, I am still left feeling guilty. So should I make sure he read that message by messaging him again? Or should I just let it go? It's been a month.",25Jul2020,1
