I bought many books and tests but during day i'm always saying myself that i will study after blah blah but that after never comes. I also go to a prep school and they gave me amount of tests that i must solve. I always leave it to the last minute and when i start doing it i look for the answers online and just write them. I mean nobody noticed it but i know and even though i don't like it i keep doing it. I cant go outside because of covid, there isn't anything important for me to do at home and i literally have the whole day free but i still keep doing it.",16Dec2020,1
1," 5 years ago I met this guy through Instagram, he is thousands of miles away, so we never met in person, he said he’d help me improve my English since he was a native speaker and im not. We talked and played games together almost everyday and after few months I felt a deep connection between us, it was crazy how we matched so well in everything and we never ran out of things to talk, id stay up so late to talk to him and sometimes he’d do it since we have 9 hours and half time difference. I loved spending my time with him (there was nothing romantic till here) and id spend my time and talk to him in every chance I got. my (ex) boyfriend didn’t like this, he said I was too into him and he is not like my other guy friends and its not a normal online friendship, and he was right, I was too into him that when my bf said I have to choose one between him and the internet friend (after many argues), I chose my internet friend, cuz I felt like I feel myself more when I talked to him than when I talked to my bf! After a few months more (second year) I could easily feel that I had a huge crush on him, but I didn’t have the guts to tell him how I really felt, I knew he really loved me too, he talked to many hot Instagram models but still would spend most of his time with me but still I didn’t want to ruin our perfect friendship and I knew that there is nothing he can do about it like even if he suggested a LDR, I knew i couldn’t do it, first he was so handsome and he could date literally any girl he wanted while I am not that beautiful and beside that, I thought the idea of a LDR is like dating a ghost and its kinda childish since I didn’t think we’d meet anytime soon, so why would he date a ghost while he could date the best girl in their state. So I kept it to myself for another year, after this one year, we were so intimate that we both knew we love each other more than just friends, but there was nothing we could do. we got closer and closer day by day till he started dating his high school crush, we would still talk but it was so limited, we couldn’t spend time as much as before or we couldn’t do the things we did together anymore, we just talked about our day and sometimes played games together… but in that time, I realized how much dependent I was and I felt bad and weak for this fact, like I had many other friends, irl or online but whenever I was upset about something, he was the only one that could say something that would calm me down because it was like he knew me better than anyone else, but he wasn’t available all the time like he used to be, although he tried his best to spend time with me as much as he could, and I could clearly feel the effort he made to keep me. They dated for almost a year and a half, in that period, we had some argues and we separated many times, but ended up texting and calling again (we still spent many times together tho, just not as much as before) on that time I worked on myself and I wasn’t feeling as dependent as before, still loved him but not in a romantic way anymore (at least not as much as before), he was just like a part of my family that I loved so much.. Things were like this till they broke up (about 7 month ago) we were both so bored due to quarantine. we spent lots of time together again and still do, we watch movies together, we play, he teaches me how to shuffle dance through vc 4 times a week, he is learning my native language and I help him with that and so many other things, I enjoy every minute with him and we are getting even more and more intimate every day, but I recently think about how good everything is and how much thankful I am to have such a fantastic human as my best friend, I feel like he is my soulmate, but where are we going? Where this long term friendship is going? Even if we meet one day (although its too hard bcs of our country’s situation), it’d be for just a few days, and after that everything would be the same as it is now, what if something happens to our friendship, am I able to handle it? Won’t it affect my mental health so much that I will have problems with my work and studies? Im so confused, sometimes I think maybe im just overthinking but that’s a very important thing that is directly connected to my future… it seems kinda impossible to stay away from him but idk maybe if I realize how much harmful this might get, my mind will find a way for it, I thought maybe I should ask for some outside opinion, so every advice or opinion would be so appreciated, thanks!",16Dec2020,1
2,"My friend got cancer and we’re not sure how long he will be with us. He has three kids and all three are quite young. The little one is 11 months old. We’re looking for ideas what he can do, so his kids will remember him when growing up. Any ideas are appreciated!",16Dec2020,1

I don’t really speak up for myself either.

Today really made feel so upset with myself..
I dealt with road rage leaving from my job and from my past experiences it’s never been as bad as this time. Some guy was cursing at me in Spanish and followed me for several lights and blocks. Once I finally stopped at a stop sign, there were several cars in front of me and this man pulled up next to me and hit my car with a baseballbat.. I got out and yelled because I was so angry at the fact he hit my car. I ended up just jumping in my car and speeding off.. I felt like such a coward and it’s been bothering me since. I don’t know why I feel this way, I feel so disappointed with myself.",16Dec2020,1

I do feel passionate about what I'm doing, I think the anxities that I have are coming from people not supporting me, the same people that HAVE supported my best friend who has also started something off (completely different to what I'm doing)

What is your advice on overcoming these anxieties? 
And if anyone else has experience in instagram businesses what is your advice on how to proceed and how long did it take you to get somewhere?

But the issue is. I don't know how to do that. Mechanically, I can do anything. But what I mean is, how would I make it a tribute to him? He kept his stock. But it's mostly the memories we made while in the car that remind me of him. 

Should I just try to find one the same color and just add my personal touches to it? And have it just serve as a memory? I also had a friend in high school who had one and we had a lot of fun in that car as well.",16Dec2020,1

My local Walgreens (if you don’t have them, they’re basically just average pharmacy) said they just got the COVID vaccines in. I’m also going to get tested, but I also want the vaccine, my mother on the other hand doesn’t want me to get it because it was “rushed” and “could have side effects” I’m 17 and believe I should be able to make my own medical decisions and I do have the ability to go get the vaccine.

11,"Good evening everyone! This is a question that I hope someone can answer. I recently broke off my engagement and broke up with my fiancé after 4 years of being together. That’s besides the point. I recently got back in touch with a good friend of mine who I became friends with back in college. We’ve known each other for quite sometime and had lost touch because my ex didn’t want me talking to him because he felt he was flirting with me. Again besides the point. I recently found out that he is single (I’m not trying to date him for reasons of my own) but he has always been a good friend.

My question is, he moved back home after his breakup and I know the town he lives in but I don’t know the actual address of his home and I don’t want to ask him because I would like this to be a surprise, but would it be a faux pas if I sent him a Christmas gift to his work? 

Or how would you go about finding out his address?

Thank you for the help!

Happy holidays to all!",16Dec2020,1
12,"I’m 17 female turning 18 December 29 and in June 2021 I’ll graduate high school. Today I just found out I got accepted into my dream school it is basically a performing arts school you can get accepted based off your talent. I only won $2,000 in scholarship but the school tuition is $54,000 I always thought I would get more but I don’t know. Anyway I have been looking for scholarships but I just don’t seem to be winning anything I’m afraid of being in debt for the next 10 plus years to come. I have thought about community college first but I’m already set to go to this school and I start my college Fall of 2021. No I don’t wanna rely on my parents, they teach me the meaning of hard work and I’m a huge daddy’s girl and he wants me to let him worry about it but I feel guilty for making him do this. My dad is a city bus driver I don’t believe he makes much. If you’ll ask why I don’t have a job mostly because my parents won’t let me but I definitely want to work while in college. The school is also out of state in LA (I live in Florida) and I’ll be far from my family.  

Please does anybody have any advice on how I should handle this?? What to do going to a school out of state and not having any family members near??? Something to ease my mind?? 

I really wanna go to this school.",16Dec2020,1
13,"Before I (32F) started working at my current job 2.5 years ago I was rarely ever sick and almost never had headaches unless it was from a hangover. Since I’ve started there I’ve been getting headaches almost every day and generally sick more often. In the past two years I’ve been to the hospital over 10 times. Before I had only gone to the er twice. 

I keep ending up in the hospital because my stress levels get to the point where it throws me into some sort of stroke like episode or what feels like a heart attack. I’ve had tons of tests and all is normal. 

I’m the only full time Employee at the office. I work by myself along side my boss 80% of the time. The vast majority of job duties are put on me with more and more piling up every week. I’ve expressed to my boss on numerous occasions over the years that I need more help from my coworker and that it would be greatly appreciated if she could either work more hours or do more during her shifts other than room patients and answer phones. She either gives me pushback and tells me I’m wrong or ignores me.

She is entirely too dependent on me. She has no back up plan in place for when I’m out which is becoming more frequent. This is due to the tremendous amount of stress I’m under 40 hours a week.

My head feels like I have a 20 lb weight on my head. This causes neck and shoulder pain that then causes my arm and leg to go numb as well as my hand locking up. Sometimes it feels like I’m being strangled. I know this is job related because this mostly happens when I’m there. 

She is now angry with me for calling out once again because I ended up in the ER. Telling me she’s been more than accommodating. This is pissing me off big time because all of this keeps happening due to my job. I’m finally looking for a job. I cannot take it anymore. This affecting my quality of life and I can’t be worried about her or her business anymore. Its too much. If she wants to accommodate me she will let up and either delegate the job duties more evenly or have to keep dealing with me getting sick until I can find a new job. 

I go back tomorrow and I’m so stressed out about this. I had planned on going back today but they tested me for COVID and the nurses said I can’t go back until I get my results. She was initially giving me shit for that and I wanted me to come in anyway then changed her mind last night. I guess she realized that was pretty unethical. I’m beyond fed up. I don’t want to go back but that’ll probably not do me any favors.",16Dec2020,1

TW:// Mentions of mental health, self harm(?), swearing

Hello, I am 18 years old . I feel like this problem makes me a little childish but I've been struggling with this for months and I can't really seem to find any kind of solution. To give some more context so you maybe can understand me a little more, I'll give some background info. I've been friends with all of these people for about 5 years, except for 1 that I've really only known this year. For years and even to this day I've struggled with anxiety and depression. I'm also a very paranoid person, so this rant may be stupid and may not make much sense... Sorry.. I also do not have a job and do not attend college atm. 

I love my friends, I really do, they're amazing people. They're nice, they're really kind people. However recently I've been extremely stressed about them. They rant to me a lot about the problems they face, many of them also struggle with mental health issues, and they all have jobs and go to college. I'm okay with them doing this because they deserve a safe space to talk about their struggles with no judgment. However recently it's gotten to the point where I am stressed or crying almost every single day because I don't know how to help them. I feel like no matter what I say, nothing I can do is  good enough. If I try and offer solutions they shoot them down, if I try to validate them and tell them I love them they just ignore me and continue to rant, and if I say nothing I feel like that makes me a terrible person.

Maybe I'm reading too much into the things they say, but they have also said a few things that have kind of hurt my feelings. They constantly talk about the fact that my parents are better than theirs, which doesn't sound hurtful, but it makes me feel like that because they have it worse than me I can't have mental health struggles. They've done similar things with money too. This makes me feel like I have it better than them, so therefore I cannot struggle  with mental health, talk to them about my mental health, and I have to fix their problems. Another time, a few years ago, I was struggling very hard with school to the point where I wanted to drop out. I'd express this many times and my friend just asked what I would do. I explained that maybe I would make makeup tutorials Youtube or something and that I would create a backup plan. Instead of being supportive they where like ""Oh well what if no one likes your Youtube channel and no one wants to watch your videos."" It made me feel like I'm not  good enough to do anything that I'm passionate about. I also think I might've been gaslighted before? I'm not sure. In a group chat we were talking about relationship stuff and I had mentioned that I'm really lonely. I've never been in a relationship, or kissed anyone, I'm also extremely touch starved. It's to the point where it gets almost painful how lonely I am... But when I expressed this I got told that ""that's better than being used for sex."" It made me feel bad, like my emotions didn't matter because they had it worse. I felt like I had made them feel bad because they had to bring that up when I mentioned my loneliness. 

It's getting to a point that whenever they rant to me I physically and mentally shut down because I just can't think of anything to say to them. I feel like I have to fix their problems for them, like they're my fault, and if I don't fix them I'm a terrible friend. But there's absolutely no way to fix their problems, I know that, but I just can't shake the feeling that they have it worse than me and that I need to help them. It's getting to the point where I hit myself in the head because I get so stressed over them. And it sucks even more because I know they're not bad people, they're  wonderful. I know they're not doing it on purpose. But I don't know how to confront them without seeming mean. 

I really don't like confrontation, I don't like bein mean, and I feel like if I confront them I'll be this terrible mean person. I've also tried to confront them about something else before, multiple times, and I get the standard ""We didn't mean to, we'll do better, we're sorry"" with no change, and I felt like a jerk them too. 

I also sometimes feel like they treat me unfairly too. If one of my friends has anxiety we all take care of her and make sure she's okay, they all validate her, but whenever I would talk about my anxiety I always get treated like I'm a stupid asshole. I've stated concerns over the pandemic we're in, I get treated like I'm stupid and mean for caring about it. I have a really weird intense fear of getting murdered and if I ever told them that they'd kind of treat me like I was stupid for thinking anything like that.

I guess I just kind of feel like I'm this therapist to them, and that I get no support back. I can't even really talk about anything I'm interested in because I just feel like they don't care. But on the opposite ends of things, I feel like I'm in the wrong. Like I'm this big asshole because I'm not caring for them enough, and I'm unhappy with the way they're treating me. They're my friends I love them, and sometimes I feel like I'm overreacting and like I feel this way for no reason. I feel like I should just suck it up and deal with it because I'm a terrible person and I deserve it. 

I'm really sorry that this post was so long. I'm just desperate for something, I've talked about it in therapy before too, and I can't seem to get anywhere. Also I'm sorry if this rant doesn't make much sense or if it's grammatically incorrect. I can't really think the best at the moment, and my memory and thinking process isn't the best, but I promise I'm safe and doing the best I can to take care of myself. I'm just desperate for any kind of solution to this. Let me know if you have any questions too!",16Dec2020,1
15,"im 21 f, and ever since i left highschool at 16 ive just worked. And ive fallen off the social circle a lot.

16,"Cannabis got legalized here 
And I researched that CBD oil can help cats with allergies in the same way Atopica helps but without side effects, and my cats been on Atopica but I don’t want her on it forever cuz it can have bad side effects 
So I started my cat on cat safe CBD oil I bought from the pet store today. 

Then I was thinking of trying it myself to see if there’s any health benefits but the places I phoned in town told me they have some THC in the CBD oil, but I read that apparently it’s not supposed to have any? But they said I’d have to go through the doctor to get that type. So what’s the diff between the two, one guy tried to convince me you couldn’t get any health benefits without some thc in it and that was still a small enough amount u wouldn’t get high from it. 

But I had very negative reactions to smoking weed and eating real cannabis oil with all the thc in it in the past so I’m just worried about that lol 

And I’m also not big on drugs or medicines but I’m open minded and like natural health remedies and stuff

17,"My girlfriend, and I have been together 2 years and lived renting together around 1 year, but we have never really discussed our finances. We know ball park what each other earn as we have to show our earnings to the letting agent when applying for the rental flat we share. She's a nurse on around £35,000 ($47,000) and I earn around £70,000 ($95,000) working in real estate. She seems a bit embarrassed at the time about her salary but we didn't discuss it at all. 

Anyway, I have saved quite hard since graduating and getting my first job at 21 - so I've been saving for best part of 13 years now. Literally putting away as much money as I comfortably can and putting it into various different investments and savings accounts. I don't buy many things, clothes, cars or take expensive holidays. I'd prefer to retire younger if possible.

We have always split everything 50:50 in our lives. Rent, bills, lunch, groceries, holidays etc. But we have never had a meaningful chat about money despite a few of my attempts. I did ask her once if we were to buy a house together in the future what she may be able to contribute and she shut down the conversation saying she wasn't ready to discuss finances with me in this sort of detail. That was 4 or so months ago now. I didn't push it.

I was doing some online banking over the weekend on the laptop and she read my bank balance of $235,000 - I had that figure as I was moving some money around between accounts.  She saw the number and went kinda went very quiet, looked very surprised and then left the room.

Since then she has been acting quite strange around me. I think maybe she is a bit either depressed as a possible disparity, or embarrassed maybe if he savings accounts are not comparable...

What she doesn't know if that's only a small fraction of my net worth, as I've invested well in stocks and shares and cyrpto and have a few other accounts all with more than that. Also have a good sized pension as I over contributed to that all my life.

I did try to bring it up with her but she shut down the chat and isn't really speaking with me about anything now.

IDK what to do!",16Dec2020,1
19,"I am absolutely torturing myself here and need a way to have some opinions on this scenario. 

I need to give a background story for this to all make sense. 

I grew up in a large family. My dad was wonderful but was subjected by emotional abuse constantly by my mum. My mum was abusive to all of us, including all of my siblings. 

She would call me names daily. She neglected us and didn’t meet our basic human needs a lot of the time. To the outside world, she was an upstanding member of society. To us, she was such a cruel person and I really don’t say that lightly. She was very aggressive towards us and the depth of disgust when she spoke to us is difficult for me to convey. 

As I grew up, her abuse worsened. I managed to earn enough to leave home when I was 19 and I went completely off the rails. I was drinking very excessively and sleeping with lots of men. Sometimes because I wanted to, other times because I was taken advantage of. I felt like this was the only thing I was good for and was what men wanted. I felt worthless but having sex with people made me feel that I had some shred of value to someone. 

I can reel off story after story of scenarios where I was taken advantage of. I didn’t understand it at the time, but looking back it was so wrong. 

On this particular occasion, I am haunted by the thought that maybe I was the one to do wrong. 

My memory of the night or early morning is very vague because I was very drunk at the time and this is going back 13 years. 

Basically, there was a group of men, we were all drunk from what I can recall. There was on guy there who I touched down below. I remember doing so repeatedly but I can’t remember if it was over his clothes or under. I think it was over but I can’t say for certain. I can remember that he didn’t seem to reciprocate. I continued though. What I can’t remember is if he said anything to indicate he wanted me to stop.

I keep playing this over in my mind. Did he say “don’t” and I’ve said “but you like it don’t you” and carried on? Or something like that? The fact I can’t remember for certain really kills me. I’m also wondering why this specific incident is still in my mind. That alone makes me think that something must have been amiss. Then again, maybe I remember it because it was a rare occasion when he didn’t take things further. 

What I’m saying is, I just really don’t know, but something makes that memory jump out at me and I’m not sure what it is. 

I am really struggling with anxiety and depression and seeing a counsellor regularly for that but I’m sitting up on my own, in the middle of the night, replaying this whole thing in my mind again and again. 

Can anyone offer some words of wisdom. 

I want to be a good person and this makes me fear that I’m not. 

Thanks",16Dec2020,1
20,"Ok so I’m my psychology I sit by a girl and she’s by far the weirdest person I’ve ever met

She shouts at the top of her lungs when the bell rings (I’m not joking), hisses regularly, shows me soft core among us porn, tells me about her fan art and story about some kid with crystals growing out of his eyes, talks to herself out loud etc.....

It’s really rough and to be honest there’s so much work every lesson and I can’t concentrate when she’s acting all weird

Also I can’t move seats, I know someone would include that there

Now although she hasn’t said, I presume she’s on the far end of the scale when it comes to autism as she displays similar behaviour to my cousin (he’s autistic) expect only x100

21,"Lately, my whole family has been pretty stressed and are mostly in a bad mood. They’re not rude or anything, but family dinners, while they used to be so fun and we were all happy and had conversations, now it’s the opposite. No one talks, my brother is stressed with school and seems very irritable. Little things like the lighting are just making me feel down. 

It’s been like this since the start of December mostly, or maybe late November. I know it’s temporary, and everyone has a reason for not always being in their best mood, I completely sympathize for them. It’s just taking a toll on my mood. Even if I’ve had a bad day, if everyone is in a good mood, it cheers me up. But on days like this, I just feel down, irritated and stressed.

Hey all :) First of all I would like to apologize if some of my thoughts will sound scattered, but due to circumstances I hope you all will understand.. so please bear with me. 

Situation : 

1. Person X is working for not very long in one company, X is very liked, appreciated and got many internal rewards for being helpful and etc. 

2. Since X was passionate and skilled, X was promoted to new job position. And X was still waiting for papers to be sign. 

3. X was called to meeting and X got request about possible breach of work ethics. It was about dark humor.

4. Ofc due to company policy everything is anonymous and bla bla, so X doesn't even know who did this complaint. The only person X suspects its X closest, they met only few times,due to remote work. That colleague verbally made dark humor jokes hundred million times, so ""smart"" X was close with him and many times made dark jokes in the chat, while that colleague 90% did it only verbally. 

5. the jokes X made : don't blame if when you come we will do double smth(its about workload given to both of them). Black humor is like kids in smwhr it never grows old. Piano gif sended and written “he is fingering B minor, as in chord not a person”. That color man deserves a brick in a face (it was in conversation about the person who tried to kidnap a little girl). So these are the darkest jokes that was written from X side.

6. colleague works in the same position for many years, he is not the best at his work and he sees everyone around him getting promoted. While “smart” X overshared his luck and his personal life details. Because X is amazingly openhearted and NAÏVE. 

How to survive this? time is ticking. 

Is there any way this still can be saved? What are the most important point that could maybe safe X promotion? And yes, I know this is almost impossible… but I have no idea how to help. It would be amazing if people from USA had any advices...",16Dec2020,1
23,"My boyfriend works for a very nice boss whom I've known for a long time. I really like them, but one of their employees refuses to wear a mask. He claims that he can't for medical reasons but won't go to the doctor to get a note to prove it. They have tried accommodating to him, offering him to wear  a face shield only when he's around others, giving him different work that limits his interaction with other employees and customers, and giving him a different route to common areas so he avoids other employees. His boss has stressed that he needs to wear a mask only when he's around people but hasn't done anything to reprimand him. One of his coworkers is ready to quit solely because of it. Would it be wrong for me to report the business to local health officials? His boss is very nice, and I don't want them to get in trouble but they have had many chances to do something about it. It's also worth mentioning that this employee isn't very hardworking and half asses many things. He also can be quite rude and has made disturbing comments about the boss' teenaged daughter. There really isn't an excuse for not reprimanding him, they don't have much to lose with him. Again, I'm just worried what effect it will have on the business. They're a very hardworking company and do great work and their customers are very loyal and pleased with them. I also just find it reckless to not be enforcing the laws regarding health safety during a pandemic. One of the employees is immune-compromised and could get very ill if they caught it.

My friend Sarah (not her real name) told me a few months ago that she has had pancreatic cancer three times since the age of 10 (we are now 17). Obviously I was shocked, and I’ve tried to be as supportive as I can but I can’t help but question how truthful she’s being. 

Both my parents are doctors and when I’ve spoken to them about her, their professional opinions are that the things that Sarah has told me about her cancer and treatment don’t work medically or logistically. It’s things like the type of cancer being extremely rare in people so young unless they have a specific genetic disorder, and also the fact that despite saying she’s had radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a pancreas transplant (which when I talked to my parents and we researched, is only really offered to people with severe diabetes and extremely rarely used to treat cancer), she missed barely any school and apparently “had them (the appointments) scheduled during the holidays”. Also I read that surgery on the pancreas takes around 2 months to recover from but she’s never been off school long enough for that time. 

There are also things like not telling the school she has cancer - which I would think would be necessary for her safety, especially during covid. Also, the fact that she has had covid and was only very mildly ill with it, but if she has had cancer three times and had a pancreas transplant, she would definitely be very vulnerable. 

This is sort of all over the place and there’s more but I feel like these are the most obvious red flags to me. I just find it difficult to believe, nothing seems to add up. I never noticed any difference in her appearance (and she said she lost her hair and wore wigs, and lost  loads of weight and hid looking ill with makeup) but her appearance didn’t seem to change much at all and she was virtually always in school. Also nobody I know has ever seen the scar she got from the surgery and she says it’s all the way across her stomach. (I would be interested to know where the incision is usually made for surgery on the pancreas if anyone knows? Sarah says her scar goes down on the left side of her stomach then across towards the right side near her bellybutton). 

There’s a few other people who know, but from watching how they react, I get the impression that they believe it all, so I don’t know who to talk to or what to do. If I’m right, I’d be very worried: for Sarah (there must be a reason she would lie about it (and for so long, the first people found out over a year ago)) as well as everyone else so has been involved. But if I’m wrong, I will feel awful and I know I will regret not being fully there for her because I didn’t believe her. 

I can also understand that this is all told from my perspective as someone who is doubtful about the situation being true, so some things I have described may be told in a way that makes it seem obvious it’s a lie. But it could be completely true and I’m overthinking it all so I would just appreciate any advice. Thanks.",16Dec2020,1

29,"Obligatory “I’m on mobile” statement. Sorry if this is a bit ramble-y. 

I started [22F] a new job a few months ago at a public library after graduating college. It’s not anything in my field, but for now, with COVID, it’s a well paying job with great hours and it’s not difficult work. 

I love the job. The hours, pay, facility, and coworkers are all great. The job itself mainly involves monitoring people and enforcing rules. Most of the time this is no big deal, I tell people a rule and they usually follow it. Since my job is at a library I really see all kinds of people, and since my job involves making sure people don’t break rules, I ultimately ending up having to deal with a lot of confrontation. 

I get a lot more pushback than the only other co-worker I have, mainly because I’m a young female. (My coworker and I don’t work together ever, just communicate during shift switches). Lately it feels like everyday I’m having to get into a big argument with someone and they end up upset and yelling at me. This isn’t like any other customer service job I’ve ever had because the rules are very hard set. A lot of times, in other jobs I’ve had, I was able to bend rules to make a really unhappy customer go away, but here the rules are set in stone.

I’m not a very sensitive person, and usually confrontation doesn’t bother me, but lately it’s been very emotionally draining. Where I am in the USA also has a ton of COVID deniers who come in just to try to stir things up, which has only added onto the amount of confrontation I have to deal with. 

How can I keep myself from being exhausted by all this confrontation? Any confrontation tips? Or mental health tips to keep myself from being emotionally drained?",16Dec2020,1

He started out by saying he remembers the first time he met me so vividly and when we first started to date. Like he told the whole story of waiting at a friends house for me and my other friend to come over and he immediately was into me when I walked in the door. We talked about all the cute things and jokes we used to do. How we used to face time all night and fall asleep together on FaceTime. How we would beg our parents to let us hangout and spend the night. How we used to fuck everywhere and all the crazy sex stuff we would do. He told me he still has my sex toys in his closet hidden. He told me how nice it would be to fuck outside and that’s kind of his thing. He said he’s been hiking lately and it would be nice to have sex on the trail. I asked if he got to do that nowadays and he said he didn’t. That it wasn’t fun with someone who wasn’t down for it. 
I said we probably just fucked a lot cause we were young and horny but he was like no it also was just amazing chemistry. 

We talked about old trips together. Like details about our trips and he said it was so fun to have such a good time with a partner and fill in the gaps we had in each other’s memories. We Swapped pics of places we went to in the past. He earlier had told me that he has been on extended vacation solo and that it is fun but it is so much better to be with someone who actually appreciates the types of trips and that is hard to find. He says it’s better to have a shared experience with someone who really appreciates it. 


I told him I’ve had partners who requested I didn’t sleep naked in bed and he said “what? I would def want you sleeping naked in bed”

We also talked about life goals, nature, travel goals, life philosophies, exercise, the first few years of us dating 

He said he misses me and loves hearing my voice and can’t wait to talk again after I am done with a long stretch of working.

We stayed up till four AM and he always talked about how he was on such a good sleep schedule nowadays and always went to bed at ten but he kept saying it’s ok I can stay up later. No big deal. I can stay up. I kept making sure he didn’t need to go

We have been broken up for four years. We usually speak a few times a month and each call is over five hours long. This is the longest we ever had. We used to speak on the phone for hours when we first met and we literally would fall asleep FaceTiming each other and wake up to each other in the morning when we first met. We have been in regular contact for the past two years. 

We broke up because we resented each other. We’re immature. Only had dated each other before in the past and both kind of wondered what our relationship was and if we truly appreciated it. He also reinforced that he wanted to give us time to mature separately because we just never knew what it was like to be alone. He has adopted so many interests now that are identical to mine, appreciation of nature, gardening, travel, cooking, exercise. He completely has become the person I always wanted him to be and see. He said he never appreciated these things before and now that he did it on his own and on his own accord he really appreciates these things. He said women he dated before never appreciated these things and that this is super difficult as he wants shared experiences in life but can still appreciate doing them alone

37,"&amp;#x200B;

Okay, here goes. Sorry in advance for the long post. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I have tortured and blamed myself and lost all perspective here.

I made a fast friend at my daughter's new elementary school. This woman, whom I'll call Jane, is very well known in her field, a big deal. So I was flattered that she invited me to her weekend house soon after we met, texted me almost daily (sometimes multiple times a day, talking about everything under the sun), and even called me spontaneously to chat sometimes. Again, she is a big deal and has hundreds of friends. Everyone wants a piece of her. So I felt honored that she found me interesting and smart. She is amazing--a wonderful, brilliant, fascinating person to spend time with. And I would also add that she is super present for her friends. That was another thing that impressed me about her: she is a very engaged parent, and a devoted friend who really does give a lot of herself to others.

We went to a movie one afternoon, and she said she didn't tell her husband because she knew he would want to tag along, so she said she was going alone. She had also said things to me like, ""I adore you"" and ""You're lovely and great."" One day when we were crossing the street, she took me by the hand as we crossed. It might have been a sisterly gesture, maybe not sexual. She seems very heterosexual to me and as far as I know has only had (many) relationships with men. I don't know, but it was sweet.

We are both women, by the way. She told me many times that she argues constantly with her husband, and when I was with both of them once I felt like i was trapped in a performance of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf."" Both of them drink a lot, and her husband has quite a nasty temper as well, although he is friendly and kind around other parents. I just knew the inside story of her marriage from her and the stories she told me, but my sense is that they have a messed up/dysfunctional but sturdy marriage. She depends on him a lo to run things at home while she earns the big bucks. So it is what it is.

To be honest, I was very grateful for her friendship, not because of who she is, but because she was so kind and thoughtful and brilliant and funny. She would always check in on me, ask how I was doing, and so on. It meant a lot to me. We had a strong and instant connection.

One day a few months ago, I tried to call her about a plan. She didn't pick up, so I tried her again. (She has no voicemail.) When she finally called me back, she exploded in anger, like why didn't I just text her? She was in a meeting, why did I call her? (How should I know she was in a meeting, anyway, but never mind). It frightened me as I had never seen that side of her, nor did I know she had a nasty temper. Trust me, it was scary rage. (Maybe the rage of an alcoholic, I don't know.)

We patched things up, awkwardly. She apologized (eventually) for her temper and said she felt a little overwhelmed by the friendship and it sort of just came out in anger. Ok. But I still felt a close and intimate connection with her. And to be fair, she was the one who had texted me all the time--but I didn't dare mention that.

Then the pandemic hit, I pretty much stopped texting her over the summer, except an occasional casual hello, figured I would give her space and we could reset. She sent me nice messages over the summer but no calls or (socially distanced) plans. I didn't contact her when school began. She sent me a text, though, so we were back in touch. But it hasn't been the same since. The dynamic has shifted in some way I can't pinpoint.

She no longer texts me except for maybe once a month. Her replies to me are prompt yet terse, although I get the occasional ""xo."" I feel like she dropped me in a cold, narcissistic manner. The person I met (and loved) I can't see in her any more.

My question is: what is this?? What happened? I am pretty direct, so when I tried to apologize for anything I had done, she seemed surprised and said, ""You mustn't take it personally that I haven't seen you. I haven't really seen anyone."" That wasn't the point. Something feels different. We have had (socially distanced, outdoor) coffee a few times and it was nice to catch up with her.

Maybe I'm just imagining a shift and it has nothing to do with me? Maybe she is depressed and dealing with her own issues? Or: did she have more than platonic feelings for me, and now she has shaken them off and I'm just some friend who doesn't mean much to her? I keep reminding myself that she does have hundreds of friends, and her own struggles, and her own work pressures as someone who is well known. I get all that. But I still love her and miss the connection we had.

I am feeling a bit traumatized, thrown in the garbage, confused, and sad. I have no family (except my daughter), so friends are my family. I feel like I have been through something I cannot understand. We are still technically friends, but I would probably have to text her to do a socially distanced meet up now. I know I won't hear from her. It's like I completely imagined that early sense of closeness. I'm feeling a little broken and would love anyone's insights. Have I simply been discarded by a narcissist who lost interest?

Thanks everyone. Sorry to sound like such a loser! This has been tough, maybe amplified by the pandemic. But it's been painful, this loss.",16Dec2020,1

42,"Hi everyone,

I’m in my second year of undergrad, and I feel completely lost and I’m doing awfully. For the past three semesters, I’ve gone through the same cycle where at the beginning and for about the first half or so of the semester I feel very driven and I’m super on top of everything, and then at some point I become depressed and unmotivated and I lose almost all of my drive. Last semester, this happened and I withdrew from classes completely.

I came back to school this semester ready to crush it, but halfway through I lost 90% of the motivation I’ve had and skipped classes and assignments, laying in my bed at home most of the day. I tried so hard to get motivated and get out of it, and I had some success, but now I’ve skipped two of my finals due to feeling overwhelmed and I see no way out. 

The weird thing is, I’ve always been a great student. I mainly took AP/Honors classes and had all A’s in high school and had great test scores. I did great in multiple extracurriculars, too. I was even bumped up a grade when I was younger. But for some reason now, I’ve been in this funk for the past 3 semesters. I even enjoy what I’m studying. I just don’t get it, and I don’t know what to do going forward.

I’ve brought this up with my mom who’s successfully graduated from multiple graduate programs, and all she ever tells me is “undergrad sucks for everyone, you just have to push through, even if you get some bad grades.” That advice never comforted me, and that’s literally all the advice I’ve gotten out of her.

Ever since April/May (when my gf broke up with me) I’ve been depressed everyday and day to day life just hasn’t been the same as it was before I met her. Is it possible for the break up to be some sort of trigger for long lasting depression? I got over it after a couple of weeks, but the timing of depression lines up well with the break up and I was very obsessed with her, I lost 50 pounds and she was everything for 3 straight months, but it turned out she was cheating on me, and being manipulative this hurt me to where I was throwing up (?) for some reason. All this happened in the first couple weeks of lockdown. I’m listing all of this to maybe see if this is an actual trigger for depression and how I might go about reversing it?

Anyway, following this, Lockdown followed shortly after and it was torture for me, I was depressed day to day and toying with the idea of suicide, I never followed through but most of these days I’m just losing hope.

My minds always stressful and it always argues with itself and throws negative thoughts around, dis credits positive ones, counter and re-counters any logical statement in my head to where I get a headache and end up screaming and getting angry out of nowhere.

My dad has become more and more hostile towards the cats lately, such as getting aggressively loud in their faces and dragging them by the scruff if they shit in the floor. I've told him to stop feeding them people food multiple times as it's given them chronic diarrhea since they were kittens (born May 8th). He refuses to listen to me and claims that it's ""just worms"" even though they haven't had any in literally months. My mother doesn't give a shit and won't do anything about his deranged behavior.

He recently started to feed the cats exclusively outside and will become agitated if I bring my cat in too early.

I'm worried that his attitude i making my cat severely depressed which has resulted in a near complete avoidance of the litter box.

Aside from that, my ginger cat really hasn't done anything THAT troublesome lately; of course he engages in problematic behavior sometimes, such as climbing on the counters and sticking his head in the stove/trashcan, but it's mostly done out of boredom and repeating the other cats.

My dad has gotten more and more hostile towards my cat since he's scared to use the litter box. But there's really nothing I can do as his child to change his behavior.

I fear for my cat's safety, as our mother cat hasn't been seen in days... with the weather being so extreme, it's assumed that she got killed somehow.

My dad says the coyotes might have gotten her, as there is a small patch of trees and a fenced field way behind our house. This is apparently what happened to our last cat, and it makes me sad that everyone in the house treats it as nothing more than a joke.

There's also been rumors of backwoods people torturing and slaughtering stray cats for fun, as we found our cats tail burnt to a blistering red nub and a few months later disappeared entirely.

If I were to get my cat a special cat harness that he could re-learn to tolerate, I thought about possibly tying him to a stake right next to the porch and providing him with a plastic house (on the porch ofc) and a comfy bed to sleep in at night alone with a bowl of food/water.

I know it sounds odd or cruel to think about, but my dad has grown more and more agitated towards the remaining cats and has told me that neither of them are allowed back into the house because they ""tear it all up"".

I've tried and tried rehoming them for ages, but the best we can do is drop them off to the countryside like we did . I honestly don't feel like doing it again as they were constantly whimpering, vomiting, and pooping diarrhea with clear jelly consistency on the outer edges. I legitimately thought they were going to pass away right there under the seats because of how scorching hot it was. 

I've contacted nearly every last shelter within a hundred miles radius, only for them to turn us down for being out of county. Just on top of them being completely full. Every single non-profit we can find has completely defunct for ages or just leaves us on hold.

I have no contact with the local community outside of my old friends from high school; most (if not all) of them have moved off to college.

I'm afraid of making a public post as I fear that my parents might take offense to it, even if I  don't say a single thing about my situation.

The people at therapy on the other hand, are kinda pissed at me for begging them to help me get rid of the second litter after my parents left them to suffer in their own filth. We had to keep them in a plastic tub and change out puppy pads because of all the roaches.

I've went from rehoming group to rehoming group, witnessing nothing but constant drama and total freaks. Pretty much all of my posts are ignored or if I'm lucky, 1-2 random strangers DMing me for pics and suddenly losing interest. I live way too far away from most members of the group anyway, and it's a challenge just to convince my parents that it's for the better.

I've just recently rehomed my nephew's guinea pig to a rescue lady on the other side of the state when it became way too much on my depression to take care of an animal I didn't even ask for.

My mother's friend (who lives in the basement) still foams at the mouth over my decision to this very day, going on about how much I hate animals.

I'd rather just keep the poor cat and do what I can than having everyone chew me out for being a such goody two-shoes or trying to get out of basic responsibility.

At this point, I've just given up entirely on trying to rehome any kind of animal.

If I were in my own place I would definitely keep him inside or in a fenced yard; but unfortunately we don't have a fenced yard and I have to respect whatever my parents do with themselves.

Maybe it's a redundant question since I'm supposed to be moving to a nursing home, but I highly doubt they'll let me keep my cat (if ANY animal at all). I guess I have no choice but to let my cat die under my ignorant parents when I'm not around.

If attaching him to a stake right along the porch is too much, what else can I do to keep him safe?

It all started in catholic school and it got so bad that even teachers found out, so I moved schools; apparently the rumors spread through all schools in the city (even school I have NEVER attended to/planned to attend to) and this unfortunately included my now current school. I went in with a bad reputation, nobody really likes me. The kids I used to hang out with at school are all graduated by now since they are older than I am. with them off to college is hard to maintain that constant communication. And the few people in my grade who I thought were my friends ended up being backstabbers

For some time I figured out I was bisexual, but unfortunately that's not accepted here by little to no one, so I haven't gotten the change to come out. It's one of my biggest secrets, with only two .people irl knowing about this because here its seen as being gay is wrong. My mom doesn't know, but she always makes spiteful jokes and cokemntes on the LGBT community, and is not open minded at all.

with that last part in mind: if I were to tell her I'm bi and atheist, something bad could happen

My situation at home isn't ideal either, my parents might or might not be separating and it sucks because whatever anger either parent has, they take it out on me since I'm the older child. I tried to talk to them about it but the said I just being dramatic and what not. I (accidentally: my mom blurtedit out to me in the middle of a fight) got told about the separation mid-November.

The separation is happening due to my dad not working. He has been unemployed for six years now and shows no signs of ibtrest on getting a job anytime soon. my mon works full time and we have enough to get by, but what makes my mom upset is 1. him just laying around and not even bothering to help around the house and 2. that that's our ""role model"" as a father figure. My dad is depressed and so is my mom. But they don't tend to be the depressed where they cry, rather than that they get angry and take it out on me by screaming at me and sometimes hitting me if very very intense.

But the way they take it out is really different from each other, my mom tend to be chill a lot of the time but whenever she is angry it's really intense. She screams at me and curses me as if it were my fault the separation is happening or her stress is my fault. My dad on the other hand its like a little needle poking in the same little by little, his attacks aren't as intense but they are constant. He taunts me like a lame school bully would, that's the best I can describe it.

With all of this being settled, by summer I decided I wanted to study in America and remain there once I graduated university. I worked my ass off to do my SATs; I didn't have a decent summer break because of the exam since I was preparing for it. I had only 10th grade backing me up when the exam evaluates 10th, 11th and 12th. I spend around four months in intense tutoring and studying before the exam. Basically went into that exam with 10th in my pocket and a bit over a month in 11th. I had never wanted something so bad, I just want to het out of here. I didn't even pass the SAT which devastated me, but I kept moving on.

Because if I don't get to go away, it's very likely I'll study something I not really passionate about and just makes the money since money makes happiness according to my family. I also want to leave this place to live out to be bisexual and follow/unfollow whatever religion I like. So everything is in game.

in order to go away I did everything I could to make me a good candidate; got four really good recommendation letters, a 3.7/4.0 GPA, I have a history of extracurriculars and winning competitions in inner, local and even national competitions, I'm a good athlete, fluent in both English and Spanish and now I'm even attempting to learn French. 

But now it's all been for nothing, because even with a good scholarship I won't be able to go away to either the US or canada (my backup plan) and it breaks me heart. With my dad not working there is no way they can sustain me in cas of going international, so I'll be remaining here. I figured that I couldn't afford it around almost two weeks ago, and my mental health has declined. For the first moments I was angry at the world, was a sobbing disaster when my mom told me I was not going anywhere. 

Whenever I cry I front of my parents I'm viewed as weak, so I don't do it in from of them, because the I get called names like ""drama queen"" or ""cry baby"". I feel like I cannot be anything other than happy infron of them because otherwise I'm being overdramatic. kinda like: upset? it's not that big of a deal. overwhelmed? you are just exaggerating. sad? don't be. 

I've found ways to let all of my feelings out like painting, drawing, talking walks and so on. But sometime sits too much for that to work, and talking to others isn't always an option since people don't tend to understand how I'm feeling. I'm genuinely trying my best to keep my head up but it's hard when I feel trapped. Trapped whereas I cannot be myself and follow my beliefs, when I cannot express how I feel, and when so much is pressuring me down. 

What can I even do?",16Dec2020,1

49,"I'm 16 years old and I go to a small high school. I'm the only student in a (special) special ed program at school...I have social difficulties and I've been having trouble with comprehension and articulating and verbalizing my thoughts. I'm kind to everyone to avoid conflict- that's just my personality. However, I've been having a serious problem that  has left me with low self-esteem, feeling marginalized and persecuted. Every adult in the school was made aware of me by my special ed teacher, who gossips about me,, and now I'm facing discrimination for having a mental illness.. My special ed teacher was made to stay with me all day everyday- waiting for me in the bathrooms, staying with me during class, escorting me in and out of the building, emailing my mother about every little thing, e.g. trivial concerns, difficulties I may have had, etc. My mother does the same. Even pulling me out of a class because I was having minor issues with another girl in that class. All of this because I have a history of self-harm and an overprotective mother that has made an impression to the school leading to have to suffer under these circumstances. Mind, this was history. I was never violent or a threat to anyone other than myself. I am stable on medications- this is just a liability concern- and it has been emotionally detrimental- I'm failing every single class. (I need to vent) As if this wasn't enough, I had to deal with my special ed teacher bullying me and a couple of other teachers rudely rreating me as if I were a delinquent in need of strict ordering and to be set serious limitations on. Because of this, my mother has decided to separate me from the special ed teacher. Mind, I was her only job, and she absolutely despised the job she had before. She's afraid of what will happen to her- she might have to go back to her old job- and now I'm feeling guilty. She's still a human being. Also, I'm still having to face the discrimination. Is there anything respectful that I could do about this? I feel as if in being perceived as a child, if I were to confront an adult about their treatment towards me- as if I were a danger or patronizing me as if I had the mentality of a 5 year old- they would feel disrespected.

51,"For the past few months, I've been feeling really lonely and upset. It just feels like I finally broke under all the pressure and things that have built up for years. I don't really know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

\-  I don't really have any family to spend time with and my mom hates spending time with me. She loves her boyfriend way more then she ever loved me. Plus, the ones in my family who did love me are either dead or left.                                                                                                                                                         
\-  I don't really have friends either. I mean, I do have two that are great people but they're always busy (It is around Christmas so I'm not upset at them for it. It just kinda sucks). Anyone else just lies about liking to be around me because they feel sorry for me. I don't know what for but they do.                      
\-  My grades are starting to get really bad too. I just feel so overwhelmed and upset almost all the time that I just can't do it, forcing myself doesn't even work. Also, I have to apply to college soon and muster up the motivation to do the art test before the deadline. Plus, I still have to get my 20 community hours to graduate as well. Ontop of all of this, my school just thrown me into to SHSM too so I have to do that too. It's a little funny because I somehow got honor roll and I'm the only one that received my school's art reward, two things that I definitely don't deserve to have.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just all too much for me. I don't know why I'm breaking during the one year that everything matters. I'm definitely not going to be averaging 80% so I might as well not even try to apply to my college anyways. It's not like my art makes up for my marks either. I just want to be left alone.

At the same time, I don't want to be alone. I'm not saying that someone has to be by my side all the time, I mean maybe like every once and a while. I think that's reasonable? They don't have to stay for long, just to have some kind of interaction and be around someone for a bit.

All of this is cutting into my sleep too. I either sleep too much, 2-4 hours and can't go back to sleep or, not at all. I've been feeling like somethings missing for a while now. Like someone is suppose to be with me when I fall asleep. I don't mean this in a sexual way, just someone I could maybe cuddle up with for a night. I just have a feeling that that's all that I really need. There is my one friend who probably would've mind if I asked them but, that's a super weird thing to ask and I have the feeling I'll make them uncomfortable too.

My mind just feels to full to not be constantly thinking about things. Music makes me not really think but, it's not really working anymore. I'm tired and frustrated and just sad all the time. I cry at least once a day, most of the time I don't even know what for. Plus i'm constantly getting sick, have a terrible body ache somewhere or just no will to move/get up. My bad grades could be that I've only been to my 3rd period once and my 4th period twice, this quad.

You can probably just tell how I'm writing all this out that my mind is too full, that I have too much to think of. I can barely stay on one topic haha. And yes, I've tried asking many times to see a therapist or just someone who I could talk to but, my mom doesn't think I have anything to worry about (I've tried many times but I just get yelled at, then her boyfriend makes fun of me).

Is there any way I can kind of stop this? Or something that can help me cope? Or just bide my time till I can get out on my own?",16Dec2020,1

Basically, I am in a happy relationship, and when things got more serious between my girlfriend and I, like when she told me that she loved me for the first time, out of nowhere I started thinking about another girl I’ve been friends with forever. 

For many months it stressed me out, as I tried to ignore or justify the thoughts, and because it made me feel like a bad person for thinking of another girl while I’m in a relationship with someone I’m happy with. It made me actually question a lot about my life and it’s actually made me work harder on my actual relationship and my girlfriend and I have become a lot closer because of it, but it’s really strange that happened in the first place. 

I’d think about this girl as if she was my girlfriend, even though I knew in reality we had nothing in common. Eventually I admitted to myself that I may have liked her deep down, but I feel like there’s more to it all. I don’t believe I can just magically develop feelings for someone I barely talk to lol. The more I accept my feelings, the less it bothers me, but it makes me wonder if I actually like this other girl, if I just was attracted to her and gave it way too much attention, or if I’m a little immature for a serious relationship.

The internet believes if I’m constantly running of someone then they are thinking of me, but I don’t believe in that. I’m not sure what to believe.

I am 15F. My sister is 19F. 

My sister keeps using my personal items. She uses my razors, deodorant and face wash. I've asked her not to multiple times. She just shrugs or gets angry at me saying she forgot to buy her own or it's a ""one-time thing."" Which it isn't. 

First, I got two spray deodorants when I went grocery shopping. I gave one to her. She kept using mine after her shower because she said she left hers in her room by mistake. She kept doing it. I got annoyed and moved my deodorant from the bathroom to the shelf in my room. She still used it. I got annoyed and told her not too, again. She just shrugged and we started fighting. 

She keeps using my razors. I think it's gross. I use them to shave my legs, arms and underarms (I have a separate one for my underarms and a separate one for my legs/arms so I don't give myself acne and they stay sharper for longer). She knows that. She just says she couldn't find any or whatever. She has body acne too. Now I started getting some on my shoulders. I'm annoyed. The thing is every time we buy a pack (we get disposable ones) we split the pack between us both. We also have another pack in the kitchen cupboard under the sink. I told her not to use mine. She said ""oh it's an emergency."" and used it. But she did this multiple times. She said she forgets to buy some when we go grocery shopping. 

A few days ago she used my face scrub. We both have acne but we both have different skin types. My skin is more sensitive so my products are more gentle. I try to always buy the cheaper option because it's not my money + my parents don't let me get a job yet. I use my face scrub once or twice a week as directed. She took it off my shelf in my room, I found it in the shower. I had only used a bit but now it's pretty much 2 thirds gone. I got really angry. She said oh sorry one-time thing. 

Her response is always that it's an emergency and I can always use her products. A) I don't want too b) WE HAVE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS GODDAMN IT. c) this time I reminded her when we went grocery shopping and she got her own deodorant.

He'd always talked about them being harsh, but I just figured they had strict rules or something. 

Anyway. Tonight he told me about the fact that they would literally brutalize him on the regular. I'm not talking like. Spankings that would go too far or something. I mean stuff that borderline sounds like military torture where the people involved get life sentences. And yet he spoke about it like it was just some funny quirky things they did? I just sort of did the hahahah-wtf thing and then the subject changed. I can't stop thinking about it. This man's never even raised a hand to me and yet he apparently sees that shit as normal?

72,"BF w depression, co-dependency and anxiety: battling between going ir staying..

I’ve been dating this man [Male, 33] for about 2 years. I’m a Female, 35. Early on I started to see that he had anxiety (a lot of it stemming from not being successful enough, even though Ive always thought he is), plus codependency and clinical depression. When Covid hit, we thought it be a couple weeks, so he moved into my place with his foster doggie who ended up having 5 puppies. It was all fun and cute until his depression took over. He had also decided to taper off of his medication so it made it worst. I suggested therapy (I had for a while now) and he started it only much later. The puppies were also taking over the apartment and even though he tried to help, it was all too stressful. He finally moved out after 4 months, and only because I suggested it. Barely took the dogs w him too. We have been doing a bit better now although his depressive energy and self-deprecating behavior continue and have really weighed down the relationships energy and my mental health. He is finally on therapy, yet again, it feels like he waited too long. I’m also struggling w feeling attracted to him sexually. We love each other deeply and he talks about wanting a home with me and a life with kids together and all these wonderful things, but is this a huge mistake for me to continue to be with him? 

TL;DR: boyfriend has struggled w depression, anxiety and co-dependency for ever. We have been together a year and now I’m starting to see his lack of mental hygiene - especially during covid. We have enormous love for each other. I have tried to help as much as I can w/o saving him. His depression has continued after months of therapy.

But now, this one friend got a girlfriend who is really into politics and she rubbed off on him heavy and he started talking about politics with another kid and then another one joined and now that’s all they talk about. 

It’s only ever politics. They’ll go on omegle and ask people about their views. They’ll make fun of our one friend for having a different view. They’ll debate politics against one another. They’ll make political tiktoks. They’ll watch twitch streamers who chat about politics. I can’t do it anymore, hanging out with them feels like a chore and feels like i don’t belong there anymore.

I don’t like talking about politics, i think it’s too negative and usually always ends with putting others down. It’s not fun and that’s not what friendships should be built on. I don’t know what to do anymore. Someone give me some advice, please. What used to be the best times spent with friends has now turned into not even wanting to text them because I feel like I am excluded for not talking about politics. I used to be the leader-ish of the group but after this political uproar I have lost popularity amongs my friends except for 2 kids. I just don’t think I can stay there anymore.

TL;DR: My friends went from a fun bunch to making politics their personality and I don’t think I belong there anymore. What should I do?",16Dec2020,1
75,"I dont know why, but sometimes when there's a person that I don't particularly like I tend to not want to share useful information with them.

Like - it's that type of situation where you are not getting tips or advice from someone you really admire for their work or in general for what they do or believe in, just because they might dislike you a little.

My question is, what the heck is this called and is it bad that I do this at times?

Did you ever experience this or something similar?

How can I be more open towards people with information and tips without being so conservative with people I tend to dislike?",16Dec2020,1
76,"So, when I made my Nintendo account I accidentally set the age way younger than I actually am, so now I can’t do anything with the Nintendo Online card I bought. I tried and no, the only way I can change it is by contacting Nintendo. So I did, and it seemed a bit sketchy, like a bot. They would reply as soon as I would hit enter. Then they asked me for my serial code. I’m just a bit hesitant in case they could hack my console. Should I do it, and what’s the worst that could happen?",16Dec2020,1
77,"So I've been dating this person for over a year. We used to be super close and affectionate (cuddling, kissing, etc) but late they've become more distant. I know that they have a strained relationship with their parents (mom is a deadbeat and dad is a drug addict). A couple month ago my SO started smoking weed, as far as I know they aren't addicted though, and I noticed that they started to purposely distance themselves from me. It was little things at first (not talking to me as much, no hand holding, and cuddling) but it's going up to not even acknowledging my presence in rooms, talking about me as though I'm not there, etc. At a sleepover a couple weeks ago my SO brought up how they made out with an ex of mine a few days prior. I didn't really react but later that night, after they were asleep, I went outside and cried while my friend was hugging me. The morning after my  friend tried to tell my friend about how that they thought that my SO should apologize to me (we were all kinda doing our own thing in her room) and my SO said that it wasn't a big deal since they were high. Since then we all haven't talked about it and my SO is avoiding me even more. I actually was able to get in contact with the ex my SO made out with and he said that they were all sober and there were four other people to verify it. I don't want to jump to conclusions but I feel like my SO doesn't love me anymore and I think the only reason they haven't dumped me is because I'm known for buying people stuff even if they've wronged me. Am I in the wrong for being upset and what should I do?

78,"A guy I dated when I was in high school was an absolute awful person. He was decent while we dated and I was more so just happy to be liked by someone which was sad but whatever it happened. Anyways he was super sexual and whenever I would change like literally into my pyjamas or something he would pull out his phone and film me as a “joke” and then save the videos. I always said stopp but I have severe anxiety and insecurity issues so I also like laughed during the awkwardness of it all so he took that as a “it’s fine”. 
After we finally broke up, his friends messaged me awful things like “I hope the demons in your head win” “I hope your life is a failure” “no one ever has or ever will love you” “your education is worthless” blah blah blah. 
Came to the point to threatened to file a police report because they were using alternative accounts (I blocked their main ones) on social media to comment on my photos harassing and hurtful things, and then sent my pictures back and forth to each other, absolutely tearing my appearance to shreds. I literally couldn’t escape it. 

We broke up like 3 years ago, and I have a lovely boyfriend who I’ve been with for almost 2 years now. And I just can’t help but feel absolutely sick to my stomach that my ex didn’t delete those images of me. 

He had a reputation of disrespecting women in this sense. And he once leaked a girls image in grade 10 or 11 to like 20 different dudes, just showed everyone he knew. Like I would be more shocked if he DID delete it to be honest, I expect he didn’t. Either way, I need to fcking know. 

Any advice?",16Dec2020,1
79,"Hello, reddit!
I don't post often, but I didn't really know who else to ask. And reddit has a great expanse of minds and knowledge, so maybe you all can help me figure out what to do. 

So an amazon package was sent to my old address (I live many states away now, my older address). I moved out about 7ish years ago, but the address may still be connected to old accounts. 

The package was clearly addressed to my first and last name. I live in a very small town. It was forwarded to my sister, whom lives in the same town. She called me about it tonight to ask, and I told her to open it to see what it was, because I didn't know. 

She opened it, and it was a webcam (looked up on amazon to be about $40). I told her not to open the box to the webcam. There was also a generic typed note from amazon included that said ""you've  received a gift from so-and-so! Scan this QR code or go to this website to thank them!""

And the name of the person it says it's from is no one I know.. or at the very least, no one I know well by any means. I'm not friends with anyone by that name on fb. The rest of my family has no idea who it is either! I didn't use the QR code or website because idk if it might be some weird scam? 

Additional info: I've never asked anyone for a web cam before. My laptop already has one, and I keep it covered by a sticker at all times, and I don't work anywhere that would need me to have a webcam... I'm a bit freaked out, because regardless, that's a very strange gift, right?

So what should I do, reddit??

88,"Hi! Throwaway because my S/O knows my account. 

I really hope I'll find what I need here, this is my last (desperate) resort. 

So, usually I'm *reaaaally* into gifts. I'm not  financially stable (broke student) so I plan my gifts for months. Thanks to money issues and challenging university, I can only work through summers, so I'm really limited with money. This means I can do my extreme gifting for just a few close humans and on few special occasions. 

My boyfriend is someone who isn't used to being cared for from people who aren't family and for the last four years, I've been trying really hard to show my appreciation for him and how much I know him.  Well, unfortunately, this year my laptop died and I study something I need laptop for, so for this Christmas, I'm giving only love and hugs to everyone.  I'm *broke* broke (like really broke) and someone who owed me a favour and promised to help has ghosted me. Well, as everyone could figure by now, my original plan failed and I have only nine days to think of something. 

I can't even order anything cheap because I live somewhere where shipping would cost more than anything. 

So, to conclude, I need ideas, but like really good ideas. I know every single simple trick in the book and I'm not afraid of DIY challenge, so every idea that isn't already known in gifting circles (I don't even know what that means) is appreciated. It can be an experience or anything for that matter, it just has to be imaginative. I thought of some kind of sex game (I never did anything in that style before), but even there, everything I can think of or google is just...plain and boring, so you can add to that idea if you can. 

Even if its simple, I appreciate *any* help I can get, you never know what can get my brain going. I don't expect much attention, but, like I said, I'm desperate. Thank you for your time. :)

 2 weeks ago my sister \[22\] was diagnosed with cancer so she hasn't been working, naturally. I want to help her out so she can get money when not working. I'm kinda at a loss.   
Today I spoke with her and her employer \[alltown global\] mentioned their going to try and get a long-term/short-term disability for her.   
Does this mean she's going to collect money while she's not working? or are they talking about health insurance which she has?  
Should she go thru the state and collect unemployment?  
Is one better than the other?

91,"I feel like I’m lying to my real life friend because of an account I have on Twitter...


To set the scene - I have a regular fandom twitter account that I use to interact with random people on there, tweet a few random things, and get news, thats about it. I haven’t really made any friends there or anything, just a few people that I regularly interact with. Now, while it is mostly strangers and all, two of my real life friends also have accounts like these and we **always** see what each other post immediately because of the notifications. This has started to mess with my head a little bit, and I started to feel like I couldn’t just have fun and relax or vent or feel free to make new friends there. So.... I made a new account with a fake name. At first, everything was great and pretty much what I had wanted and expected. 


 However, one day, one of my real life friends followed me and started liking and commenting and retweeting all of my stuff. I didn’t want to be rude and I hoped it would maybe even make her happy if a someone who wasn’t her friend was giving her posts attention as well. She’s even started tagging me in stuff, and mentioning me in other threads and things, and I’m scared she’ll DM me or something soon. It’s starting to feel like I’m being a creep or lying to her. 


Should I trash the account? I don’t even think I could actually tell her it’s me without it properly freaking her out, but I don’t want to lie to her and feel like a freak. What’s the best option here?? ( I apologize for the formatting I’m on mobile right now )",16Dec2020,1

I know I’m being manipulative and spamming all of reddit and it’s a horrible thing to do but I can’t stop posting I am extremely desperate I can’t cope. Please help me. Please please please please please 

It happened again and can’t stop crying about it. 

Yesterday I just talked to my fave prof on zoom, and now I feel so awful. He didn’t even do anything unusual or wrong I’m just so hypersensitive and needy. I have been looking forward to this meeting for weeks. He seemed bored and distracted and I feel like he wouldn’t care if I died. I thought he liked me and he just seemed bored and cold toward me. His laugh was flat and fake and he gave absolutely no indication that he was even remotely enjoying himself. I just kept apologizing and sounding stupid. This always happens. I planned for this meeting so far in advance. I haven’t seen anyone other than my grandparents in months and was so excited for this but I bombed it and received confirmation that he doesn’t really care about me. And why should he? 

What is wrong with me? why does this matter more than anything in the world to me? Why do I feel like a pile of bricks has been dropped on my chest? My cheeks are flushed. 

I’m desperate for his approval. I swore I had it at one point and now it’s gone. It was probably all in my head. I’ve been secretly obsessed with him for four years but clearly couldn’t care less about me.... I can’t handle this. 

It was so absurd and pathetic, I kept trying to drag out the conversation. I feel so isolated and crazy I need him. 

I’m inconsolable and it doesn’t make sense to anyone else. I can’t stop crying I feel like I’ll never stop feeling this way. I don’t want sex or a date I just want him to care about me. I just want a sign that I matter. A smile or something.  Anything. 

My dad molested me when I was little and even though I don’t feel consciously *that* traumatized by it I definitely have boundary/ attachment issues and an insatiable need for affection and approval from authority figures. (I was also abused verbally by my mom for many years.)",16Dec2020,1

I constantly forget to do things. Like, when my parents ask me to do two chores or if they ask me to bring them two things, I’ll do one of the things and completely forget about the other. I have okay grades, but I really struggle to pay attention when I’m in class, especially with my classes being online now.

A couple months ago he was going through something personal and has distanced himself to everyone around him since then. He's done it before in the past but only for a few days, and I gave him his space. I've never really talked to a guy I liked who liked me back before him, and I've never been in a relationship, and I'm pretty sure I fell for him, hard.

Deep inside I knew it was never going to be, he's almost 5 years older, lives in the next country over (were both in Scandinavia), and I'm not even finished with highschool.

To begin the story, 2 years ago I met a girl from my school, we'll call her C, and she had a huge crush on me. I happened to have liked her too so we began dating. We dated well over 2 years and we, like all relationships, had our ups and downs but managed to make it through all of it. After we had started dating, my best friend, we'll call him D, became her best friend. We were all a group of 3 best friends and we all were very close. Skip ahead 2 years, and she begins to lost interest in me because of a lack of communication and starts talking to my best friend to get her through it, they ended up dating behind my back and still wanted to be my friend despite them stabbing me in the back. I say they stabbed me in the back because they used to say they'd never date no matter what happened. Anyway, It's been months and despite all the help and advice I've taken to help get over her, nothing has happened but me starting to love her more and more. I know she still has some feelings towards me of sorts because when she hears my voice, she starts trembling and has to take her anxiety medicine. I've talked to her about it in attempts to let her know my true feelings for her and she says she loves me, just doesn't feel for me romantically. They've only been together for 3 months and I feel that my window of getting her back is shrinking and I need advice on what you guys think I could do to try and get her back. To add to the details, I was never in any way abusive so that couldn't be a reason for her needing her anxiety medicine. And I know the way she feels hearing my voice thanks to one of her friends that told me about her telling them that.

110,"I am majoring in an engineering study, after speaking to a college advisor and the engineering head they told me they planned out my semester and had me on track for my degree. Well, it turns out my engineering head put me in a class by mistake thinking I needed a credit that I did not. Around this time I started having extremely bad internet problems and family issues due to covid. There was also an issue where I kept being removed from classes during this time and had to fight to get added to them.  I managed to get everything fixed around halfway through the semester and was then told the issue.

I was then told that I had 2 options. I could drop the class and lose 25% of my financial aid, or I could take the class and get a general studies degree as well since I would only need to take 2 more classes after that for it. I need my financial aid so I decided to try to keep the class, I bought the book from the college with my own money because they were no longer accepting financial aid payments. It arrived a week or two later. 

This class is the last one I have to complete and the final deadline is today, I have only managed to complete half of the 160+ assignments given. I am going to fail this class, and while it will not affect my main degree, I am constantly being told it will tank my GPA. Can anyone think of anything I can think of to help my situation?",16Dec2020,1
111,"My company is still 100% work from home. Usually each Christmas my department has a white elephant and I usually get small gifts for my bosses and vice versa. This year I got a new boss, and because of covid I was not planning on getting anyone anything, mostly cause I don't know addresses. 

Today I got a large box from my new box with a bunch of bath bombs, an oil defuser, and a candle with a nice note. 

It is extremely sweet and I'm very grateful, and now that I have her address from the package, I would like to send her something.

She would have had to look me up on instagram. And then she mentions shes about to play among us, so I invite her to play with a few friends and I, and she has to do work. She always responds to a conversation starter within 5 minutes(less consistent lately), and will often keep the conversation going, but never starts conversations herself. She uses lots of blushing, smirking, and star eye emojis(obviously never talking about me, that would make it obvious). What's going on here? And if she sees this, that is hella awkward and please dont bring this up in conversation.

She didn't know and I felt good I continued to text her till today but I just don't think I can continue I'm feeling deep sadness and it hurts so much so that I've been feeling physically sick and nauseous.

I no longer want to be around them, I no longer want to be associated with them. They have small children and my parents love seeing them.

117,"I really need help

So I have been studying in Australia for 3 years and during that period I met this guy I really liked. We ended up hooking up and also started spending a lot of time with each other and studying together and finally ended up living together for the past 2 years. In the past 2 years, we have spent a lot of time together and we really enjoy each other’s company but we have never spoken about feelings and how we feel towards each other. (Sometimes people would ask us if we are dating but he would just say no). But we are not officially girlfriend and boyfriend. However, over the weekend I found out he was lying to me and spent 2 nights hooking up with a different girl ( I found out as I happened to see him and he was at a different place compared to where he told me and I found condoms in his bag). I have been feeling really really upset and down and I don’t have anyone to really talk to about this. It hurts me.  Anyways, I happened to bring it up with him and firstly he just denied but secondly he said “You and I are not dating or not officially together, I don’t need to explain myself to you and I can do whatever I want, you don’t be so jealous”. I just don’t know how to react or feel. I’m feeling really sad. I’m meant to fly back to my home country for good in a few months (but I can expedite the process and go home faster). I did mention to him that I’m really upset and what I should do for this feeling to go away and asked him for advice. He said if I’m too emotionally attached I should just start living at my own place and maybe we can just hang out as friends. The thought of living by myself after 2 years of living with him makes me so upset and alone and I’m not sure if I am mentally okay to be alone and I don’t really have any friends to talk to. (Just to put into context he always says I’m one of his most closest friends and is so grateful he met me). He also said maybe I should try to get a flight home faster. 
I’m not sure what I meant to him over the past few years after living with him and sleeping in the same bed and also travelling together!

118,"Okay, here's the situation:

I recently received a job offer from CVS and I took it. However, I'm beginning to have second thoughts about the job. One of the main problems I have with the job is the position. I'll be a pharmacy technician. Before covid hit, I used to work as a pharmacy tech at a local grocery store and had a hard time with the job itself. It wasn't something I really wanted to do. It was more of my parent's decision. I still tried my best at it, I asked questions, pushed myself to the limit but I wasn't getting the satisfaction of doing the work itself. I don't know if I don't like the work or I'm just lazy at this point.

Another thing I would like to add is that I already have a job. Heck, I just started it two weeks ago. I work at a pizza place making pizzas. I actually like the work. It gets me working with my hands, I get messy, and I feel somewhat proud of my work. I like the job to some extent. My parents are suggesting for me to juggle two jobs but I'm in college and I don't really think I need to overburden myself like that. My parents expect me to choose the pharmacy job over the pizza making job but I don't want to leave when I'm just getting the hang of things. I don't want to leave on a bad note for a job that I dislike. 

My parents both work in the pharmaceutical industry so that explains why they want me to work in a pharmacy so bad. I really don't know what to say to them. The only pro to this job offer is that I'll be getting paid 13$ an hour. Which is five more dollars than what I currently make in my pizza making job. I get tips on top of my wage so I could actually be making the same as the pharmacy job. Ugh, I'm such a mess. I never should've told my parents about the offer. I should've declined and never said a word. 

I'm hoping anybody can give me some guidance about this fiasco.",16Dec2020,1
119,"Hi Everyone! So I need some help for a while now I have been changing my diet to a gulten-free and dairy-free diet which isn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be.

120,"I know how dumb it sounds, but its absolutely killing me. I can't focus anymore. I have a ton of schoolwork to do and, while I was getting very good grades to begin with, they've been slipping lately and I can't focus. And the pain is just awful. It's like starving but having no hands to cook food with. It hurts *so* bad. 

I'm not a drug addict. I'm 20, I've never so much as tasted alcohol or taken a drug of any kind. My parents, on the other hand, are hard-core alcoholics. I really, *really* don't want to end up addicted. But I need something to stop the pain fast. We've got a bottle of 60% scotch and a bag of ""Mendo Breath"" (I don't know what that means but I guess its strong). I don't even know what to do with the stuff. I just need enough to make it stop for the night, long enough I can catch up on school work and sleep for once. 

I just can't take it anymore. I have no one. My parents are awful, wacko-abusive. I've never had so much as a single friend, and I mean that absolutely literally. I mean *no one.* My parents wouldn't let me go to school, or even leave home. I mean literally locked up, with the windows taped over and the lights off so it was always dark. Somehow I made it to college this year, but with all the restrictions and my awful social skills I didn't meet anyone. 

I tried. I tried inviting people to do things. I tried talking to people, even though it was incredibly awkward. No one wanted to talk to me. Everyone in my dorm hung out, and people in my classes made friends with each other, but not me. 

It's just been me forever. I don't even know any family, outside of my parents. I can't sleep anymore. I feel tired constantly, but I can't sleep the night through. I wake up over and over again. I find myself daydreaming about having friends. I've always done that, but I've been doing it even more the last year or two. It's like an escape, almost. It's the only pick me up I have. I lie in bed and just imagine having conversations or meeting people or making friends with someone that seemed nice. It helps, if only a little, but when it gets old I just realize it's going to be a really long time, if I ever get to actually experience it. 

We all posted our contact information at school on a board. I've never heard from anyone, but something that helps is setting my phone up to send random notifications. It'll go off a couple times a day, and for a moment I have a little hope and excitement that someone actually wants to talk to me, even though I know it never happens. It's just another small thing that helps.

I don't know what else to try. Reddit is great and all, but talking to people online just isn't the same. It just keeps getting worse and worse. I tell myself someday it will get better, but who knows how long that'll be? What if it's months, or years, or never? I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I know I'm boring. I don't want anything from anyone, except for someone to spend time with me. We don't have to do anything, just talk or something. Anything.

124,"TL;DR 
my bf’s mom is at the ER a lot. I offer to do stuff but he says he’s good. I don’t know how to support him and his family right now but I want to. Any advice?

My boyfriend’s mom diabetes and recently had a stroke, they frequently have to call 911 and take her to the ER. 

She doesn’t stay for long usually a day or two. Sometimes she goes to the hospital and they get her to a stable place and then she’s back later that day. 

Every time it happens I ask my boyfriend how I can help. His mom wants him to ride in the car with her so often he’s stuck at the hospital (in the car) while his dad is doing the paperwork. I’ve offered to bring him home so he doesn’t have to stay but he says he wants to stay in case anything happens which (I understand) 
I’ve offered to bring him food while he’s there but he says he’s fine. 
I’ve offered just staying there with him so he has company but he says “nah.”

He won’t tell me anything I can do when I ask just that it’s nice I care. 

I usually would understand someone wanting to be alone or not wanting food in a situation like this but it’s happened so often that he is kind of used to it. 

I want to help so badly but I have no idea how.

125,"I'm an introvert without a lot of ""normal"" interests and had a pretty small friend group when I was an in-person college student. Unfortunately, since this past spring when I returned home, basically none of my friends have gotten in touch me of their own accord - they only respond when I email them or message them on Facebook. Even on the rare occasions where they do ask me something, it's never ""how are you doing?"" or ""I hope you had a good break"" - it's always ""can you help me with this homework?"" or ""do you know how [concept] works?"" Outside of my usually dysfunctional family, I feel like I'm not valued as a person by almost anyone.

After doing a ton of work earlier semester, I applied to nine grad schools at the end of November, and my area of study is a pretty subjective one that requires auditions and pre-screening. Today, I found out I didn't even pass pre-screening for a school where I personally knew one of the senior faculty members and where my sister studies a slightly different subject. It also really hurt that it only took them two weeks to reject me, while the vast majority of other colleges aren't supposed to announce their decision until the end of the month or in early-mid January.

I'm already exhausted from a difficult semester, and all of this together is giving me low self-esteem and making me feel miserable about my future (even though there are at least three graduate schools that I almost certainly should get into.) Normally, taking a walk or hike in nature helps me get away from these lines of thinking, but because of rising COVID cases and lack of mask-wearing near where I live, that's mostly not a safe option anymore.

My friend has this girlfriend who he has been with for about 3 years. To cut a long story short, he vows to be deeply in love with her and that she is his soul mate and the love of his life blah blah blah but the reality is that their relationship goes beyond toxicity.  Just this week I knew that she hit him, slapped him, makes him do her homework, orders him things, makes him spend his money.  Everything in this week.

He always comes crying over something she did to him and well at the beginning it's cool to support him but now im getting tired that we all know the solution to the problem: For him to break up with her.  however, that is a very sensitive subject, and if you say the least thing about her he becomes defensive and even angry.

131,"I’m 17, and I’ve been porn free for 12 days now. This week I’ve started to feel insanely strong sexual urges.

I don’t think I’m straight but I don’t think I’m gay either. 

Either way, literally every older man I walk past, I sexualize in my mind. Last night I had a dream and then intense sexual feelings around one of my asshole teachers. I don’t even know if I find him attractive, and I’ve developed this fetish for being dominated by other men, attractive or not. 

If I get these thoughts, should I masturbate to them if the urge is very strong, or is that giving into my old unhealthy ways. I don’t really know what they mean. But I feel, not attracted, but aroused by the thought of being sexual with almost any guy, but no women.",16Dec2020,1
132,"I have this one friend that I’m really close to, and she’s the only friend I talk to on a (mostly) daily basis. We live in different states now, so our friendship is long distance. I’m not much of a people person, so texting every day is already a lot for me. My social battery is rather small and drains quickly. 

Anyways, literally all of my friends live in different states then me (I moved recently before covid and have no social life), so I’m not weirded out by an occasional “I miss you” from them. But this one friend says it very often, and it’s not that I don’t care for her, but I feel this weird guilt/obligation feeling whenever she says it and so I’m starting to really dislike it. She also asks to call all of the time, which makes me really uncomfortable. I’ve noticed on the few times I have called her, she always seems to get extra clingy and needy the next day, spamming the “I miss you’s” and fantasizing about how visiting each other and that type of stuff.  

She’s also admitted to having feelings for me, which I don’t return. I don’t care to ruin our friendship or treat her awkwardly because of that. I only mention this because I think it affects how I react/see the behavior. Because of bad experiences I’ve had, cutesy romantic behavior/clinginess/dependency-like stuff makes me freak out at an anxiety/panic attack level. 

I’m not naturally social or dependent, as I’ve said before, and my attachment style is very avoidant. Normally, I’d be able to handle and get over my meh-ness about this, but I’ve been going through hell mentally and irl and I just don’t have any brain power. We often talk about our issues to each other, and that type of support is great, but I’m just so emotionally dead that it feels like (on both sides) those conversations are burdening. I’m very drained and I find myself wanting to leave the friendship because I feel exhausted. 

But, at the same time, I don’t want to end the friendship? She’s one of my only friends who knows basically everything about me, and that I talk to regularly. I prefer distant socializing, but I don’t want to be completely isolated by giving her up/distancing her as a friend. I also know that she herself is extremely isolated because she doesn’t work/go to college/etc, her friends are limited, and her family isn’t really in the picture. She doesn’t have the greatest mental health, and I feel like if I leave while she’s feeling rock bottom, it might cause her to get way worse.

Idk. I just feel gross. I also feel like an asshole for feeling all of this. I’m bad at putting up boundaries because I feel like a jerk, so I just sit there and accept the behavior and feel upset. I’m not sure if I could just cut her out of my life or say anything to her, so I just feel stuck. Idk what to do. :(",16Dec2020,1
133,"Whew so this is going to be quite long:

I have a friend that I have known for while, and she had to move away because of circumstances beyond her control, so she would no longer be at the same school/city  that I go to. Probably two months after they leave, I contact them. Boy I did not know how much things can happen in less than a year.

She says she is now trans, and that she wants us to use she/her pronouns. This isn’t an issue of course. Then she starts talking about her new school, and how she is purposely getting into physical fights for the adrenaline rush. This is a pretty long rant mind you. I am just sitting here looking at my phone screen like... what the hell. I am very uncomfortable now and this is the last time I talk to them in a long time.

Flash forward to last week, and I reach out again. Things are worse. She says that dysphoria sucks and that, along with other circumstances, are ruining her life. Things get heavy from here. She says rather casually that she is thinking of ending it all, and she asks my advice on if she should do it. I say NO! Obviously, she responds with “good advice” and then starts explaining that she has to go to a boarding school after this semester. She says that it’s because she tried to do something VERY BAD. I don’t really want to say, but I will say it involves fire, and a house. She says that it is in retaliation to an assault she was victim to. This is her own house by the way.

So this completely came out of left field, and I feel like such a piece of shit for saying this, but I’m not entirely sure she wasn’t the aggressor in the first situation. You see, she isn’t the most reliable reteller of events, and she frequently lies, bends the truth, and omits events. She has done this a lot in the past as excuses for not getting work done or something. Once again, I feel bad for having any sort of doubt about this, and considering I don’t know the end goal of their retaliation, I am pretty uncomfortable with asking for clarification.

Anyway I tell her that I don’t really have the emotional intelligence  to give her any advice about her dysphoria, but there are plenty of communities online where she can find someone to talk to, and they can help more much more than I would be able to in this situation. I tell her that I am concerned and she replies with: “boi why are you concerned”. Um... whaaaaaaaat?!?? Do I even have to explain why?

A few days later I ask her if she has tried reaching out to anyone, she says she hasn’t because she would probably forget, and that she has to build up trust with someone before talking to them, but she hasn’t even tried yet. She says that she will find people to help her when she goes to boarding school in a couple of weeks.

I feel like I am in the wrong  for no longer feeling like I can help, and essentially giving up on doing so. I tried to help and tell her to talk to her school counselor but her excuse is “people are shit”, and when I didn’t know what to say to something she told me, she said “wow (insert name here) was right, people are shit”",16Dec2020,1

135,"I have constant thoughts that I'm too dumb and that I will always be a failure. I believe these thoughts are the truth. This is indeed how things seem when I attempt to look at it objectively. Every little failure reaffirms these thoughts for me. Like an additional nail in the coffin. I've gotten to a point where I despise being me. I am afraid of putting effort into anything again. I am  afraid because I expect it to blow up in my face. I know I will not be able to handle it again. The thought of putting in that effort for something, where success is uncertain, feels like poison to my body. I feel physically sick sometimes. 

I haven't been getting stuff done recently. I just stare at my computer screen and I keep finding a reason to do anything other than the work I have to get done. It then puts me back into the pattern of negative thoughts I've been having. Its been a daily cycle.",16Dec2020,1
136,"Hey all....So as confusing as the title is is exactly how I feel. My dilemma might ring the same for some, so I just need some guidance if possible? Warning: kinda long post on mobile. Also I totally am not sure if I should post here, I’m sorry.

I used to want to be a boy as a young kid, but also the “hot badass chick” from games and movies. I feel like that mostly stemmed from insecurities and bullying that I looked like a boy. But deep down I really wanted to be a boy either way so I don’t know why it would upset me?  

As I got older I was obsessed with the idea of being “beautiful”, but also deeply uncomfortable. I was so ashamed of my female body, especially due to some trauma with males. I constantly hid myself.

Fast forward to now, I’m fully female and present as one. I still try to look beautiful. But every year I’m filled with more shame for who I am. I hate to wear feminine clothes, or revealing ones, because I’m terrified of being looked at. I desperately wish I was comfortable in my skin...and that I was a guy. But at the same time I also want to be a girl! But I’m scared to be anything I guess. It’s so confusing what I want and I feel so torn. I don’t know if I’m trans or not, but I just want to know if someone else understands this? It could just be trauma making me scared, or I’m scared of being someone else? I don’t know and I’m sorry if this is offensive to anyone, I’m just in a bad place right now. 

It could just be that I’m scared to commit to one or the other and never change? Again, I don’t know and I appreciate any help.

I’m desperately scared to be a woman and to look like one, but at the same time equally scared to not be one. Don’t know what to do about this dilemma and what I really feel.",16Dec2020,1

Let me say first that I don't think she's replacing me or anything, I think she's incredibly short staffed and needs someone competent. I think she relies incredibly hard on me to perform as well as I do, and to do tasks that have been done by senior employees in the past.

I do all of the tasks listed on the job description, and I think she's looking for a second ""me"" to join the team. (Most likely to replace the temp we currently have on staff). I feel like I need to confront her about my pay, but I'm not too sure how to word it. This listing has made me feel incredibly underpaid.

138,"So long story short, my aged body (I’m 34) is failing to become impregnated and I’ve got some reproductive issues and thyroid related troubles which may make conceiving children impossible. Ive expressed my concern over this a number of times to my partner and expressed how sad it makes me and how worried I am that it may jeopardize our future together. My partner  tonight told me he couldn’t be sure how he’d feel in a few years about my being unable to conceive, should it not happen. 
This left me feeling like I’m on a clock now and must get pregnant or risk losing him. I feel like he’s just going to keep me around the next couple years to see and if I fail, he’ll just cast me aside. When I express my fear of this (usually in an overly jokey ridiculous way cause I’m sensitive and scared of his answer) he’s only given casual sort of nah I won’t dump you if you can’t get pregnant comments but it never sounds very convincing or like there’s a lot of meaning/sincerity behind it...Sometimes he doesn’t even look me in the eye when he says it..i know I shouldn’t have brought it up jokingly but I’m a “talker” and so I process my feelings out loud. Anyway. That happened this evening and it really hurt my heart. Am I wrong to be hurt by that? Better question, am I being unreasonable in being angry and upset about him saying that?

147,"I just can't deal with it today. So, since summer of 2019, I've realized I'm trans, and started transitioning. Kicker is I'm 38. First punch line to telling the bad joke that is my life. My spouse of 9 years left me three days after I started testosterone last spring. They loved me, but not me as a guy. I don't blame them, because I kinda loved them less romantically than I should have. I still wanted to try, because I loved them. But I didn't love them properly. They deserved way better than me. They deserve actual love. Also I realized I'm ace and they definitely are not and that was a huge issue. 

So, concurrently with my marriage ending, I realized I was ace and also hadn't known what romantic love was supposed to feel like via.....wait for it....falling in love with my closest friend, who absolutely does not feel that way. I'm still in love with them. I think I finally understand what being in love actually feels like, because I love every single detail of this person and, even though they put me through hell (that's another story and trust me, I returned the favor, not innocent here) and I really shouldn't, I'm completely in love. I didn't know this is why romance mattered to people and I guess it's why relationships are a big deal. Never felt this way about anyone before. 

Multiple people have thought my friend had feelings for me too. I think even my therapist thinks so. However, they're all extremely, painfully wrong. My friend does not and will never feel that way about me, despite any appearances. 

Second awesome punch line: my spouse of 9 years was fine with walking away without even trying the couples therapy I wanted to do. They weren't wrong because I'm a heartless asshole who stole 9 years of their life because he had gender/orientation issues and a heavy dose of mental health shit. My friend, who is an online friend I've known like a year and a half, and 6 months of that not speaking due to some bullshit, wants to do joint therapy to fix our friendship.

Yep, you heard me: partner of 9 years didn't want couples therapy but online friend of less than 2, who I'm in love with but doesn't return my feelings, does.

The actual FUCK is my life.",16Dec2020,1
148,"Hey all. First time posting in here so I’m not sure if I’m doing this right. 

I’m an extremely empathetic person. I feel everyone’s emotions, I am upset if people in my house are stressed because I can feel it, and I can’t even listen to sad music because it makes me mope around (hence why the majority of my music is future funk and disco! haha). 

However, movies involving somewhat painful scenes are becoming more and more upsetting for me. (TW ahead: mention of movie violence)

I do experience a bit of sympathy pain from movies: I watched a movie where someone accidentally stepped on a nail, and I was limping for 30 minutes after the movie, too afraid to put my foot down because I was convinced it would hurt. HOWEVER, I can handle action movies: usually because the violence is so cartoonish, over the top, or unrealistic that I don’t mind. But lately (the past few months) it’s been REALLY bad. 

We were watching a movie tonight where someone with a broken wrist had that same wrist slammed onto a pool table 3 times. I immediately was startled and upset and had to leave the room. Another scene was from a comedy action movie where there’s a brief moment one character pushes the area where another character was shot, causing him to cry out for a moment. I was immediately upset and then enraged by this. Lastly, we watched Tenet recently and (no spoilers) he swipes at someone with a cheese grater. I didn’t watch this scene (I was warned beforehand) but was envisioning it so much it honestly didn’t matter anymore.  

I feel as though I’ve gotten more sensitive to these things, and it really bothers me. I’d like to be able to watch movies without being worried about a scene that will make me upset. I know there’s more things I can do but I’m not sure if I’m doing anything to make this WORSE. 

If anyone has had any experiences with this, I’d highly appreciate any advice you have! Also: I do have a therapist, and I will be talking with them about this more, but I’m just very frustrated. 

TL;DR: Movies have been triggering my empathy a lot more than usual and it really bothers me.",16Dec2020,1
149,"Hiiii hello, I’ve never posted anything before but I’m completely lost here. I really need some advice. 
My bf and I have been dating for almost 4 years &amp; living together for about 3 years.
When we met I was just about to turn 23. Wasn’t looking for a relationship at the time but hey we fell in love. It all happened very fast. 
I had just recently gone back to school when I moved in with him. We wanted to be together &amp; my fam is super overbearing/protective (love them) so I chose to move out, work part time &amp; go to school. We agreed I’d pay less rent until I graduated and found a ft job. 
My bf was all supportive but I definitely took my time finishing school, getting a ft job, &amp; just getting my shit together in general. I didn’t really know where I was going or what I wanted to do. I was super lost and honestly very comfortable standing in my own way. Super frustrating for him - believe me we hashed it out. About money, school, family, integrity. You name it. Everything he said I took personally.
Eventually in all the fighting I finally took some time to myself &amp; realized he wanted more he wanted someone who was able to meet him  where he was at. 
Someone who is sensitive and doesn’t know themselves &amp; someone who does know themselves with a mean edge-Not a good match  
He’s a great guy but now the edge is a full blown machete and I’ve got a ft job I’ve graduated &amp; acknowledged how I’ve hurt him. 
Last night I asked him to speak to me in my love language (words) cause it’s been rough the last few months and he’s just gets so frustrated with me for little things. 
He told me how can I ask for that when I’ve done nothing to make things positive. He told me I’m lucky he’s still with me. When I asked him to empathize with how I’m feeling he told me it was my fault he doesn’t say kind words and that I’m playing the victim.

151,"Ok im going to try and keep this story as short as possible but please understand that im working through a lot right now so i have no idea how long this will end up.. 

I'm a 33 year old female shut in.. im on Disability for PTSD (which i have for a multitude of reasons, including my house burning down as a young child and losing everything, my dad almost bleeding to death from skin cancers that got as big as oranges, (one being on the back of his neck, one on his arm, and one on the side of his face) and those would bleed randomly, we guess the cancer ate down into a vein or something and he almost died, this happened when i was just 12, and i kept him from dying by holding Pressure on the cancer.. anyway so long story short ive never been able to work for very long due to Anxiety.. ive had massive panic attacks since around the time he almost bled to death, and they've only got worse as time as gone on.. so being on Disability and not leaving the house much, ive put myself in a very bad place.. 

my dad who was the only one who knew how to drive in our small family (myself, my adopted sister, my mom and dad) died in 2013 from lung cancer. since then i stayed with my mom and sister to help them, as well as not having/wanting to leave.. 

this November my mother fell, and fractured her hip.. she was 72, but got around great before that, she was in the hospital for 20 days, i was even able to go see her, even due to how horrible it is for me when i leave the house, well me and my sister didn't want her to go to a nursing home, one reason being my mom worked in nursing homes before and she knew how terrible they were to people there, so we decided to keep her at home and help her whenever she needed it.. 

i was woken up on December 9th by my sister cause she needed help getting my mom onto her portable toilet. we had been helping her off and on for around a week, so at this point it was nothing new. when we got her onto the toilet, she started leaning forward after about  30 seconds, and we asked ""Mom what's going on?"" she said ""I don't know"" and then started snoring. i tuned her head around and her eyes were blank, and she made these weird contorted movements like she was going into a seizure.. i started screaming mom, mom all you ok?! and i told my sister to call 911, then she started gasping for air like she was dying.. so that threw the whole ""Seizure"" thing out the window, and i knew exactly right then what was going on... she was dying from a blood clot that had gone to her lungs...

911 said to get her on the floor, and so somehow me and my tiny sister did, my sister started CPR on her, and when she did she said she felt all of her ribs break, (Which she is still crying over a full week later) EMS finally got here, they basically acted like there was not much they could/would do, and my mother passed away on this Terrible, cruel goddamned year of 2020, just weeks away from Christmas. 

my mother wasn't just a mother to me, she was my best friend.. she sheltered the absolute shit out of me, but she was still my best friend.. 

when she left the Hospital the doctor said ""We called your VERY IMPORTANT Prescriptions into your Pharmacy"" we fought EVERY SINGLE DAY calling the hospital and her pharmacy to find out why the Pharmacy didn't have them. including her blood thinner to keep her from GETTING Blood Clots.

so id love to sue the doctor/hospital/pharmacy SOMEONE over my dear mothers death, but my sister says it's hopeless, she thinks everything is hopeless, though.. 

My mom didn't speak to her sister, or her kids for 7 years, because my aunt went Ballistic on her over petty crap, including more down below in the story of my fucked up life, i went while she was in the hospital and told them what was going on, because they claim to be ""Good Christians"" so i hoped they'd make peace with her, INCASE She died. they did not. my cousin claimed my mom said ""i want nothing to do with you or any of the rest of the family"" but he is either lying, or was lied to by his mom (my aunt) because i was in the room that day of the phone call, and my mom simply said ""if you don't want to speak to me anymore, ill leave you alone like you want""

so now that my mom is gone, we have NO family, it's literally me and my sister... that's it.. 

especially fun around Christmas, btw.. 

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

here is where my problems have started, what i need advice with, ect.. 

she was on my Disability as my Payee i think it's called, im scared they're going to cut my Disability off because she's gone now, i had thought of putting my sister on as my Payee, but i don't know anything about it.

My mom was in the process of selling our home.. she was over 65, so it didn't matter how much money came into her bank account (from what i was told) but that's a different story for me, my mom had already signed the papers, and we was supposed to move out on (or before) the 31st of December.. as you can imagine this whole thing has thrown all that into chaos..

me and my sister found out that we can live on just our disability payments without starving, but we'll have to stop paying on some of the things my mom ranked up in debt, like JTV, but im not paying JTV over us eating, so that's whatever i guess..

we took money out of my moms bank account to have her Cremated, we wanted to bury her by my Dad... but one of the reasons me and my sister have NO extended family now is due to what they did to my Dad after he was buried, my moms Sister ""my Aunt"" paid to have my dad buried... then MY MOM Got sued by someone in the family saying she died on the paperwork and put him in a reserved plot from a distant family member.. this distant family member made the graveyard Dig my dad up, and move him into another plot.. a year and change later, so i got to see my Dad's bones, hair, black sludge being scooped out of his grave, because of this human piece of shit.. my Mom's Sister sided with this asshole, even though my mom had NO PART in the burying of my Dad, she was so shaken up at the time she couldn't even get out of bed, for MONTHS afterwards.. 

so we wanted her Cremated, we did everything we could to get the money to do it, of course now we've got little money to live on until we get more.. my dad had a handgun we tried to sell to my dad's side of the family, who are into that sort of thing.. but we honestly don't know them very well, so that didn't work. my dad bought it like 10 years ago, far as i know it's got a serial number on it, but im scared to take it to a gun store or some crap, cause what if it was used in a murder or robbery or some crap? i just wanted to sell it for like $500 so we'd have money to eat on, plus with all the stress and depression, i don't like the idea of owning one, for obvious reasons. i live in texas where i was told by an online friend you don't need paperwork to sell a handgun, but idk man.. 

also the people my mom was selling the house too still want to buy it, but they said i needed to sign an ""Addendum"" or something, im so afraid we're about to lose our house now too because who can you trust, right? 

if anything, this is a cautionary tale of why NOT to shelter your kids, and help them learn how to be an adult, cause i tell you, ive never felt so depressed, useless, worthless... stupid.. i have nobody to talk to but my sister, and we don't talk much.. i just feel so hopeless.. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I'm an idiot with debilitating anxiety who's parents while wonderful, never wanted me to leave home, so never taught me anything, and now that they're dead, im lost, scared and leaning on the semi ""End it all"" options

btw, tiny parts of this was slightly changed, and this is a burner account, cause i don't want anyone i know in person to know about me ranting and crying about all this, in case they do somehow see it..

if you're able to respond and help me with ANYTHING, please do.. because im so depressed, and i feel like nobody in the world cares..",16Dec2020,1

Hour ago, I went to shower. My gf is asleep, I was working late. This is common. When I came back from the shower though, all the lights in the flat were turned off. Now my first thought was that gf woke up and turned them off, but as I woke her up, she said that she did get up, but only to let cat our of the room, and it was already dark. And she has no history of sleepwalking.

At this point I'm scared. As I have mentioned, it's not uncommon for me to stay up way later than her, and I NEVER turn off the lights before I go to sleep. I need to bring a glass of water, charger, find clothes etc. What I'm trying to say, I find it unlikely that it was a tired brain fart. Power of habit I guess.

The light switches were in OFF position, and they are old-school mechanical ones.

Now, the door is locked, I checked every corner of the flat to make sure noone made it inside. Both of our keys are still in place.

I want to believe I'm scared because I'm tired and it's late, but it's still freaking me out. What could be the explanation? How do I sleep now?

156,"My (28F) partner of 8.5 years (28M) goes to band practice on Saturdays about every other week. During the pandemic, they've stopped according to restrictions &amp; laid off when they felt it wasn't safe or if they were going to have contact with family within 2 weeks of practicing.

This weekend, the band members have decided they want to turn band practice into an opportunity to bond, to grow stronger together as grouped musicians by partaking in certain party-related ""activities"" during their session Saturday.

I love the members of this band; they are also my friends. I don't want to hold them back from playing or achieving this growth together, I fully support it &amp; everything they create together. Their music feeds my soul. It's not that I don't think they are responsible, it's that how can anyone *know* what will happen? What if my partner comes down with something before Christmas?

Since we are visiting my partner's mom's house for Christmas Eve, I have been expressing that I feel it is very risky &amp; cutting it way too close, considering our state is currently at 50,000+ new cases per day, &amp; we live in an urban area.

My partner insists it is no different than any other band practice, yet he plans to spend the night in a house that is not his household, &amp; they conduct band practice indoors. According to our medical experts, there should be no gatherings indoors with people outside of the household.

My fear is that they will be drinking &amp; having fun &amp; not stay conscious of how close they are in proximity to each other &amp; how much they are sharing surfaces, items, substances, whatever it may be. They'll be frequenting the bathroom more for obvious reasons due to drinking, &amp; I'm scared of the implications of all of this.

I will admit I am upset that we have made the difficult decision to not travel &amp; see my parents in Florida this year for fear of bringing anything to them or anyone in their community, &amp; now he wants to essentially go to a party - albeit small (5 guys) - of attendees who all come from separate households, but have been quarantining &amp; remaining isolated at home, less than 1.5 weeks before we go to his mom's house for the holiday.

The kicker is: **My partner was sick with what was apparently a cold only 3 days ago. He did not get tested.** I did not get sick, but am still isolating.

I've expressed all of this, am asking him to read this before posting, &amp; I've said if he were to call/text his mother &amp; explain his intended plan &amp; ask if he is still welcome for Christmas, I would put this to rest &amp; he won't hear another peep out of me in protest. He doesn't want to do so, &amp; so I've said if he chooses to go, I will have no choice but to tell her out of consideration &amp; respect for her &amp; her household that she is inviting us into.

I've also urged him to consider asking if they can't make this plan for after Christmas, when we know nobody will be seeing any family &amp; he can remain quarantined for at least 2 weeks after. He is calling me an A. So Reddit, any advice? Am I in the right here?

TL;DR: Partner wants to go to weekly band practice but end it by partying &amp; spending the night in another's household during the pandemic. Am I unreasonable for vocalizing my fears about this &amp; asking if it can't at least wait until after the holidays?",16Dec2020,1
157,"I have had a hard time piecing together the knowledge/wisdom I’ve gained in life. At this point I don’t know who I am or what I want or how to just live life.

About 4 years ago, during my sophomore year of college, I had a huge realization about my life. I realized I was hanging with the wrong crowd, not focusing on things that were good for me, and overall leading a life that was far from the one I wanted. It was quite the experience and one I will certainly never forget. It shook me to my core and made me realize I wasn’t seeing things clearly, only partially and through a troubled, murky mind at that. All of my beliefs and actions were called into question. I dropped out of college to focus on myself and regroup, hoping to find a better way for me; however, 4 years later I’m still struggling to piece things together and make something of my life.

I have had to confront many worries of mine and have made some progress but I still am so damn lost after all of this. I have made a lot of changes since then but my confusion still lingers to this day. I tried college 2 more times (I recently dropped out again this semester). I have worked a couple different jobs and even moved to a college town to try and live out on my own for once. But I’m still stuck. I have tried many therapists and many medications to help with the general/social anxiety and depression but those haven’t worked. At this rate I don’t know what to do.

I have a few good friends. I have a family that loves me, although there are some complications there. I am somewhat healthy - I quit drugs and only have a few beers once in awhile at most. I’m lucky to be where I’m at all things considered, but through all of it I have felt like a shell of myself for a majority of that time. Sure I have some good moments and some good times where I feel good about life, but those are few and far between. So I don’t know... I guess I’m reaching out to see if there’s a way to change things, something I’m missing here because clearly I’m not getting it.

I don’t know who I am or what I want or how to live this life. It’s (I believe) our only chance to experience consciousness, a brief flash of light between two eternities of darkness. It’s incredible to be anything at all. It’s a lot ya know... I have siblings I love and want to see grow. I have an opportunity to live my life and make the most of it. But this mental shit.. the anxieties and depression, the issues I have socializing and getting things, they’re hard to shake. So I’m trying. I want a good life. I want to do good. I want to be a great person who seized the day and lived a swell life, not just for myself but for others and the world around me.

I have a big heart. I want the best for others. I want to do good. But how that looks, how that happens, I don’t know. I have no idea what to do anymore. I can’t piece together this puzzle and it’s starting to get really fucking annoying. I’m overwhelmed. I don’t know how to live, just LIVE LIFE like everyone else seems to be able to do. I feel anxiety about so many things and I’m so uncertain about everything. I don’t know what role to play in this life, who I want to be or what I want to represent or what have you. I can’t stress this enough - all I know is that I don’t know. I don’t know how to live this life and accept it all. It’s so overwhelming to me.

I could go on and on and on forever about this stuff because it is constantly there in the back of my mind no matter where I’m at. I’ve been stripped of the present by a pressing future and a nagging past. I want to LIVE and not just exist and not just waste my time here but I haven’t felt like I really have in so long...

So any advice about moving forward and making the most out of this life despite the absurdity, despite the unknowns, despite it all... would be greatly appreciated.",16Dec2020,1

167,"Before anyone says anything, yes I know I shouldn't have cheated in the first place and I'm only now feeling bad because I might have gotten caught. I realize that. I'm just not sure what to do.

Last week, we had an open note/book final and my professor gave us 48 hours  to complete it. It was not proctored and it wasn't monitored.

I  answered every question to the best of my ability but couldn't figure  out one of them. I decided to just look it up and found an answer on Chegg and just put it down because I had basically given up at that point which was pretty dumb in hindsight. 

Apparently, at least two  other people put the same answer and I got an email this morning saying  that there's evidence of an academic integrity violation. The penalty is an F in the class and a report to the Office of Student Life.

She asked me to schedule a Zoom meeting or send an email explaining myself.  I emailed her asking what she would like me to do and haven't heard from her and it's been like 9 hours. One of the other people who used it  has already had their meeting and attempted to explain the logic behind  their answer.

I'm inclined to just admit to it and accept the consequences but I don't want to screw over everyone else. Part of me is also saying to just plead ignorance and deny any wrongdoing as I don't want my to fail the class and have my record ruined because of a small part of one question on one test. Once again, I know this is entirely my fault and I shouldn't have done it in the first place if I was that worried about this. That's in the past and I'm here now so I'm not sure what to do. 

What would you suggest I do here?

But right now my best friend is going through something. And i need help on what to do. Not what to do to help him but what i should do for me. Brw i am 16 year old male and he is 17.

I posted here yesterday and it helped but only got 1 response and things have changed.

Friday night im at my house with him playing basketball and working out. Everything is fine and we are having a good time laughing and talking. After a few hiurs his dad picks us up and we head to his house to spend the night and eventually got to sleep around 5 am. I head home at about 9:30 am and everything is still good. Come 5 pm i try to contact him cause he left a few stuff at my house. No response. I though he was busy and i will try again later. 

I left my phone for about a minute and came back to it to 3 missed calls from his grandma. I called her back and she informed me bret ran away and left his phone and if i knew where he was. I did not. After bret hasnt responded to his gf for a while she texts me to see where he is and i gave her the bad news. So to help calm her down i texted his nan to see what happened and he showed back up about an hour before i texted her. I told her to get some sleep cause she needed it and i would see what happened in the morning. At this point ik he has his phone back cause his nan told me but he has ghosted all of his friends... kind of. 

We are on this app called ifunny (ik you can hate me later) and he supposedly gave his account to a trusted friend called “diggle.” That name is an arrow reference and that is brets favorite show. None of his friends have heard of this guy before until now so immediately i had my suspicions. Some time passes and its pretty obvious that its him acting like this so called diggle. I texted him on the app and he said i was not on the “list” of people to talk too. I am his best friend, at least that is what he has been saying for the past few years. I texted him on snapchat and got him to respond (its a little complicated how i got him to respond) and he said that he has ghosted everyone because he didnt want it to affect them including his gf. I think he is being manipulative by saying he isnt talking to us so it doesnt affect us but pretending to be diggle and only messing with us more. And may i add in that he has said stuff like “are you two even right for each other” and “arnt you toxic together” to his gf. Idk what to fo for me. I have found put he has been suicidal for the past few years through his gf recently. Also, “diggle” (which im convinced is him) randomly sends stuff like a selfie of him in a mirror with the captions “ready for a job interview” and a vid of him vibing to music in a car drinking bang lip syncing saying that is what bret has sent him, but nothing else.

Please help. Should i drop him as a friend or what should i do?",16Dec2020,1
177,"I am a 20 year old female. I haven’t really told anyone about this and I feel like I really don’t want to let go of my boyfriend. There may be some triggers (brief description of sexual assault and self harm). So I’ve been dating my bf for 3 years now. He was my high school crush and I was absolutely obsessed with him. Toward the beginning of our relationship, there were two instances of physical abuse and one instance of sexual abuse, which I never addressed at the time. I just let it go. I am really confused about the whole thing and am wondering if I can ever truly forgive him. The first time, we were arguing and I laying on his bed and he choked me. I immediately asked him why he put his hands on me and he tried to justify it. I just let it go. The second time, we were arguing and he punched me in the shoulder, close fisted, full force. I was shocked by the pain and it knocked the breath out of me. At first he didn’t care, but then he started crying talking about how horrible he felt. The sexual assault happened before we started dating. We were having sex in his car, and he was hitting my cervix (super painful) so I asked him to please stop. He kept going and I started crying and begging him to stop but he wouldn’t. I asked him to please stop several times. I didn’t address that at all and it was as if it was blocked from my mind. I didn’t even accept that it was a sexual assault until recently. I didnt really understand or know how to cope with these feelings and I started cutting myself. I’ve been reflecting on these events and decided to talk to him about it. He hasn’t done anything like these things since, and when I brought it up to him he begged my forgiveness and told me he’d never do it again. I truly do think he’s changed some but I don’t know if I can get over it. We kind of broke up twice over it but I keep chickening out. I really don’t think I could break up with him even though if I’m being honest with myself I feel like it’s the only way I can move past this. I really don’t think I have it in me to do it.

So I’m a 23 yo guy and I’ve never been too social, had 2 friends in elementary school, 0 in middle school, 0 in high school + 2 significant others, and currently in college I have 1 friend and had 1 SO. 

I’ve never gone to a party, been drunk, done drugs, i went to 2 concerts in high school but nothing since. I also have no talents like being able to play an instrument/sing, etc.   
All the partners I’ve had I’ve met on the internet (though I did meet 2 of them in person after) so it’s hard for me to socialize now that I’m an “adult” and have no idea what to do.

Sooo with that background, I was wondering, how should I go about meeting people, socializing in general.

180,"A little backstory. Our local plant had a couple employed here. They had a falling out at home and it overflowed into the workspace resulting in one being terminated for harassment. The still employed one never wanted the other fired but wanted the harassment to end.

Fast forward to today (1.75 years later).

The employee informs me, in passing conversation, that our supervisor has been informing the aforementioned ex-employee of their work schedule. Beyond the obvious safety risks, this is an obvious breach in ethics and professional conduct. If it were a lower employee causing the issues I could let it pass as per the request of the employee, but being a supervisor it seems like a road we don't need to continue down. 

I'm below the supervisor, but above the other employee. The employee doesn't want anything said out of fear of retribution or us losing our jobs. In my eyes, the supervisor is enabling continued harassment and the only right thing to do is report it to our internal office that handles ethics breaches.

181,"I am going to start this out by saying that I was in a relationship with someone from high school when I first went away to college. A mutual friend that I met when we were young (about 13/14) and I enrolled at the same college. For the sake of anonymity, let's call him Tim. Tim and I became pretty good friends after about 2-3 weeks of being at the school together. We did practically everything together - went to the gym, dinner, library, drinking, shopping, etc. Because Tim and I were so close, my now ex became a literal insane person. My ex knew about the friendship Tim and I had but he began to get very jealous and possessive. He would ask where I was, who I was with, what I was wearing, if I was drunk/doing drugs, and then would always finish the convo off by calling me a slut or some other derogatory term. Once my ex began acting this way I ended up breaking up with him (which was a huge deal to me - I did not want to break his heart but I couldn't put up with his shit anymore.)

Maybe a month after we broke up I realized that there was a lot of chemistry and sexual tension between Tim and I. We got into an argument one night because I went out for drinks with friends and yelled up to his window that we needed to talk. I told him, due to liquid courage, that I knew he had the hots for me which he denied, and an argument ensued. We did not speak for a week or so until we went out with a group of friends one night and he found the courage to kiss me. We laughed about our argument and I told him that I had thought about us being together sexually. We ended up going back to his place and we were going to have sex but we didn't. I told him that I didn't like the way he acted during our argument and he made me feel bad. After this I felt like I led him on so I tried to get up, get dressed, and leave but he pulled me back into bed and just held me until we fell asleep. The next morning we got up and walked to class together but we never talked about that night ever again.

We remained friends for a year or so and we would randomly make out for fun at parties. He was sleeping with other girls but I was never the type to sleep around (I maybe had 1 or 2 sexual partners at the time.) We got into an argument about something else and he pushed/shoved me rather than resolve the issue (it was over something really stupid.) I was really hurt by that and we didn't talk for over a year because I didn't reach out but neither did he. We have seen each other a few times since then and we've been courteous but our friendship was never the same. Fast forward to last year. We ended up getting wasted with a few friends and he gave me a heartfelt apology. I don't hold a grudge so we buried the hatchet. His friends kept joking around about how we would make a beautiful couple which we laughed about. It got late and he lives around the corner from the bar we were at so Tim, our mutual friend, and I went back to his place. Once our mutual friend fell asleep Tim came onto me and I honestly LOVED IT. Sad thing is that I am in a long term, serious relationship that I would ruin if I were to do anything with Tim.

I still think about Tim a lot which I feel guilty about because of my relationship. I love my SO with my whole heart but I still think about what could have been with Tim and I, if we would work out or wouldn't, how the sex would be. A few of our mutual friends have told me (and probably him) that we're made for each other. I don't know if he only wanted me because he couldn't have me - both times I was in a relationship. But now I have turned him down twice.

I fear that if I do break it off with my SO (not because of this there are other issues) that Tim might turn me down. Please give me some guidance or advice! We aren't nearly as close as we used to be but I think there might still be something there. I don't know if he just wants to be with me because it will make him seem cool around his friends. I also have never known if he truly likes me or just wants to sleep with me. I want to get this off my mind and be at peace with it because it's been eating away at me for 5 years.

TL;DR: I may have feelings for an old friend but I am currently in a serious relationship and don't know what to do.",16Dec2020,1
182,"I’m wondering if anyone can give some advice in regards to requesting a significant raise/salary bump? TLDR at the end. 

I’d like to preface this by saying I understand that I am in no way entitled to a raise/bonuses, etc, and that I also understand this has been an insane year where myself and others have been required to go above/beyond planned expectations due to COVID. I also understand that I am incredibly privileged to still have a job right now. Still, I’m wondering if anyone can help with advice on how to make my salary seem fair. 

I’ll try to make this as short as i can with some backstory- 

Basically, I was hired in Jan 2020 for a social media position at a nonprofit. Starting salary of $40k with annual raises and end-of-year/holiday bonuses. The expectation was to manage social media channels, write blog posts, and take photos/videos occasionally. I accepted the job without hesitation because it provided benefits and was an upgrade from my part-time/freelance graphic design work. 

COVID hit about 3 months after i started, and with this, my position changed so that i was helping the entire agency transition to virtual-based efforts. In addition to my regular social media responsibilities, I built websites, recorded/editing videos for online programming, transitioned multiple in-person events to being entirely online, etc. And, once people learned I had a background in design, that somehow became a major request/component of my job.

It’s gotten to the point where I am often working on projects outside of my regular 40-hr week. I’m technically in a “senior” position, so I only have one manager above me, and they are on the brink of retirement and don’t put in much effort (can’t help much with modern software, and is more of a PR-spokesperson).

Because of the pandemic, our nonprofit has taken a major hit due to lack of state funding, and we’ve recently been told we’re on a salary freeze with no bonuses this year. This is totally understandable, but also frustrating a) because I considered that part of my expected salary from when I was hired, and b) I am in a higher cost of living area and living paycheck to paycheck on the current salary. 

I would like to still apply for a raise because I feel like my job has not consisted of anything I was told it’d be. After looking into it more, i found that my “senior” position averages $55k+ a year, and the work I’ve primarily been doing (web/graphic design/videography) is also above my pay grade, especially considering it’s being done on top of my regular job duties. It’s also been suggested that this work will need to be continued after the pandemic is over and office life returns to normal. After working the figures, comparing salary averages, and figuring out the stats of what was expected vs what was actually accomplished, I feel as if my estimated salary should be at least $65k. 

So this brings about my question/need for advice: Do I ask for a raise despite the financial situation of the agency? And if so, how to I ask for a salary that’s over 1/3 MORE than what I’m currently being paid?

Thanks for any help/advice! 

TLDR: I’ve been going above/beyond my job expectations and working outside my pay rate - how do I ask for an enormous raise (fair compensation) when our company lacks funds and I should just be happy to have any job at all?",16Dec2020,1

currently 20 and I’ve been doing some casual online uni since 2018 and working jumping around places. Currently making about £30k a year but what I’m doing right now there’s no progression, it’s not an career however it’s easy money.

I’ve recently been trying to make a big decision on focusing doing full time online uni along with an accountant qualification and quitting my job but what if it doesn’t work out like how I planned where I don’t get a First class degree. I’ll end up worse then I am now 2 years down the line. But if I don’t commit to full time uni it’ll take me another 4 years to get a degree n even longer counting experiences and extra qualifications I need but I’d still be making money on the side. 

I’ve taken a week off work to see how I’d cope with a week just for studying (I normally only get 1 or 2 days a week for study) and it’s clear my doubts constantly creeps up which made me stay in bed 2/7 days in the past week where I just didn’t want to get up and face the possibility of making the wrong decision, I don’t know if that’s just the pressure of only having one week to figure it out or if it’ll get worse after I make the decision.

She spends all day, every day, 7 days a week going from shop to shop to talk to the people who work there. 

Shes very hard to understand and repeats everything 3-4 times. 

But the problem is... lately she's started getting more comfortable. She grabs my hands while I'm trying to do something to look at my nails and pull my fingers. 

Tries to take my keys for the Jewelry cupboards and constantly interrupts all of us while we're trying to work. It's distracting and it means I don't get much done. She can be in the shop two or three times a shift for 20 mins each. 

I'm new to this job and don't want to make mistakes that mean they won't keep me after the holidays.

He eventually got married and found God. His wife urged him to try and connect with us. Truthfully I don't actually think any of us really cared considering my oldest brother has a different unknown dad, and the rest of us already had separate lives at that point. The years after have been mostly the same, we talk here and there. Before covid hit a lot of us were at my brothers kicking back. Our dad showed up and started drinking with us which was fine he's actually pretty funny. 
He pulled me aside and told me I was not his daughter. I asked who was my real dad then he said it was his friend who I'll call Sam for now. Sam and my aunt were together around that time If what my dad said was true my mom would have started an affair with my aunts BF. Unfortunately Sam is now deceased so I can't ask him. I asked my mom who absolutely blew up and called my dad to cuss him out she stated everythinghe said was a blatant lie.

My parents forced me into college because “you‘ll never make money without a degree”. Well I HATE college. I have zero motivation for what I’m making, my art classes don’t inspire me (one of them is so strict that we are not allowed to put in any creativity, my professor wants our art exactly how she draws). The only class I like is English composition. I have gotten almost 100/100 on all assignments for this class and I actually enjoyed doing them. Other than that, college is just not what I expected. I feel like I could do so much more if I wasn’t in college like save for a condo and look for a third job. Currently, I work at a veterinary hospital as a kennel assistant and I love it. I also work as a pet sitter (most jobs I’ve had are animal related). If I wasn’t in college, I would work day shift at a boarding facility (was offered a position) and could save up my money instead of wasting it at college were I’m half assing my work. But I am also considering changing my major into something animal related, not sure what.. but I still don’t know if I could get motivated.

210,"I’m in my fourth year of a psychology degree, and I recently switched from University 1, to university 2. University 2 told me that most of my classes would transfer over, but I asked about a very particular class (let’s call this class A) because I took it at university 1, and university 2 only offers it in the fall. This course is required in my program, and is also a prerequisite for class B. I was told that class A would transfer, but halfway through the current semester they informed me that it did not actually transfer. This means that I now have to wait until fall 2021 to take course A, so that i can take course B to graduate. Had they told me when I initially switched schools, I would have taken course A during this fall semester so that I could graduate in Spring 2021 as originally planned. 

(University B also failed me in a course that I literally could not get into for the first month. I have proof of me trying for 1 straight month to gain access to the zoom meetings for the class, and proof of the professor replying with “this isn’t my fault” repeatedly.  I missed 12 lectures and the first exam, and when I brought this to the schools attention nothing came of it, so I’m already very frustrated with the school.) 

Now my graduation date is delayed by at least 1 full year. At this point, I’m not sure that it’s even worth it to finish the degree. On one side, I’m almost done (6 more courses needed) and have already invested so much time and money into this that dropping out now feels like a kick to the teeth. That being said, I do not need this degree to pursue my career, and the fact that they delayed my graduation by at least 1 full year because of one course is really discouraging. 

If I continue on and finish my degree, I will not be able to put as much time and commitment into building my career. This will delay raises, work related learning opportunities, and work related certifications that will directly impact my success in this career. However, it will mean that the 40,000 I’ve spent on my university education would have some sort of pay off.

If I drop out now, I will be able to immediately take a certification that will directly benefit me and my job, make more money, and likely feel no real negative impact from not having a degree. At this point, finishing the degree is solely to say I did it, as I hate being a failure. 

So I ask for your help, Reddit. If you were me, what would you do? Suck it up and finish the degree slowly over the next 1.5-2 years? Or save my time and money and drop out?",16Dec2020,1
211,"Let's get the important details out of the way: we live in Australia so it is hot. We also have a six month old daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

THe air con in our flat broke last week and so we promptly contacted our property manager as soon as we saw the problem. We filled out the request on their website as per the terms and conditions in our tenancy agreement. 

Nothing happened.

After giving them a week to respond, we called them today (I tried calling yesterday too but the office staff had all knocked off early for the day) and a young woman answer saying that, aww sorry, the company has changed policies and they no longer take maintenance requests via their website and we needed to print, complete, and scan a maintenance request form. 

We were *never* told about this. No emails, calls, or texts to notify us about a change in terms and conditions. So of course, after giving the girl a thorough telling-off and letting her know that this lack of notice is completely unacceptable, we filled out the form and sent it away. 

Then I received another email. This one was clearly sent out to everyone. It said that they are closing the office for Christmas break from 18th December. That gives only *tomorrow* for the repairman to come and fix the air conditioner. 

I have no faith in these people. Late last year all their really great staff who we'd spent years building a rapport with were either promoted or moved on to better endeavors and they were replaced by young girls in their twenties. These girls leave the office at three everyday (Office hours are supposed to be 8 until 5), go on hour-long breaks, and treat us tenants as though we are disobedient children. I do not believe these girls will be at all organized or professional enough to have organized a repair person by tomorrow. So... what are my options?

219," 

Me and my brother have always been at odds with each other. He is a very....""real"" person. Very detail and goal orientated. He believes in the ""facts"" and only that and refuses to see things from a different perspectives other then his own eyes. Very judgmental of people who don't follow the standard life route. He got all A's in school, went to college for business, got a very nice job, an amazing wife and now has a daughter.

I am the opposite. I'm a dreamer. I don't follow the conventional route. I quit school early, have had different jobs with different skill sets. I'm open minded and always try to see things from other peoples points of view. I never judge someone based where they were in life or how they chose to live their life.

For years we would battle and clash, some times physical in my teen years. I had a history of lying and fibbing, but since then I've grown to the point where I may lie about small things once in awhile but as everyone else in my family will say, I've truly become a much better person.

He moved away in about 2014 and from then on we barely talked. Every now and then, we would see each other at birthday parties etc.

About two years ago in 2018 I attempted suicide. I came to my senses and decided to start living and better myself. I remember him calling me in the hospital, telling me he cared for me and wanted to work on our relationship and make it better.

Well since then I've tried to build on that. I moved to the same city as him and the rest of my family, I would call and text him, ask him to hangout and get together. I came to really respect my brother and held nothing but love and admiration for him. He would always have a reason why he couldn't get together with me though (work, tired, date plans with his wife) or he would flat out ignore my messages. Not only that but I focused on myself. I became more self sufficient then what I was, I focused more on what I wanted to do in my life and the person I wanted to be. I guess it turns out that person isn't what HE was wanting me to be.

Presently I felt that while we may never have that brotherly bond others have, I was content and felt that he had finally accepted me for who I am and the person I have been becoming. The rest of the family has and they all greet me with open arms and love for who I am.

Sunday the 13th he, in a group chat with all the other family members, openly showed his disdain for me. We had all been joking and talking shit to each other the entire night, at some point he thought I was messaging him off of my mothers phone and demanded that I confess. While I had sent one message on her phone, which I admitted to (Mine had died and she sat there and typed the message out for me), she assured him that everything else was her messaging.

The basic sum of the message he sent went that "" I only added you to this group chat because I was asked to. You are nothing but a liar and would always be one, therefore your opinion DOES NOT MATTER"". He then followed it up with another message that said ""I do not believe that these messages haven't been all him, I gave him enough chances to admit it, just typical of him to play the victim""

This really cut me to my core as, stated before, I believed we had finally gotten to a place where we both understood one another and that we had grown in each others eyes. Needless to say the rest of the family all got pretty upset, but outside of my parents, no one else confronted him or said anything to him about it. I never said anything back to him in the group chat outside of stating that I would leave the group chat.

I then decided that I would not go to our family Christmas Eve as I did not want to be around him, I did not want there to be any sort of tension during a happy celebration, and I did not want his wife and daughter to feel excluded should he decide not to go. I mentioned this to my mother and my father. My mother said she didn't know if she would go after what he said and as it turns out so did my father.

Cut to today (15th) and he calls him. I ready myself as I believe we are going to have a heart to heart talk, (my parents had been attempting to get us to talk since he said what he said),and that maybe he can see that I am a different person from who I was 10 years ago. He makes it clear right from the start that he meant everything he said, he does not have any respect for me and will not, and that the only reason why he was calling was to figure out the outcome so that my father would go to Christmas Eve. He did not care if my feelings were hurt, he did not care to make amends and said he would not apologize. He then goes on to say that I had ruined Christmas and acted like a child by saying I would stay home. He then says that he would be the adult (he continuously called me a child during the call), he would stay home so that I felt comfortable going as that would allow my father to go and let everyone else get together and that once again I had ruined Christmas.

The amount of hatred and disdain he openly showed towards me in the group chat and then him reinforcing that he meant all of it and then some over the phone call has hammered it into my brain that my brother will always have some deep seated hatred and anger towards me. I have felt nothing but love and admiration for him since I decided to become a better person, but he still holds onto his feelings for me. My father informed me that my brother has had these feelings for me since I was 15 and left school and has held onto them for all these years. He is spiteful, he is hateful, and I truly believe that he will not ever have respect or love for me as I had for him once.

I have made the decision to attend Christmas Eve with my parents and sisters family and if he shows up with his wife and daughter, then he shows up. But I truly and honestly believe that my brother has nothing but anger towards me and that after this we no longer see each other as Brothers or interact with each other. He's a stranger and nothing more....and it breaks my heart because I know it breaks my parents hearts as well....  


At this point I truly do not believe there is saving this relationship. My parents want us to be able to go to family functions together at some point, but I feel like that would be living a lie vs facing a hard truth. So i ask...do I simply go with my parents advice and just bury my feelings and put on a happy face for these family events we both will be at despite how uncomfortable I will be with him around, do I simply make the decision to not attend certain family events should he be there, or do I suggest working out a ""I go to this thing, he goes to that thing"" type of situation? (The latter I do not expect to be one that will be accepted).",16Dec2020,1
220,"this one's a bit long, i just wanted to get all the necessary details. 

this all happened this morning.

i woke up this morning and went downstairs to go eat a donut. there were six yesterday, and none today. i went to my 13 year old sister's room to ask her about it, and she said she had one. i asked, ""are you sure?"" and she said ""i had one yesterday and one today"". i clarified, ""so that's two donuts"". i was calm for this entire conversation. she instantly gets out of bed and tried pushing me out of her room, but i'm older (17, almost 18) so i didn't really move. instead she tackled me to the ground and began pushing me and hitting me. she had a history of being even more violent years ago, and we didn't get along for a long time because of it. i never fought back, and i thought she moved past that stage. i still didn't try to hit her back today.

i did try and push her off of me so i could walk away. she was rubbing my elbow into the carpet, but just last night at work i scratched it up really bad, probably about a square inch of skin just completely scratched off and bleeding, so i was in a lot of pain.

when i walked back to my room, i was crying because it felt like sandpaper was taken to my elbow. i texted my mom, but apparently so did my sister. she told our mom that i had berated her about the donuts and that i had pushed her down.

side note: i don't give a flying fuck about the donuts. i care that she was violent to me.

mom gets home, and she decides to believe my sister over me, even though i've never lied to her in my life, and my sister has a long history of doing so. i try re-explaining my story, but my mom decided she didn't want to hear any of it, and that i should walk away unless i wanna be punished.

tldr: my sister pushed me to the ground after i asked her a question, told our mom i did it, and mom is siding with my younger sister instead of me, and trying to punish me without fully hearing me out.",16Dec2020,1

And then I ripped her my chemical romance hoddie in half.... After going back and forth for about 15 minutes I told her that she would never be a vampire or witch and she bit me (keep in mind that she still had her vampire fangs in from cosplaying idk what) and I haven't talked to her since and I'm genuinely scared to talk to her in fear she will bite me again...

222,"Hey guys. I'm 15 and I live with my grandmother, and since christmas is coming up, she asked my brothers and i what we wanted for gifts. i said a macbook, because the laptop i have now is incredibly slow and old, and a macbook would be reliable and long- lasting, along with some other items. She had proceeded to tell me that a macbook couldn't happen, because it was out of our budget and we don't have that much money. I was slightly bummed out, but not really. I had told her i would look for a cheaper laptop. Today, while browsing Amazon, i added something to the cart and saw that the macbook had been ordered. Since then i have been filled with guilt and feel like i really don't deserve it and that i'm selfish. Does anybody else feel this way about things?",16Dec2020,1
223,"TL;DR - my father, who discriminates against my bf for his religion, threatened to hurt him and idk how to marry him and leave the family safely.

Bf (M32) and I (F23) have known each other for 2 yrs, both have stable jobs and great communication, very happy together, and we want to get married and start a life together.

My father discriminates against bf's religion, so he knows nothing about him as he refuses to speak or look at him. He likes control and for things to be his way or no way. He tells me I'm brainwashed and bf isn't a ""man"" and has a bad background (bf never inflicted his religion on me - father didn't even ask about his bg to know if it's bad). Once he realized things were serious, he threatened to hurt bf and disown me, and I hope he only disowns me. My goal is for us to stay safe.

My parents are divorced, I live with mom and sis but he pays bills. I can't move in with bf as it's frowned upon and I think illegal in this country.

My options are:

1. Get married and move to bf's place - he may hurt bf or may accept it and disown me,  idk which is more likely as he fakes being calm (then calls mom to complain) until it happens then he may explode.
2. Move into a flat for financial independence and distance, and then I'll marry bf and move in - he may still hurt bf but less likely, but it might just piss him off more idk.
3. Get married and flee to another country - takes time to look for work and a place, and father would definitely be mad so I can't return to see mom.

**Do you see any other options? If you're a conservative parent, what would you think?**

**What kind of conversation can I have with father to know if it's a real threat or just talk?**

There's no way I'm leaving bf just because my father says so - he can't commit to a relationship himself (cheated on mom for 14 years) so I wouldn't take his relationship advice or let him decide who to be with. I know he wants a christian boy who drinks and parties with many friends, and has a 6 pack cause that's \~what makes you a ""man""\~.",16Dec2020,1

My partner always talks about how hard it is dealing with her. 

My partner had to recently moved back home because of the pandemic and being out of job. She stays for a few days but since I have roommates we are trying be mindful of the situation we are in, btw she is at home all the time not really doing anything but I want to respect my roommates.

227,"Hello everyone! Posting this on my second account as my boyfriend and I are frequent reddit users. I’m in my early 20s and am on a budget. For my boyfriend who is a few years older than me, I am always expected to spend around $50 on him. I didn’t get his parents anything for Christmas last year, but as I’ve seen them more often this year, I feel I should get/craft them something small for the holidays. Does anyone have any inexpensive ideas that would be nice to give them? My budget is around $25-30 dollars or less. 

Truthfully, I just don’t know if it’s even worth getting them a gift as what I would be able to spend is pocket change for a working adult. But maybe someone can give me some insight on this.

229,"Hey people of reddit, this is kind of a tough one to type out but I am seriously lost and feel so alone in this world right now. I'm a 20 (almost 21) year old man, and I have literally done nothing with my life. I had a pretty fucked up childhood (my step-mom constantly cheats on my dad, massive fights would break out, I was forced to choose a side otherwise they would both hate me, they would make up, and I would be forced to deal with passive-aggressive comments/actions from the person whom I sided against, usually my step-mom. Which has been going on since I was at least 8 years old.) So basically I was only loved by them under the condition that I took their side when shit hit the fan.  


Obviously, this shouldn't affect my life in the way it has, but I have 0 support from my parents, my step-siblings moved out a while ago and I don't talk to them anymore, and I'm slowly starting to drift away and lost touch from my friends since they're going places and I'm stuck in the same place i was since high school. Originally, I wanted to go into the military, because it would mean a free one way ticket away from my emotional trauma, but when I brought it up to my parents, they were furious and began to belittle my life choice. However, I really thought i would be able to get out so I lost the 60 pounds i needed to lose to join, but again my parents wouldn't help me with anything. I didn't get my ID till i was 19 (with the help of my friend, not my parents) so i was shit out of luck with the military.  


So, i decided to try college, of course my parents were relieved, but i needed a way to pay for it. (additional information: my step-mom has a whole different life with her boyfriend and his two kids. outside of her life with my dad (her husband) to which she takes half of my dads salary to pay for a second house where her boyfriend and his kids can live, as well as spending money on her lazy, good for nothing boyfriends gaming addiction. ex. buying the new PlayStation for him in exchange for our groceries or rent.) My parents haven't filed their taxes since 2015, and for FAFSA, you need your parents tax returns. My step-mom said she would pay for my first semester ""with her own money"" (she doesn't have a job, only a fake job that she created so she can go live her second life.) Thankfully, my college had a payment plan that would split my tuition into 3 different payments over 3 months. Time goes by in the semester, and we miss the first payment, I finally convince my step-mom to pay the payment but by that time the second payment was already due, and then the third, and now its the end of the semester and I still can apply for next semester classes until I finish paying off my tuition, and my parents still haven't done their taxes, so I'm stressed on whether I will be able to attend another semester or not.  


It was a long story, and if you read this far, thank you for taking the time. The real question is how would someone with no mode of transportation, no help from family, and zero self-confidence, make an actual difference in their life? I'm at the point where every day i hear my friends having fun without me (the only people who i genuinely trust and believe they love me unconditionally) and doing stuff with their lives, i grow increasingly depressed. I want to change and get better so i can become someone they would be proud to call their friend, but i really dont know where to start. It is all so intimidating and i feel lost and scared that ill make the wrong decision with everything I do. Anything helps, im seriously desperate at this point.",16Dec2020,1
230,"So I work a pretty normal job, 4 days a week in a part time position doing simple technical support work. I have a degree in my field and have been working here now for around 2 years.

Around the same time I was hired, a few weeks later another guy was hired who would take on a similar role. 

For a long time we got along, and still do, we're around the same age but I'm a little older, we make jokes and have fun but we also both work hard. Lately though, he has come to talking to me in a demeaning tone, if he wants help with something instead of saying ""hey would you be able to take a look at this?"" He says something more like ""I'd like you to do this"" or ""please do this.""

It's important to note we sit right next to each other, just a few metres apart, and yet he sends me messages and emails in a commanding tone, rather than just talking to me face to face and asking for help like a normal person.

Now my actual boss does send us both messages and emails that are to the point, asking us to do things, and I have no problem with that, because he is my boss and can say things however he wants

This co worker though really grinds my gears, I hate doing what he asks, not because I'm lazy but because he is so rude and it seems like he's just copying the way my boss messages us, but I don't think he gets the concept of a chain of command or a ""pecking order"".

What should I do next time he sends me emails or messages like this? I'm more than happy to help him and do things for him if he's busy, but not if he's going to treat me like I'm his personal assistant",16Dec2020,1

233,"I am trying to establish boundaries with a new roommate. He is a teenager. In one week of living here, he has been destructive, rude, bratty, and utterly inconsiderate. He has damaged my property.

While the boundaries have been now set up and agreed-upon (let's see if he follows them), I'm trying to get over the sheer disrespect he has shown me, and the foul language he used when I held him accountable.

At the moment, I'm letting the dust settle. I have screenshots of his unnecessary hostility and cursing, in case things escalate. But bringing up the foul language now would likely only ensure an escalation (due to his petulance), when I'd rather wait and see if he escalates in response to reasonable requests. Then I have more evidence when I take the matter to his parent (who is paying his bills). I'd prefer to keep this arrow in my quiver, and be smart, instead of responding to my hurt feelings and anger. Things are calmer now and he seems to be taking care of the rental property, so bringing this up now might do more harm than good. Besides, I can't handle more drama until drama arrives through his actions. I don't want to bring it up yet.

I need a way to deal with this. I have to play the long game, but in the meantime, I'm livid. I'm furious. I know teenagers have outbursts and act this way, and I know it's not a big deal to have some snot-nosed little baby fling some curses at you, but this is *my* home. I won't tolerate disrespect, and my screenshots of his behaviour are an extra piece of evidence I can show his parent and say, ""this needs to stop"". I'll be texting him all tenancy requests instead of asking in-person, so that way I can screenshot all responses, and keep them as evidence if he disagrees unnecessarily.

I don't want to make one incident than it needs to be. I need to let things calm down, and give this kid a chance to behave. It's his first time living out of home so he gets one more chance to prove he can be respectful. If he repeats this behaviour, I treat him like the child he is, and take the matter to his parent.

How do you stay calm in situations like this? How do you hold your tongue and wait, because you know an escalation either isn't worth it, or will cause the same problems you just tenuously solved?

Thank you. I hope you're having a good day.",16Dec2020,1
236,I’m a college student and obviously for any college student money is tight. I have two friends that I’m close with in college who are very into fashion and trends and shop at small expensive stores I have never even heard of (I’m more of a Walmart and Target girl). I’m not going to lie money is tight in my family right now as my mom searches for a new job but I worked this whole semester so I bought these two close friends Christmas presents. They are REALLY good at giving gifts and I figured that I would be the one to low ball the budget and was extremely worried about spending too little on them and having them buy me a large gift. Being one to usually spend around $20-30 on a gift I spent around $90 total on the both of them ($45 each and around $5-10 of it was for shipping). Now for a person that works a minimum wage job in between being a full time student that’s a lot of money. Well... turns out I spent way more money on them than they spent on me. I honestly don’t care what I received but I’m just kind of upset that I pressured myself into spending that much of my own money which I would never spend on anyone else. Obviously that’s money that could have gone towards books or tuition. I hope this doesn’t come across as selfish but I feel like I can’t let myself get over how much I spent originally to feel like I was “keeping up” with my friends and trying to impress them and then ultimately realize that even though my friends loved their gifts which I’m happy about I could’ve gotten them something great with a lower budget. I just feel like I’m in an awkward place now and am unsure of how to approach it. I’m worried about making my friends feel bad for the amount they spent on their gifts for me and now them thinking that this is the standard amount to give. I’m realizing quickly like I can’t spend $50 for every birthday and Christmas for each of my friends.

238,"I’ll be brief because I feel strange talking about my family like this. I’m in my mid twenties and I’ve always had issues with my family. My parents are really tough with discipline and don’t like things not going their way. This also includes my personal life decisions as well as my likes/dislikes, pretty much all matters relating to me.

I was oblivious to the fact that the issues were not only my fault. Sure I’m honest when I’m hurt, I call people out (including my family) when I feel I’ve been wronged but that’s just to straighten whatever has happen out and move past the issue.

I guess some back story is needed in order to get some sort of different perspective and/or advice because I feel like I’m on my last leg. I asked my mum to pass me some milk out of the fridge and I was ignored. I thought maybe she didn’t hear me so I waited for her to finish up with what she was doing at the fridge and I could get it myself. I decided to sit on a stool in the kitchen and started strolling through my phone. 

My mum has a habit of bringing up all my past shortcomings (failures or negative about me) when she’s angry (most of the time not at me. I sat through it and when she finished I asked her what I have done. She called me disrespectful and a disgusting ungrateful child. I asked why but my mum kept calling me names and insulting me. 

She called me rude and said I was not kind to her. This is where I snapped (I know I should have kept my cool but I guess my mum knows how to push my buttons). I said “I’m not rude or unkind, I’ve never been described that way. Why are you acting like you don’t even know me?” My mum replied with “you’re afraid of other people that’s why they think you’re kind but you ain’t shit.” I said “no when people act like a monster towards me I don’t back down and I can act like a horrible monster back. I won’t shout or get rude but they’ll know they’ve wronged me. I’m not scared of anyone, no one disrespects my boundaries to that point so there’s no need to see my nasty side. They’re not showing me theirs.” 

My mum kept quiet because I rarely respond back, I just let her get whatever she needs to say off her chest. This time I felt like this was some sort of character assassination and I couldn’t bare it. I snapped said things I shouldn’t have. My mum came after me, well about half another later and shouted at me calling me disgusting and disrespectful. I asked “what is it I have done exactly, I’d like more than anything to squashed there once and for all. We need to move past this because I don’t want to have this sort of relationship with you anymore, please help me fix us. 

My mum listened to what I had to say and started insulting me but this time laughing at me too. I got upset because I realised my mum doesn’t want to fix this ever. I begged her to just listen to me because I’m tired of this. She laughed at me and cut me off by speaking to my brother and diverting the conversation.

Now I’m sat on my bathroom floor crying. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to leave the house I grew up in but it’s constant problems and I’m not strong enough to take it. I’m not a nasty person and I’m hurt that this has to continue. I realised tonight that my mum isn’t going to meet me in the middle.

My gf and I went into one rest stop on the way here (we peed in little pee pods in the back of the U-Haul for the rest of the time and emptied them in the grass), and we went in a few restaurants to quickly pick up take out food.

We were one hour away and then my gf calls her parents to make sure they’re gonna wear masks when we get there, and they refuse and say that they are very careful outside so there is no reason to wear masks in their home. We explain we are uncomfortable with that especially since we’ve been traveling but they are refusing.

I live in Ohio and I’ve been in my apartment complex for a few months now. There’s this one guy who owns a full breed German Shepard in a different building from me, and I feel so bad for this dog. 

I have met the guy who owns him once before at the dog park when I was taking my dog out. I try my best not to judge people but it looked like he hadn’t showered in weeks, he smelled awful and the dog had missing patches of fur all over and I’m pretty sure has fleas. He told me he works 3rd shift and only takes his dog out once a day, and when he does take him out it’s maybe a five minute walk.
He lives on the bottom floor and I can see into his apartment sometimes and I’ve never once seen the dog out in the living room, plus his apartment looks like a hoarders. I only hear the German Shepard bark occasionally when I take my dog out and it sounds like he’s only kept in a bedroom. 
One time I was waiting in the leasing office and I overheard him say that they needed to clean up his balcony because his dog had popped all over it since he couldn’t take him out sometimes. 

I feel so bad for this dog, he doesn’t get any exercise, he’s missing patches of fur, and never gets to go outside, and I’m pretty sure he is kept in a cage literally all day. I’m not sure if I am able to contact anyone about animal abuse, or if there’s even enough reason for someone to come check on this dog.

242," Hello everyone, I need some advice if anyone could tell me what they think. I have this female friend I met online. She lives in Medellin, Colombia and I live in Texas, we have been chatting back and forth for about 9 months now. Well I have always been there to listen to her and assist her with her problems and she already knows I like her and I have said it to her before without actually saying the words I like her but either way, we are friends and have even talked about meeting IRL someday after all this mess with corona passes by. She has even told me multiple times she appreciates me and has told me that I have been there for her during difficult times in her life this year. Anyway, the problem is that this past week she outright tells me that she has a bad feeling about me and that she thinks I have been harassing her online on social media making her feel bad because she claims ""someone exactly like me"" has been the one harassing her. I fully admit that I can be pretty annoying at times and I do tend to text a lot at times when she takes too long to answer back but to outright accuse me of harassing her and purposely making her feel bad because I assume what she meant by someone exactly like me is the number of messages she has received or whatnot. I really have no idea what was even said to her so I do not know what is her problem. OK now, this past week after she tells me lets take a break while she figures things out she is ignoring me and has even blocked me on social media now. We communicate primarily on WhatsApp even though we have seen each other on webcam so I know for a fact she is a woman and I know for a fact the woman I talk to is real, But anyway I know she has not blocked me on WhatsApp yet because she has opened my texts from there which you can tell from the blue checkmarks that appear when a message is read. So anyway sorry for this long post nut my question is, WHAT DO I DO? should I just tell her f\*\*\* you for treating me like this and accusing me without evidence or should I just give her some time. She already knows I value our friendship more than anything almost and I have told her many times before a while back that I would place her well-being above my own if there were ever a choice. Can anyone please give me advice on this so I can figure out what I should do? If age is of any relevance she is 20 and I am 27 almost 28 now.",16Dec2020,1

My younger brother and sister lived with mom but there wasn't room for me... so obviously I had issues growing up. I made some friends through high-school and my life was relatively normal all the way up to freshman and sophomore year, I'd see my dad on weekends for a while and my mom sporadically when she had time and a more permanent housing situation. As I got older and my dad started seeing women more seriously it eventually got to a point i saw him 2x a year and rarely talked to him. He got remarried and put most of his time and energy with his new wife and newborn, oh well. 

Sophomore year during the summer before junior year my mother got a trailer in a trailer park within my school district and I was about to start at a vocational school for my last 2 years. She had a new long term boyfriend and unknown to me at the time they were on drugs. It started with me catching them smoking weed, and 16 year old me thought it was cool and started smoking with them. Then my friends came over and got into smoking weed with me and they'd sell it to us (WAY OVER PRICED BTW) and that became our hangout/party spot, we smoked and drank and partied. Within a year I caught them doing pills and got her to sell me some. I developed a habit quickly and by senior year my mom was single again and we were buying and using heroin together. By 17 I was addicted to heroin. I also got a girlfriend who new nothing about my habit and she was pregnant a couple months before I turned 18. In the 9 months before the baby was born she found out I was an addict and left me.

We lost the trailer and I ended up living in a hotel with my aunt, uncle, mom and her current bf and we were all using IV heroin. By the time my son had turned 1 I finally got sober from opiates. I got back with my sons mother and did everything I was supposed to. I worked, paid bills, took care of my family and was happy for a time. I had multiple of our friends living with us in our apartment at different times and we drank and smoked lots of weed and for about 2 or 3 years I was sober and we were all happy and I loved my life and family. 

Well my mom started coming around again and through no fault of hers I began using again. Within another year my sons mom left me. I was around 21 at this point. I moved into a very cheap lowly apartment complex with my aunt who was also an addict. I went into it HARD and am lucky I never died. We bounced around different homes a lot with whoever I could stay with. My sons mom eventually ended up with another guy and by 2017 got engaged to him. The entire time from 16 until 2020 I worked construction under my grandpa who was a contractor.  I went through very bad times. I was homeless, sold everything I ever owned, stole from family and friends and made every single mistake possible. When I OD'd and got narcanned I was just pissed they took my high away and went to get more immediately. I went down that path to extremely low places I don't wish for anyone to ever have to see or go through. 


In 2017 I was arrested and did over 3 months in county jail until I was offered a chance to participate in their Drug court program. I was released in early to mid may. I was put onto the vivatrol shot, put on GPS monitor and had to stick to a VERY strict sobriety program they had set up which included NA meetings 3x a week. Outpatient rehab counseling 2-3x a week. Drug tests 3x a week. PO meeting 1x a week. MaT group 1x a week and court 1x a week. It was not easy. During my time in jail I called my son a couple times a week but he was too shy to talk so I spent most the time talking to his mother (yay me!!) 


I did amazingly through the program, through work, and in life in general. By that October my sons mother had left her then fiancée and we began talking and eventually got back together!! It was everything I'd ever wanted!!! We had 2 almost 3 good years together and then I relapsed again. I don't even have a good reason. I never wanted to go back to that life but its like I wasn't even in control of my own actions. She put up with it for a time and hoped I'd come back out of it. It didn't happen and she kicked me out in 2020 but in 2019 BUT I got her pregnant again and we had our daughter July 2019. I went way harder and deeper into addiction than ever in 2020. I lost everything I had built up and gotten for myself the last few years. By early 2020 I checked into 30 day rehab and got clean. She gave me one more chance and I was great for about 6 months before I just lost control and found myself with a bag of dope in my hand and went even harder than before. I IV'd fentanyl and OD'd at least every other week. Now its December 2020 I have been using methadone through a clinic and im finally clean again albeit pretty newly but im here none the less.


The problem is I lost all my close relationships with family and friends. My ex can not deal with me anymore she's too terrified of me relapsing again. I have lost my family, the only job I've ever known, the love of my life, and every single thing I've ever gotten for myself. I have no car, no way to get a job, and no chance at getting back with my family who I love and miss every single day of my life.


I don't have any idea what to do with myself. I cant get a good job with my criminal record, im going through major depression, I will literally never be able to afford reliable transportation, my phone bill is due in a week and I cant even pay that and I am ashamed to say I cannot even buy my kids Christmas presents. I doubt anyone read all this or has all the answers but I have less than zero idea where to even start or look.

246,I was eating a burrito at chipotle and this guy and his sister/girlfriend walked in. Nothing much happened I looked over once or twice. We made eye contact once and he was all aggressive about it. He walked by once to go to the bathroom and made it a point to walk by me. When they got up to leave he walks over all Eminem gangster like. He stares at me so I turn around and look him in the eyes. In the softest voice possible he says you got a problem. I then say WHAT and lean in because I could barely hear him. Then he responds with what’s up. I say not much how about you. He comes back with I’m glad you’re good. Have a nice day. I then say you too. I suppose he thought I was after his sister/girlfriend/cousin. I was calm and controlled in the way I handled it. What would you guys have done in this situation?,16Dec2020,1
247,"Hi, I am making this post to see if I can get any advices from you guys to help me with my current situation.  Sorry for my bad English in advance. 

I wonder where should I start... So I have a brother and a Mother. My mother is a workaholic and a Overly control mother. So whenever we have to go somewhere we would have to specifically tell her the time &amp; dates plus she will provide transport instead of us going by taxi / Uber ( Note: we cannot do anything past the 10:00pm curfew) even though we are at this age. So whenever we tried to be rebellious or to gain our so called "" Freedom"". She will use death threat (aka she will suicide if we don't listen to her.) Mental note: She did this a few years back where she constantly banging herself against the wardrobe. So you guys could imagine if I am hanging out with a friend; I HAVE to call her saying that I will be home late or have to ask for her permission to stay a bit longer but not over 12 am. ( She will shout and yell at me when I'm back late.). The worst part is I don't even need anyone to transport me, but she clearly has to provide me a driver. She also made excuses that I SHOULD be home early it is because the driver has a family too ( Which I clearly said I don't need driver to drive me to the place I want).   


Another side of the story, I personally understand why she is over controlling us. I believe it is because of our old man. Now, I wouldn't consider him as my father. Why? all the past 20 years; he just spend the money on prostitutes. Not even a single penny was putted into us. The funny part is why is he even here in our house? My mother never even filed for a divorce (In my Point of View). So personally she believe that we will end up like him if we go outside.   


TLDR; My brother and I, we are stuck in this little bubble where we are unable to socialize or talk to people or going to any place that we want by ourselves. 

If there any questions let me know, I will answer as much as I can.",16Dec2020,1
248,"hello. I am a 16(17 in a few weeks) year old male, and I am completely lost and broken down. I might rant for a bit here so excuse me, I will try to make things simple. The girl I love is going through a lot right now, she has terrible mental health problems, and is just extremely depressed. She has eating problems related to her depression, and her best friend recently died. I got a text from her the other day explaining to me that her parents are forcing her to cut off contact with me. She said she still has feelings, but her parents are forcing her to not be in a relationship because of how bad her mental health is right now, they want her to take care of herself first. I completely understand that and I’m not mad or anything, just extremely fucking sad. I would like to mention she has help from therapists and professionals. I was only happy when talking to her, and now I just feel terrible. My friend also killed himself last week. We weren’t best friends but we were friends. I didn’t go to his funeral and I don’t know why I couldn’t get myself to do it and I feel really bad about that. I’ve felt empty and numb emotionally for years and it’s all building up on my shoulders.

249,"Since I was a kid, I was becoming obsessed with other people's personalities. I'm an overthinker, and I love to analyze people's behaviour(I like to analyze things in general, but people are my favorite). All that is okay, because I truly enjoy it, but I noticed that at some cases, these kinds of analyzes are becoming unhealthy. When I was around 11 to 15 years I knew this boy, he was my classmate. At first we were talking a bit, then I realized that there are bunch of things I disliked about him. I continued talking to him, together with my other friend, but not because I liked him, I remember that I called it ""doing a research"". Then when I was alone I continued with analysis. I even followed him around few times and listened to his conversations with other people. When he disappeared from my life, I stopped analyzing him, it was that easy. I met several people in my life, even nowadays there is someone, because of who I can't sleep and have to find out why are they behaving the way they are behaving. There are certain patterns, I noticed that all of these people maintain in their personality: Low self-esteem, they're usually unpopular among others(I'm not very popular either, but they're even less), some sort of victim mentality ""everyone else are wrong they just want to hurt me, I'm the one who's right"", oblivious in lot of ways, oversensitivity..

251,"i was on the phone with her today talking abt her job and randomly she started telling me about why she moved out of our house. she basically told me that she had been continuously raped by my cousin and that im the only reason why she didnt kill herself.

she also told me that she told our mom abt the rapes and that my mom said that its ok and that its normal, i was like wtf ru sure she said that and she said yes. i asked her multiple times if shes sure my mom said that and she said yes every time. i told her i was going to go confront my mom abt this and she said ok. 

i did so and my mom denied ever saying that, and she said she didnt even know abt the rape until i told her just then. i was like huh and i called my sister again and asked her if shes sure that my mom knew. at first she started saying wtf why would she deny it, but then she stopped and told me oh wait shes telling the truth and she really didnt know. i was like why would you tell me that she did know if she didnt and she said she was thinking abt what she was saying. 

the part that bothers me is that this same thing happened a few months ago under different circumstances. my sister told me that she told my mom that my moms boyfriend had been touching her butt and that my mom said its ok, i confronted my mom on this, she denied it, i checked with my sister again and she said that she actually didnt know about that. 

currently all i can think abt is the rape and i seriously wish she didnt tell me. she said the reason she told me was because she didnt think id be triggered or that it would be traumatic for me to hear about and that the staff and this home shes at now encouraged her to do so. i shouldve mentioned this from the beginning but im 15, my sister is 17. i feel like the thought of the rape is just clouding my mind so much and all i want to do is forget that i know. does anyone have any advice for me on all of what i said please? anything will help, thanks.",16Dec2020,1

255,"How do I deal with my family

I’ll be brief because I feel strange talking about my family like this. I’m in my mid twenties and I’ve always had issues with my family. My parents are really tough with discipline and don’t like things not going their way. This also includes my personal life decisions as well as my likes/dislikes, pretty much all matters relating to me.

I was oblivious to the fact that the issues were not only my fault. Sure I’m honest when I’m hurt, I call people out (including my family) when I feel I’ve been wronged but that’s just to straighten whatever has happen out and move past the issue.

I guess some back story is needed in order to get some sort of different perspective and/or advice because I feel like I’m on my last leg. I asked my mum to pass me some milk out of the fridge and I was ignored. I thought maybe she didn’t hear me so I waited for her to finish up with what she was doing at the fridge and I could get it myself. I decided to sit on a stool in the kitchen and started strolling through my phone. 

My mum has a habit of bringing up all my past shortcomings (failures or negative about me) when she’s angry (most of the time not at me). I sat through it and when she finished I asked her what I have done. She called me disrespectful and a disgusting ungrateful child. I asked why but my mum kept calling me names and insulting me. 

She called me rude and said I was not kind to her. This is where I snapped (I know I should have kept my cool but I guess my mum knows how to push my buttons). I said “I’m not rude or unkind, I’ve never been described that way. Why are you acting like you don’t even know me?” My mum replied with “you’re afraid of other people that’s why they think you’re kind but you ain’t shit.” I said “no when people act like a monster towards me I don’t back down and I can act like a horrible monster back. I won’t shout or get rude but they’ll know they’ve wronged me. I’m not scared of anyone, no one disrespects my boundaries to that point so there’s no need to see my nasty side. They’re not showing me theirs.” 

My mum kept quiet because I rarely respond back, I just let her get whatever she needs to say off her chest. This time I felt like this was some sort of character assassination and I couldn’t bare it. I snapped said things I shouldn’t have. My mum came after me, well about half another later and shouted at me calling me disgusting and disrespectful. I asked “what is it I have done exactly, I’d like more than anything to squashed there once and for all. We need to move past this because I don’t want to have this sort of relationship with you anymore, please help me fix us. 

My mum listened to what I had to say and started insulting me but this time laughing at me too. I got upset because I realised my mum doesn’t want to fix this ever. I begged her to just listen to me because I’m tired of this. She laughed at me and cut me off by speaking to my brother and diverting the conversation.

Now I’m sat on my bathroom floor crying. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to leave the house I grew up in but it’s constant problems and I’m not strong enough to take it. I’m not a nasty person and I’m hurt that this has to continue. I realised tonight that my mum isn’t going to meet me in the middle.

266,"I think I made a dreadful mistake 13 years ago!!

I am absolutely torturing myself here and need a way to have some opinions on this scenario. 

I need to give a background story for this to all make sense. 

I grew up in a large family. My dad was wonderful but was subjected by emotional abuse constantly by my mum. My mum was abusive to all of us, including all of my siblings. 

She would call me names daily. She neglected us and didn’t meet our basic human needs a lot of the time. To the outside world, she was an upstanding member of society. To us, she was such a cruel person and I really don’t say that lightly. She was very aggressive towards us and the depth of disgust when she spoke to us is difficult for me to convey. 

As I grew up, her abuse worsened. I managed to earn enough to leave home when I was 19 and I went completely off the rails. I was drinking very excessively and sleeping with lots of men. Sometimes because I wanted to, other times because I was taken advantage of. I felt like this was the only thing I was good for and was what men wanted. I felt worthless but having sex with people made me feel that I had some shred of value to someone. 

I can reel off story after story of scenarios where I was taken advantage of. I didn’t understand it at the time, but looking back it was so wrong. 

On this particular occasion, I am haunted by the thought that maybe I was the one to do wrong. 

My memory of the night or early morning is very vague because I was very drunk at the time and this is going back 13 years. 

Basically, there was a group of men, we were all drunk from what I can recall. There was on guy there who I touched down below. I remember doing so repeatedly but I can’t remember if it was over his clothes or under. I think it was over but I can’t say for certain. I can remember that he didn’t seem to reciprocate. I continued though. What I can’t remember is if he said anything to indicate he wanted me to stop.

I keep playing this over in my mind. Did he say “don’t” and I’ve said “but you like it don’t you” and carried on? Or something like that? The fact I can’t remember for certain really kills me. I’m also wondering why this specific incident is still in my mind. That alone makes me think that something must have been amiss. Then again, maybe I remember it because it was a rare occasion when he didn’t take things further. 

What I’m saying is, I just really don’t know, but something makes that memory jump out at me and I’m not sure what it is. 

I am really struggling with anxiety and depression and seeing a counsellor regularly for that but I’m sitting up on my own, in the middle of the night, replaying this whole thing in my mind again and again. 

Can anyone offer some words of wisdom. 

I want to be a good person and this makes me fear that I’m not.

267,"My younger sister is a new elementary school teacher, but due to the times she has to teach virtually. She uses a huge TV screen as a monitor and that is literally less than 2 feet from her face. Her box light also is way too close to be healthy in the long run. She complains she’s exhausted but I think it might also be because she doesn’t take time to prepare snacks for endurance throughout the day. What prompted this post was last night after a 4.5 hour shift followed by nonstop 8 hour shift (she tutors after work, also virtually), she complained of a really bad headache. She just started a few weeks ago and if it is this bad already, I can’t imagine her state of health in the next few years. Hopefully she will be able to teach in classrooms as she had hoped when she signed up to be a teacher, but in the meantime while we are all trying to figure our way through Covid-19 times, I wanted to hear from people who made the same transition and found out what worked. 

I’ve recommended blue light blocking glasses, and probably making some protein powder snacks for her breaks in between because she says she can’t do much since after a class she is preparing for the next class. Maybe stretches if she can fit that in? 

TLDR: what are some must-know practices for people forced to transition to virtual work?",16Dec2020,1

269,"Im kinda getting into the alternative scene and because of that i like doing things different. Im not gonna follow the crowd because thats what society wants me to do. I cant dye my hair, cut my eyebrow/hair, express how i feel about things and i cant even wear certain clothes or listen to certain music. 

My mom says i cant dye my hair like red, pink or blue because it ""too grown"" for me. Shes always thinking about what others will think when they see me so she does things to please people like her friends which kinda restricts me from doing things i wanna do. I have explained to my mom that doing this kinda stuff really helps my express myself but she doesnt care.

Last time i cut my eyebrow my parents flipped out and my dad even compared it to SELF HARM because i said ""cutting my eyebrow makes me feel good."" It really does and its not an unhealthy habit because its hair that'll grow back in like what? 2-3 weeks? My mom said she would ""box me like a boxer"" if i cut my eyebrow again and that i looked like a boy. My dad took a picture of my cut eyebrows and sent it to my aunty and when i looked thru his text and saw he did that i felt violated because like dude wtf??? My mom says that I, a TWELVE YEAR OLD, is trying to act like a grown woman because i told my mom ""you dont own my body, my body is not your property you can control."" 

My dad said to his manager that i couldnt cut/trim my afro if i wanted because ""its not her choice"" and ""shes a female, she can straighten her hair if she wants but shes not cutting it"" then he said ""welcome to the world of parenting."" So hes basically implying that i can damage my hair if i want (by straighten it) but i cant cut it if i want? Hes also implying that im like a object because i cant even make my own simple choices.

At my moms house i cant come out. Im a lesbian. My mom went thru my phone and social media and read my fucking text with my friends then her nosy ass fucking called me asking me was i into girls. I had to lie because if i came out i would be treated like shit at her house. I also think i would like to go by she/they or they/them but if i told my mom she wouldnt respect my pronouns at all. She cant even respect my trans friend pronouns. When i also listen to ""heavy metal"" she thinks im ""trying to be a man"" then she told me she would never accept a lesbian child in her house.

I can already see my parents not letting me express myself actually mentally and sometimes physically harming me because now im just confused asf with myself and anytime i try to think it out it just stresses me out to the point where i cry (and i dont cry much). And when i get too stressed and mad i get urges to harm myself or i start getting suicidal. 

How can i get my parents to start respecting me as a human being and start letting me express myself?",16Dec2020,1

271,"I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder for about six years now, and I’m in therapy and see a doctor but I feel like lately something has been off, on a good day a few months ago I could get &gt;!1500!&lt; calories and then two months ago it dropped to &gt;!1000!&lt; then &gt;!800!&lt; and so on until the past two weeks where I’ve been eating around &gt;!200!&lt;

I’ve dropped from &gt;!140!&lt; pounds to &gt;!112!&lt; and still feel like I should lose more, so I know the eating disorder is affecting my thinking a bit but it’s getting harder to separate my thoughts from disordered thoughts.

I get utis and no matter how terrible they have gotten, they have never moved up to my kidneys. I went to the clinic and there was a new doctor. I told her it hurt when I peed but that was about it. She did a urine test and said there was a bit of an infection but nothing major and the she sent my pee to the lab and gave me antibiotics and just before I left she told me to turn around and did a knock on my kidneys. The left one, didn’t hurt and the right one didn’t hurt when she hit it but then a couple seconds later it hurt really bad but I had already said “nah it’s fine” and then felt the pain in my side. It’s been 2 days since she did that and it still hurts but it doesn’t hurt when I pee anymore and my urine is pretty clear. 

So now I’m confused. Did she injure my kidney or activate something? My kidneys have never hurt before. When I lie down the pain mostly goes away but when I sit up It’s just constant.",16Dec2020,1
273,"This is going to be a long read so beware. 
For the sake of my privacy, my mom will be named Kate and her boyfriend will be named Dan. 

WHEN THEY FIRST MET 
My mom had just finished with a nasty divorce with her second husband (who is not my biological father but I knew him since I was 7).  For a few months it was just me and my mom. But then, she met Dan. At first, Dan was okay. I gave him a chance because she had been single, was loosing weight, and I could tell that she wanted company. However, at the age of 13, I knew that she was moving on a bit too fast after a divorce with a relationship that lasted for 6 years. So here I was, 13 years old when they first met. They were fine at first, the honeymoon stage. It was good. But it wasn’t until he moved in that problems started to happen. First of all, I didn’t have any warning of his move in. It was a tiny 2 bedroom apartment and suddenly my space was being violated and it was clear that she was hiding it from me. But one day, he was just there. Permanently. At first I was bothered but then I had gotten over it. This was when I noticed that he didn’t do anything. He didn’t have a job, he didn’t clean, he didn’t provide any support, and he tried to act as if he was an authoritative figure. He always had to critique what I did. “You didn’t pick up the dog poop right”, “Clean the bathrooms better”, “Push in your chair” etc. There was even a time when he texted me saying “You didn’t make you bed this morning, do you think you should be punished?”. Keep in mind that even though I was 13, I worked. I worked picking fruits and vegetables and going to a farmers market with a friend from Friday-Sunday. From there, the resentment started to grow. 

PRESENT DAY 
So now I am 20. I’ve had a job ever since I was 13. I went from picking in the fields to fast food to a more stable job working with children now. Guess what? He STILL doesn’t have a stable job. He had one job back in January and he couldn’t hold it. We DO NOT talk. We are merely co-existing. I do not look at him, acknowledge him, or speak to him. Here are a few things that lead up to my complete and utter distaste towards him: 
 - My wifi was turned off at 10PM until I reached a breaking point in COLLEGE and told them that they needed to stop turning it off (it turns off at 1AM now.. but there shouldn’t even be restrictions! I’m an adult!) 
- In high school I was working a fast food job and would have late shifts, especially on the weekends. I was told that I could not take a shower when I got home because I was “too loud”, so I had to go to sleep with oily hair and smelling like burgers 
-  At 15 years old, he told me that “I should be more considerate and ask about his day” even though he rarely spoke to me 
- At 14, he would text me things like “you looked very pretty today” and precede to ask “Is that weird?” Yes. It is weird. To this day, I am still creeped out by it. I was 14. 
- He constantly complains to my mom through text about random stuff that I do. Whenever I leave the house I automatically get a text from my mom asking me where I’m going. He’s always watching me like a weirdo.
- At the age of 20, I have a 10PM curfew because again... it’s “too loud” when I take a shower and get ready for bed. But when he played video games until 4AM in the morning when I had work/school the next day that was okay? Alright. 
- We live in a 3 bedroom apartment. One is Kate and Dan’s room, one is mine, and the other is his “office”. So he has an office even though he doesn’t work. Makes sense right? Even though we have a college student and a professor living in the house too who could greatly benefit from a quiet room to do work. 
- He does not clean, cook, and may I mention again.. doesn’t provide any financial income. 
- We have different political/humanitarian/ moral views. My mother and I have the same views and he is the complete opposite. 
- He talks to my mother in a degrading way. My mom has lost a lot of weight and during her weightloss journey I remember one situation that clearly sticks with me. We were getting Starbucks and my mom had happily texted Dan that they had a deal on trenta sized drinks. He preceded to tell her “You don’t need that big of a drink. No one does. Throw it away”. In addition, whenever she talks to him his tone is so monotonous and uninterested. Even though he sits on the couch all day and plays games on his computer, his replies are simple “Good”, “Ok”, “Bad”, etc. There is no love. No partnership. No relationship. In my eyes, it seems as if they are together as friends with benefits. 

Again, those are just a FEW instances. There have been much more. Kate and Dan are both in their late thirties + early forties. I’m not sure when I want to speak about this issue to my mom. Love can be blind, but I feel as if he’s a leech to her. I’ve only spoken about this to my friends and other family, but I’d like to hear a strangers point of view. Thanks for reading!",16Dec2020,1
274,"Both my older sister (22) and I (not of legal drinking age but I'm a college student: do the math) are home from university after thanksgiving. Most days for dinner my parent will have a beer or glass of wine after a hard day's work (natural in my eyes). My parents often offer (usually just my mother though) but I don't feel comfortable drinking with family (just weird to me and I honestly don't even like it) but my sister always takes them up on it. At first it was harmless but them my sister started casually day drinking mid-week when I knew she had important assignments due (tried to hide it at first but couldn't sneak it past me).

I started to keep an eye out for it and have noticed a very clear pattern that whenever she is even mildly stressed, she'll have a drink or two, no matter the time or day. She even once said that she ""really wished she was blacked right now"" jokingly, but usually comments like that really can hint at underlying truths. 

Now that it's finals week things are at max stress levels and she straight up said that she needed a few glasses of wine before bed so she *could sleep* and unsurprisingly mom mom grabbed a bottle off the shelf and said say less lol. This set off alarms in my head!! I'm not usually an alarmist person and I believe strongly in independence, especially for a full fledged adult. I have been told by others that I have reliable judgement (not to sound like a conceded ass). Obviously alcohol can take the edge off things (duh) but using it as a crutch is dangerous, and I am certain that this is the case. How do I even begin to bring these concerns to either party??

276,"Its a long story but at some point, I offended someone politically and my manager told me they no longer wanted me on their team despite 4 years of being a top performer. They tried to put me on a plan to fire me but couldn't follow through on that so they told me I needed to transfer and gave me an almost impossible task with a hard deadline of the end of the year.

I immediately found the team to transfer to that starts on Monday. At first, my manager was really nice about it and we talked and we had a list of things I need to hand off. When I was interviewing, he said he would negotiate for vacation time for me to start my next job when I got my next role. But immediately, after I got the job, he started to turn. He said he needed ALL of my available time left, won't let me take any of my PTO which expires at the end of the year, didn't talk about it with the new manager and said that I had to be the one to ask him for the time (which is super awkward).  And now, as I start to hand things off like we talked about, suddenly everything I do is wrong again. When I tried to hand off billing today, he told me that I was sending the vendors his personal billing information (even though I had been using mine/we've done this for the past 4 years). I feel like they might not have realized the gap I was leaving behind when they were trying to get me to leave and now they're in a bit of panic realizing all of the work they would have to take on. But I just don't understand what his objective is. I'm literally trying to do everything he asked me to do in the first place.

Should I attempt to fix this or let this go? I'm not quite sure what I could do at this point that would make things better. I've already transferred to a new manager in the system.",16Dec2020,1
278,"So basically, me and my buddy have known each other for about 5 years. We were super close for a majority of that but then we kinda fell off for a while. Recently started hanging out again at the beginning of this year just like old times. Turns out he has a new girlfriend. Won't go into details, but I fell for her very quickly. 

Held my tongue for 8 months because I didn't want to mess things up. Finally talked to her about it, not expecting to get anywhere, but it turns out that their relationship had been pretty rocky and they weren't together for the right reasons and she had feelings for me as well. She broke up with him and we started dating a while after.

Our trio grew pretty close over the past year and neither of us want to hurt him, but we know we have to. It was brought up that we might become a thing a while back and he said that he would drop us both and stop talking to us if we did.

286,My dad has been playing guitar for 20 years or more. He considers himself a “campfire strummer” as in he knows a bunch of chords but not many more technical skills. He taught me the basics of guitar a couple years ago and I’ve since put in a lot of effort to become a better player. I took some lessons and I’ve been in a band for over a year. When I play guitar with my dad now I can tell he’s a little upset that I’ve surpassed him in playing ability. I’ve tried to teach him some new stuff but he always gets frustrated and says he can’t do it and gives up trying to learn. I feel really bad because I took something that he took a lot of pride in and robbed him of that feeling. I know that it’s ok for me to learn and enjoy the guitar too but I just feel guilty. It’s gotten to the point that he even puts himself down about it saying things like “I suck” or “I’m not good enough for that.” I can’t imagine how discouraging it must be to feel like you suck at something you’ve been doing for decades.

I was listening to my music and completely ignoring her because I figured she’d just be another pretty girl walking by in the mall. But as we are walking by each other, I hear her say hi to me. I say hi and and we keep walking. I thought it was weird for her to randomly say hi to someone walking by in the mall. Think about all the people u walk by in a mall. U don’t say hi to everyone. So I turn back and eventually bump into her again and she says hi again. I took this opportunity to start a short convo with her. The convo was short and sweet &amp; I noticed we gelled well when it came to keeping the conversation going and not making things too awkward. Surprisingly enough, she ended up asking for my IG account. We exchanged info and went on about our days. I guess it’s important to know that during our conversation, she mentioned she was looking for business partners to join her trading team. Although I was slightly interested, I turned her down because I didn’t want to start the relationship with a business mindset. I thought she was cute and wanted to get to know her on a more personal level. We spoke that night and I told her exactly that. I told her that I was interested in business but didn’t want that to be the only thing we spoke about. She agreed and we had a normal convo. A little through text , and a little over the phone. A couple weeks ago I asked her if she’d like to hang out but haven’t heard back from her since. But she still watches my IG stories, likes my pictures, and even commented the heart eye emoji on my IG story today! I tried sending her another message today but still she did not reply.

290,"I've been dating this guy for a few months now and initially I thought I was jealous of his friends when he hangs out with them rather than with me, but someone helped me come to the conclusion that I'm not so much jealous of his friends but rather *my boyfriend*.


I moved to a new town and covid has made it so hard to meet people so it makes me jealous to see him be so comfortable with a close knit group of friends. Even in my hometown, I never experienced that type of close friendship. His relationships with them would be my dream. They're so close and comfortable with each other and I've never experienced that type of friendship before and in a way, I resent my boyfriend for having those friendships (which is stupid, I know). I'm jealous that he's so confident and charming and able to make such strong friendships while I'm insecure and anxious.


I'm also just jealous of how much more he's lived. He's gone to nightclubs, partied, dated multiple girls, all while maintaining an amazing GPA. It makes me so insecure about how mundane and boring my life was. I wish I had his past, the excitement and everything is what I've dreamed about, but thought was impossible. Being with him has made me realize it wasn't impossible, I was just too nervous to go for it. It makes me regret wasting my high school years in normal boring, mundane activities with no real friends.


I'd like to make up for it now, but covid's made it really hard to meet people and have crazy adventures. This is such an awful feeling because it both fills me with regret and instills a small sense of resentment towards my boyfriend for simply having lived life.

They make my stomach hurt more and I don’t really know what to wear in those days.

Should I wear skirts so that I can at least wear leggings underneath or something? Does anyone have any suggestions in what else I can do?

I’ve never celebrated Christmas in my life, so I already don’t know what a normal gift is. I decided to knit him a hat, but I was told that making him something is too much and will make him think I still want to date. 

Would you feel mixed signals if someone gave you a handmade hat and then never spoke to you again? And if so, what should I get him on a budget?

My property management number leads to a call desk that takes messages but has no actual info. So...

300,"I am a 23 year old guy, just out of college and just starting my life. I am back with my family because of COVID, trying to save money and I have desires to leave my hometown, travel and potentially live in LA. I want to be able to take risks in my 20s and not be tied down to anything but

I really would like a cat. I love them and I feel like one would be just what I need in my life. I love meeting other people's cats and I have even bonded with a few of my friends cats which made me feel real happy. I have done cat sitting for about a week once. The cat really doesnt like people or affection beyond a very low tolerance for light occassional pets so I only fed it and cleaned its litter. Even then, I didnt mind those responsibilities and it made me feel like finding a cat that was affectionate, that I could bond with would be great. 

The problem is that I am 23. I dont know where my life is going to go, where I am going to end up, how my life is going to look financially, etc. I am worried about having to move somewhere expensive, have trouble finding an affordable place and then worrying about pet fees, or going on vacation and having to worry about finding a sitter. And I feel like that uncertainty might lead to me having to get rid of said cat and I just dont think I can do that. I dont know if I can commit to 10-15 years of providing proper care for a cat until I'm in my mid to late 30s. I dont mind buying food and what not, but I am a bit worried about vet fees. I have never owned a pet so I am ignorant to that whole facet of it all. I try to be frugal where I can but I still dont own any property, my own car and I only have about 12k in savings so I guess I am just worried if shit hit the fan, a cat may be both a financial and practical burden. 

Another concern is that I have no fallback for that. I dont think I could stomach giving a pet away to another home. I only have two family members and they hate pets so I dont think I could depend on them to take care of my pet should I need to go somewhere without it. 

 How do people make these kind of decisions with such ease?",16Dec2020,1

I tried working out throughout the day, but that was extremely hard to maintain with sudden issues occurring, people getting in the way, busy to do list, failing tasks, etc. I thought of doing light workouts (sweat less) at night, but it's very hard to get a toned body with very light exercise.

306,"I was a ballet dancer and for many years i had what is considered the « ideal » ballet body, but i was still a child and hadn’t gone through puberty yet.

When i was around 15 i moved away for dance and that’s when i started to gain a bit. My dad always wanted the best for me, and so that’s why he started to ask me about my eating habits. He started by telling me to cut bread and unnecessary carbs from my diet. But then, after a few months of being away from home, he came to visit me. That is when i found out that the dance school i was attending at the time didn’t want me there anymore. Then, my dad starting asking me if it’s because of my weight or if i didn’t work out enough. Fast forward to the end of the school year (during summer) I was finally back home. I remember feeling so ashamed because of how he would look at me. I remember one time specifically where i had told him i had a bagel for breakfast after he had asked me what i ate. He was so disappointed in me and started lecturing me about how i shouldn’t be eating this type of food. During dinner with my family he would comment things like « you look great have you lost a pound? » i felt embarrassed...

Fast forward to a year later (still dancing) i had lost a bit of weight and felt great about my body for the first time. But then one day, he asked me out of nowhere « Are you still keeping in track with your diet? How much do you weight? » I felt so sad that he didn’t notice any of the progress that i had made. I was even more sad when he suggested that i go see a nutritionist to help guide me in my diet. It was like all my hard work was for nothing...

Fast forward again to year later,
(he would still comment on my diet/body here and there during the year.) I was at my lowest ever and had spend the summer away from home for dance. I was eating one meal a day and dancing for 8h which was incredibly unhealthy and made me lose a lot of weight under quite a short amount of time. I remember my mom went to visit me and she was shocked at how thin i had become. Instead of being worried i took that as a success (if mom reacted that way to my body maybe dad would say the same thing) I was searching for his approval. Eventually i went back home and my dad didn’t mention my body but he kind of stopped asking me about my diet and stuff

Today, i am no longer a dancer, but all off the comments on my body from my dad still affect me. I often find myself crying because of the things he said to me but there is also a part of me that understands that he just wanted what’s best for me and my career as a dancer. Obviously i am not blaming all of my issues on my dad because they also come from the ballet world and the toxic environment that comes with being a ballerina but i would still like to have some sort of closure and maybe tell him about my feelings but i’m not sure how he would react...",16Dec2020,1

315,"I learned they were nonbinary yesterday and it... triggered a panic attack..? Like I’m not phobic, I’m gay myself but for some reason this made me feel like my friend was a completely different person from the one i knew despite being the exact same, they’d even revealed to me that they had preferred they/them from all the way back in 2017, which is about when I met them.

I’m really used to calling them she/her, a lot of in jokes about it and they said they didn’t mind what they’re called as long as it’s not directly meant to be offensive but I still feel like an ass if I kept calling them her.

Like I’m not phobic and sure as hell don’t want to be. I think my grandparents had a similar reaction when I came out as gay, they weren’t homophobic, but they really didn’t expect it and I was the only gay person they’ve met. I think it took a while for my grandma fo get used to in particular.  

Honestly I’d prefer to just use she/her given that’s what I’m used to, I mean she even said I could use any pronoun I wanted but I’d still feel like a complete asshole for doing it.

So I work in the trades and a couple of days ago my boss and I were trying to figure out how to solve a small problem.

317,"Hello everyone so a little background info about me, my wife and our marriage. I'm a soldier in the us military been in 6 years now. My wife is a Korean citizen I met my first time in Korea we dated the whole year I was there and got married after I left so we could stay together. We are both 25 now. We met at 19 and got married at 20. Alright it's been a hard past 2 weeks. So it started with my wife dropping a bombshell on me about 2 weeks ago. She told me that she is not happy in our marriage and she can't imagine a happy future with us together but when she imagines being alone it makes her feel excited and happy. She said she will give our marriage one more year and if she I ain't happy then she will leave me and go home to her parents. We then for the next few days sat down and talked about why she I ain't happy in our marriage because I believed if I knew what the problem was I could start working on myself to fix it. Talking about it with her I looked back at our marriage and realized I have been a very bad husband to her and I can't imagine how she lasted as long as she did. I recommended to her that we see a marriage counselor to try and fix our marriage. She said she will try for me but she is sure it won't work.. I'm really willing to do anything to save the marriage I realize I was a bad husband ( all though it's very late to realize it) and I truly want to change myself to be the man she deserves the only problem is I think it's to late. I do understand if it's to late I can't change the way I behaved, and I truly do not deserve another chance I know she has given me a few with every mistake I've made. So thank you to anyone who has read this far. My question is 1. Do you think our marriage is favorable. 2. Should I just let her go so she can try to be happy alone.
3. Has anyone else gone through something similar and had a happy ending from it.

321,"Life has been just... bleak for me lately and Reddit always seems to help, so I’d appreciate if someone told me how to... spice up my life in times like these.

I’m in 9th grade, I do really well in school (A+ average with As and A+s in all my classes), I used to have a lot of friends (took it upon myself last year to mend broken bridges and stop holding myself back from hanging out with people regardless of status or popularity, which is what I was kind of born into but I’ll get to that later), I had a lot of interests that brought me joy, and I got out of the house a lot and did fun things with my friends. 

I feel like a less descriptive way to explain how I’m feeling is: bored. 

My main focus right now is school which had always been important to me but seems at the moment to be the only consistent thing in my life- and I find comfort in consistency. Friends on the other hand is a whole other story and I only realized it recently. 

At the beginning of quarantine I finished out my school year online and connected with my friends in the discomfort of changing our entire schedule and relationships to go online, but I adjusted quickly.  But now, I still thoroughly enjoy the consistency of staying online. 

When we started going back to school (we had a two day online period when half of the students went into school, an entirely virtual Wednesday, and the last two we went into school and the other group stayed home). With covid getting worse in my state, my parents are taking the necessary precautions of not letting me hang out with friends without masks (which I generally feel embarrassed doing and feel as though it won’t do much to prevent the virus if it were present so I result to: not hanging out with friends at all and I decided to stay out of physical school until the holidays at least. 

I don’t like going into actual school, it doesn’t feel safe and I much prefer to do what I want during free periods and between classes at home. I decided to just stop hanging out with friends because I know it’s the safest but in doing this I stunted my friendships to the point that no one asks me to hang out anymore. 

I have a bunch of groups of friends and although I’d probably not be able to if they asked, they don’t invite me to things. I tell myself it’s because of covid, but I never inherently told them I could absolutely never hang out and shit just starts happening without me. For example,

- my two close friends started dating- I didn’t even know they talked but neither of them have asked to hang out or even tried to text/call me to ask me how I am
- three of my other group of friends keep hanging out without me even though I’m generally thought of as their group
- the other side of that friend group (they aren’t getting along right now) is hanging out together and not even they are inviting me. I’m playing middle ground but instead of being included in both, I’m not good enough to be invited to either.

Everything just feels so dissociated right now for me and I was wondering if anyone had any advice. 

TL;DR I’m feeling pretty separate from everything despite everything in my life looking good on paper and I’m wondering if there’s any way to make something of this.",16Dec2020,1

324,"We've been friends since 8th grade, became closer in High school and hung out with each other all the time. We always had a stable and chill friendship, I honestly would've considered her my best friend.

After we graduated HS this year I knew that we would most likely drift apart since we're in different colleges. Well, we've rarely talked since then and anytime we texted it was me who initiated. I wasn't mad about it because I understood we're all busy in school rn.

But what's made me question our friendship is the fact that my grandpa passed away from Covid two months ago and she never asked me how I was, we haven't been in contact in 3 months. At first I gave her the benefit of the doubt because I don't have any social media and don't post anything. But I remembered she has many of my cousins and sister (all went to same HS) on Instagram and Snap chat and Facebook. 

Also our last conversation was me telling her I was worried about my grandma who had gotten covid and that my grandpa could get it too and she didn't respond back. So she had to have known. I feel kinda betrayed and hurt because I've always been there for her when her grandma died and through all her breakups. We almost never fought or had problems so I can't understand why she's acting like this.

As time has passed and I've grown a little more mad when I think about it. I don't want to throw away five years of friendship but maybe its for the better. I don't have many close friends and its hard for me to open up so something like this is hard for me to get over.

335,"I'm Male, 14, and ever since 3rd grade my best friend group has been a group with a bunch of 18/19 year olds (currently). I'm also an SAG actor with a sizable income for my age. During filming I often get complimented for my maturity and that's always been one of my favorite compliments to receive. So much so I even started placing myself above people my age. I haven't really clicked with anyone else my age for a long long time and so I don't have many friends in my age group. Instead, I spend most of my time online in discord talking to my older friend group. I've made tons of amazing memories with them, and as much as my parents have tried, talking/gaming with kids my age just does not work for me. During 5 years, my friend group has grown quite a bit and we've gotten a wide variety of people. One of which (who I won't name) I was immediately impressed by. He was jokingly ""edgy"" but was overall an incredibly wise and nice guy. Recently he went to school for phycology, and after a long night, it was 3 of the guys in my group including me and one of them was him. I was having some overall school stress issues at the time and I decided to ask him for advice. He was a natural and I felt like he knew the answer to every question I asked. As time went on I grew fonder of him and he began to feel like an older brother to me. Recently with the release on steam, a couple of the guys and me in our group starting playing apex legends. In the game you can have parties of 3, and with a total of 5 of us we knew there was going to be some complications. One day, when all five of us were in the call, I was playing with the ""guy"" and another friend. 3 of them just randomly vanished from the discord call and party. The two of us left in the call were confused at first, but then I checked the friends list and realized that they were all in a party together so I had assumed they had moved to a different discord call. My ""brother friend"" in this situation played it off as one of the other guys started the call and he didn't know what was going on. But later that night the third guy in their party sent me a dm explaining the whole situation. The third said that ""brother friend"" had started the call because he had found me being annoying and constantly pestering him about apex legends and genshin impact (another game we both played). The third said that he (the third) felt incredibly bad for someone talking about me behind my back and felt he needed to tell me. I was broken. I didn't know what to say or do, I just kind of sat on my bed for a solid 5 minutes before I could process anything. Had I really become just another kid my age who doesn't even ask before calling? Who asks why to every question? Have I become what I hated? That whole night I could not fall asleep. My blanket was in the wash so I was blanketless and I just sobbed for almost the entire night. The one who I looked up to, the one who I went to for help, had gone against me. The next morning I confronted him. I said that if I'm being annoying please let me know so I can make a mental note to improve. I also pointed out that I tend to get a bit over obsessive with certain games and that I will try my best to calm it down. He said that he felt he had gone a bit overboard and said he'll try to be more direct next time. But even now, I still feel like it isn't back to normal. I still think he finds me annoying and I don't know what to do. No matter how hard I try to think what it would've been I just start crying. I hate to self diagnose but I genuinely feel depressed. I feel unwelcome st times and I don't have anyone to talk to anymore so that's why I came here. My parents are great don't get me wrong, but it's much more of a one sided relationship and I don't feel as comfortable with sharing  this with them. Reddits helped me out in multiple ways before so I was hoping some live advice might be here as well.",16Dec2020,1

I’ve also had several other friends seem like they’re pushing me away and when I reach out I don’t get a straight answer either. I’m really confused and really hurt as to what’s going on. If I haven’t done anything wrong then I don’t understand why people seem to be distancing themselves from me. 

It’s making me feel really toxic, like I’m bad for anyone. And with everyone pushing me away I don’t really know who I can reach out to anymore, like someone I can lean on. This whole thing is making me rethink all relationships with anyone and avoid getting close to any new people because I feel like they’ll push me away too. I’m starting to develop real trust issues

338,"I don't know how to not be jealous of my husband and my friend. When my husband and I were in our first year of marriage (4th year together) we had a neighbor move in who my husband encouraged me to be friends with. We had discussed previously trying an open relationship and he decided he wanted to be open with her, he was also going through a bunch of emotional/mental stuff and was confiding in her about it. This all made me feel uncomfortable and I expressed this. It led to him telling me that I only said that I would try an open relationship so he would marry me. Eventually we made up and everything was wonderful. Recently he has brought up the open relationship/ adding someone to our relationship thing again and he wanted to know if I was really comfortable with it. He also admitted that he was attracted to our friend who he works with (19F) who is very similar in personality/temprament to me (his words) He has been helping her get ready for a physcial fitness exam and thus spending a ton of time with her. He has also been going through emotional and mental issues again and confiding in her. I am having a hard time with jealousy and believing that nothing is going on there. She is not the type of person that would do something like that and has according to him actively encouraged him to talk to me. How do I get over this jealousy when I know nothing is going on?

in 2019, when i was 15, i became super depressed, and my confidence was super low. i have two anxiety disorders and depression and i was taking the year off from school to get treatment and get my shit together. since i wasnt at school, i didnt have many friends to talk to, and my relationship with my family was pretty bad, so i turned to online relationships for attention and affection.

i ended up forming sexual and romantic relationships with several much older guys, between the ages of 19 and 31. i was in an online relationship with a few of them, sexted them and sent some of them explicit pictures. the relationships were very toxic, unhealthy and manipulative, and made me feel horrible. eventually after about eight months i decided to cut off all of these people and deleted my account entirely. 

now, at the age of 17, i feel horrible about what happened. i feel like i was groomed or sexually assaulted, but i also blame myself because im the one who initiated the relationships and i wanted it at the time. im disgusted that there are adult men out there who have seen my body. i try to direct my anger at them, but i know that its really kind of my fault. 

usually, i can just forget about it and not think about it but occasionally i start thinking about it and it keeps me up at night. how do i forgive myself and let it go? how do i recover from what happened to me?",16Dec2020,1
344,So for some background my mother had me when she was 14. My father was never around and hasn’t been my entire life. I am now 21.

He is saying he’s going to change how he is and wants to build a positive relationship with me. I don’t have any clue how to feel about this. Over the years I’ve build up so much anger and hate towards him that I don’t have a clue what to do. I’ve definitely said how I feel about the situation in letters I have yet to send to him. I just need some advice on what to do or maybe someone in a similar situation. I don’t really know if he’s going to change himself of not.

346,"Hi, long time lurker but first time poster. I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but here goes.  I (20f) think that my mom is using hard drugs (m*th or h*roin) but I am unsure of what to do in this situation. It all started sometime early this year (probably around June). She started hanging out with this guy that we’ll call Frank. Frank was homeless and she would hang out with him and some friends on the back porch until the early hours of the morning. I was unaware that Frank was using until one night I went to go to the bathroom but couldn’t because my mom told me that Frank was shooting up in the bathroom. Shortly after, they started hanging out more and more, and eventually he moved in. After a couple of months of annoyance (she didn’t consult me or my two siblings about moving a stranger on drugs into our home) I moved out on my own. Since then, my mom has been very erratic. She always seems to be high (she says it’s just weed but it is always on an astronomical level of high), she has lost upwards of 60 pounds in 3 months, she has a glassy glaze over her eyes, and she just looks so... sick. It breaks my heart seeing her this way and my sister and I genuinely don’t know what to do about this situation. Can anyone offer me some advice?",16Dec2020,1
347,"So me and this other guy are courting.  We went on one date and we're going on a date today. He's nice and generous so I thought why not give him another chance.

The thing is, I have really, really, strong feelings for another guy. I love his sense of humor and he's really cute. Every time I try to deny and repress my feelings for him, they come back even stronger.

I know he probably doesn't like me back. He's friendly with me but never showed interest. But I feel so bad about dating one guy while being basically in love with another.

348,"I've been friends with this person for a good few years now ---  it's been a bit off and on due to some toxicity on my end in the past, but for the past year we've been on great terms and I've been told explicitly that I've become much better than I once was.  
Things have been great in regards to our friendship, though it's always been a little strained.  She's never done well with initiating conversations, and because she talks to so many people she can be a bit forgetful (see: check a message, plan to reply, never do it.)

For a long time this was okay , but things have gotten a bit worst lately.  
These days what'll happen is that any time I get a reply during the day it's very brief/one word/etc., and otherwise if I toss a couple messages her way (art WIPs, topics of discussion on some collaberative projects we're doing with original characters, etc.), I get pretty much ignored.  
Usually, if I do get a reply, it's by 3-4AM (12-1AM her time), and most often what happens if I send a goodnight message and things get addressed rapid fire, leaving me with the choices of stay awake to talk or get my sleep.  
(It's worth noting it was a topic we discussed that I was fine to send these messages throughout the day, in case anyone is worried that it's that aspect making her uncomfortable.  She actually encouraged it.)

We've talked recently about our friendship and we both agree it's stronger than ever and she's openly stated that she enjoys our conversations and that she's happy in regards to our friendship.  Otherwise I would assume that maybe something was wrong/that there was some sort of dissatisfaction.  
The problem is, as much as she says that it feels like I'm only an afterthought at this point.  I try not to let it get to me but this is one of only a few close friends I have and so understandably that's easier said than done.

We *have* discussed the strain it puts on me to be the one constantly initiating, and though she's said she's working on it and though there is the occasional convo started by her it's very rare still and especially now it feels like she only initiates if she needs help with something.

As much as I enjoy the friendship it's seriously draining to be the one to always initiate, carry the conversation, and oftentimes to be ignored for the entire day.  I genuinely wouldn't even mind if I only got a response in the sense of 'busy, will talk later' or 'cant talk today' ---  I just wish there was some form of communication.  
With all of that being said, what do I do here guys?  I'm really stuck.",16Dec2020,1
350,"I (20yr.) am in desperate need of advice on how to help my girlfriend (21yr.) who is in an abusive relationship with her mom and stepdad, who also makes the majority of the money and has financial leverage over her. We met at our college a year and a half ago and have been dating for 10 months. Our relationship is really good and we recently just moved in together and have a pet cat. 

About a couple of months after we started dating I got to witness the verbal abuse her mother put her through over the phone and then my girlfriend started sharing with me what happened to her as a child. She has been verbally abused and physically abused by both her Mom and Stepfather. Then she shared how she has been raped by her stepfather and how the only reason her mother is with him is that she could not financially support herself or my girlfriend. Her father is in the picture and is a good figure in her life but he does not make a lot of money and has to support his girlfriend and her two daughters. The one escape she could of had in her life was her father but he could never provide for her and always put his girlfriend's kids first before her.

I have gone home with her multiple times and everything has gone relatively smooth with her mom and stepfather not being mean to her when I'm there and not being total alcoholics like they usually are. I'm glad that I am able to make her feel safe and not allow them to attack her but it has gotten to the point where she doesn't feel safe going to her house without me and I'm not able to be with her all the time because our school schedules are changing. She wakes up in the middle of the night absolutely sobbing because of all the bad things that have happened to her that she dreams about. She talks about how she wants to go to therapy but her mom and stepfather won't let her and would stop paying for her phone, car, groceries, etc.

I do everything that I can to make her happy and help her with school so that way we can graduate and be independent so that way she doesn't have to rely on them ever again. The bad part is that we won't graduate grad school for another 3 years and I'm running out of options on how to help her. 

She can't tell people that she has been abused her whole life because a good majority of her family won't believe her or she won't be able to financially take care of herself because her mom will stop supporting her and her father won't be able to contribute. She is scared if she tells someone that she has been raped and her stepfather finds out then either her stepfather will kick her mother out and she will have nowhere to go or that no one will believe her and nothing will happen. Then her mother will take the punishment of her telling someone what has happened to her. She also doesn't want her family to know and be ashamed for not being there for her and carrying that burden. Then finally she would not be able to take care of herself financially. She is also very forgiving and wants everything to be a happy ending and have her family just turn normal but that will never happen. 

What can I do to help her? Is there a therapy route where she can see a therapist without her parents knowing first? Second Is there a way for her to be financially independent without taking out a crap ton of student loans? Then what about insurance and what not? I personally feel like the only way to get out of this situation is to wait till we graduate and then have a job where we can move where ever we want and not have to worry about her parents. Although I do not want to see her be so afraid for the next three years and have to deal with the dictatorship that she is in.

352,"Background for context: For my whole life, I've been at the same school. This year, I moved to a different school so I could graduate a year early. It's a small school with only about 100 students, and the teachers participate in the gossip instead of trying to stop it.

Last week, I got into a relationship with a girl. We both really like each other, and we're going out soon. There are a few people who are unpleasant to be around, but somewhat tolerable for a conversation every once in a while, but there is one kid (a freshman) who is just awful; we'll call him Jerry. One of my friends was quarantined until January because his dad had a mild case of COVID, so he isn't at school to defend his girlfriend from Jerry, who would blatantly hit on her in front of him. Since he's gone, she's found that most people only tolerate talking to her because they respect him, and that combined with the fact that he's gone has made her very vulnerable. Jerry is constantly messing with her, and she's told him repeatedly to stop. 

Yesterday however, he messed with my girl, and while I didn't see it happen, I saw the aftermath, and she told me in detail everything that happened. Long story short, he had accidentally hit her with a volleyball during our free time after lunch, and she had grabbed it and was keeping it from him because this has been a daily occurrence. He wanted the ball back, but instead of asking politely for it like any decent human being, he got up in her face and did a bunch of other things (physical contact included) to make her feel uncomfortable so she would give him the ball back in order to get him to stop.

 In addition to this, he has also admitted to a number of activities that are illegal at his age in our state including, but not limited to, unlicensed driving, drinking, and smoking (specifically marijuana). He has no self control, no manners, and constantly curses and makes inappropriate jokes. I need a way to put him in his place without getting myself in serious trouble with the teachers. Any help is much appreciated. I understand that I may need to go to r/legaladvice for some of the answers I need about his other illegal activities, but mainly, I just need advice about getting him to stop harassing my friends.",16Dec2020,1
353,"For context: I'm 23yrs old, still live with parents (currently at uni), in the UK. My parents got my dog when I was about 11 so naturally they have been the ones paying for him in terms of insurance, vet trips and grooming. He is the family dog, not MY dog. 

Dog is about 12 years old so has slowed down a lot in old age. His breath has stank for a while now, but whilst it used to smell like normal dog bad breath, it now smells like rotting flesh. I did a quick google and it COULD be an indication of kidney failure. 

Parents don't want to take him to the vets because he's old, and any treatment may be too taxing on him for what it will be worth. Also, he doesn't seem to be in any pain. He still plays, barks, has a good appetite, drinks water, poos regularly. All that good stuff. So from my parents point of view while he's doing all that he's fine. 

I do kind of agree with them, but also I would just feel a lot better if we at least took him to get checked out. Even if the vet tells us that yes it's kidney failure and it's not worth treatment at this point in his life, at least I know I've done everything for him. 

In terms of the legalities of pet ownership, insurance, payment etc, can I take him to the vets without my parents consent? Will they see him if it's me that brings him in and not one of my parents? I have savings so I can afford to pay for it. My relationship with my parents is pretty good so whilst they might be a little annoyed at me for being overdramatic I'm not going to be ex-communicated or anything like that. 

I just want to know if I can actually take him myself without my parents.",16Dec2020,1

356,"So, in March/April this year, I brought my Macbook to a repair shop, just before our local lockdown started. It had fantastic reviews on Google, so I didn’t look much into the company before I brought my device in. They told me that the problem was with the motherboard and would take a week to repair. I was lenient and giving them the benefit of the doubt although our lockdown rules allowed repair shops and services to remain open, but I couldn’t get through to them and their shop was closed. They finally contacted me in May saying that my motherboard has been repaired, but they didn’t realise my keyboard had been broken as well even though I am sure I told the dude when I first went to the shop. They told me the shipment would take about a month(as I have a UK keyboard and they didn’t have any in stock) due to covid and I said ok.

Anyway, fast forward to late September. By then, I was frustrated because how did a supposedly one week one month repair turn into something that has dragged on for over half a year?? Their service was absolutely rubbish, everytime I rang to check on the progress, they would either tell me they would ring me back and they almost never rang me back at all. I had gone down to the shop to speak to the dude there after our lockdown rules were loosened, and it was always just him telling me he’ll get his manager to call me back. I went down to demand my Macbook back and he rang his manager and she was just very reluctant to give back my laptop without the repairs. She claimed they replaced the motherboard, so I was just like put back the old one, and she was like oh we didn’t replace it, basically saying that the components were repaired/fixed/replaced. As someone with not much of an understanding of computer parts, it was quite difficult to grasp what was being done to my Macbook because it just sounded like there was 0 consistency with what she was saying. Anyway, I pressed for my Macbook to be returned back to me, but during the week they kept calling me to try and convince me to accept their work, which was also very overpriced btw.

I took my Macbook down to another repair shop my dad had found for me about two weeks ago,  and they did the whole thing for less than $300 while the shop with the terrible service quoted me about $850 btw. So great, I finally have my Macbook back repaired! Except not really because when the dude asked me to check if everything was ok, it showed up a different user than my one, and he said they didn’t do anything to the storage and he said the previous shop probably had my storage component replaced.

I went down to the shop with the bad service and asked about my data, but he was just really hesitant and jumpy to talk to me and told me to talk to his manager. She once again gave me the “I’ll ring you back” nonsense when I called to ask, and when I said I collected my Macbook back in September/October she was like “that’s so long ago”. 

I’m just really frustrated and this whole issue is causing me a lot of anxiety. I just want my data back as I didn’t manage to backup my storage(my Macbook blacked out and wouldn’t turn on which was why I brought it in for repairs). Any advice for how to confront them/proceed?",16Dec2020,1
358,"I abruptly told a friend why I was done being friend with them and now I feel absolutely awful. I feel like I went about this the wrong way. 

Ever since we've know each other for a year. But it seemed like ever since June theyve started taking jabs at me. Like it started off with making me feel bad for messing up video games and being overly competitive. 

It progressively got worse to the point they would be unsupportive of me dreams (saying it's hard and time consuming) (but for some reason they seemed supportive later on so I don't know how genuine that was). They would say subtle put downs to things that were straight up discouraging. 

They'd also only talk about their interest while skipping over mine. When I tried telling them what I'm into they'll basically say they never heard of it and aren't interested, skip over what I say entirely and just go back to talking about their interest, or just leave me on open. 

I've talked to them about how I felt about their ""jokes"" and comments hurting me. And while they would apologize they would make me out to be sensitive. The first time they started off their apology with ""I'm sorry you feel that way"". And then once they realized that apology is rude then they gave a better one. Only to tell me they feel like they can't joke with me like they can with their other friends because I'm more sensitive

This made me afraid to tell them how I felt because I didn't want to he the sensitive friend sucking up all the fun because I have paper thin skin. I told them again another time that what they said hurt my feelings and again, while they apologized they told me ""I really need to watch who I'm talking to"" making me out to be sensitive again. So after this I struggled to tell them how I felt out of fear of being deemed too sensitive. 

A few days ago we got into a petty disagreement that ended with her ignoring me for 4 days straight but talking  to my brother and our other friend in our group chat. I know she was ignoring me because on those first two days she didn't even open my message but I saw her talking to the other two in our group. Then she left me on open for the other two days, while still chatting with everyone else. 

I felt very distressed and resentful so I wrote a wall of text explaining why I'm done being friends with her and then blocked her before she could finish typing. I feel like my behavior was brash and I'm starting to regret what I did. I feel like a huge jerk and that I should've just talked out how I felt more.

361,"I have a problem which, I guess, is fairly common today. (For TLDR scroll to the bottom.)

After a first wave of covid, when the first lockdowns were lifted I joined a meetup hiking group to get some social interaction while spending time safely outdoors. I joined them for a number of hikes, got to like several people and appreciate the organizer for planning the routes.

But two months ago (or so) the covid cases started to rise again and government put a limit of 4 people on a maximum size of a group. I joined the first hike in those circumstances - in the comments we were discussing that we will split into smaller groups that walk separately to still get the benefits of hikes, but follow the law. But the group did not split and people were completely ignorant of the rules. Not even trying to pretend when we were going through places with more people. So I decided that I will not join them on next events. Nonetheless they continued and from the photos in the whatsapp group they evidently did not follow the covid rules.

The covid cases never dropped significantly, and have just started rising again. The government had to put in place even stricter lockdown, limiting the meetings to 2 people. And yet they still have planned next event for this weekend, with 20 spots available.

I wrote the organizer directly (I didn't want to make a mess on a public forum), that this seems very inappropriate and I strongly suggest they cancel the event. They responded that they respects my decision to not join, and hopes I respect theirs. Then I wrote that I can respect breaking the rules yourself and putting yourself at risk is one thing, but organizing an event putting others at risk is much more problematic. I heard no response since.

What do I do? Write to other participants on a whatsapp group for the events? Write on the meetup app, where the event is organized? Report the event at the meetup, indicating it encourages violating the law? Report to the police about a planned violation of a lockdown? Let it slide, and accept that everyone who joins makes that decision themselves?

I did enjoy the hikes I joined and liked the people there. And I do not want to destroy the group, which may happen if I report it, because the events were a lot of fun and very valuable. What do you think I should do?

TLDR: A hiking group I joined a number of times and enjoy a lot continues outdoors events with up to 20 people despite the lockdown that limits the maximum size of the group to 2. I wrote a polite but strong message to the organizer recommending to cancel the events but they refused. Do I report it, write other participants or let it slide?",16Dec2020,1

364,"So seeing how it's my first time posting on reddit I was contemplating about posting this because I don't really like to post anywhere about my personal business so I'll try to keep it short and clear.

A few months back I met this amazing girl on a dating app. She hit me up first and we hit it off. Judging by the way she would talk to me it seemed like she was really into me, she would flirt a lot and kept saying how she couldn't wait to see me.

About 2 months into talking I noticed a change. Like she all of a sudden switched up on me. She would take longer to respond and kept bailing on me when we planned to see each other, and no she is not a catfish cuz we talked otp and even video chat. Eventually my curiosity got the best of me and I asked her if something was wrong. That's when she told me she had a lot going on and didn't want a relationship yet. I decided to give her space to think and sort things out. About 3 weeks later we talked again and she decided she wanted to stay friends for now and I was perfectly fine with being friends. 

After that conversation she would take a day or more to answer and me being the dumbass I am would answer within minutes but she ultimately went ghost on me and ignored my messages. I knew she would ignore them cuz she would watch my story but not read them or even open my messages and no I wasn't pressuring her to answer cuz ik that would make the situation worse. 

After I realized she probably wouldn't talk to me anymore I tried to distance myself as much as I could from her because I really liked her so much that I always felt like texting her and felt like if I did then I would fuck up somehow cuz she probably didn't want to talk. 

Fast forward to now, I couldn't resist and texted her with a simple ""Hey"". She replied but still takes a whole day to answer, but of course I'm being patient. After a couple exchange of words I asked her if we could start over as friends in hopes of being able to reconnect with her and establish a relationship like before cuz I still think about her and still like her a lot. No reply yet as I'm posting this but I just want to know, am I being an idiot by doing this? Or what should I do or say? Idk if this was the correct thing to do or if I'm just a straight up idiot. She seems uninterested compared to when we first started talking.  

I'm not forcing anything but the way she just suddenly switched up on me is very frustrating and confusing because I don't understand. I don't understand if I said or did something or if she just maybe found somone much better and interesting than me and just decided to cut me off. 

I'm probably overthinking but any sort of advice would be appreciated.",16Dec2020,1

My [17] mom (45) has recently started dating this guy and I just don’t like him. There is no major flaws, he not a serial killer, he’s not abusive, he’s not disgusting; I just don’t like his personality.

I think his jokes are not funny. I think he is immature, and I think he is fake. My mom is one of the two smartest people I know, so I would think that she would have an idea of my perception of them but she doesn’t seem to doubt him in the way I do.

I don’t ever say anything rude about him, because I really want my mom to be happy. She knows that he’s not my favorite but doesn’t know why.

I know it’s none of my business who my family is with, but she seems to think they may get married one day and I just feel unhappy thinking about this guy being in my life too much much less being a step parent!

Should I mind my own business and pretend to like him so my mom will feel more supported or should I be honest that he’s not my favorite?

I just graduated from university as of this week ( technically this upcoming Thursday). I interned at an agency for my last semester and was hired by them as of yesterday and need to re-take a drug screen.


Problem is, i usually smoke marijuana to go to sleep. I haven’t smoked in 2 days (hence why i’m up at 4:30 am) and don’t know exactly when to expect to take the test. I would think within the week but I am going to celebrate my graduation with my parents and don’t know if they’ll offer leniency for this as i won’t have a lot of spare time to go in for a test this week anyways. 



I usually take 1-2 hits from a joint a night and go to sleep that way.

I spent years working my ass off and taking on special assignments, overtime, being a top ranked employee, taking on extra training etc to earn an assignment here. Only about 1% of the people in my career ever get assigned to this kind of role. To complicate it further, most of my friends are a part of this unit which is a part of why I went after it in the first place.

I've only been here for 1 year and most people stay on this assignment for decades if not the remainder of their career if they manage to get here. The problem is, I hate it. It takes up an enormous amount of my free time and energy, even outside of work, and it is a constant source of stress. But, If I leave after only one year, I will be by far the shortest-lived member of this unit and am afraid I will be a huge disappointment to my friends and coworkers and that it might even damage my reputation in my career field.

I [17M] have just been feeling really frustrated/angry today for seemingly no reason. 

I won’t go into it here, but I’ve been through a lot of crap in my life and didn’t get much of a childhood, and this last year has been particularly traumatic for me, and I have a history with depression and anxiety.

I’m normally really good at dealing with anger, I can forgive people and let go of my anger really easily. But today, none of my usual strategies have worked since I don’t even know why I’m angry. 

While this last year has been hell for me, I’ve had some really amazing friends to help me get through it, and these last few weeks I’ve actually been feeling at least close to ok. And I had a really amazing day yesterday, I met up with a few friends at one of their houses for an early Christmas party. I have literally no reason to feel angry, I should be feeling happy. 

I really hate feeling like this. I’m so scared that I might accidentally lash at out at a friend and say something mean. I’m normally a pretty chill person, but right now I just want to scream or hit something for literally no reason.

The only thing that I like about myself is my empathy and compassion, and this random feeling of anger feels like it’s chipping away at my one redeeming quality.

390,"I met this girl online a few months ago, she seemed really sweet and we had some friends in common. So we meet irl for the first time for a coffee and cake. She was very nice and sweet. 

A few weeks passed by and she suggested to go out somewhere fancier. 

 She asked me if I can pick her up from her house(which was really far away) cause she has no one for a ride, plus she mentioned that she really liked my car. This sounded weird but It was no problem , so I told her I will give her a ride.

We arrived at this restaurant only to find out that it was full of people. We went back to my car to go somewhere else and as I was about to leave, the parking ticket was around $6. That was fine, I mean this was a really fancy place at a fancy area in the city.We went somewhere else which had no parking at all so I had to pay for parking again. She didn't offered to pay which was fine but it something I would do if someone was driving me around.

We went to the restaurant, ordered and had a good time. I noticed that she was waving her hair all the time and she was walking in front of me for some reason. So the bill comes up, and I ask her to pay each to their own cause my food was a bit more expensive.

So as we're about to leave manager comes to us and tells us that  the money we gave him are fake. And guess what. It was her money(I paid with card).She started laughing saying that someone probably scammed her and gave her that money . Manager asks to replace the money as soon as he comes back (he was very kind by the way).

So the manager leaves and all she does is stare at her phone. So i ask her ''Are you going to pay? we have to go'' And she replies with '' Mmm I don't have any more money' ' And just stares back at her phone again. She was basically waiting for me to pay her stuff. I don't know why I did that but I went to the manager, gave him my card to pay and took her home as if nothing happened.

I've spoken to her again but nothing in particular. She thinks everything is fine but I'm very upset with her. She thought I was her personal bank.

She asked me again to go somewhere fancier which I deny with a ton of reasons. I don't wanna make her feel bad , and at the same time I don't wanna sound like a bitch but she doesn't seem like she knows the reason I don't wanna hang out.

Now, my father is a multi-millionaire businessman \[who seemingly I can't find anything about, other than his records at Companies House where last year they raked in over £700,000 with very little work\]. His parents are, too.  

I'm desperate and I do not know what to do. I think my best option is to contact him, explain the situation, and hope he will look after my wife. I've got less than a few hundred in my current account - her family will not look after her because they are strict Muslims and did not agree for her to marry me \[an atheist English boy\]. 

Would anyone help me find my father? I have his last registered address which he moved out of nine years ago, the name of his accountants, but he and his wife \[and my several brothers\] have no digital footprint. I expect he did that to safeguard against the day I inevitably arrived. 

I can't sleep at night and find myself tearing up all day thinking about what my wife's going to do in my absence and how she will support herself alone. It's destroying my life. My last option is to find him and hope he will, despite his shortcomings, look after his grandson. 

I can verify my identity and my connection to him through a birth certificate for anyone that would want to help but is concerned that I may not be who I say or maybe concerned I am not trying to find who I say I am.

396,"So, my parents divorced in the beginning of this year. Luckily before lockdown he moved out of the house. When they got divorced I was still underage and was included in the divorce, like who would take care of me and where I'd live. I chose to live with my mom full time. My dad pretty much chose not to help pay for anything. We don't have money problems but it still kinda hurt. He's the one who gets emails from my school and just sends them to my mom and I like he doesn't have anything to do with it. 

He rarely tries to contact me. Only with national holidays he will ask me and my siblings to come over to celibrate. We did that in the beginning of this month and I hadn't seen him for a long time. He cut his hair super short. His house was kinda messy and dirty. He drank a lot and was generally really annoying. At some point we started talking about covid-19 and he went on about how it's just like the flu and it's nothing to worry about. He also tried to convince us face masks don't do anything and it's all made up by the pharmaceutical industry to make money. He also believes the Pfizer vaccine contains nanobots from Microsoft. 

He then decided to drive us home after he probably drank 4 really strong beers. He was driving pretty recklessly and I felt very unsafe. On the way home he asked me for the 3rd time if I was going to school or not. It's been on the news for months that students go to school. The week before he asked me it was on TV daily on the news and popular talk shows that he used to watch. I've also told him twice before. He also keeps forgetting what my sister is studying eventhough she's told him like 5 times now. I have no idea what's going on with him. I really don't recognize him anymore. 

On the other hand. My mom is thriving. She lost weight and she's been really successful. She has been seeing her friends more. She's been going on dates and is taking on new hobbies and just generally seems a lot happier. The contract between my parents is just gigantic.",16Dec2020,1

398,"**TL;DR at the bottom! I know this is kind of long, sorry... &gt;\_&lt;**

Hi everyone, I've posted on Reddit few times regarding being dumped by my first love, but tonight I'm struggling more than ever. I'm looking through the screencaps I took of our past conversations, along with playing ""our songs,"" and it's making me so nostalgic for when he was so incredibly sweet in the beginning and he was so warm to me and he was saying everything I wanted to hear...

But now he is so cold and wants absolutely nothing to do with me, and I really should want nothing to do with him. I mean, for goodness sakes, he's already kissed another girl a freaking WEEK after breaking up with me! And that was after he set the girl from his hometown he was pining over as his lockscreen, before signing up for online dating apps again, before deleting those and deciding to dedicate the next year to himself. -rolls eyes- I just... how could a man who was so perfect-seeming and princelike reveal himself to be so infuriatingly confusing?! It makes me so frustrated that I can't travel back in time and do better and make him only want me.

Then again, I am kind of a hypocrite because I was the one to break up with him a bunch of times in the beginning when he *was* pining after me, because I wasn't sure if I was attracted to him all that much. But there was something about him that kept drawing me back. And although he let me back in and we fell in genuine love with each other during our steady (rather than on-and-off) relationship this year, I am aware that the damage was already done to the trust he had in me. And... he's already definitely broken my trust by revealing that he's been planning on breaking up with me for three months now, and during that period of time he gave me empty promises for ""many more years to come""...

I feel like I'm going crazy. I know I cannot contact him ever again, but this is just so frustrating to accept that we are over and he probably will never want to be with me again. I don't even know why I want to be with him again... I think it's just because I painted such a pretty picture of him in my head from when we first met. I've just... I've known hardly any guys in my life, and I live in a very religious state where it's hard to find like-minded people (I'm spiritual and liberal; people here are very religious and conservative) and he matched me with those beliefs. I keep thinking that he was the very best I could do, my only chance at love, even though he obviously didn't care too much about me if he didn't try to work things out and just gave up. My friends and family have told me it sounds like he didn't treat me very well too. You can feel free to read my past posts for more info if you're curious, but yes.

I think another reason why I'm terrified of not finding a guy as ""good"" as him is because he admitted to me that he is aware that lots of guys out there have the reputation of not treating girls good, so he always stressed that he tried his very best to be as much of a gentleman as possible, which was pretty obvious in the beginning when he was trying to court me. But then when he knew he had me, he kinda just... gave up on trying to be romantic and sweet frequently.

**TL;DR: I keep reminiscing and romanticizing my past with my first love who just dumped me and hasn't treated me very well for the past while. I keep wishing I could go back in time and change things, and I'm infuriated that I cannot do that and that he probably never wants anything to do with me again. Please help offer advice on how to cope? Sorry this is pretty long, and if it is fairly confusing... I confuse myself too. &gt;\_&lt;**",16Dec2020,1

400,"I’ll provide some context (this might be kinda long). I met some of these people in middle school, and others in high school. We all go to separate colleges now, so seeing each other was minimal at best. And now with the pandemic (we live in the US, btw), they only want to see each other in person, which is fine for them, but I’m not willing to risk my life to see these people in person. So a while back this summer, I recommended we do video calls at least some of the time so I could still see them. At first, they agreed. So I tried to make some plans, and they tried to make some plans too. All but one time the plans fell through. I realized I was putting in too much effort in the group, carving out time in my schedule when they made plans to see me and they never called. So I thought the friendship was over, and though it was tough, I finally learned to be comfortable without them, and without friends period, and it was awesome! I didn’t have to worry about them, I didn’t have to worry about trying to fit in with them, it was great. Then, they finally noticed I was gone after a month and a half, and they were “worried” about me. So I explained this all to them, and they apologized and said they would do better. Cut to now, and they haven’t done better. We don’t talk as much in our group chat, and they claim they are “too busy” to even send a text. Our plans are flaky because when one person can’t make it, they all have to do a whole rain check (though they were fine this summer hanging out without me, lol). They even told me doing video chats are difficult, which I find hard to believe. We all are at home more than usual, right? We are all doing online school in some capacity, so I know they all have reliable WiFi to some degree. They all have phones with front facing cameras on them, too. How exactly is that hard? To me, it sounds like they won’t or can’t make time for our friendship. I then explained that I feel like an acquaintance to them, and I had one friend tell me she thinks we are still close! For me, if we don’t talk nearly as much as we used to, and have no fundamental similarities (such as music, career choices, childhood experiences, hobbies, etc), how on earth can we be close??? They don’t even ask me “how are you?” When I ask them that all the time. I’m so beyond frustrated at this point that they won’t let me leave, but there’s no fixing this. I know I will be much happier if I can move on. They offered to do reintroductions to get to know one another more, and I agreed to that but told them that if I still feel this way, then I’m out. Is that wrong? Is that okay? What do I do if they still insist on being friends? Am I justified in leaving them behind?

TL:DR; I was putting too much work in my old friendships, and I don’t feel close to them anymore since leaving high school. I want to move on and leave the group, but they don’t want me to leave. Am I justified in leaving them?",16Dec2020,1
401,"About a year ago I met this girl online, on a forum where we were first discussing on some random topic, it was all nicknames and aliases, then we started chatting in private messages there. After a day or two we started talking on discord where we exchanged real names, where we live, how old we are (I didn't even know it was a she until she told me on Discord about a week after we met).   


From there it kind of picked off, we would chat for hours at a time, we would watch movies on netflix together, we would call each other, talk about our lives and issues we are facing, our families, jobs and pretty much everything else. Soon enough we added eachother on snapchat and instagram, facebook, whatsapp and we still talk daily, from morning to night. The only time we don't talk to one another is when either of us is asleep, we live in different timezones.  


A few months ago I told her I think i caught feelings for her, and she accepted it well and was very uhmm smart about it, told me not to make high expectations, told me to actually wait some time and be absolutely sure that I am just not in love with the idea of her, the ""moment"" I guess.  A few weeks ago she told me she had feelings for me too but was too scared to admit, we gotten into the habit of calling eachother all those cute nicknames, telling eachother ""I love you"" when one goes to sleep, or when we end a call.  


My issue is that I can't be with her, not right now. I do not have the financials to actually go to her since we live nearly 16k kilometers apart, literally on opposite ends of the world, and I am afraid to disappoint her since she already rejected 2 guys that she had a chance to be with because of me, telling me that they do not interest her but then goes to tell me that she wants to be in a relationship and that she wants to be with me. I can't promise her that its gunna ever happen, I'm in a bad place both financially and mentally and i was so close to giving up until she came into my life to be honest  
**(feel free to check out my account, tho you might see some triggering shit)**  


I'm not the type to fall for a girl easily, she is literally the first I've genuinely have feelings for , all my life I've been told I'm cold and apathetic and people at some points even convinced me that I am some sort of a sociopath lol

I wanna be with her, I really do love her, and I know i probably developed an emotional dependency but I don't wanna hold her back, we talked about it so many times before but its all the same result. ""I don't want anyone else but you""   


I can't promise her that I'll be able to come to her and be with her

403,"My best friend has been dating a girl for a little less than a year, and over that time I became good friends with her as well. Right before Thanksgiving they had a fallout and broke up because of a scary argument that left her hiding in the closet until her friend came and picked her up to stay with them. From what she described there was no physical abuse involved in that instance or during the relationship (but she could be easily hiding that information for traumatic reasons), but only threatening mannerisms, yelling, gaslighting, verbal/emotional manipulation. Those behaviors permeated the entire relationship from what she’s described, as well as dangerous driving during car arguments and other forms of emotional manipulation. When they broke up she says he openly admitted to intentionally doing those things to manipulate her and make her stay with him after arguments that they regularly had. I was planning to stay away from him the best I could until I could get professional advice from my therapist because it’s hardly a confrontation I can handle right now, and it would make me sick to be around him. The only problem is that I drove to my college city to avoid him and do personal work, but seemingly on a whim he also planned to come to town and I am 100% sure he will want to hang out during the week, and I don’t have any excuses to keep him away. The hardest part is that if I’m forced to confront him and tell him I cannot be friends with him until I heal and he seriously gets help and improves himself, I feel it is not unlikely that he will try to kill himself. I love him for our friendship and the memories weve made, and even though I think he’s lost the right to be my friend at the moment, I feel the need to do everything in my power to stop him from killing himself. The only way I can think of this is to contact his parents to tell them whats going on and to monitor him, but were in a different city and I dont know if I can contain him until they come and get him.

404,"I'm a sophomore, I'm not doing well with school and I don't have good relations with my family, there isn't a lot I can say, or just put into words. I hate my grandpa with a passion, I mean, like, we had this odd, weird, stupid ass dynamic where for some reason they thought I was a bad kid. I remember when I was a kid me and my cousin were arguing over something stupid. 
""Yeah, but I said taste buds send a signal to your brain.""
""No, taste buds can't speak.' he said.
""I KNOW, I SAID they SEND a SIGNAL to your BRAIN!""
I ended up having to to timeout on the couch, or I would have my ass beat. I wasn't even a bad kid, most of the time I was a cry baby, but god was I deathly afraid of him. I remember we lived an hour away from their house and I was begging my mom that I didn't want to go, saying stuff like it'd be better if she left me home, or no body wants me there anyways. That's when I was probably 8, at 12 I called them, on phone, to tell them they're bitches and that I hate their fuckin guts. Stupid that my grandparents can wonder how two of their kids ended up failures, except my aunt, the only child that was his and he cares about. Retard drunk. The thing is I want to be able to reconnect with them and tell them what I think, I mean it's also important 'cause they're family. It'd be easy since I live close to them. 

I'm not doing ˢᵒ ʷᵉˡˡ in school. I'm unhappy, I haven't done what I want and I don't have a complete schedule. I'm getting started on the schedule, but it's mostly that I'm unhappy. I don't have the friends that I want, I'm now thinking it would be better to get more friends and try to be less intimate with one. I just wanted a best friend where we do everything together. I don't like my friends, one in particular seems tone-deaf and can't tell when someone isn't doing alright, maybe he's never been there. He's the one that I like the most, I've just never felt like I've had a real conversation with him while I know other people have. I don't feel like knowing anyone personally is worth my time now, probably because I've got something to hide from them all. 

I'm embarrassed of myself, I don't have the room I want, the friends I want, the clothes that represent me as a person and the people that don't laugh at me. I don't try to make myself a laughing stock, I just feel I don't look presentable, bad miss-match clothes that make bad outfits, I can't impress my friends with skill or what I own, I don't speak Russian, I don't own a trumpet and I don't feel... me. 

The grandparents thing especially matters because my family is poor, my mom doesn't have a job (she's been depressed?/mentally unfit for years), my dad makes all the money (and not much, he did good in his school years but he has a severely broken leg and is prone to seizures, just... nobody wants him in the workforce. Not even himself, he can't take it anymore.) So it feels like the only way I can be financially supported and be myself is if I reconnect with my grandparents. It feels illegal thought, like I'm using them, but I actually like my grandparents. I've talked to them in person in the past 4 months. It just feels hard to talk to them, because I actually do like them. It just feels hard.

So I’ve recently had some issues with my next door neighbors and their noise level and I need some advise on what I can do. 
My neighbors right across from me (we’re on the 2nd floor) moved in earlier this year. Me and my bf have lived here for almost 2 years now. 
It started with them stomping up and down the stairs along with slamming their door pretty much as hard as possible. The complex is made from flimsy material so we hear everything reverberate through the walls and the floors. The first time back in August, I left them a note just asking to please stop slamming and explained that it shakes through the whole place. They seemed to stop for a while. (I also have emails to my landlord about this from August, November, and December (current)). But then recently the stomping has continued. 

I regrettably left them another note just kindly asking (I even said please) to stop stomping up the stairs. The neighbor didn’t take this too well and threw a fit. He started screaming and cussing and stomping even harder and now is continuing to do so without fail. I emailed my landlord about this and it backfired. My landlord said that MY unit was the one that had two complaints over the weekend — one from the noisy neighbors and then one from the senile old bat downstairs who thought the stomping was us when it was actually our neighbor. So my landlord was pretty useless in the situation. Both he and the police said that I should provide proof that they’re noisy and causing this shit. I said okay. So now the neighbors have taken it upon themselves to also blare music that blasts through the wall.

She’s very aggressive and defiant, she ran away when me and mom went to get her, and she just generally seems very not-excited to be where she is. I know they use riding whips on her.

412,"**Background and Prelude**

I’m a 15 year old boy who’s in 9th grade living in Sydney, Australia. I have been accused of many things that are not true but have however made everyone hate me. These things are, from my knowledge; said I was going to rape a specific girl (let’s call her Isabella), said I was going to pump Isabella with cum, that I pinned girls against the wall (not sure if people think I did it to specific girls or just “girls” in general), said I wanted to beat/bash 2 certain “eshays” (if you don’t know what they are please google them for better understanding and you’ll probably have an idea of what they’re like. They are like wannabe thugs and gangsters, chavs, etc). Let’s call these 2 “eshays” Cameron and Joel. People also believe I said I wanted to kill myself. These are just the things I know and there is a pretty good chance that there could be more that I am not aware of. These incidents have happened around 3 months ago but people have still not forgotten. It is an endless cycle of people not caring then caring again. So far I have been called a pedophile, a bitch, been punched, been constantly physically harassed (sprayed with a water gun, had the back of my shoe stepped on, etc), pushed and shoved; trapped and sieged in my school’s bathroom and math block, etc. All-in-all my situation is bad and it never gets any better in the long run. What makes it bad is that for a long time I have had a bad, unlikeable, annoying personality which made many people dislike me from the get go. In Australia we have Primary School (K-6) and High School (7-12). There were many rumours albeit not true circulating about me doing perverse stuff especially in 7th grade, things like looking up girl’s skirts, watching girls change at school camp, etc. These days I never go outside because I always have a fear of being caught by my grade and getting into a brawl like during a previous incident. The problem about this is though not my whole grade bullies me, a significant plurality friendship group (the “Eshays” including their girls) make up over 25% of the Grade (57/~310 people). They will always back up each other in a fight. These days there is not much I can do when the Eshays harass me, they are usually between okay~skinny to muscular, somewhat know generally know how to fight, and are in at least packs of 3 wherever they go. I want to do things with my life like get a job, hangout with friends, etc but can’t because my mom doesn’t have a car and I have to take public transport. The Eshays are a common sight in public.

**Timeline**

On September 1st I started texting this guy, let’s call him Lachlan. Around 2 or 3 months ago before that me and a girl fell out (we were friends) mainly due to my behaviour. After some back and forth talk he offers to send messages to her. I take it a step further and ask if he can pretend to Isabella that he’s sending the messages and not me. He agrees and I ask him to tell her that I regretted messing up with her. He offers to make it “I regretted fucking up with her” for authenticity. I agree, he sends it. In the meantime I tell him I have a plan to get my high school social life back on track with a plan. I say I need to sort out stuff with Cameron and Joel (I was unaware that sort out meant fight). He then asks why I said I wanted to fuck her, I then realise he made a mistake and said I wanted to fuck her. I then joke “Oh no, now she thinks I want to pump her with 20CC’s of liquid dream killer”. She questions this and I tell Lachlan to fix it and say it was a mistake. He doesn’t reply. As the final message on this day I say you can’t leave me hanging like that. On the 2nd of September he says yes I can, I then proceed to start sending fight threats jokingly but according to his friends he thought I was being legit. On the 3rd he informs his friends who are close with the eshay group which makes up 25% of the grade that I said I wanted to rape and pump Isabella with cum and many other things that I have mentioned before and things I’m unaware of (he said a lot but I don’t know all the rumours). I was then approached by a small group which escalated quickly into a medium-sized crowd which the day ended in my whole grade finding out about me and a fair portion of grades 10 and 8. That evening, I leak the messages to some people to prove my innocence. With limited success it spreads. I faced harassment for around week until my messages reached Cameron (one of the top dog eshays in their group). He then thinks I want to beat/bash him (up). With me trying to lay-low it takes a long time for the eshays to find me. Eventually a crowd of 100-200 people were going around the school searching for me while spreading the news about me on how I said I wanted to “rape a girl”. They find me and it’s bad, I need to be defended by 4 teachers. After that it’s only the eshays are at least physically harassing me. But it ain’t over. Throughout the 2nd-crowd incident until now I’ve been again, constantly harassed. For example a few key incidents are the multiple times I got shoved in the hallways by a specific kid who we’ll call Noah, when I was trapped in my stall by a Head Eshay who we’ll call Tyson, when I got punched on the holidays in public around 2 months ago, etc. It just never stops and always seems to get worse no matter what I do or how low I lay. School will be over in 3 days and then a month and a 1/2 vacation will insue.

**Plans and Goals**

In my situation I don’t care about social reputation anymore, it’s beyond repair I just don’t want to be bullied anymore. But it still hurts to see everyone dislike me, it’s worse than before this incident. I sit alone or with a loser in most classes (the losers are chill though, I like em’). My Mom emailed a report/list I created to the principal with people I do not want in a class with next year and she said she’ll try her best. The list totalled to 57 people out of approximately 310 people. I also asked the Deputy Principal if I could have any potential end-of-year awards handed in private instead of going up stage infront of the school. I just want to be a low-key kid in the background for a year or two and then I’ll try fixing my reputation. But I don’t know how to do it because everyone keeps shining attention at me by either calling me out for being a pedophile or a bitch, etc or bully me. I plan to stay away from the Eshays during recess and lunch but they are spread out everywhere making it difficult to find a place to hangout. Other than that, I plan next year (10th Grade) I’ll focus on studies and get good grades and stuff. But I now struggle to find friends and a place to hangout. I am pretty good at meeting and introducing myself to people but usually mess up the relations between us within a month giving them a bad reservation about me.

**Mental Health**

When people bully me there is nothing I can do because they have a massive group to back them up and they are usually aggressive, sporty, athletic, and muscular. For example, today (Friday) I was called a pedophile and a bitch by a guy we’ll call “Riley” in the office and that Tyson guy flipped the middle finger at me when I was walking into the office. Thankfully it wasn’t that bad today but days are sometimes better or worse. But it usually follows a pattern where things get and feel better overall and then it gets worse and the bullying gets worse and then it gets better and repeat. What hurts the most for me is how everyone in my grade are starting to become friends with everyone and each other while I’m practically a social outcast. I can’t hangout with the people I want to because the Eshays hangout very close to the areas where the people I want to hangout with hang. I’m the anxious type and even if one person just flips the middle finger at me once I think about it anxiously for the rest of the day. I just want to be accepted to be down to heart honest and I hate being outcasted from pretty much everyone. That Isabella girl used to be kinda close with me and seeing everyone being super nice, friendly, and friends with her kinda hurts, a lot. Makes me feel like even more of an outcast and a hated loser. It’s very easy to tell that everyone dislikes me but no one says it. I can see it in the way EVERYONE looks at me and talks to me. Even though no one says it, I’m always “that guy, that kid”. Even before these series of incidents I was always treated as the weird guy. When the door is locked to the classroom and I have to knock when someone finally opens the door and sees me they sigh loudly and say something like “ugh, it’s *him*”. This isn’t a school thing either, at home my family always thinks of me as that kid. I hate this so much, I just want to be accepted and I know it’s bad. I’m also an attention seeker and I do things for attention to be brought to me (not the incidents, bad boy attention, or bullying attention but little things like talking loud, being a bit of a “rebel” (using phone in class, listening to music), etc. I’ve been kinda stressed from my mental heath knowing everyone hates me and sometimes in class I lose it when I can’t take it anymore. I have these “drunk moments” where pretty much I have zero control and responsibility over my actions and I tend to do and have embarrassing moments. It’s usually from my mouth that gets me in trouble in general but it’s especially the case for my “drunk moments”. I wish I could just be truly chill and be quiet and not care about wanting attention and wanting to be accepted and liked; and wanting to be included with everyone (because everyone are becoming friends). I want to be the chill kid with a couple boys by my side just going through high school being low-key having fun. But unfortunately, I don’t think that will ever be the case ever again.

**Extras**

A few days ago a friend at school told me that his entire math class is talking mad smack about me and even sent an audio recording. I used to be such a dumbass and do a lot of stupid and weird things in the past grades that again already made everyone dislike me. That list I made on who I don’t want in my class next year got leaked by a guy I thought I could trust. I was so stupid to trust him and he asked for the names and he recorded me saying all of them. I don’t know what to do anymore. I know I’m whining about all this happening to me but I’m pretty sure it was coming my way. After all people thought of me as that kid for a reason. I just don’t know how to fix myself, I don’t know what to do, what to think. I just want to be chill and genuinely nice to talk too. I also didn’t mention that my parents have been separated for a while planning a divorce once COVID-19 is over and how I dislike my Dad because he pretty much has all my bad traits but on a worse scale. I’m also kinda poor and these conditions just doesn’t help at all. Leaving a hardship of school just to come home and deal with the stress of home. I would really appreciate a comment with a strategy to deal with school and these “Eshays”, and how to fix my character and become a better person. I am writing this at night and the school holidays have started giving me 1 and a half months before I enter a new school year in 10th grade. Ever since the guy who I trusted leaked my list of people I don’t want in my class I have been getting weird stares and jokingly messed with. For example this morning the guy who punched me said “Hello, *my name*”. I waved back and he said “Remember the time I punched you?”. He has done this before once in a joking form and left me alone after that. That “Tyson” guy, I do not know his reaction and he hasn’t seen me at all since he got that list. I know for a fact he is violent and aggressive and I can’t get him off my mind as I am anxious. I especially need help with not caring about what others think ~kinda. After hearing and learning about the comments people made about me in my friend’s math class I get hurt and betrayed. I need friends and I don’t know what to do, everyone hates me. What would be most appreciated in a comment is a social strategy on how to deal with the social life of my situation in my life and especially high school, because like I said; everyone dislikes or hates me and everyone is becoming friends with each other. Even if they found out those rumours aren’t true they will still dislike me. Since this is the beginning of a 1 and a half month of vacation I’d also appreciate advice for me to stop being anxious about my situation and how to improve myself so much that by the time school starts I’ll be or at least seem like an entirely different person (in a good way) so people will not associate me with negative reservations.

430,"First off, throwaway account.

So I (28T/F) have been dating a girlfriend for over a month now. We talked for a long time prior. She has been amazing, for the most part. Really conscientious, and considerate of my feelings and things I'm going through. She has had a string of really tough losses in her family, though, over the past month.

I got a message from a friend asking if we were still together, to which I said, ""Yes. Why?"" Friend showed me Facebook screenshots that showed my girlfriend is listed as single. I have a Facebook and had her listed, but uninstalled Facebook because I don't like spending my day obsessing over it. I reinstalled it and looked at my own, showing our relationship was pending. My first thought is she forgot to add it when I submitted it. My second thought is she didn't want her kid's parent to see until she had a chance to talk to him (though now she has mentioned that she has informed him of me).

Not putting much stock into it, I just simply asked girlfriend, ""Is there a reason you still show you're single on Facebook?"" She says, ""Oh,"" and I get left on read for about 4 hours. She messages me later saying she typed this but it didn't go through, ""I assumed when you listed it, it did it automatically, but I don't see why it matters."" I explain I've been hidden before and that girl ended up cheating on me, so while I don't believe she's doing that, it leaves a really gut wrenching feeling. She just said, ""Well, I understand that, but that's not what I'm trying to do at all."" She then went on about how much of an inconvenience she is, and I left it.

I really like this girl (as those in a relationship do) and I think it could have just been a total oversight, but I'm concerned I'm being naive. In the nearly 16 hours since this began, she still shows single and we haven't been communicating nearly as much.

432,"Dear strangers

There’s this friend of mine I have been meaning to NOT be friends with her but keeps trying to contact me.

The reason why I don’t wanna be friends with her is because I can no longer trust her. I don’t get a good vibe about her. 

Her actions are always so dubious.
She expect a favour in return. 
Flaky, wants to hang out on her own terms only (her place, her time, or meet her at her errand period time)or always weighing to see what’s the next best thing/plan before agreeing to hang out with you. When you agree to meet up, she is always late. 
I invite her to hang out and she agrees but when the time comes...you don’t hear from her, UNLESS it’s her the one who ask you to hang out, then she will definitely make sure to remind you and makes sure you don’t forget to attend.
Never remembered my birthday.

I started to find it annoying and weird as well that she constantly would call me to chitchat whenever her partner is not available.

I decided to ignore her after a time I asked her to hang out at my place Or somewhere around my city and she again pulls another of her date time and place that are more convenient to HER (she lives 40 mins away from me and I already been nice enough to go meet her 3 times at the places that are most convenient to her).

Weeks later after that convo she texts with some links or some topic to make me start chatting with her...so I kinda did until she decided to all of a sudden talk about some random chick that met my ex and on top of that trying to get me to tell some info about what my ex does when I told her not too long ago what her name and position was and she must know I’m still pretty sensitive about talking about my ex. And then saying she misses me and wanna hang out cause she wanna pick up the plant I had propagated for her.

I ignored again and didn’t speak to her for another 2-3 weeks. She msgs me again wishing me good luck on my exam. So I decided to block her.

A 1.5 months went by and a no-caller ID calls and I stupidly picked up and she started saying long time no talk, got worried haven’t heard from you and wanna see what you’re up to. I said hi yeah, I’m at work now can I call you later and just hung up.

NEVER called and picked up another no-caller ID again. 2-3 days later she calls again with blocked ID#, leaving me a voicemail saying that I didn’t bother listening to it all, until just first sentence saying she’s not sure what happened between us that I had to block her.

Now in December my friend (call her Abby) tells me flaky buddy reached out to her! 😩 but my buddy Abby became closer friend with my flaky friend’s partner instead haha n Abby wanna see if I wanna do zoom with them.

So now I feel like I cannot shake off this dubious person!...Do I have to tell them straight forward I don’t wanna be her friend???

437," 

I kind of feel guilty about what happened at work today, so basically I have really bad anxiety right (and/or) it's a combination of my terrible social skills. So thankfully for me, I work from home and we have work calls either on video or voice like roughly one or two times a week and today was one of the calls. Last week Friday, I was assigned a bug to fix which I really struggled to because, firstly, I was working some code that was not written by me and secondly I'm new to the field and this is my first job so I had trouble understanding the code, so because of the combination of the two factors I took way too long to complete something simple. It was simple because what needs to be added was simple but knowing where it should be added (the data) is what I had trouble identifying and understanding and I don’t mean to give myself excuses so maybe I’m just noob (I am but I hope I am not permanently noob). 

So for the past few days, everyday the guy who is the team leader (say his name is X) has been texting me and asking if I’m done or what is my progress. Today after the work group call, he said everyone can go except me  as he wants to catch up on what I’m doing. So I stayed and when it was the two of us, I told him the issue and he explained why what I thought was the data is not (it was a dumb mistake tbh, I thought a class is an array because it was inside a class and I hadn’t seen it before but it was still so silly of me not to know). I’m extremely self conscious now and I’m pretty sure that they all (X and our boss who are quite close and talk a lot) think I’m dumb or not suited for the job. I am a slow learner and I have about average IQ :( but they hired me because they were impressed that I spent quarantine learning new languages and frameworks on my own but now they’re probably thinking I’m dumb.  
It wasn’t the first time I felt stupid today, I’ved asked questions before and panicked so I sounded really unsure of myself and I gave off the same stupid vibes because I felt talked down to after that. Also something i forgot to mention, from friday (when the task was assigned to me) till today, I did dm X twice and ask questions regarding my concerns but he dismissed them and redirected me to what I “had to do” (like e.g. my task was to water cactus A which is under 3 sheets that look all the same but the other 2 have different plants and I can’t lift the sheet to see or the cloth would tear and I asked him how can I find cactus A and he would reply saying  that I have to find cactus A and then water it - giving me the feeling that my question was irrelevant even though I was genuinely confused and unable to continue but to him it just seemed like a dumb question most likely).

And the same panic happened during the call today. I had just messaged X and asked him a doubt and gotten the dismissive response but with additional steps to follow (thankful for this) so I did not expect him to want to talk to me or I would have rehearsed what I needed to say. I when he asked me to talk, I spoke in a very uneven tone, suddenly fast then back to my normal pace. And the worst thing happened: after he answered my question, there was an awkward silence then I said thanks and he said welcome and more awkward silence then he said something (which i will get to later) but at that time I did not hear it and I said ok thanks and he said thanks again and then I said bye and he said bye and I hung up, at that point I just wanted to get out of the call, I was so nervous and the situation was so anxious so I didn't pause and think and ask him to repeat :(  
After that, a few min later it just struck me and I think he asked me to show him my work and take a look at what I have so far. I am not 100% sure but i have a feeling it could have been that and now I am feeling extra guilty. What can I do? Should I message him again and ask? And is it possible to stop myself from sounding stupid (I can think of a couple of things I can do- practise more so I will be more confident and also calm down and try to speak normally) or do you think that their mind is made and they will always see me this way?",16Dec2020,1

i have some money saved up and i’ll have even more by the time i go to college. i was considering renting an apartment off campus, but i don’t know if i’d be able to afford it on top of paying for college. having an apartment would make it easier since i wouldn’t be living with my parent at all, and the rent wouldn’t be an issue. if anyone has gone to college and rented an apartment please let me know how it worked because i’d like to do it, but i’m worried about not affording it

439,"I’m in my early 20s and have been with this company for over a year since graduating from college. I don’t have many complaints about my employer (I have a good relationship with my co-workers and the culture is great), but I’ve been contemplating on finding a new job to explore a different career path/industry and more recently moving aboard for a couple months to doing some soul searching (as cliche as that sound). 

I’m very grateful that I still have a decently paying job during this pandemic, and very privileged to be able to even contemplate quitting and temporarily leaving the country. Which is why, as a risk-adverse and humble person, I’m finding it hard to make this decision. I feel like I haven’t truly done something for myself and have been sticking with the “safest/most certain” option. 

While aboard I plan to apply for jobs but the uncertainly of the job market makes me anxious. Many of the job listings I’m seeing requires 2+ years of experience and I don’t have much of that outside of college.

443,"Basically I don't know if I have platonic or romantic feelings towards someone, or if it is even a crush. 

I'll start with a short trip through my past. I haven't been in a relationship so far, and I was never looking for one. I've had a few crushes during my middle and high school years but that's about it. So I've used the labels straight or asexual depending on the friend group.

Recently I happened to be in a discord call alone with someone, and we kinda ""clicked"". We are trying to get into the exact same uni, we have a common hobby, we play almost the same games, similar tastes in music, almost the same age. Long story short, we started drinking (just a few beers), and discussing topics such as existence, ways of living, nihilism as an ideology, religion. This lasted for almost 4 hours. In the end I realized that I had probably been depressed (or had given up in a way?), which caused me to somewhat snap out of it the next day. But anyway, the thing is I have unfamiliar feelings towards that person. It's not the same feeling I have towards friends, not the same as liking someone. I think about them about 4 times a day, but we only talked twice and over a screen. 

So I don't know what that feeling is, but even if it is a kind of romantic attraction I know that they aren't into people of my gender. But it still bothers me. 

I would ask a friend but I'd have some mayor explaining to do and maybe even cause them to worry about me a bit so I figured reddit would be the next best thing.

My ex has now lost his job, is probably struggling to afford many things and although I dont want any contact with him, I'd hate for him to lose his pet or for the animal so suffer at all.

I was going to order a crate of food to the house and a cat tree (as I had promised many times to buy this but never did) but I don't want to give him the wrong idea. I dont want anything to do with him. And I understand it isn't my responsibility anymore, but I do want to do something nice for the pet, especially since its Christmas, and the cat was so attached to me so probably doesnt understand where I've gone and I hate that. I dont even know if he's still staying at his house or not right now.",16Dec2020,1
445,"For context, I am NOT a parent. I’m 22, fresh out of college, and had my teenaged nephew thrust unto my care when the country went into lockdown. He lived with his grandparent’s (not my parents, my former brother in law’s parents), and neither my sister (his mom) or his dad are in the picture. When the pandemic hit, his grandparents’ business struggled, and because of their older age, they needed someone to take care of him while they worked. Since I had just graduated and was apparently “free”, they basically paid me to take care of him for them “for the summer”. That was back in April and his grandparents have only told me now, in December, that they’re ready for him to go home in “a week or two”.

As you might be able to tell, I was not prepared for this whole thing at all, especially since lockdown has restricted even his school to being at home. I thought that maybe it would just be like having a roommate for a bit, but it turns out that I’ve actually have had to be the acting “parent” figure in his life for over 2/3 of a year. When it became apparent that he was locking himself in his room for *literally* all day besides eating and a shower (which takes up an hour and a half in total), and that this was normal behavior living with his grandparents (I couldn’t believe it), I decided to look into it. And it turns out my nephew is extremely lonely. 

The problem is that, apparently he has spent the entirety of middle school with no friends because of a trauma which more or less gave him anxiety. And given that the high school he’s going to (or is going to now) will have a majority of the kids from his old middle school, he has resigned himself to not having any friends (it’s pretty hard to make friends during online classes anyways). And so he withdraws into his room and goes online to socialize. On video games and behind his phone screen is where he feels safe enough to make friends. 

But there’s just one problem, isn’t there? There are dangers lurking online (and this is coming from someone who grew up with the internet too. Given our ages, I used to frequent many of the sites and video games that my nephew frequents too when I was bored at his age), and basically, I didn’t think that it’s very healthy of him to dig himself into a hole where he grows up, and finds that he can only socialize on certain platforms online, and not in any other way. I didn’t want that for him, and the issue became more pressing after he confided in me what his online “friends” sometimes do. 

I’m not going to get too much into it, but one of his “friends” was very obviously emotionally manipulative (threatens suicide and self harm, gives and withholds attention etc) because they wanted to be in a relationship with my nephew, or something to that extent. He has also admitted that he was in a “strictly online” and “one time” relationship with a male even older than me. And this is all honestly just the tip of the iceberg. I could get so much deeper into it. But honestly, as an adult, I have to say that I already knew that people like this exist, especially on online platforms. 

However, I was, and still am so worried because of a few factors. 1) My nephew is “too nice”. I don’t know why, but he lets these people treat him badly. I’ve read up on these issues with teens, and I think maybe he struggles with self esteem or self worth issues. 2) Put in crude terms, my nephew has no life. He has no hobbies or activities that he pursues with any passion (he doesn’t work out, he sometimes paints but he’s “too lazy” to, he used to sing but doesn’t wanna pursue it ever since his voice changed). And 3) He seems to be a very social-oriented person, whose interests only include whatever his friends are doing/watching/reading/playing. But once again, because of a combination of the previous two factors, when this happens to him with toxic people/predators online, my nephew gets absolutely consumed by their lives and he becomes a walking doormat who “lives their lives” in a sense, doing things irregardless of his own interests or what he likes.

Being inexperienced but feeling like I was the only one who could (or cares to) help him, I decided to have a go at parenting, or at the very least, mentoring. But my methods were more suitable for dealing with friendships (I do see him as a buddy nowadays after all this time, plus we’re only 7 years apart) and I frequently found that my emotions got in the way too often. I have taken to lecturing him lengthily anytime my doubts or anxiety about him slipping back down the “wrong path” creeps up on me. And this was because whenever I tried having reasonable talks with him, he would understand and change at first, before slipping back into the same rabbit hole of being “trapped” in the grips of his so called “friends” for a week or two.

And yet, my solution to attack the issue was to simply occupy my nephew all day long with activities that he could share with me. Like grocery shopping, food trips, random drives, getting sun at the roof of our apartment, etc. This way I could “keep an eye on him”, but in truth, I think it might have just been a way to reassure myself that he wasn’t lying to me. It may sound bad, but like I said earlier, I was highly emotionally driven in my reactions. Because this way, what I was actually doing was both beating a dead horse with my lectures, and simultaneously ignoring the elephant in the room. I had never EVER directly addressed the issue by trying to build up my nephew’s self esteem. Or building him a “life”, with interests and passions that he could call his own. Instead, I simply preoccupied him with meaningless and unhelpful activities.

And this has all been going on for all this time; him slipping back and forth between knowing his worth and being too lonely to care about how he was being treated and taken advantage of. But recently, he’s been on a really good streak for nearly two months, and I think I actually believe him this time when he tells me that he knows his boundaries when it comes to people online. No matter how lonely he gets. At the same time, though, he has also been extremely lonely, more than he has ever been, and I think that’s because his main social outlet has been taken away from him (please correct me if I was wrong to do so). 

He brought up something tonight that worried me a lot, by expressing a desire to go back to this online platform on a popular video game (Minecraft) that allows players to meet, mingle, and basically “date” (the reason they’re all there) each other. This was where he met his old toxic friends, who he has completely cut off already by the way. However, he wishes to meet new people for companionship, and he wants to do so specifically on this platform; he insists that since he knows better how to spot the red flags now, he wouldn’t fall for the same type of people as his old friends. And if he does, he’d be able to cut them off quickly instead of getting tangled in another toxic relationship. 

And yet, while this makes sense logically, he has offered no reasoning for wanting to go back to ONLY this platform for companionship, instead of the other healthier ones I’ve suggested (Reddit being one of them). But again, if he didn’t mean what he said, why would he even tell me in the first place, when he can just lie? Or better yet, wait a week or two to go back to his grandparents, then proceed to go ahead with his plans anyways without ever telling me?

I guess a lot of this is coming from my anxiety of him going back to his grandparents. It’s not their fault, but they’re busy and old, and their idea of raising my nephew is to only provide shelter/food, and leave him to his devices at all other times. In fact, this was the exact circumstances that got him into the state he was in when he first moved in with me, and combined with the fact that he outright *wants* to go back to these places filled with strange and toxic people, I’m worried that he’ll dig himself another hole he might not be able to get out of.

Is a lot of my concerns just me overthinking? Yes. Are my concerns, specifically about how people online act in toxic/predatory ways and the fact that my nephew’s low self esteem makes him susceptible to it, legitimate? I feel that is also a yes. But what do you think? Please, correct me if I’m wrong. And if I’m not, what should I do? Should he really go back to the platform? I don’t have any more time to make any significant positive impacts on my nephew. And all because I never saw that him never seeming comfortable on his own, stemmed from self esteem issues.

TL; DR
Helped my nephew who’s stayed with me for the past months out of extremely unhealthy relationships with toxic people and predators online. He’s improved a lot, but he has also recently been expressing a desire to return to the platform where he met the aforementioned people. He insists he can find better people there and that he knows now who to avoid, but he’s also leaving soon and I’m not sure if I should be worried.",16Dec2020,1

447,"“if they wanted to, they would” is this true or false, and why? (+ my story)

I saw a post that said if they wanted to, they would text you to hang out or just text you in general. I’m assuming this mainly applied to men since they’re generally the ones initiating. Some women definitely will, but I feel like even to this day we put more pressure or expectation on men to initiate or chase a woman. Do you think this is true? 

My story: This guy and I reconnected while we were drunk at a get together. A year and a half ago we met through mutual friends, slept together 2 times but it didn’t work out. He asked me to get drinks once but I bailed bc of work and we drifted after that. When we reconnected, he was showing a lot of interest in me. I slept over but I figured I didn’t want to have sex (on the last days of my period) and he begged me to stay, said he didn’t care and he didn’t try anything at all. He said he just wanted me around and cuddled until we fell asleep. The next morn, he bought my uber and asked me to text him when I was home. I didn’t text him right away, but I texted him later that night saying thanks for the uber btw. He asked how I was feeling, I didn’t get to reply til the next day but he was responding right away w/ every msg I sent. I took hours to respond to him ngl, I got nervous, so the convo completely died. 

A couple days later, he came into my work. I’m a server. Even before we reconnected again he was coming in even months prior to this, almost every other day so it wasn’t surprising to me. When he came in, it was dim where I work and I have terrible eyesight LOL so I couldn’t figure out if he even said hi and I kind of left the front. I passed by his table w/ his friends a few times but because I’m so shy, avoided eye contact bc my heart was racing. I thought it was rude he might have not said hi on his way out and not even when he came in.

I told my manager about it to vent and he told me the guy seems incredibly awkward and shy. He is VERY quiet but I felt so sad when he didn’t make an effort. I figured maybe he wanted to avoid me but why would he come into the place I work? Idk what to think. Help.",16Dec2020,1

449,"This is a throwaway account, first time on reddit, thought you'd have some useful advice for me, Reddit. tl;dr at the bottom!

Things have been insane, so I'll try my best to get everything as short and straight as possible. So, a ""little"" backstory:

I \[F18\] have been going to therapy since January last year, stopped during the summer cause I felt like I was genuinely doing better, then started up again one month ago, had only managed two sessions before this happened. I was the one to ask for therapy, after I was officially 18 (almost 19 now) and my mum obliged.

After about 6 months of therapy, my therapist, T \[M32\], suggested seeing a psychiatrist, A \[F39\], as well as going to regular therapy. I couldn't afford both after some time, and I genuinely felt better, so I dropped therapy. Well, now I've been doing shit, so after a lot of thought, I decided to go back and I did.

During my last session, Friday 11th, I told T I experienced a suicidal episode two weeks ago to the day, that I had stopped it, and I wasn't sure if I would experience any more. He seemed concerned so I reminded him that I am feeling fine, and didn't ""feel"" any more coming, so I wasn't worried about it. I was on edge cause I felt like he was going to call the cops on me and get me submitted into a clinic or something, which I had explicilty stated multiple time I did not want, both A and T knew that.

The session ends, I go home, a couple hours later, my mother's phone rings and its T, I pick up. T asks for my mother cause he wants to let her know about what I said during the session. I freak out, understandably, and told him that he has no right to call, that he is breaking patient  confidenciality  and that I am an adult and I do not give him permission to call, or talk, to my parents. He disagrees and basically forces me to hand over the phone and I do. He tells my mother to not freak out and tells her everything, even suggests to her I be submitted into a clinic at some point and hangs up.

I am furious, and my mental health, my trust, my hope, my dignity is left in shambles and I regret ever going to a therapist in the first place.

I calmed (lied to) my mother and later that night called T's boss to explain why I will no longer be attending therapy. Then called A, to see if she knew. She did, she agreed with everything T said, even the fact that he called my mother before even letting me know that he was going to do so, and defended him to the bone. Now I'm furious at the both of them.

I will no longer attend therapy, I cannot see myself ever trusting a therapist after that. But what do I do with A? I don't know if I can trust her. I feel like the medication hasn't helped me much and I wouldn't mind stopping it, I have been on different kinds for over six months, it's kind of a lot. Do I fire her and seek another psychiatrist (and thus continue my medication)? Do I stay with her to stop the medication? Do I fire her and try stopping my medication myself?

Share your thoughts with me Reddit!

TL;DR: therapist and psychiatrist broke patient confidentiality. Dropped therapist, but I'm unsure if I should continue seeing the psychiatrist (cause of the medication)",16Dec2020,1

Tldr: my (f,20) sister (26) got in a huge fight with me over my parking skills using her depression as the main argument. 

Well we have not really talked since. My parents really want us to stop fighting and want me to apologize because my sis tells them every phone call that everything she said and did is completly right and I am an awful sister. They understand that it is heavely exeggerated but they also know that argueing with her is not worth the struggle and want me to write her and ask how she is doing etc... 

But I also know if I do this, in my sisters head it will sound like she was as always right and I am accepting the fact that I did everything wrong. I do not want that. I do not want to let her think that she is right. I do not want to feed her pride, so that she can blame me for this fight the next 10 years.

So we have been in a relationship for a few months, he's a Palestinian muslim, but lives in Europe, I'm European Catholic. In the beginning of our relationship I didn't take him serious due to the fact of our differences, I told him it has no right to work, we are so much different, your family won't accept that, he claimed that he doesn't care about any of that, he just wants to be with me and that's all that matters, so I gave it a chance. He was the most wonderful person to me, he planned our future, which was kinda delusional, because we barely knew each other then and it was kinda red flag for me, but longer I stayed with him, more and more I started believing in that and more I fell for him.  Such men like him don't exist anymore, he treated me so well, even such things as carrying the shopping bags and not even letting me touch one or opening the car door for me made me feel so special, not going to mention the fact that he didn't even look at other girls, he's very attractive and I know that many girls want him, but still he didn't care about any of them. He called me his future wife and said he wants to spend the rest of his days with me. A month ago he started talking about the religion more and more, said he wants to start to pray soon, stop drinking alcohol etc. So now. Basically slowly and slowly he was giving me hints that he wants me to convert into muslim, but he didn't say it straight, I never even thought of doing that, because this religion is far away from me, I'm not even a religious person, especially when it comes to Islam. But one day out of nowhere he said, we just can't be together until I convert. I asked: why are you doing this, do you really choose the religion over our love? He said: yes. He said he wants to raise his children in islamic faith and EVEN IF I REMAIN CHRISTIAN AND WE HAVE KIDS TOGETHER, HE HAS ALL THE RIGHTS TO THEM AND (IF) AFTER WE DIVORCE HE TAKES THEM AWAY UNDER THE CUSTODY FROM ME. and there was many more weird and scary things he said.. that was a huge dealbreaker to me. He broke my heart, because I really loved him and he was an awesome person, he says he loved me too, I was his first love and he will never be able to love anyone this much, but I can't believe how much the religion got to his head and how a young man can be so radicalized. 

Please tell me your opinion about this whole situation, I know I would never feel good in this religion and especially with a person and his family who are extremely religious, but I lost an amazing person and I really miss the way he treated me and the love he gave me, also I feel really lonely now, I don't really have many friends that why it makes everything harder for me.",16Dec2020,1

I learned a couple of days ago through our other cousin that the two are now in a relationship. She was visiting our 14 year old cousin for a family event, and she told her there that she was dating that guy.

Being that I'm in an entirely different country, I can't do anything to really help.

He has been trying to help her through her eating disorder and from what I've been told, it works. The problem is, she only eats when he supposedly tells her, and I'm worried that she just does whatever he says.

Her parents apparently know that their daughter is dating a 19 year old on the internet but they don't seem to care. In fact, the mother was annoyed that I had continuously pestered them about it before, so I can't even talk to them about it.

Am I wrong for thinking this is absolutely crazy that my 14 year old cousin is in an active relationship with a 19 year old? She only turned 13 a couple of months ago.

I’m 16 and no one really cares about me, yes I have parents and a “friend” group. Mum and Dad are there but not in a loving way they feel like they just need to feed me and put a roof over my head and instead of showing me any affection they just buy me a gift here and there. (I can’t remember the last time I’ve been told I love your or even given a simple hug let alone a pat on the back) 

My friends are somewhat good people but being 16 and living in a small country town in Australia we have nothing to do but make silly decisions all the time. 

I feel as I’m the “black sheep” or odd one out in the group you know like I don’t have a mullet (all my mates do) I have glasses and I get no girls at all. I’m trying really hard to talk to girls (I’m kinda introverted) and I’ve made some progress but never have actually had them be interested in me and only talk to me because they are bored. 

My friends always make me feel lesser than them like they are just as good as me in things and I never get a shot and they always talk me down and discourage me. There’s one friend I’ll just call him Jack, he’s my “best friend” I don’t think I’m his but he doesn’t participate in the talking down of me and always tries to make me feel equal and if something happens that puts me in a bad position he’s always the first one to come with me weather it be leaving a party etc. he feels like a real friend I guess but obviously me not being as “cool” as the other guys, he keeps going after them and now I’ve noticed they are starting to make plans behind my back and yeah that’s fine and all but it’s now at the point that I make plans, they all back out and go do it together without me.

Deep down I just want to be loved, even a bloody hug. I feel like I’m just being used, I want to be cared about no I don’t want someone to care about me 24/7 like I’m a baby I just want someone I can trust to check In on me and give me a hug and make sure I’m ok. 

There’s no one I can genuinely trust, every girl, mate and parental figure has always betrayed my trust and now I find it hard to trust people with my feelings. and being introverted I find it incredibly hard to make new friends, my face goes bright red when I talk to someone new even though I’m not embarrassed in the slightest.

468,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I’ve been in a relationship for about a year and a half. He’s nice, it’s good. But we a) have a lot of cultural/religious differences and b) are very different people and not in the same stage of life at all. 

Lately I’ve been noticing myself having overwhelming feelings of attraction and honestly a big crush on one of my friends (whom has a girlfriend himself). Him and I hit it off too well and have a million things in common, and anytime I catch myself being too friendly I instantly pull back. I could never, and neither could he (he’s so in love with his girlfriend it’s adorable) but the fact that I am even having these feelings is only highlighting what’s wrong with my own relationship. 

Why do I put my standards on the back burner and date whoever is around or whoever is nice to me instead of dating men who have qualities that I actually like (ambitious, funny, etc). Why am I so fuckin impatient and why do I refuse to believe that guys that fit that standard exist, and when I do meet them it’s never the right time and makes me rethink all of my choices. How do I talk to my boyfriend about this.. should I talk to him about this?",16Dec2020,1
469,"As the title says, I'm planning to run away at 18. I'm 14 this year and the reason why I'm willing to wait for 4 years is because I don't think hiding from the police is worth it and I rather just hide my feelings and earn money while waiting. My parents, my mum especially, are toxic and both are homophobic. I never open up to them before and after I came out to them because of their negative reaction towards my coming out and just talking about my feelings to them in general feels weird to me. Anyways the thing I need advice on is that I may be adopting 2 cats soon and I don't want to leave them behind when I run away. I was wondering if there was a way for me to take them with me.

First, I'm sorry, this is a little below the level of this subreddit ...

475,"Background: me and my boyfriend got together last October, he had recently started taking antidepressants because he had a break down at work. He then didn’t work till March when he got a new job. From what I can gather he had a difficult upbringing. His gran parents adopted him when he was 10 because he was living with an alcoholic mum and possibly an abusive step dad. His own dad died before he was born. He doesn’t really open up so I don’t know how bad things were for him as a child but I understand some what as my mum is also an alcoholic and this is something that bought us close together in the first place. We have both experienced things like seeing out mothers try to commit suicide.

Anyway, for some reason my boyfriend stopped taking his antidepressants back at the end of July. As I said he doesn’t really open up but I think it was something to do with them making him but on weight or he thinks they don’t help. However since then I have noticed a change. One weekend in September he had this depressive episode where he hardly spoke to me for days. He admit to me he is always in emotional pain, and nothing seems to help. He still lives with his grandparents so I told them he stopped taking his medication and they got him to the doctors. I thought he was taking it again but turned out he wasn’t. After this he was alright for a while, or seemed it. The last month or so though his behaviour has just been getting more and more erratic.

For example, he collects his prescription of antidepressants but doesn’t take them. I asked him why he bothers getting them and he said “it’s nice to have a collection”. He said he wanted to try CBD for his depression and anxiety as he says he always feels anxious. So I bought him some as I take it then he didn’t want it. When I told him I bought it specially for him to try he took it and thanked me but I don’t think he will take it. I can tell when he is anxious because he will biting the skin off his lips/pick and the skin on his fingers. He also seems to not be looking after himself as well anymore too.

Yesterday I was round at his house and he randomly goes “I wonder what would happen if I took a whole pack of antidepressants” I told him that wasn’t a good idea and would probably be painful. Then he made some joke about wanting to hang himself at one point, and proceeded to tell me he knows how to tie a noose. He makes jokes a lot about killing himself, and it’s something I tend to do as well. We kinda of have a dark sense of humour but the way he does it is worrying. It’s really hard to tell when he is joking too, or being serious because a lot of the stuff he says sounds jokey. I’ll ask him something like “are you alright?” And he will go “no” and when I ask his why he says “I don’t know”

Then in general he just acts erratically. We will be sitting watching tv and he will be fidgeting. Making weird faces. Randomly insulting people on tv and making jokes but it’s the kinda of jokes you would expect teenagers to make. He will also randomly blurt out sexual stuff. I’ll say something like “my toe hurts” and he will go “what colour?” He will make “jokes” about himself too. Saying he is fat, or weird, or fucked up. He says he gets random messed up thoughts that seem to distress him. I told him they are just intrusive thoughts as I get them too especially since I have OCD and that seemed to calm him down. Also yesterday he was messing around pretending he was hallucinating. He is only really like this when watching tv. If we are busy doing something he is fine.

He also seems to spend a lot of money, he is constantly buying stuff. He eats a lot too and it’s all junk. The other week he also admit he masturbates like 5 times a night, which seems excessive? He says he gets bored. This was after I left between 10-1 so it was like in 3 hours too. He doesn’t really have any friends. Just two who he only talks to online and sometimes goes weeks without talking to. He hardly spends anytime with family either. He seems to just isolate himself. Which he seems to of done since a kid according to his school reports. 

I get being weird because I’m really odd too, but some of the stuff he does seems to cross a line from weird to worrying. Should I be worried? It’s hard to tell because I have my own problems so not everything seems that “bad” to me as I’m pretty messed up so what I considered “normal” isn’t normal to others.",16Dec2020,1

482,"My (22M) little brother (8M) sleeps over my apartment on weekends. When he comes over, I let him play all of my old Gameboy Advance games. For example, Super Mario World and Pokemon Emerald.

Turns out he's been having more than a blast playing them, and all week long constantly asks my father (42M) how much longer until he gets to come over again, which makes me happy!

Now I've hit the issue of cheating. He has an old phone my father gave him when my father switched phones. On that phone he figured out how to download these two games, that way he doesn't have to wait all week to come over and play them. And with that, he figured out how to cheat. In Mario, he doesn't take any damage, and can fly from just standing on the ground. And in Emerald he gets 50,000 exp from fighting Wurmples, or anything for that matter.

Now, if he had even come remotely close to beating either of these games, I probably wouldn't see it as much of an issue. But before this happened, he tried again and again, game over after game over to progress a decent chunk into each game, loving it the whole time, and now he refused to play them the legit way.

From my viewpoint, cheats are for: 1) losers, and 2) people who've beaten the game 100 times, 80 different ways and are looking to spice things up. I've tried all I can think of different ways of trying to explain why he shouldn't cheat, but he just doesn't seem to think it's wrong. I told him it isn't as fun, but he disagrees. I told him the games weren't meant to be played that way, but he doesn't care.

I know the point of video games is to have fun, and he is still having fun, which is great. But it runs a little deeper, I don't want him to cheat around all obstacles in his life, these games aren't that hard and he was enjoying them just fine before discovering cheats. Even before this issue he was looking up all the secrets to the games which I wasn't a fan of, but at least he had to push through to get them.

The reason he comes over is a long story, but the short version is that he had nowhere to go and this was almost forced upon me to take care of him. Which I'm more than happy to do, but I wasn't/am not ready to have children yet so I don't know how to teach him this life lesson.

Any help or tips are massively appreciated!",16Dec2020,1
483,"Hello all, 
Sorry in advance im on mobile,

To start, I recently started a new job end of September. I essentially do testing on preproduction automobiles for a third party company that is hired by a manufacturer. I left my previous job because of the pay increase and no longer working manual labor, as well as going more into the career field I wanted and thought would make me more money. I make 19.50/hr and I was working anywhere from 50-60 hrs a week with overtime and double time and that was awesome for the time being which was up until about 3 weeks ago, where its slowed down now, especially because we have no weekend work that supplemented my hours above 40. I started the job with the understanding that I normally would work at least 50 hours, because that's what I previously budgeted for with my other jobs and expressed in my interview. We have been for the last few weeks contacting our supervisor for weekend work, which they said there was none.
Sorry for the overdone intro, but onto my advice question: My friend has started a position with a company that does pays 15/hr and he works from home and works minimum 40, but is allowed to work what he chooses to above the 40 and usually does 50. He is recruiting people for hospitals and gets paid 1/hr that they work, and they work at least 48hrs/week. Now he (it is his 3rd week) is currently staffing 30 employees and is getting at least 1 new one per day (this is not cold calling, it is a constant flow of employees looking for work) and the company expects you to have 30 within a month of working. Is it a good idea for me to switch jobs and at the minimum work 50 hours so I'm making more money than currently and potentially make a lot more once I have recruited employees like my friend? The only issue my fiance has brought up is that 1. I'd be leaving the career field I wanted to be in and 2. I'd be taking a paycut to work for that company. My rebuttal is that at 50 hrs a week im making more than I would be at 40, and that making money for us to live on is my main prerogative. 
(Sidenote: the average recruiter has 50-60 employees at a time, the top recruiter has 115) 
(Yearly pay for the different minimum employee levels; 30 employees with 50hrs a week (constant)- 117k before tax/ 20 employees - 92k/ 10 employees - 67k)
(Incase it comes up, they have daily meeting calls, Monday are recruiter training calls, you have plenty of resources through account managers)",16Dec2020,1
485,"So I went to IKEA this week and bought some furniture, me and my partner arrived under an hour before the store shuts (9pm). We zoomed round in a rush, grabbed a few small items and then the bulky stuff. I pay and we head to the car.

We drive all the way home and unpack, finally I realise we forgot to grab the 2nd package for an item of furniture; I only have half a cabinet. I check the receipt and realise that the cashier assumed the package underneath was the other half of the cabinet, it wasnt, it was a $150 table. I wasn't charged for this table and it wasn't even rang through by the cashier. The whole cabinet is worth $100.

It appears I have a few choices:

1. Return to the store and explain what happened, pay up $150 for the table and grab the 2nd half of my cabinet.  

2. Play dumb at returns, most likely they will just grab the other half of the cabinet and send me on my way; I'm up a table. Only issue with this is that they might delve into CCTV and see I had the right number of packages, but surely this isn't very likely?   

3. Go back and buy another whole cabinet, saving me $50 vs option 1. I'll also have a spare half a cabinet.  

4. Leave it and buy a cabinet elsewhere. I'm still $50 up.

What would you do? I've asked a few friends and family and they all say option 2 or 3.",16Dec2020,1

I was also supposed to get fruit plates and chef salads. And some more stuff like cups of peanut butter, a cup of ice, and a bowl of grapes for some residents. Well when it was time to serve the line, I was so disorganized. The first ticket said pizza, breadstick, tossed salad, milk, blah. So I was supposed to give them a straw and a cup of ranch and a milk and put their tray in the lunch cart. The second ticket said cheeseburger, mashed potatoes, soup of the day, milk, strawberry kiwi juice. So I was supposed to give them a straw, soup, crackers, milk, and juice, and then tray goes in cart. Pretty simple right? Well my mind was all over the place. Maybe because I had taken a klonopin beforehand. And I kept forgetting where I had put things. Also I ended a breaking a plate that day when trying to carry fruit plates and salads at the same time and the cook said “wow this is an easy day too.” So I kind of just was like forget it. I didn’t check to make sure the food was correct. I just put the lid on and just started putting things on their trays. Someone didn’t put the lids on the soup right and one spilled all over a tray and i didn’t clean up the tray. I just put another soup on it with the spilled soup on it. 

This also happened years ago when I was working at a thrift store. I forgot to discount some people and they mentioned it and if I wanted to void their whole order, I would have to get the manager. But I acted like I knew what to do by giving them 50 percent off some of the rest of their clothes and acting like it made up for the things they were supposed to get 50% when it didn’t. They’re total actually added up to more money than it would have cost with no discounts. Probably way more money. And they somehow still paid. I feel so bad about that to this day. 

And when I’m confused, I just act like I know what I’m doing and mess up so much stuff. Anyone can relate?",16Dec2020,1
487,"A little background: I got a job through a temp agency in October. These people were really nice and not once did they treat me like a temp. They treated me kindly, and with respect.

My boss is a super cool, super nice, super chill lady. She's fun, easy to talk to, and oh so nice. She's an altogether amazing person. She really is. 

Since December 1st the whole office has had to work from home. And with the holidays coming up my boss sent out an email to her whole team (she manages a whole department) and asked people for their home addresses. I was just curious as to why and when I received the email it got me a little paranoid.

She emailed back reminding me holidays are coming up and with that she wanted to send her team members a little something. I thought this was so nice. Primarily because before her all my bosses sucked. Most of them were sexist, or flat out rude. And being the grateful, overly eager and kind person I am I couldn't help myself.

Now, to note really quick, this is not the first time I've told my boss I think she's awesome to some degree. And I've never said it in a way that would come off as ass kissery or followed it up with any requests or anything of the sort. I just genuinely think she's amazing.

So emailed her back my address and then told her I think she's amazing, and super kind. Normally I wouldn't think anything of it.

I didn't hear back from her. Not that I was really expecting to... but normally we would be in office and I would see her and we would exchange small talk at lunch so I know I didn't weird her out.

502,"I never had any close friends, in high school I had two male friends that I really had a blast with in school but after we finished we broke up. I stayed in the same town, my other friend went to our capital city to live and the third friend went outside of our country for work.

Even away from school we wouldn't hang out that much, the real action was when we were at school. With that being said when school ended I was kinda alone all the time. Either in my room or just walking outside by myself.

A few months ago I linked up with my cousin because she called me to come with her and her two closest friends. She is more outgoing then me and at the time I was more of an introvert than now. Knowing that it was going to be me, her, one guy and a girl was ideal for me. I did know the guy from previous times that she has called me but the girl was new to me. So when I went out with them I met her and she was interesting, so interesting that I got her contact the second time we went out as group and in a very short period me and her started going out every single day. We instantly clicked as friends in such a short period. We shared music with each other, stories, we were both weird and it was so fun to be around her at that time.

Fast forward to today, recently I had a bad stroke of luck in my life, I got overwhelmed with anxiety and stress and for a long time I kept panicking around being outside in general. Whether alone or with friends I would experience panic attacks often. I started reading about this and one phobia came out named ""Agoraphobia"" although I am not saying that it is 100% that because I don't want to self-diagnose myself on nonsense.  
I was lucky enough that I noticed this problem within me in a short period and two days ago I promised myself that I was going to get more productive so I don't feel bored and such. I took up meditation, guitar practice, daily walks around town and even home workouts. My sister did advise me to seek out a psychologist for more in-depth help although for now I don't think I'm that desperate.

Now my problem is this: I randomly feel very anxious and nervous around my close friend and I don't know why. Like at home I might be anxious but now it happens rarely then before, but whenever I get a text from her I almost always get anxious and nervous. I don't know why this is happening, she is a very gentle and nice person. When this started happening I would avoid her telling her I'm not in the mood to go out and such but that just made her disappointed which was expected, I would be too if I got turned down five times in a row.

505,"First off, I need to explain that I struggle massively with anxiety and depression. 

I need to explain my backstory for this to make sense. I had a very tough childhood where I was abused emotionally on a daily basis. My mum was extremely cruel to me. I was repeatedly told things that no child should hear. How my dad didn’t want me and how I was disgusting and so on. My mum was very aggressive and controlling. I was so desperate for her love and affection but after years of trying, I eventually left home and went completely off the rails in my teen years. 

I had sex with many men. Often, I was very intoxicated and taken advantage of. I didn’t care though. I thought sex was the only thing that I could offer in this world. It was all I was worth. I would throw myself at men and allow them to treat me in any way they chose. I allowed them to degrade me and even humiliate me at times because I didn’t know any better. Feeling like that was something I had been so accustomed to growing up and I had grown to expect it. 

This all happened in my late teens. I am not 32 years old and am not haunted by the things done to me, but by something I may have done to someone else. 

I remember one night at a party, it was daylight outside but we were all very drunk, from what I can remember. I think it may have been early hours of the morning. I remember I touched a guy down below. I can’t remember much about it but I have this huge worry and fear that what if he wasn’t okay with that? What if he didn’t want to be touched. From my vague memory, he continued sitting next to me but I can’t remember if he asked me to stop or anything like that. The memory is so vague but one that sticks out in my mind for some reason. I’m not sure if it is more memorable simply because he didn’t take things further, like every other man i had been with had. 

I am filled with absolute fear and dread at the thought that maybe this wasn’t okay for him. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t live with this guilt. I feel like I am at absolute breaking point and don’t know how to put one foot in front of the other any more! 

Please help me! I am desperate!!",16Dec2020,1

She recently told me she wants something that money can't buy. The only 2 things I can come up with is something made by me (which I'm not good at) or some kind of experience like going on picnic or something (the place we live in doesn't make this easy either).

508,"Im not quite sure how to phrase my exact question but i just really need someone to understand me and possibly help me move forward with my life. Im 20 and still living with my parents, we are really poor and i have been paying bills off and on since i got my job back when i was a senior in high school. My mom has ms and my is incapable of working and my dads job isnt stable, he sometimes goes months without working. He hasnt gone back to that job since last November. I got him a job near where i work but hes making even less than i am. 


I work at a fast food place, making roughly $10 and hour. Im perpetually broke, and im drowning in multiple drug addictions, as well as my dad. We both smoke and drink almost every night. On top of that i vape and he smokes cigarettes. I take adderall to get through my long shifts at work (which are almost all of them). I had to drop out of college because quite frankly im over whelmed and it just keeps getting worse and worse. 

Ive put on weight and ive been spiraling hopelessly in and out of depression. Im just so stressed out, my hairs started greying and i dont know what to do or how i can help myself. I cant sleep if i dont drink and i cant work without adderall. Weed helps me with my anxiety and im too deep into nicotine to go cold turkey. I know these are all stupid excuses, i know that what i do is not justifiable and it probably contributes to my perpetual brokeness. I just dont think i could handle all of this without them. 

Ive lost faith in my ability to be a strong person. Im slowly sinking further and further into rock bottom and no one around me is doing anything to stop me. My dad literally buys weed and beer for me. Everyone just enables me and while i appreciate it in the moment, long term its destroying me. Im so lost and i have no one in my life who can help me.

513,"Hey all- 

I am requesting some advice related to unemployment options, work place bullying, getting a one up on corporate and over all how to help my mom out of an emotionally tough place and help her pull up the old boot straps- 


My mom was just offered two “we don’t want you to work here any more” offers by her boss. 

One is an improvement plan (but it the boss told her to her face she isn’t a fit for the company). The thing is, my mom has email after email from other departments telling her how awesome she is, and how they couldn’t have gotten project x done with out her. That is until boss decided my mom wasn’t allowed to work with other departments any more. Additionally, the woman has been bullying my mom relentlessly the last year to try to get her to quit (isolation, removing job responsibilities, starting rumors, nasty words said behind her back and to her face, just trying to get my mom to snap so she would leave). So I would imagine this would  continue per normal. (Yes we have proof, but “at will” means you can leave if ya want).  so my mom would absolutely be let go no matter what - cause the lady has decide my moms not young and pretty and peppy enough to do her job. (Isn’t there protection for people her age?) 

Second is that she leave now and the company will pay her rent and she can then move, find a new job, whatever. 

Thing is, my mom needs the unemployment and I am concerned that the second option will not give her the option to get unemployment since you have to have been terminated (as in, if they give you another job option you have to have taken it). It will give her a temporarily better quality of life, since my mom has been sick multiple times this year (like hospitalizations) due to work place bullying. 

I don’t want my mom suffering more, but I think (based off limited knowledge admittedly) that she should take the improvement plan and keep looking for a new job. 

I am looking for some advice with unemployment, how to council my mom (who is understandably emotionally distraught- she’s never had anyone fire her or treat her like this before). 

Sorry if I Rambled. I love my moms, and I can’t do much more for her then offer support and figure out how to help. (I’m not rolling in the dough myself enough to help her retire or anything). 

Any and all help/ pointing to resources is appreciated. I have already looked at the states unemployment pages, and federal, it’s a lot of if/this/when stuff and we aren’t the ones with the lawyers:/ 


Lost story short: need advice on- take the pay out (and possibly loos unemployment) or take an improvement plan (and be bullied mercilessly by a boss led group of young mean girls).",16Dec2020,1

I am writing this post to showcase my art, as well as to ask a question about how to calculate the price of my custom-painted clothing.

I have recently started painting my old clothes out of boredom and it turned out that people actually appreciate my work!

Today I got a request and thought of doing a little ""business"". After some research, I found out that the materials would cost me around 15$ for this one project. Their request would be to draw this [https://imgur.com/a/MsWsC4X](https://imgur.com/a/MsWsC4X) on a shirt provided by themselves.

I just want to be able to ask him when he’s coming back to work. I’m worried he quit but I could be overthinking things because I know he likes his job.

The problem is that they pretty much refuse to do anything about it. 
I think it is more anxiety, they have barely left the house since March, won’t go for walks due to 5 minutes of walking causing pain. 
The doctors have suggested regular exercise, weight loss, more water, and therapy for anxiety. I’ve been to therapy myself so there isn’t a stigma about it in my family.

I started to notice he would get snippy and rude texting, if he did not think my input was valid, and I was not ""invested"" into our business. We got together to run through ideas on how to make it successful. I know little to nothing on designing a website, and would just give my opinions. I started noticing on text messages he would be really critical of me and he did not feel I was taking this seriously. Literally, we could not get the permits we needed.

The night prior to our meeting, I texted him explaining I had the stomach flu and could not make it. He wrote me a really rude and demeaning text. He called me some nasty names, and was extremely rude. I contacted the following day via text. He never responded. 

I was done with his drama and rude behavior. I never contacted him again. Fast forward to three months, the guy texts me. I was just done and blocked him.

We chose 6 month @ $145 a cleaning ( which is steep for our budget) but it was the cheapest option and having extra help was worth a big chunk of my paycheck to me. 
We scheduled to service they assigned us a cleaning pro and we waited. That Tuesday at 10am we expect our cleaner to be there. 1030 rolls around and she hasn’t texted me back when I asked her if she was coming. No answers. So I rescheduled the service and reported it so I wouldn’t be charged. We rescheduled for 8am the next day. So 8am rolls around on Wednesday and I asked if they were coming, waited, no response. So I cancelled the service all together. Now I don’t want to do any business with them. The price was already steep. They refunded me the $72. And credited $10 to my account for each missed service ( which I don’t care about). I don’t want anything to do with them. 
The catch is that cancelling before my 6 month commitment causes a $99 cancellation fee, which is ridiculous in the first place. But I’m not paying it to an unreliable company. 
I emailed them asking for a fee waiver since they couldn’t provide me the service the promised. They basically said we gave you a credit so yeah, pay the fee to cancel.

Well my boss kept trying to reassure me that I was doing fine,  but this way my way to look for an escape honestly. I was hoping that I was going to be agreed to be let go. This just opened a realm of information about my boss and I see through him now..
This job is retail. It's nothing more besides retail and screen printing. 
My boss told me ""you're doing more here with your degrees then you would anywhere else."" Thats his first foot in mouth moment.
My degrees are criminal justice and cyber security.  He didn't know my degrees.  The second thing was I caught him in a lie. He said he has a business degree,  but a few weeks back he told me he never finished a degree because his business took off. 
Those things stuck out to me, and it bothers me that he lied and is manipative. 
Yesterday night rolls around and we speak again but this time I'm not holding back,  I told him I'm looking for another job and that I'm not happy here. I have only worked their for 4 months but he is the reason I'm not happy. He brought my photography into this whole mess and offered me to hang it on the wall and sell it to make extra money. (Because he pays 12 a hour.) Well he told me ""the only reason I bring your photography up is because I want you to master that software"" (the printing software) That was the breaking point for me. I rejected the offer and was done. He refuses to pay me to learn this software and instead wants me to come in on my day off to learn it or learn it at home. I would be the only employee bring work home with me. I disagree with this. This is a minimum wage job. No benefits,  small business.  

A few other things that have gone on is, he calls my hair a mop and then other coworkers do too. Then proceeded to bring this one moment up that I don't ever remember of me apparently laughing along with them about my hair?

Recently he's convinced our parents that I've been attacking him, and I am not allowed to talk about it or explain that he has been lying. What can I do?",16Dec2020,1

539,"I'm 19F and right now I have a part time job (I work about 26-30 hrs a week) and my husband has a full time job. Although we both have jobs, right now I'm catching up on a couple Christmas gifts, but afterwards I plan on going vegetarian. I'm mentioning the Christmas gift thing because money is low, and I don't want to spend all of what I have on food, ya know?

Anyways, my reasoning for going vegetarian is mainly because I just don't enjoy eating meat. In the end, it makes me feel heavy, too full, and gross. I do eat salmon occasionally, most of the time it's from a bag of frozen cuts of salmon, so it's not incredibly fresh and amazing for you, but the ""fresh"" salmon is the same price for one cut of it when I could buy an entire bag. This is the only meat I can eat without feeling like crap afterwards. 

I was not raised in a healthy household. We had a lot of junk, processed snacks, fast food, etc. I was never taught about how to make meal, let alone a healthy one at that. 

Any food that I would buy would most likely have to be a mix of some fresh foods, but mainly canned or frozen foods. I don't know where the best place would be to even find recipes or how to make sure I'm not hurting myself in the process of going vegetarian. I've looked on Pinterest a little and I plan on looking for actual recipes, but are there any other specific sites that could help for what I'm looking for?

And does anyone have any general tips for things I might not be thinking of right now? Just for generally going vegetarian. I'd love to hear anything and everything, and any advice would be super helpful. Thanks in advance.",16Dec2020,1

541,"I've recently been thinking about changing careers. I know its not uncommon for a uni student to reevaluate their choice of studies but I think Im a pretty late to the party considering Im in third and would be graduating next year. Taking that into account, I dont know if I should go along with it. If I do end up changing I get this feeling that I´ll have thrown these three years away, like im straying behind while everyone else my age moves forward. 

But on the other hand im not really motivated to study the things im being taught, which is especially hard since the line of work this degree leads to requires you to have a lot of passion. Not only that, but the environment im surrounded by isnt helpful either. Im constantly being bested by other student that have huge potential and on top of that I dont really have friends so nothing really motivates me. I dont know if this career change is just an excuse to change my surroundings. I honestly have no idea how to feel. I just feel kinda lost. Nothing to look forward to, when I go to class the only thing I think about is how much time is left for it to be over. 

I've brought this up with my parents and they support me my decision, that said I cant help but feel like im letting them down somehow. I feel like a jerk to be in such a privileged situation where my parents fully support me and probably expect great things from me but im just here not even taking advantage of my education.

542,"When I was eighteen, I started a clothing company that was pretty successful. It set me up with a lot of money for an eighteen year old. 

At the same time, my parents were on the brink of bankruptcy. None of my siblings were in the position to help, so I helped them, with close to $60k. This was a big portion of my net worth. Eventually my clothing company failed and since then ive been paying my way through college by working minimum wage jobs.

Im on my last semester and all my siblings are now succeeding financially ( im the youngest ), while im barely scraping by. 

My parents pay me back $100 a month, so ill get my money back in another 50+ years. 

Part of me feels like my parents held me back, stopped me from pursuing projects with the funds I used to help them. And my successful siblings reaped the rewards of my family not going into bankruptcy. Their student loans, their stability, all available because of what I did for the family. 

I have an immense amount of hate in me and I want to stop. When my parents try to offer me career advice, I almost want to scream at them. They dont know I feel this way, I never show it, but man this is hard on me.

546,"I was a stupid naive indian girl and my parents sheltered me from all evils. I always wanted a prince charming and when I met Josh at 17, I thought he was the one. I had a one side crush on him for 2 years. We are church members that's how we met. we started talking and after 2 years , we become close. I started noticing that his behaviour towards me was different from the way he treated others. He always defended me , never let anyone belittle me or mock me (even if it was just some friendly banter), and won't pay attention to his phone when I am near him. I loved his attention and care and soon I realized a lot more changes in him..like the way he would say my name (with a lot of authority..like I belong to him...not even my dad called me by my name like that), he would never say no to me and the only time he kind of raised his voice is when I didn't paid attention to what he was saying. But the foolish me , overlooked everything.

So one day when I was 19 , he said he loves me and I was in cloud 9. so we started being in a relationship but we kept it as a secret. We both were each other's first love and first kiss..He later started pressurizing me to strip for him in video call , emotionally blackmailed me and at last I did it for him. I stripped for him and I would send nudes to him. I blindly trusted him. then later I started realizing that his calls are declining and he would call me only when he wants to see my body..then I went for college in another district and after some time he stopped answering my texts and calls. I was sad. then two weeks b4 my bday I called him and finally he picked up and he dumped me. I was devastaed and depressed. I failed my exams. But yet I loved him and couldn't forget him and still continued stripping for him even after breakup hoping he would come back.. It was a very foolish decision. I know that now.

Then after 1 year I went abroad for Uni ( I quit my college) and was still sad but my Uni friends helped me a lot and I started enjoying my life, regained my self esteem. things was going great but then one day, he texted me and said how much he misses me and wants to kiss me and asked to strip for him but I refused even though I still loved him. 

Then I came home for winter hols and he started texting me again but I didn't respond much. but then one day I was forced to meet him and he tried to kiss me but I pushed him away..after a few days , he came to my home with his dad and he again tried to kiss me and to grope me and I tried to push him away but he was too strong for me and he forcefully dryhumped me..It took me one week to come in terms with what happened . so i decided to call him and to yell at him (to get some peace) and that turns out to be the biggest fight in my life..he said that I liked it but I told him no..that gone for a while and I guess he eventually realised I didn't liked it...anyways I asked him whether I was just a sex toy for him and he replied no..and that he never saw me as a sex toy and that he trust me alot and that's why he stood naked during our video call and that he never did that for anyone else...anyways after a long fight he finally said that he never loved me and only loved my body and only had LUST FOR ME....I was sad, devastated and felt used...but that'swhat helped me to finally move on and I thanked God for not letting me to lose my virginity to that jerk.

After a few months he again contacted me saying he wants to talk about something but I didnt respond..but after a few days I contacted him out of curiousity and he said that after our big fight he felt very guilty and that he is sorry and that he didn't mean anything by it and he said all those bcz he was under a lot of stress on that day and he was angry and that he said to purposely hurt me..I didn't buy any of it..THen I realized that I don't feel anything for him and felt happy and when he said how much he misses me and how much he longed for my hugs or to sleep on my laps, I told him to say that to his current gf and not to cheat on her and I said that I no longer want him in my life. He said since we shared our body, we are one and I was like when did we ever did that, I shared my nudes foolishly but that doesn't means that you own me..sharing my nudes with him is not equal to sleeping wih him . I bruised his ego and in the end he blocked me and honestly I laughed out loud when he did that. 

2 weeks ago, it was his dad's bday and my parents dropped me off at his home to spend a day with them since we are very close with his family. things was going good until he decided to forcefully hug me , grope me and kiss me. but I resisted all his advances and i told him that I don.'t love him anymore...and later he raised his voice when i refused his help to do something. Throughout the day , he was acting all unusual and odd and goofy( like when we were dating) and everyone noted that, but they overlooked it.

&amp;#x200B;

550,"I've posted this before, but things now changed rapidly. As background information, we (let's call her L, 18) go to the same class and two months ago she wrote me whether she could sit with us (a group of 4 men (2x16, 1x17 and me)) during the breaks. 

Since then we have been very good friends and write to each other every day and have already had a few meals after school. 

Now we decided on Thursday that we would smoke cannabis on Saturday because I do that kinda often and she wanted to try it out too. I also invited a buddy (let's call him K, 16) because I didn't want it to be too much like a date. 

Background information: She has a boyfriend who is in the armed forces, but whom she has not seen for months. She also claims that the relationship is of no use to her and that the boyfriend puts down things that she likes.

 That's why I didn't want to make a date out of it, even if I wasn't uninterested in a relationship.

 Then came Saturday: We were delayed at the dealer and then smoked a joint in the dark and wet with the dealer, so four of us smoked a joint. K, who actually already has experience, fell over after two hits. two times. Then L had a panic attack. She said she couldn't see anything and I went to a lantern with her hand in hand to give her security. 

There I rubbed her back a little while holding her hand + talking to her while when K came back with the dealer who looked after him (I know the dealer very well personally and could therefore trust him). 

When she calmed down, she still held on to my hand and we walked 40 minutes to the train station. When we got to my city, we quickly got to my room and got ready to go to sleep.

 I have a mattress and a sofa in my room. I initially suggested that L could have the single mattress, but K wanted it. That's why L slept with me on the sofa and because we watched films for 6 hours, she lay down by my side.

 There we fell asleep shoulder to shoulder and in the morning we stayed there and watched YouTube on her cell phone. 

One day later i told her i was sorry for randomly grabbing her hand as she needed it, but she said it helped her and she was fine with it. We even agreed to do it a second time in early january. 

But now she doesnt join Discord during online lessons anymore and, although she answers my messages, she does it delayed (like 2 to 3 hours which usually wasnt the case) and K just completely ghosts me and even doesnt wanna talk to me anymore. He said: ""He needs time to think about what happened and what will happen in the future.""

And i now am completely confused. I mean, i could understand why L would be upset, although she initiated most of the events and was fine with me holding her hand, but K ? I didnt even do anything that could upset him.

My guess is that he has a crush on her and is upset because L gave me some attention (bad wording, i dont really know how to phrase it better), because as the school started he talked about which girls are good looking and he mentioned her. 

How should i proceed now? I dont want to lose them as friends, but cant stand being ignored without telling me what i did wrong. After all, he said it was a very nice evening the day after.",16Dec2020,1
551,"In March of this year I was hospitalized and treated for acute pancreatitis. I briefly changed my diet and felt fine after a couple weeks so all went back to normal. In October/November I had another flare up just like the one in March and was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, sent to a GI specialist, and told to change my diet to help with my symptoms. Between my second flare up and my telehealth appointment with the GI doctor I changed my diet to almost fat free at the suggestion of online resources.

553,"So to make a very long story short, my dad's an abuser. Has been my whole life. He is also most probably a narcissist.

We don't get along at all and he's been accusing my mom of sleeping with my brother and he's fully convinced of this even though he's been making secret recordings of us for the last 4 years and has found nothing. He has beaten the shit out of us all because of this fucked up idea. He watches an unbelievable amount of incest porn and some other questionable shit. He threatens us with violence if we don't agree with him and he accuses us of lying if we tell the truth.

Now that the rant is over, let me describe the problem. This has gotten too much for us and my mom wants a divorce, but he doesn't want to play fairly. He threatens to bribe the police to lock my mom up for a whole bunch of things ranging from HIS illegal business to false proof of her molesting kids and the dogs.

He compares her to the man who molested her when she was younger and he emotionally abuses the lot of us by breaking us all down and then turning around and being the niceness himself.

We recently had an argument and he pretty much cut me off. He said he doesn't want to be associated with me anymore because I abuse him. He refuses to acknowledge what he does hurts us and he says it's our fault.

So now with the divorce coming up, my mom doesn't know what to do. She got retrenched because of covid and has no income whatsoever. We don't have family near us who we can stay with.

My dad wants us out. He refuses to give us the house and wants me to pay rent if I want to stay here and demands I pay him my entire salary. I'm a full time college student and have recently gotten a job so that I can start saving up to move out. He wants it all. It's barely a liveable wage, but it's better than nothing. 

My mom wants to go live on this beaten up farmhouse one of her friends has, but I don't want to go there because it's way too far from work and school, and I don't have a driver's license to get myself around. 

I don't want to stay at home either because my dad wouldn't give a shit about me regarding my transport or even food.

556,"Usual reasons for a throwaway. Names are not real names. Sorry it's a long one, as I don't know how to arrange my thoughts rn and I'm on mobile, so sorry for any bad formating.

Some backstory, I'm a 23 year old guy, my uncle's are in their 30s-40s and are basically the backbone of our family, they plan everything, arrange things like holidays, dinners, birthdays, not because we make they but because of they don't do it, it won't be right. 

For the last couple years I have been in constant fear about what would happen if I told my family about something that happened between myself and my uncle (Frank's) partner (Bart) a few years ago. It feels like I am stuck in the moment just before a water droplet is about to splash down into the water, I don't fear the landing but the ripples it's going to make. Butterfly effect and all that.

So at a family's birthday a few years back we rented out this big farm house in the country for a few days, and on the last day before we packed up and went home, Bart got drunk as per usual and kept insisting that I got in the hot tub with him. I said no (body image issues) but after a while decided screw it, it would be a laugh, could have been the fact that I was drinking a bit too or because I felt bad that I hadn't gotten in once while we were there.

Anyway as I'm sat there with him he starts asking about my sex life and why I had not been with anyone. (Backstory: I was 18-19 at the time and had only dated one girl for a brief period of time) He then starts to ask if it's because I'm uncomfortable with physical contact, which I was, to the point I did not like to hug people, I've gotten over that now. Slightly. Next he says that if I want, I can jack off with him now while in the pool, big nope to that. He starts saying how he would help me if I wanted and starts going off that you don't have to be gay to poke it another man's backdoor. (I'm paraphrasing here). I freeze up as it's not a discussion I want to be having with my uncle's partner as I'm definitely not gay and don't want to be jerked off by him.

To this he decides he wants to help me get over this by playing firetruck (a game where you put a hand on someone's inner thigh and go higher up it untill they say red light or stop) as soon as he touched me I said stop, he said that can't be so soon and kept going up. By the time he had his hand maybe an inch further I got out of the hot tub and locked myself in my room. Next few days, it was like nothing had happened.

Then one day as my sister and I were on the train back from collage, I got a text saying he would pick us up from the station as he wanted to talk to me about something. Oh no. He drops my sister off at home and we go down to the local beach and take his dog for a walk. Don't say anything there or on the walk. On the way back however, he pulls into a secluded area, sits and says nothing while I wince at every movement he makes as if he is about to wing at me. The as if nothing was wrong he drops me off at home and leaves.

This has been my waking nightmare ever since as I don't know if I can tell anyone without causing ripples that might destroy my uncle's heart, ruin the few happy memories that my mother had before she got cancer (all's good now, but still) or fracture the family. I've spoken to a few close friends about it and they all say I need to speak to my family about it as he could also do this to my younger cousins. I have been waiting for the right time to talk about it but there is always something, mother gets cancer (definitely not ripping that band-aid there and then) then get cleared of it, father then get cancer (no joke a week later), I move away for university, birthdays. Now with covid and finishing uni at a time where jobs aren't abundant I have no way to keep away from him without flat out saying no which people will ask question about and in my family, just saying no to doing something helpful without a good reason (not wanting to isn't good enough). This has let to me having to be alone with him several times over the last few months and everytime I feel the same amount of dread as I did when he basically kidnapped me after collage.

I honestly don't think I can take it anymore and need to tell my family, but it is Christmas next week and I just feel like it will get swept under the rug like many things do as if they do take this seriously, it could break over 25 years of trust between a man, his partner and a large family or I just get told to live with it as I'm ""over reacting to someone who tried to bring me out of my shell"".

TL:DR - Uncle's partner broke my trust in him by asking if I wanted to jerk him off in a hot tub while he did the same to me and sliding his hand up my leg. Now I feel like I'm going to have to die with this knowledge or destroy my family.",16Dec2020,1

563,"So. I’ve been talking to a girl for years now. We had our oh so casual “I’m drunk rn but I like you” kinda of talks but nothing ever came of it. Up until last night, she hit me with a come over text. I was like dope, my friend lives over there lemme grab a bottle of rum from him so I don’t come over dry. Shit goes good and we all have fun, my friend being the textbook definitely of fun and a wingman, gets me closer to said girl. At some point she says she too drunk and goes to bed. All cool right? No she ask me to help her and eventually takes me into same bed. Being the guy I am I don’t take advantage of it I actually just tell her to chill out with me, everything you’re doing I get it but I can’t do so much without you being any bit sober than what she was. So I’m chilling with her and we both have our hands around each other cuddling. And god does it feel good. It’s been a good solid 2 years since I was with anyone like this. Up until my friend dragged me out and said more beer pong and took me back to his place afterwards. I was so hammered at this point I remember saying no I wanna chill with said girl but he says nah you’re chilling with a girl who’s dead drunk. I’m offended of course though cause we all were and I was personally invited to chill with said girl but anyway he takes me back to his place and before I know it, I’m wanting to go back, I’m so drunk off my mind, for whatever reason there’s bacon and eggs on the stove, and then the worst happens. I can’t back to their apt because of a gate that I didn’t know goes up in the morning and lord knows no one would answer a phone at this time. But I was right there. I was so close.

565,"So I've been interning at this company for 2 years and at the end of my frist year, I signed a job offer for a full time position for when I graduate. In it was the basic ""we will pay you X amount in salary, X amount bonus, etc"". I just graduated and was planning to start the full time position in January and today I got an email from HR that the original offer was adjusted to reflect new pay rates.

I was happy to see it being quite a bit more, but was quickly drowned out by the additional clause they added that stated if my GPA is under 3.6 that the company has the right to ""adjust your salary accordingly"". I don't know if this matters but a GPA requirement was never discussed in the job listing, the email notifying the change, etc.

I know my GPA is quite a ways below that, and I want to email HR on what the adjustment would look like but I'm stuck on how to format it without making it sound desperate or something. Do I bring up this clause was not on the original offer? Or am I overthinking this?",16Dec2020,1
566,"I'm M/White and the qualities I want in a partner are increasingly underrepresented in European people. Europeans are increasingly promiscuous, egalitarian, and less interested in waiting for marriage to have sex, permanent marriage, and pro social behavior compared to East Asians.

I've seen it before with colleagues and family who married East Asians and the stats also back up that they have more stable marriages and less sexual partners. I want to be a virgin and date a girl who is with the prospect of marriage. At least in the modern west that's very rare, while in the east very realistic, with some countries having very low rates of premarital sex and divorce.

The problem is I fear the consequences of having mixed children. They might not feel like they belong to either group and feel strange seeing such a divide in families, culture, and appearance. I've also noticed a lot of depression and self hatred among half white/asians, particularly males. Besides all this I'm not very attracted physically to Asians. A middle ground might be to find someone who is European but of a more traditional background like Romania or even go further genetically to something like Georgia or Armenia which is still relatively similar and Christian Cultures. I know those cultures are becoming increasingly like the west though so I'm not sure if past data is a reliable metric, but it does seem like they have a strong Christian background and low divorce/sex partners.

Alternatively there are a small number of people in the US(where I live) that still have these values, particularly more fundamentalist Christians but I don't live near those either and it's still quite rare. Any ideas on the best option to orient myself towards?",16Dec2020,1
567,"f 17. i’m a high school senior, about to be eighteen, applying to colleges. i’ve dealt with a couple different mental illnesses throughout my life, but my adhd is my biggest issue. i was put on vyvanse right before school started when i was still working and it helped me immensely. i’m awful at math and with the help of vyvanse, i went to tutoring and got a c in algebra for that quarter. a month or two later my doctor stopped refilling my prescription because of my history with eating disorders. however, my medical marijuana doctor is a psychiatrist and he put me back on vyvanse yesterday. so i’m a bit more hopeful. 

i started pulling all nighters and drinking monster energy in eighth grade and i don’t think i’ve gotten a full eight hours of sleep since then. my sleep schedule is now incredibly fucked up and it’s kinda ruining my life. i’ve gotten into the habit of staying of til midnight or later since quarantine began. i smoke a bowl around 7/8 and then do dumb shit on my phone, research random topics, or watch tv. then the next morning i have school and i cannot bring myself to get out of bed. i’ve been on time to school maybe six times this school year. now i’m suspended and my school is threatening to expel me. i’ve tried melatonin, benadryl, kratom, cbd, thc, alcohol, kava, chamomile, and other stuff. i set multiple alarms and even got one that shakes my bed. yet, i still cannot complete the basic task of getting out of bed on time. my family is getting tired of giving me chances and i’m losing hope in myself.

tldr: i stay up late and can’t get out of bed the next morning. now i’m at risk of getting expelled from school before i even graduate.

572," Hi there,

It’s been a while since I’ve posted something of this importance on Reddit. Usually I just wander through Youtube videos that feature some crispy reddit threads, but I’ve never really took an interest in sharing my life with people on the internet (even less asking for help).

But right now, I don’t really know who to turn to.

For some background, I’m a 24 years old female, and I’m from a pretty big family (we’re 9 kids from the same conservative-Christian parents). I’m the first daughter, and it’s been 4 years since I moved out to a bigger city (parents live in a rural French region). 

I’ve been dealing with depression and self-harming for kind of a long time. I’ve just very recently understood what it was, and it’s been 2 years since I began seeing a psychiatrist about that (weekly sessions). 

At first, the effects were rather positive: I gained enough self confidence to find a real job, and for a long period of time, I stopped being this pitiful creature that refused to open to anyone about anything.

Then the lockdowns started, and the weekly therapies session brutally stopped (my doctor works in a hospital). I had a **BIG** argument with one of my roommates regarding the virus (that’s a story for another time), and everything turned into a shitshow; my destructive habits came back harder than before, with some new ones (hi there bottle of booze). I became even more bitter and sarcastic, and I pretty much cut contact with anyone that was interested in my emotional state.

When the first lockdown ended in May, things were a little bit less dark (I managed to leave my roommates for a whole new apartment for myself, and I liked my job). I also managed to have another meeting with my therapist.

But it didn’t last, since the lockdown started again at the end of October. I was completely destroyed at the thought of spending time alone in my tiny apartment, and my first response was to drink a whole glass of schnaps.

One of my brothers called me, and upon seeing that I was in a pretty bad shape, he made me call my parents so that they could come and pick me up with my work stuff.  

Since then, I live at my parent’s place, and if things were great at first (no more lonely evenings with chartreuse shots), I slowly began to crumble again.

Even if my parents could be rather harsh at times, they’ve never abused me in any way. I know that their heart was (and still is) in the right place, but I just can’t honestly open up to them; my father is unable to understand this type of things, and my mother would overreact. I’ve already tried speaking to them before, but it always left me hurt because they just wouldn’t understand.

So I can’t talk to them about how lonely I feel. Everyone around me seems to function pretty well with one another, having conversations and relationships with each other… and I’m over there, trying my best not to interfere with anyone. Social interactions just don’t seem to worth the effort.   
 But of course, I’m a god damn human being, so I need to be heard at times… so I’m in this constant thought process of “*no one would want to interact with someone like me*” and “*I wish there was someone to hear what I have to say*”.

It just doesn’t seem to end, and as time goes on, I find myself to be more bitter and sarcastic (hence the ""*femcel*"").

So I don’t know, maybe some of you people may share some practical advices that could help me to stop being such a negative ball of energy.   
Well meaning wishes are cool at first, but after a while I fall into my sarcastic self again and they have no effects.  


Here are some facts that you may find useful before adding your two cents:  


* Needless to say, I’m single (only had a boyfriend for less than two months), and since I’ve been      rejected by a guy that I was really into, I’ve never really dared to date. I don't find myself particulary ugly. Just not worth of anyone's time.  
* I’ve never made any real friends since I moved from my parent’s home, and I only have a couple      of them in total.
* Since the beginning of the second lockdown, I managed to meet my psychiatrist more often… on an ap. It’s been very difficult to keep up with the exercises, but at least I’m not totally left by myself.
* I’m also religious, like my parents (although I may be a little bit more open minded than them), so      they are not really harassing me regarding a potential lack of faith. I’m not really comfortable to discuss the extend of my faith here (not the topic); just know that I don’t really think that God is responsible for all this mess. I am.
* Like I said, I’m not really into reaching to other people on the internet; that means that maybe I      would disappear from here as suddenly that I appeared. Please don’t be surprised. It’s always like that.

577,"          I’m having depressive thoughts ever since i was elementary, it still continues up to now, its been 6 year since i thought it would go away if i just let the time pass by and just continue on living but ever since the pandemic hits, where i have lots of time to reflect on myself i've come to a realization that life is meaningless and living become way too boring for me i also thought of it now as a burden, the reason why im still alive and breathing right now is because i don't want to ruin my family, im pretty sure that if im living alone i probably ended my life already. I decided that i'll spare my life for years and let my parents die peacefully before i kill myself or maybe atleast i might be able to find a reason to live by then.

           My family and a small group of friend know that im having a problem but don't know what kind of problem since i don't want to say it to them, i don't want to cause drama or something like that though i already did last week and it ended up chaotic causing another problem, i ask advice to one of my friend his whole family probably know it already they are willing to help me but i don't trust them neither my family would be able to handle my problem also, it might just escalates into me finally killing myself, i don't like being pitied by or being the center of attraction. 
            
            I tell them that i would drop since i can't handle or re-organize my thoughts properly, so i just want to take a break for a year since it might help to calm down my thoughts but they didn't agree, it's because its only just 9 months before i graduate, it's because we're poor and cannot afford me to just drop because i'll loose the perks of being able to enroll to a school for free, but i don't really think my mind can handle it until then, i might just go insane. They ended up telling it to my classmates also it's pretty much know anywhere already which just increase my suicidal thoughts day by day.

             I don't know what to do in my life anymore, they keep sending messages like 'you can do it, don't give up' idk why but it doesn't really do anything to me anymore probably because what i need is reason to live not motivation.

586,"My cousin is in her 30s, she has 5 kids. I have only met 3 of them. I think I \*saw\* the little girl briefly after she was born, but not the youngest at all. The oldest child has had it the worst, but quite frankly, they haven't had the best upbringing, all of them. The boyfriend who is father to 4/5 children have been around for over a decade, they did get ""engaged"" and he bought a ring, but I am pretty sure they sold it. He refuses to work, and doesn't like it if my cousin works. Currently I don't know what is going on, as according to my sister, even welfare is looking for them (as are creditors).  Many family members have tried to help them, but they typically abuse it and then run off leaving those usually with some of their debt...

Most of the good toys they get go to get ""fixed"" at pawn shops. They are lucky if they get it back. That is, of course, until the 3rd who has been more often than not been breaking his and everyone else's belongings. He did mellow out a little, but I am pretty sure there is something behavioural there... And that is if they're not moving to which most of their belongings get left behind... 

They've moved three times this year alone... Or least that is what I understand. She (My cousin) gave me her latest address, but her son said she hadn't moved. But he doesn't know their current address. the second son told me he was still staying with certain people, BUT immediately deleted the message (this was on Facebook messenger)  


I want to get the kids something, but I don't really know what. Some of the kids I barely know anything about, and there are so many issues. I think the youngest is one, and the oldest is a teen, around 16. They know it will be late as they only gave me the address Sunday (13th) and I am on isolation now as I had a GI upset (pretty sure food poisoning) but because I was in contact with someone who tested positive for Covid, I had to get tested. So, I cannot go out right now and not until I get my results.   


When I can go out, or potentially have someone help, the question is what to do or get? Anything electronic often gets hawked (sold) or destroyed, anything gift card wise is often the same, or doesn't go to the kids. It cannot be anything that might spoil any time soon, as I am not sure the address is even hers, and may be a friends (as she is hiding from creditors) but the kids could get the items eventually? It would be great if they had an experience, but I don't know what. I have done the ""movie night"" with a big bowl, and small popcorn containers, a popcorn maker and kernels, and flavourings for the popcorn, and a few movies. I don't know if she still has that stuff though... but maybe something like that?

First some back story:

I have battled with depression and anxiety disorder for a good portion of my life and was ready at 19 to end it all. The pain was to much and I just couldn't handle it anymore. Luckily I made a decision that changed my life for the better and I got myself out of that. It took some time but I can finally say that I am ready to start my life now that I have found my passion and the career path I want to pursue. At 22 it might be a little late (I know) and I constantly worry about being to slow and not being able to keep up with everyone around me. Now I really want to be a Veterinarian Doctor. 

Here is the problem:

My grades in Highschool where... lets say not so good. I am very ashamed of this and blame myself for it even tho I know that back then I had multiple physical injuries which left me in constant pain and ontop of that was mentally already just drained (sleeping 3 hours a night, constant anxiety attacks and just general huge depression cloud over me). I dont want to use my state back then as a excuse anymore because now I know that many people are in far worse situations and what has happened already happened. No turning back. Thats why I had chosen instead of going the Vet medicine road I will start with being a Vet nurse/technician (entry requirements are not so strict). I found amazing schools abroad and started to apply but I still have a really bad feeling about not getting in due to my grades. I see this almost as my last chance and that if I cant get into my dream school now I have just failed everyone around me who has cheered me on so far and that thought is giving me a full blown panic attack. 
I really don't know what to do anymore. I really want to go school in South East Asia and would do anything to get into these schools but I am simply not good enough and I am constantly being reminded of this when I look at my grades. 
I just need some help in figuring out if it is worth it? I feel so hopeless and barely have energy to do anything anymore. I... I just want to be enough and not feel so lost anymore. I feel like all the hard work I put into the last few years has just gone up in smokes due to my grades.
So please reddit anybody who has been in similar shoes before what did you do? How did you get out of this slump and how can I feel enough even tho I lack in so many departments.
Or even better how can I better myself and my resume/grades. Do you think it would be a good idea for a fresh start to just move to the country where I want to work in and just go for it? No turning back? I have saved a little bit of money but I am scared that it will backfire on me so hard...
In the words of Leah Organa: ""Help me reddit. You are my last hope""

I really love animals. They have gotten me through so much and I honestly owe them my life. I am especially interested in the conservation/rehabilitation of monkeys in south east Asia (especially gibbons).

Before lockdown first happened I had just finished my A Levels at Sixth Form so we both decided to go to America. So we're now living together and it's been amazing, he's been amazing, despite lockdown and everything else I've really enjoyed the move and things have been going great between us. I think living together really suits us.

But then yesterday I went into the attic to find a spare chair to stand on whilst painting, and decided to nab the one at his desk (which he uses for writing and drawing etc) so as I was taking the chair I noticed his sketchbook was open. I took a peak (which seems shitty of me but in my defense he usually lets me look through it) and quickly realised it isn't the sketchbook I'm used to seeing (which usually has drawings of buildings and animals). The drawings in it are just gross. Like grotesque body horror stuff or however you say it. Like these really detailed scenes of people being tortured etc. Which I wasn't majorly disturbed by at first but then I saw this one drawing of like, me and him stitched together like siamese twins? like cut in half and put together. That's the best I can describe it. And it was drawn in a really creepy way if that makes sense, like the overall style looked purposefully creepy- not sort of surreal and artsy but more like botched and gory. I put the drawings back and haven't said anything. I do feel bad for snooping but I'm more concerned about how I feel about the drawings. Am I overreacting or should I say something? the reason I haven't just mentioned it already is I find it super awkward and confusing incase I'm being over-dramatic so I'd really appreciate other peoples thoughts. Thanks for reading.",16Dec2020,1
593,"For some context we weren't together for very long. We dated through the end of the summer, then I caught him sexting our coworker and inviting her over. I broke up with him and I left the job shortly after, mainly due to the fact that I had a second job and I was focused on moving out of my mom's house and starting the new semester.

I wouldn't say our breakup was bitter or intense, even given the circumstances. I knew his social circle was small and I didn't feel like it was necessary to completely cut off contact. We even talked a bit at the beginning of the semester, but a lot more shit came out about him physically cheating, talking shit about me, etc, and I decided to unfollow his social media and move on. I found someone else (this person is an old friend of mine and my ex knows him from work) and we've now been dating three months (call me an asshole but I'm finally happy).

Recently, despite finding out about my new relationship, my ex has been routinely going back to my instagram and liking all of my old pictures. He does it ever few weeks, sometimes liking half of them and sometimes just liking the same one. It's harmless but it's annoying, and I don't really know why he does it. I was under the impression that we both were moving on, seeing as he's said nothing to me and we've been broken up for more than twice as long as we were together.

I recently went back to the old job (temporarily, just for this month), and when I've actually seen him in person he's just been rude. We don't talk at all but he complains to my boss that I'm there and he tells everyone I'm a bitch. If he had something to say to me he'd tell me in person or just text, and if he wanted to make my boyfriend jealous they still *work together* so there are plenty of better ways to do that. So I don't really get the point, maybe it's just to be annoying.

Anyone else ever dealt with something this? I think it's obvious that I shouldn't text him and make my boyfriend upset, but in the event that he might eventually text me, I don't even know if I should respond. Maybe I should just block him but I was planning on avoiding that route. I don't know I think it's kind of ridiculous to serially cheat on someone and then act like you miss them, especially when you know they're with someone else. I'm confused and annoyed so if someone could offer some perspective that would be awesome.",16Dec2020,1

I haven’t been working because I thought I would be moving back to college next semester and would get a job in my college town. However I am living at home next semester due to some changed circumstances. I quit working at Walmart last year at the beginning of COVID because my mom wanted everyone to stay home. This year while I’ve been attending college at home she has made me feel like shit for not having a job. I decided to reapply for Walmart because stocking shelves is something I know and am happy doing. Walmart had a assessment you have to take though to apply online and I unfortunately failed so I had to wait 60 days to reapply. I told my mom and we agreed I would work there when I could. About a month back though she blew up on me because I was on the couch reading. She called me lazy and said my life was to easy and that I needed to get a job. I should mention she works from home on her laptop everyday so being around each other 24/7 made things worse. So I felt worthless because I take what my mom says to heart and she had slowly been building up to that with smaller jabs. So I applied for two other jobs and got one at a convenience store. This place requires checking people out, stocking shelves, and cooking. For someone who suffers from pretty bad anxiety I don’t think I will fit with this fast paced, social job. I can reapply to Walmart, a job I know I can do and I enjoy in about 2 weeks. I am currently going through training at the convenience store and I already hate it.

598,"Hi there.

I've got a problem with my ""perfectionism"". I know that it's mainly a  good trait because it makes you work harder on things you care about.

For example, when I was making flash cards for my Chinese classes, I've put a lot of effort into them. They're not perfect because of the material I've used and, well, my handwriting is not good. But I like them. I think they're perfect nonetheless.

I like drawing a lot because I know you can let your creativity go wild and do whatever I want, but here's the problem. I don't know how to draw. This is where being perfectionist sucks for me. I've been trying to learn how to draw for quite some time but I've always gave up after a day or two. Every single time I tried to draw something, I was like: ""Come on, you can do better than this. Try harder!"" But I can not do better than this, that's why I'm trying to learn how to draw. But that voice in my head keeps telling me this every single time, and so when I draw something, I get furious about how bad the drawing is, and I crumple the paper and throw it away.

I've get these great images in my head I'd like to make come true, but I can not. I know don't have the skills for it, yet I can't aknowledge it.

Because of that I got into creating a fantasy world ""on paper"". Here and there I take a note, an idea, no matter how crazy it sounds. Later I combine two or three into a big one, and make them work in the world I've created. I chose this because it's way easier than drawing. Your only limitations are your mind and knowledge/understanding of the language you're writing it in.

I've already got a few, at least in my opinion, interesting stories I'd like to write about, but I didn't think them through yet.

I'd love to become either an artist or a writer in the future.

I suck at writing as well, at least I always did in classes back at high school. But that doesn't mean I can't get better at it with practice.

Now that I think about it. I think there is this invicible barrier that's keeping me from drawing but not from writing.

What should I focus on? Should I still keep trying to gert better at drawing, or just focus my energy into getting better at writing?",16Dec2020,1

602,"I want to start a journey to become more of an actual person. Less of a mess. More optimisting, more open. Having more of the energy or vibe I once felt i had.  


Most of the times I feel lost. I am 24 years old and yet I still have difficulties with people in more intimate situations. Maybe that's because I only had 2 relationships, including the onw I am now, and don't know how to act in one. People like me when they meet me but I am afraid I am just good at faking behaviours.  


My studies and career go really well. Yet I am prone to self destructive behavious. Trusting stranger, being risky, abusing substances.  


I feel like I just observe people and never talk or have something meaningful to say. Even in my own relationship I can't figure out easily what the other person needs. Or how to talk about us as a couple (talk about what I want, talk about intimacy maybe). I am just being seeing as a faker who does not deserve to get a deeper connection (cause I cannot understand yet what it means to be a grown woman.  


Sometimes it feels like I am stuck at 16yo emotionally. Or just a kid observing and listening to people. Always afraid and always in emotional pain. Always thinking about the bad path of things. I had a good childhood and I was not abused. Though i believe I suffered from depression at some point.  


I don't work hard for anything I think. I just got lucky. I pushed away half my friends. I always cry and don't do anything. I feel like i lack passion for everything. I can't even answer a ""tell me anout you "" question.  


I've been doing hypnotherapy for 4 months now, yet it does not feel like it is working cause maybe once again I am doing enough.

Nothing really came of my effort, so I've been accepted back at the old job with open arms. They're happy to have me back, but I had to disclose with them that I was receiving a fair amount of unwanted male attention &amp; it factored into me leaving last time. They understood &amp; said that although they can't prevent anyone from asking me out, they can definitely get involved if they refuse to take no for an answer &amp; keep doing it. I was slandered &amp; treated like a prostitute simply for being responsible &amp; sleeping with no one, so yeah, insanely toxic environment.

The environment is very cutthroat &amp; unfortunately they have spots to fill &amp; a high turnover rate, so my coworkers aren't necessarily the most emotionally healthy or great at communicating. They have a pulse, so that's enough. The workload is large &amp; I know I'm going to be severely unhappy there with constant late breaks, bad back &amp; leg pain from the constant walking &amp; everyone'sattitude, but I don't have any better options unfortunately. 

I've been working on myself for quite a while &amp; my confidence &amp; mindset was slowly getting better, but now that the start date is slowly approaching I dread it so much. My attitude is the only thing I can change about the situation, yet that's hard with a mental illness that I can't open up about without being told I must enjoy having it, otherwise I would change. I can put up with it for a few years, but those will be some really tough corporate, hospital kitchen years. I'm already at a loss. I have depression &amp; this job makes it harder, so I've decided to get medicated as soon as my insurance kicks in. 

I asked out one of my supervisors via letter after I left, too. He knew I was interested beforehand, but did nothing about it other than get my number &amp; couldn't even respect me with the word ""no"" after I asked. He ghosted me completely &amp; I just feel like I've been slapped in the face. He will be one of my direct supervisors. And it sucks because he's a great boss, but I will probably always find him attractive somewhat. It sucks to know he never saw me as attractive enough, but I will never bring up his rejection as long as he doesn't. I doubt he would say anything. 

I don't even know what advice to ask for anymore. Therapy? Exercise? I've done it all. I feel like an overly emotional idiot.

She has so much compassion and kindness for everyone else even at the sacrifice of her own mental well-being. For the past two years she has been falling into financial troubles and has been deal a shit hand in life, with many personal troubles. Recently she has talked about how she feels she is a complete failure in life. That she doesn’t deserve my love. For everyone nice thing she’ll do or say about someone else, she’ll do something negative against herself. She is so self critical. And it’s painful to see how much she hurts. I’ve always been there for emotional support, but recently she’s been throwing my words back. Saying I’m wrong, that she’s a terrible person, that she’s selfish and that the world would be better if she didn’t exist. Whilst she has said she thinks about suicide she had promised she wouldn’t dare do It. But she says only cause she’s too weak to do it. 

It breaks my heart seeing her this way. Yesterday her car broke and she was informed by mechanics it would cost thousands to fix. And this has pushed her so deep into her out of despair she refuses to accept anything good about her life. She’s so self critical and it’s damaging. She’s a NHS worker (the health system in England) helping the covid pandemic and she doesn’t even believe she’s made a difference despite handling numerous incidents relating to COVID. She is so brilliant but just keeps getting more defeated by the world. I am so worried about her yet it doesn’t seem I can help anymore. 

Financially I can’t help, i don’t make enough. And I know she’s at least, 5 grand in debt though that does include the cost of repairs. I spent 50 pound today on scratch cards hoping I could win big and give her the money but that was a pipe dream and has just left me with a dent in my wallet. And it doesn’t seem I can emotionally help her anymore. She hears what I tell her, but just tells me I’m wrong. That she doesn’t deserve affection or my care. And that if she was gone I would realise the world is better off without her. If she wasn’t in this world it would destroy and the world would have lost something so bright. 

How do I help her? I’m trying everything I can think off! I would really appreciate any advice or solutions on how to get her better. I don’t think my support is doing anything for her anymore and she seems to be getting worse. I wish I could just clear her debt, and then she would at least just be focusing on herself but there’s no way to make that kind of money. So please how do I help her be ok.

609,"TLDR: should I stay at home until next August with my family who’s always putting me down and making me feel bad, or just move out immediately and practice being on my own until I’m overseas at the end of August? 


A little background: I’m a 24 yo male still living at home with the family. I work practically full time (47 hours, 20 hours as an emt and 27 at my dad’s business), have a med school acceptance but to a Caribbean and just finished my last prerequisite for a majority of other schools (med and PA) and can apply to them. 

At home, my family constantly plays down my work schedule and what I do as an emt, saying it’s not that big of deal, even though I saw a patient die on my third shift out of training earlier this year. If something isn’t clean, it’s somehow my fault (ex: older brother’s turn to clean the bathroom, he doesn’t clean it, I get yelled at on the basis of “you’re here at the house more than him” even though I clean it when it’s my week to clean it). When I have a long day at work, the minute I come home my mom expects me to start cleaning even though I’m exhausted from transporting patients all day and working with my dad and just want some time to rest. 

I’m constantly called cheap even though I get gifts for my family (mom, dad, older brother, and younger brother) on every birthday and Xmas ever since I started my first job back in 2014, while they stopped giving gifts for Xmas a few years back. They make fun of my friends, and when I’m feeling down, they ask me what’s wrong and when I tell them, they say “that’s not a reason to be sad” and get annoyed that I was sad in the first place. 

I feel like an outcast at home, always getting put on the spot for something and yelled at for what feels like every little thing (my mom yelled at me for listening to music with earphones on and using the dust pan. And just last night, I tried talking to her about a show that we used to watch together and she tried getting on my case with “if you have time to watch the show, then you should be cleaning” and I listed a bunch of errands I did yesterday and ended with “I just wanted to talk about the show with you” and she looked like she was about to cry and said “don’t even start!”) and I still have to follow an 11pm curfew for god’s sake (before this whole quarantine mess). My family constantly mocks me saying “what’s it going to be like living on your own?” acting as if I can’t handle it, and informed me that they were going to start charging me rent starting next year. And the other week, my dad was giving me a hard time and berating me and I said “maybe I should just go home” and he shouted “well then go!!” so I went home

I’ve been looking for apartments and I found one that’s absolutely perfect in terms of size, pricing, and location. However, here’s the issue: my med school acceptance. I have enough funds to last me til the end of August (just on my savings alone with no work, with work I can easily make rent in a week with my emt job, and I’m also looking for research jobs) which I would then go to school (or go to japan to teach English which is a complete secret from my family, but that’s a whole different story). My dad is completely against it, saying to stay at home and he’ll forgo the rent, won’t have me work at the business (he’s been trying to guilt me lately to coming back) and is considering eliminating the curfew. However, I know my family, and down the line I’m certain that they’ll go back on what my dad said and try to get me to pay rent to live at home and try to get me back in the business. So the question is: should I leave home and practice being independent for when I’m truly on my own in a different part of the world, or should I bare with it at home until August with the risk of my relationship with my family getting worse?",16Dec2020,1

She also comments that if she sends it she would ""send it through Snapchat"" and  ""cross her name, birthday and today's date out"".

 during the summer I found a job and rekindled my social life, went on many dates, talked to many people, when summer ended my country went into a lockdown and so my social life was left in shatters again due to me not being able to spend time with the people I met/ people I already knew.



I still have the same attitude where I believe that if someone doesn't treat me right,isn't straight with me, or jerks me around, I'll talk to them about it and if it keeps happening, I get pissed and cut them off, regretting nothing..



Untill now..where I'm left with 3-4 friends that I've known for 7-8 years, who I can forgive a few more times, however I've noticed some attitudes since before summer where they would blow me off just to stay home (not to go out with eachother, just because they're bored to go out, even if it's the only day they have free due to studying) and even though we have set a workout schedule together recently I find it harder and harder to round them up so we can do it together, I usually do it with 1-2 friends, and they change every time, this bothers me, because I hate to be stuck inside my house and I hate not following my workout schedule since it's something I've started loving 6 months now and made it a part of my lifestyle.

It’s had such a mental toll on me where I feel like I can’t even have a relationship of my own because she would feel so shit about it. I’ve tried to get therapy for her but it’s near impossible due to COVID and when we did get her temporary help she didn’t want to get better.

I’ve told her school but there isn’t much they can do about it, her family is awful and not supportive of her at all but she can’t leave them. She doesn’t really have friends and doesn’t want to make any because her trust issues have gotten so bad.

She says the only reason why she’s still alive today is because of me, but sometimes wishes I wasn’t her friend so that she could kill herself.

I want to be there for her but it’s really weighed me down mentally, always having to be there for her when she’s crying, staying up late, having to prioritise her so she does get sad.

She knows she’s obsessed with me and that she is low-key toxic yet feels she can’t do anything about it and gets extremely jealous whenever I do anything outside of her. Every little thing I say she always sees negative and then gets upset over and I always feel like I’m walking under eggshells.

I just feel like I can’t do anything with my life and that I can’t get anyone to help her because she doesn’t let anyone in. I’ve tried so much to help her and give her as much advice as possible but she juss doesn’t want to get any better.

The worst thing about it is, that I KNOW that I’m the only person she truly cares about and that if I do leave she WILL kill herself (or at least attempt to) and I really don’t want her to do that.

Please help me.",16Dec2020,1

I know with time it should wear off but I was wondering if anybody had some creative ideas that will help shake it off faster or more efficiently...

626,"Trowaway because I feel immensely guilty and people I know can find this.   
Also, English isn't my first language, so mistakes will be made. 

Background:

I (27F) have a friend (27M) who refuses to go to therapy, but always comes to me to ask for advice.  
He even offers me money for it, which I refuse  
I work with people, but in no way is he a client or do I want him to be. He knows this.  
I have many times said that I can't give him advice and don't always have the space to listen to him.  
But he messages me almost every day.   
Always talking how people hurt him by doing this or that and it was getting to much for me.

  
So I suggested taking an online test to see which therapy is right for him, because he can't handle life anymore. Not suïcidale, but he is immensely  tired. 

Yesterday, he messaged me that he couldn't make the test, because he couldn't choose between a couple of options on different questions.  


How I broke his trust:

This morning I made a very stupid decision.  
I went through the questions for him.   
Thinking that I could talk to him about it or even put my name on the test and sent the results to myself.  
But then I did something I feel so quilty for. Instead of entering my email, I entered his.   
I don't know where I was with my head. Such a stupid choice. The background doesn't matter.   
The thought that went with it was: maybe this is easier for him. And he can take it another time if he wants.

I called him directly after and explained what I had done, because I knew it was wrong. And he got rightfully furious. He says I betrayed him, violated his privacy. All true.   
As someone who works with people I should know so much better.

And now I feel so quilty and don't know what to do.  


I did inform my boss, because I want this in my record as a complaint (I work in a very sensitive field).   
Even though he isn't my client. I did ask him if he wanted to add something to my record or if he wanted it to be  anonymous.   
I apologised and don't know what I can do now.",16Dec2020,1
627,"So I have seven classes this year, because I needed a semester of credit from this class in order to graduate. I am a senior (M17) and I need to have high grades in order to get into the colleges I am applying.   


So right now is finals week, so it is the most stressful time of the year. Additionally, I have to do all of this virtually, so it is really hard to contact my teachers and my counselor.   


I have a teacher that is so lazy and it is driving me crazy. This class is at 7 am in the morning, so it is really tiring. There are two days of final for this class, one on Friday and the next on a Monday. That Friday was normal and we did do something finals-related. On Friday, he did not say anything about another final, nor that there was going to be a class on Wednesday. But on Monday, I was 15 minutes late because of an internet issue, but when I got into class, it was definitely not finals-related and the activities was normal for a regular class. At the end of the class, they did not say about a class on Wednesday and just said to enjoy your break.   


Then, I wake up this morning and there was an announcement that there was supposed to be a class for today. I was extremely puzzled because the school's official final exam did not state that there was this class. I looked at the class's website and then I see an announcement made by a student, not by the teacher themselves. Throughout this whole period, I did not get notified on my phone or any other devices about this announcement. Nada. At this point there was only two minutes left of ""class"" and then I see the final assessment with two minutes left. I frantically tried to finish the exam and when I looked at my grade for the class, I now have a D.   


I have emailed my teacher AND my counselor, but I think they will not even respond to me and the anxiety is growing. My counselor only responds to me once a week and I think that is odd.  I know that there is some of myself to blame for being late and all of that stuff, but this teacher is really bothering me. He does not remind you about anything and expects you to remember all of the stuff that happens on a certain day. I'm just 17 and how am I supposed to deal with this class and six more periods I have to worry about. I am panicking as time moves further and I really do not want to fail this class. I have done all the assignments for the class and the final is just staining all of it

I brought up how we felt about the relationship and I told him that it feels stagnant to me. He said that he doesn’t want me to base my post college decisions with him in mind. He says that I’m still young and would want me to explore the world and be able to meet so many different people. He says he knows what it’s like to be 22 and sometimes people based life decisions on relationships and he doesn’t want me to do that. 

I understood him and said that I’m also on the same page so maybe it’s best we shouldn’t continue even though I have a semester left. But I’d still like to be friends.

I still have the pages in my journal from that night, but I don’t think I could ever bring myself to read them. At that time, my bed was placed directly next to my window, so I could sit on my mattress and look at the streetlamps outside. Usually, it was calming. I enjoyed the gentle reminders of the sun and the moon without having to venture into the cold wind. That night, it was suffocating. Our streetlamp had burnt out, and a dark expanse greeted me instead of a warm residential road. The bare tree in my front yard stretched its branches towards me, as though it was prompting me to join it in the cold, naked and vulnerable to the midnight frost. 

Tears welled in my eyes and my chest ached. My hands trembled and pulled at my sheets with desperation. I thought of school, how days would pass without me saying a word to anyone. I had moved back to America that summer, after spending a long six years in the smog-filled valley of Beijing. 5 months had passed without a friend, although I had never been good at finding the confidence to talk to others. 

The only reason I remember this night is because it was the night I fully, whole-heartedly wanted to kill myself. Not a passing thought or a jokingly light-hearted way. I thought if I didn’t wake up tomorrow, it wouldn’t have been soon enough. Yet like most other things in my life, I couldn’t do it. 

December 22, 2018

I was old enough to start working at a local movie theater for some extra money and felt comfortable enough to chat with a few people at work. We joked about crazy customers and weird managers. I had friends in school and I was doing well in my classes. It wasn’t a natural transition, however. For the past year, I had been attending therapy once a week, and meeting with a psychiatrist every month. It took 6 months of trying a medicine that didn’t work, then another 6 months to reach the full dosage of a medicine that did work. 

I met a boy. A friend of a friend. We weren’t dating, because we both admitted we had crap to work through. Sometimes it felt like it though, when he would wrap his arms around me or kiss me on the forehead. He was the first person to make me feel beautiful. He loved my body and my face, which I never imagined possible. 

Whenever I sat on my mattress and looked out my window, and the branches would start reaching out to me, I could pick up the phone or squeeze my fluffy dog, who always slept in the bed with me.

December 22, 2019

I was very happy. I got to work in a leadership position at the movie theatre for some more money and extra responsibilities. I had friends at work and friends at school. Everywhere I was, I had support. My boyfriend and I had been together for almost a year, and we had an amazing relationship. We spent almost every day together, we never argued, and we loved each other very much. My dog still slept with me, and we cut back the branches outside my window.

651," When I was little, I was interested in everything - math, languages, science, Art, etc. Everyone praised me for being talented, focused on my goals, etc. I was always a good student since my mom was very strict and would terrorize me (mentally) if I had a mark lower than an A.  In my younger years I was mostly studying and didn't socialize much which made me a weird introverted kid. I always loved drawing, at some point I won certain awards and went to art lesson. I found it very calming and generally interesting.
 Anyway, I enrolled into the best high school in my town, a mathematical school, focused on maths and science. The original plan was for me to study coding and computer science.
 I am now 16 and 2 years away from graduating. I am not that good of a student anymore. I have lost interest in any sort of science or studying at all. The only subject I enjoy from time to time is math. I find everything else boring and I have no motivation to study. I have absolutely no interest in programming and I don't want a degree.
 During the last year I got back into drawing. I started thinking about my childhood dream of pursuing a job in the Animation field or Digital Art. The problem is that my parents have already spent so much money on lesson on other subjects. Also I have spent so much time trying to be good in everything else and didn't have any time to serially practice. I feel like I wasted my childhood doing stuff that I hate just to be in an elite high school. I guess my parents too played a role in my decisions as they don't really want me to be an artist. But at this point this is the only thing I enjoy doing and the only thing I can see myself doing in the future. I am not super good at it, but with some practice I think I can get much better. But now I worry that I wouldn't be able to make a good enough portfolio in just 2 years and that I wouldn't be able to compete against people who have practiced their whole life. I also wonder if I will be able to find a job and be financially stable if I decide to study Animation. Any advices?",16Dec2020,1

655,"So, I observe a pattern in my relation-and friendships. Inevitably, me and these people either get into a conflict or go our seperate ways because I am unhappy with the situation. What I noticed is that in many friendships at some point (sometimes after years of being really good friends) I feel like I am the one always initiating, writing, calling, organising meet ups. Often, my friends fail to be consistent, to answer or to show that they care. And to give you some context so you don't think I'm a crazy person with super high expectations : I'm talking for example not writing back, leaving me days on read when we would normally talk every other day (and not having an excuse such as work or being busy, I can totally understand that your not on your phone 24/7). When I ask if everything is okay because they disappeared suddenly, they don't have anything to say about it. 
 I'm taking us planning a meet for quite some time and a day before they found a ""better option"". And that hurts. I feel like I am the one giving and giving and this has happened so many times I'm fed up and  no longer patient. I usually give people the benefit of the doubt but if it happens too often, I will talk to them about how it makes me feel and what I would wish for instead (in a non aggressive way, because reproaches never help, that's self explanatory). Often, people either agree and promise to change (not changing at all) or they shut down completely.
Now, it's kinda tough losing friends but on the other hand if a friendship just makes you feel sad, disappointed, not enough for other people, not cared for... Is it really good to stay in that relationship? I don't think it's too high of an expectation to wish for a friend that shows they care. I'm not a person who cannot give other space and time apart but keeping promises and so on is kinda important to me.

I just feel really lonely during this pandemic and gradually losing my friends is not making it better. Still, I'm not so desperate to not listen to myself when I feel very unhappy and continuing a relationship at all costs. Do you have any advice for me? I'm wondering why there is a common thread on many of my friendships... Do I ""attract"" these kinds of people or is it more about my inner attitude?

Not ghosting me is not too much to ask imo 🤷‍♀️ How can I find the ""right"" people?",16Dec2020,1

657,"Background: I am Chinese and I work in the UK. I live alone. It's been a very tough year so I wanted to go back home during Christmas period to spend some time with my family. I started planning since October. My original idea was I will leave before Christmas and then come back early March next year so I can spend Chinese New year with my family which is in February. I plan to WFH and take 2 or 3 weeks holiday.

I discussed with my managers and they were all supportive. However when I officially requested I was told that due to tax and IT security reasons I cannot work from China. Moreover they told me there is a new company policy that nobody can work from outside of the UK due to tax reasons. After several conversations I accepted it and changed my holiday plan to next Jan/Feb so I can spend Chinese New year with my family. However I will have to spend Christmas and New Year by myself. I won't WFH instead I will use most of my next year's holiday.

Everything is fine until last week I noticed people started to travel back home and WFH as usual. Some went back to South America and some went back to Asia.

I was so angry and feel strongly being treated unfairly and with double standards. I had a few conversations with my manager to discuss it but I don't think he can fully understand my position. I believe he did everything he can to help me. I made it very clear that I was treated unfairly and I need proper communication about why this is the case.

So about 2 weeks ago I was on vacation in Stockholm and I had an evening to my self before a friend of mine joined me in town. I decided to go on bumble and look for a date. I matched with this really cute guy and we met up later that evening. Everything was great, we had a nice dinner and I spent the night at his place. He was super sweet to me in the morning (something I am really not used to from guys) and we have stayed in touch ever since. Unfortuntly, I only had a few days left in Sweden and I didn't mange to see him again. I am back in Germany wondering what to do. I have been texting with him everyday since I met him so we are definatly still in touch but we are in 2 different countries now so we didn't make any plans to meet up again. I wanna tell him how much I really liked him. I know it sounds crazy since I only met him once but on the other side I have absolutly nothing to lose. If he says no, I wont see him again so I might as well try. But how do I say it without sounding crazy or needy? Unfortunalty I also have to do it via text. If he says yes, luckily I work remotely and could go back to Stockholm at any time so if he wants to see me again, I could make it happen!! Help. I dont know what to say to him!!",16Dec2020,1

College kid here. Life was a little rocky a until a few months back. (Wasn't having too good a time from mid-2018 to mid-2020). Luckily things look better now and I'm really thankful for that, however I still think I'm in a sensitive mental place and am not fully okay.
Here's the issue I want my fellow redditors to help me with:

I sleep for 8-9hrs each day in a go and don't wake up easily; sound sleeper basically. However I have pretty bad dreams every 2 days (deaths, violence, being ""attacked"" or chased or being trapped etc). There are normal things about the dream too but the sick parts of it like the aforementioned kinda haunt me even after waking up. Thing is, everytime I watch dark shows like Mindhunter or True Detective S1 or even sharp objects (which are shows I really like when awake), I have bad dreams about them for WEEKS if not months. 

Any advice on how I deal with the situation? (Also on how to not have horrible dreams)

I honestly wanna build myself up instead of quitting watching dark shows you know :(.

664,"  

My co-worker (M21) makes me (F21) extremely uncomfortable but I'm not sure how I should distance myself from him. Also I'm not sure if I´m also in the wrong because I put up with so much since I'm scared of conflict and hurting him.

So we and some others started as trainees at the company a year ago and I kinda got along with him because he was very open. Sometimes he made me uncomfortable through inappropriate/mean comments, weird touching (like suddenly stroking my arm) and staring. I didn't say anything in the beginning, except for the staring, because I didn’t think it was a big deal.

Some time ago he switched from some mean and teasing comments to excessive compliments and more staring. Told him a few times that I don’t like that. He apologized every time but it didn't change.

The worst happened a few days ago when he visited me to drop off a Christmas present… had the most uncomfortable 6 hours of my life. When we had something to do like playing a game, he stopped it pretty fast to just talk and while we were playing he kept staring at me instead of the screen. Even when I looked at him he just kept staring. I think 60-80% of the whole time he just stared at me. And when we were talking, he brought up so many topics that I'm not comfortable to talk about with him. He also probably complimented me 20+ times, telling me that I'm one of the most important people in his life (also the only girl besides family). Well that was awkward because to me he's a good co-worker at most and I don't want that place in his life.

I feel very pressured because he values me so much and feel bad because I let it come this far. Makes me think that I should have been more open about it.

How would you distance yourself from someone? I think straight up saying let’s just be coworkers will hurt him a lot. Maybe it’s better to let him give me some space for now. That might just be stalling though..",16Dec2020,1

In highschool I never had any experience how to approach someone first because everyone I dated so far revealed their feelings to me first when I only had to agree. One of those girls ghosted me which was my favourite and liked her alot. This had some affect on me and took some time for me to move on. When I liked someone after that in 12th grade in first time in my life I approached them first but because of my stupidity and inexperience it didn't work out and my pitiful amount of confidence took a hard hit and I also was reminded how my ex ghosted me.

So after I visited them once and went home week later she called me and asked me hang out with her friends and go to city mall together which I agreed.

673,"I have severe ADHD and no matter how hard I try I can never do hard work, especially when it involves thinking. 

It’s easy to assume I must be lazy but that’s really not the whole story. It’s so hard to describe my problem but it’s the way my brain processes information and it makes it so hard to complete tasks. 

When I try complete a task I can’t help but obsessed over the different ways to do it and I get overwhelmed thinking about how to do it instead of actually doing it and then my brain is too exhausted to start. 

Another big problem is I don’t know what to commit to because I have so many hobbies I want to master equally. I want to write tv shows, produce music, learn calligraphy, and practise cinematography. I don’t know what to focus on so end up committing to nothing and never practising enough to get good at anything. Everyone says I have potential with all those things but no one ever says I’ve made anything that’s actually good. 

I honestly just want to practise all those things so I can get good at all of them but I can’t even practise at all. I can practise calligraphy because it’s just drawing letters and doesn’t require any thinking. But my real passions of writing music and screen writing are so difficult for me to practise. I do them occasionally but I want to do it every day and I just can’t seem to do it. 

It’s easy to think I’m just scum and I don’t really want to practise because if I did I would. But I do and I’ve tried very hard, my adhd gets in the way and I can’t take medication for it because I have high blood pressure. For example I have working memory problems which means as soon as I have a new thought I completely forget the old thought which makes it hard to stay focused and work in a flow.

677,"I love my mom more than anything in the entire world. She had me at 18 and my dad and her split up when I was 5. He started getting into drugs and she quickly, smartly, slowly removed him from my life and raised me as a mostly single parent with the help of my grandmom (who I also loved with all of my heart until she passed away in 2016).

I'm 30 now and my mom and I are still very emotionally close, even though we don't talk every single day. We both know how much we care for one another.

3 years ago she started dating a man much younger than her (she's 49 and he's 34, she's a proud cougar). One of her exes died last January and they had been together for 10 years before she met her current boyfriend. She was really devastated by this loss, since they were still friends, but her having her new guy really eased the pain. Part of what made dating a younger guy so appealing for her was that he could take care of her as she got older and, after as much loss as she's experienced in her life (don't get me started on all that), she felt like she'd never have to worry about losing him. 

I moved out in August, partly because she had her new man and I felt comfortable leaving her. She had a companion who waited on her hand and foot and they did **everything** together. They were together 24/7.

It's so crazy to hear, and I'm sure people will think this story is fake because it's *so* melodramatic, but unfortunately it's true. My mom's birthday was on November 27th, which is also my wedding anniversary. She went to work, despite her boyfriend asking her to call out so they could spend the day together. She said she had a really great birthday. Her sister dropped off a cake for her at work, her chef made her her favorite dinner, etc. At around 5:30PM her boyfriend texted her that he didn't feel good so she said he should take a nap.

When she got home at 10:30PM, on her birthday, she found her companion on the ground on his knees, face down. She knelt to touch him and he was cold. She turned him over and he was blue. She tried giving him CPR but he'd been gone by that point.

Thankfully I was already scheduled to take a 2 week vacation from work, which I've mostly spent by her side any time I could. I live 45 minutes away now, so I can't see her every day but I've been obsessively texting her and visiting her almost every day. Truthfully I think I'm probably bugging her with how much I'm texting her, but I can't help it. All I think about all day every day is my mom and how sad and shocked she is. Even now she's still in a state of shock, regret and confusion.

She keeps wishing she'd stayed home from work. Her boyfriend also said a few times over the last year that he ""didn't feel right"", but she took him to the ER the first 3 times he said that and all their tests came back fine so she thought he might just be being dramatic, so she has a ton of guilt over that too.

She says she can't fill the void of his absence, since he was attached at her hip. If she took a 5 minute trip to the convenience store he'd insist to come with her. Texted her all day. When they'd get take out they'd just split one entree. Her was truly a companion for her.

I know she's hurting and I just don't know what I can do to make it better. It's driving me crazy myself, because I seriously just think of her all day and I'm even tearing up now as I write this just thinking of my mom being sad and lonely. I want her to be happy because she deserves it after how hard her life has been and how much she's done for me over the years. 

I just don't know what I can do. How can I make her happy after such a tragic, unforeseen tragedy? 

How could this happen to someone? **Who** does this happen to? Who finds their significant other (who's 16 years younger than them) dead ON THEIR BIRTHDAY? I know life isn't fair but this goes beyond unfairness and straight into cruelty. I'm **mad** *for* her and just desperate for my mom to feel okay and supported and loved and not alone.",16Dec2020,1

It’s become an issue that every time my son takes anything outside, the youngest tattles that he’s not sharing. When I asked my son he says the youngest is too rough, breaks his own things and is always saying mean things. My son says every time he has something the other kid wants it, whines and throws a fit. He told me he doesn’t mind sharing toys with the other kids as long as he himself isn’t using it.

But I’ve gotten undertones from the neighbors that they think my son is the one being a “brat” because “he won’t share”. Let me also add, their children never bring out toys or share stuff, they also are bad-mannered and often left unsupervised. 
To me, telling my kid to share his stuff without question is like giving into this other child’s tantrum. How is it fair that my son is being asked to supply entertainment for the neighborhood kids and at the same time is being made to feel guilty if he wants to protect and use his own toys.

I'm asking reddit because I'm just really torn up about the whole ordeal.

A little back story, this guy (23M) and I (24F) have been talking for a month or so now. We hung out recently and had a good time (at least I thought so). After hanging out that night, when we parted ways, we continued to talked more over text about how much we enjoyed our time together and how we would be seeing more of each other. However, the next day, it felt like he was giving me the cold shoulder. He usually responds within 10 minutes of our last message, but this day, it took like hours, which I understand that we are adults and we have our own lives, no biggie. Long replies turned into being left on read. Obviously, I was really hurt by this. I ""confronted"" him, and just simply asked if I had done something the night before that upset him or if he was just not interested in me anymore. He tells me that he is going through things and he doesn't want to bring me down with him, and that he simply is not interested in anyone right now. He has a history of depression for which he is taking meds. I tell him something along the lines of ""hey, I understand and I respect that. I'm here for you if you ever need to talk"", and that's the end of it. This was a less than a week ago.

So, I'm posting because I'm a little upset, but I feel like I don't have a right to be. He's going through things, so I can't make this about myself, however, it just hurts a little you know? How do you go from talking to someone everyday to completely just go cold turkey.

Reddit, please, give me some advice.

1. Do I have a right to be upset? **I'm not upset with him, but more upset with the situation.** I really liked him, and just being ""cut"" off so abruptly kinda hurts.
2. Do y'all think it was me? Is it depression? He said that it wasn't me and that I didn't do anything wrong the night prior, but it feels like odd timing? Am I just reading too much into it?
3. How do I move forward if it is a depressive episode? I told him that I was there if he ever needed to talk, which I feel like we're all guilty of saying this or being told this without any further action. How do I let him know that my words are genuine? Should I check up on him in a week or so? If not a week, how long? What should I say?",16Dec2020,1

Hi nice to meet you all. I've got less than a year \[predicted\] to live,  but I do not wish to go into the details of my condition. I'm in my  mid-twenties, my wife is pregnant. My father ran away when I was in my  infancy and left me in the hands of my abusive, alcoholic mother.

Now,  my father is a multi-millionaire businessman \[who seemingly I can't  find anything about, other than his records at Companies House where  last year they raked in over £700,000 with very little work\]. His  parents are, too.

I'm desperate  and I do not know what to do. I think my best option is to contact him,  explain the situation, and hope he will look after my wife. I've got  less than a few hundred in my current account - her family will not look  after her because they are strict Muslims and did not agree for her to  marry me \[an atheist English boy\].

Would  anyone help me find my father? I have his last registered address which  he moved out of nine years ago, the name of his accountants, but he and  his wife \[and my several brothers\] have no digital footprint. I expect  he did that to safeguard against the day I inevitably arrived.

I  can't sleep at night and find myself tearing up all day thinking about  what my wife's going to do in my absence and how she will support  herself alone. It's destroying my life. My last option is to find him  and hope he will, despite his shortcomings, look after his grandson.

I  can verify my identity and my connection to him through a birth  certificate for anyone that would want to help but is concerned that I  may not be who I say or maybe concerned I am not trying to find who I  say I am.

The good news is that they're trying to avoid putting more people in jail right now (for obvious reasons), so in a sense I was lucky...

...But sadly my crime wasn't ""minor"" enough that community service or straight probation was enough.

I accepted a plea deal to avoid jail time (normally not possible for this crime), but part of my probation conditions will be smelling this really-horrible-smelling-stuff for 5 minutes straight, on 4 separate occasions.

No idea what it is, other than that it's not considered harmful. My lawyer told me that ""malodorants"" have started to be used in jails here as a more humane alternative to solitary confinement, to deter prison fights / rule violations...so I guess with 2020 being how it is, it's now being used for criminal offenses too.

693,"My husband, our almost 3 year old son and I are currently renting a house we have been in for a little over a year. We had talked to our neighbors here and there. They're husband and wife and they have a one year old girl. Lately we've been talking to them a little more and the husband offered to gift our son a ride-on car they had in their shed since our son's birthday is coming up, along with Christmas obviously. Well I guess the car didn't work so they decided to buy him a new one, we looked it up and it's $120. 
To me this is insanely sweet but I kind of feel guilty in a way.. my husband and I are trying to think of an idea of what to do or give them in return. Does anyone have any ideas?",16Dec2020,1

696,I'm stressed out with school because of all the work and requirements they want us to have. But I also have to work along with my work which I have three days off. I'm stressed and I don't know what else to do.,16Dec2020,1
697,"So I have been working at a laboratory for the past 3 months but have only been able to get 2 days a week of work, which is okay because I love it there and they love having me there. I lost my other job before that due to personnel cuts. the government wanted me to make more hours so they found me a second job at a small retail chocolate store.

Last Monday we had a press conference in the Netherlands about a new lockdown (it's bad here) and that same evening they (the company) was busy checking out my contract and travel expenses to make it all in order because most of their stores would be closed. The next day I was supposed to sign the contract but about 10 minutes before that I got a call from the store manager telling me that I had broken their trust, they had heard things about me and that they don't want someone like me in their company. I tried to explain my side (plus asked where all this came from) but they said it didn't matter to them.

To explain: I asked my colleague if we could use money money of the register/store for coffee/tea since we worked the closing shift (it was very cold also) and out of experience in retail we sometimes could. Eventually we paid with our own money.

He made up the story that I wanted to take money out of the register to get myself coffee. I only asked if we could, not that I wanted to.

I also gave one of my friends a discount without asking them because they (supervisors) were never there and I wanted to be nice. In hindsight not the best thing to do but I didn't mean any harm. They said I ripped the receipts and thrown them away, which I did but that's because my friend didn't want the receipt and we do that all the time with regular customers too because sometimes they don't want the receipt for their chocolate.

Yesterday I closed everything with the store manager, sent the key back and that's it.

This evening I got a new email with other people in the cc saying all the bad things (2 things above) I did and that they'd terminated the contract immediately (still hadn't sign it but fine) and I feel so bad because I feel like they are blowing it up and making me seem like a bad person just so they don't have any obligation to pay me because of the job loss due to the lockdown. They said it didn't have anything to do with it but who are they kidding? I also feel like my ex-colleagues banded together to get rid of me so they could work more hours with me gone. I was not at all interested to keep working there after all this so by telling my side I only wanted to make sure things weren't taken out of context or made way worse/untrue.

I know I could be out of line for giving my friend a discount but this all seems too much. Like they really want me to feel bad and put me on the spot.

698,"Sorry for the novel, but I am just so frustrated by this and need help.

Like many others, I’ve been extremely financially strained this whole year. I’m currently out of a job, way behind on every one of my bills, unemployment is lagging, and I’m currently having the most difficult job search of my life.

Most of the companies I’m financially obligated to are still asking for payments every month even though I’ve given notice that I’m financially impacted by COVID and unable to pay. I have car insurance through USAA and they, like all the others, are offering reassurance on every bill and phone call about how they’re “here to help during this trying time”. And they’re all full of shit. 

USAA put me on a payment plan last August for the balance I owed which was supposed to carry over into next August. But today I woke up to a huge overdraft from USAA. Called them and found out it was because my policy had been automatically renewed and that had reset the payment amount... even though I was supposed to be on a reduced payment for 9 more months. They said they sent out a renewal packet stating that my premium was going to revert to the full amount and that because of that, they can’t and won’t reverse this payment. 

I explained my situation and what this charge has done to me, but they don’t care. I asked to speak to a higher up about it but got talked in circles until I hung up in frustration.

So, I have no fucking idea what to do about this. The only income I have while I find a new “real job” is plasma donation, Postmates, and Instacart. And with gas costs, that’s nowhere near helpful enough to cover this overdraft before the fees start coming in. I’ve asked for financial help from my loved ones so much this year, I really don’t think I could ask again and I’m just SO PISSED that USAA swindled me like this. I want to dispute it somehow or rip the higher ups a new asshole until they change their policy on this, but I feel like that’s unrealistic and futile. 

How would you handle this?",16Dec2020,1

700,"Quick background. When I was a kid, my mom was sick and was hospitalized, so I only had a dad who really struggled parenting, and was kind of a drunk asshole when I was growing up. We lived in a wealthy town in the shittiest neighborhood and struggled to make ends meet. 

I fucked up when I was 17 and ended up in jail for quite a while with a felony (which imo had a lot to do with him being absent), and now I'm much older and still struggling to earn money. After jail I put myself through college (paid myself with loans) and the last few years have been working to grow my career, but now I'm at the point where nobody is going to pay me the salary I deserve, without also requiring a background check. Because of this I've been in and out of work, but I've been working really hard to grow my skill set in the meantime, and honestly I deserve a good job in my field at this point but I keep failing to hold anything down once they find out my background.

My dad came into quite a bit of money in the last few years and lands a high paying job. He did not pitch in to my college loans, but he did help me out when I needed an apartment deposit, and helped me out with quite a few other things along the way. 

Now I owe him a ton of money that he wants paid back, and he's turning our now-adult and once happy relationship into guilt trips. I'm living on unemployment and haven't had a steady salary in forever (but not for not trying!) and can barely afford food, and he's sending me angry texts, guilt tripping me about owing him money that I don't have. He says he's worried about his retirement fund, and great, I get that, but jesus christ I don't even have a savings account let alone a retirement fund to think about. Look at our world, people starving and losing their houses due to covid and he's worried about his retirement fund. 

It does say a lot about him as a person that he did share his money with me when I needed it, and I know how lucky I am that he understood my situation, and also understood that he had the capacity to help. But I still don't have a job, nothing has changed.

So then I eventually end up saying to him that he fucked up my childhood so much (physical abuse) that he basically owes me that money anyway.

As adults we've become really good friends so this whole thing really hurts. Should I feel bad for owing him so much money?",16Dec2020,1

703,"I'll try to be as brief as possible..

Met this girl on Tinder in late October.  She told me right away that she just wanted to be friends for now (LTR had just ended badly), and I was good with that.  We met at the start of November and hit it off, and since that point we've been talking constantly and continuing to hang out, have dinner/drinks, etc.

Might have been some occasional flirting and what not since then and during all the times we've hung out - but nothing happened until this past weekend.  We went out for dinner and then went back to my place for a movie.  We were propped up pretty close to each other, shoulders touching kind of thing, and at one point she started making the move to kiss me, and I obliged.

At that point, the gloves were off so to speak.  She ended up staying over, and while we didn't ""go all the way"" (we wanted to but agreed it would be best to wait until we were 100% certain), we did do a lot - and it was great.

Since then we've been talking fine all week with the exception that now there is sexual tension and suggestiveness in our communications - but today during a call she reiterated the just friends thing and wants to have a talk about it (in person) - and straight up said that its got to be friends only (all while continuing suggestive things before and after that).

I can't even determine if I like realllly like her (despite the fact that we really enjoy eachothers company) because every time I think it might be going somewhere it hits a wall; so I've done my best to not think about it too much.

What am I supposed to think or do in this situation?  I realize she is vulnerable and unsure of herself right now so I have no desire to push her into something she's uncomfortable with, but it feels like she's the one whos been pushing and then I'm the one who has put a stop to it (Like we could have had sex, she asked if we should, and I said we should wait to be sure).",16Dec2020,1

706,"A little backstory, we were in a pinch to buy something quickly to avoid penalties on closing our old mortgage - so the hasty purchase/lack of diligence was our own doing.  But we found a new build that the “builder” lived in with his family for a year.  He does this regularly, building a house - living in it for a year (to avoid cap. gains I guess?) selling it and then quickly slapping together another to move into.  

When we moved in we had everyone from delivery drivers to random neighbours asking if everything in the house was okay... which was obviously hint number one.  They went on to tell us about all the other owners of homes he’d build and their similar stories.

When we bought he asked for a 3 month closing, in which time the lot beside us that he also owned went from a parking lot to a finished house with him and his family inside.

Then came problems.  The garage was graded into the house - flooding the entire main floor.  Drainage points in the laundry room were a good 2” above grade, so absolutely useless.  Just over 19k in damages and repairs.

Electrical was an absolute disaster.  Heat didn’t work downstairs if it was on upstairs, half the outlets didn’t work at all, and CONSTANT trips to the breaker.  Another fun fix.

The tongue and groove hardwood upstairs needs to be entirely replaced - it wasn’t installed correctly and has separated, bowed, or buckled in all areas it covers.

Found out after purchase our deck wasn’t even to code, but our inspector had missed it (they had posts pushed up underneath it looking like extra supports but they didn’t even touch the ground - we got the $ from our inspection back).

Had a major leak through the roof, after insurance sent someone out to look at it they found that a flat roof skylight (?) had been used instead of one for the slanted roof it was in - allowing water to run right through.  Insurance didn’t cover repairs or replacement because it had been installed incorrectly.

Kept the second garage door opener (they said was lost) and have opened our garage 5+ times, letting our dogs out and into traffic twice.

Etc etc etc.

All wrongdoing is skirted by the fact that everything is in his wife’s name and she can deny knowing any of it before the sale.  

SO, he’s selling the house he put up in all of 15 minutes right next to us and as much as I’d love him out of my sight - I can’t in good conscience let someone else go through the same thing we have.

What should I do?

716,"Hello, I’m posting here because this feels extremely selfish and the anonymity of the internet feels like a safe place to get some honest feedback. This is about a friend whom I thought was really close with.

So my birthday was 2 weeks ago. The day of, pretty sure my friend forgot it was my birthday because we had a full conversation that day before her saying anything about it being my birthday. Finally in the afternoon I think she saw on FB it was my birthday (even though I told her) and she wished me a happy birthday and said she had something for me. 

A week before then, she FaceTimed me and my husband to show us this cute mug she bought for him. 

I never ask for anything. I also despise my birthday for a multitude of reasons. So I thought it was nice but I didn’t say anything to her saying she got me a gift. Fast forward to this last Sunday, I left a gift for her to give to our other friend whose birthday it was in October. She never saw her to give it to her. Plus I had bought a few items from her business I needed to pick up. I had to go pick the gift up because I had plans to see this other friend the next day. 

So I arrive and not only is she very short with me, she hands me a box full of the products I ordered plus the gift for our other friend, and then says she needs to go and then she leaves. There’s no gift, and the mug she bought for my husband isn’t in there. 

I don’t want this to sound like wah poor me I didn’t get a birthday gift. Because I don’t feel that way. But what bothers me is why lie about it? Why FaceTime me specifically to show me a gift she got my husband and not give it to me? 

I have major trust issues and this has been kinda the icing on the cake because in my jaded experience, if you can lie so blatantly about one thing, you can lie about anything.

I had another friend years ago that did the same thing - we aren’t friends anymore - but why lie? And is this a common occurrence? I just don’t understand it. I haven’t talked to this friend since... which is weird in itself because we usually talk every day. But my gut tells me I just don’t matter to her. But that could be because of past trauma.

But I know I have good common sense and I am smart but I never think and tell myself that I’m smart. Like I talk to myself all the time when I’m not talking to someone or even sometimes in between conversations trying to figure out what I’d say and what would it look like. But whenever I do it I always tell myself that I am not smart. I believe I am smart as (I read a bunch of articles online so telling in the basis of that) I talk to myself a lot. I’m curious, I want to know everything like how the whole universe started, how was the languages discovered, what was before the universe and stuff. And I also have good common sense ( i think I’m smart on the basis of this as I read it online and I just know it). When I am thinking of a solution to a problem, I always think how I would do it otherwise. Like if let’s say I’m sneaking into a house and I have to leave without no tracks, then first I’d think of myself as the sneaker and then when I think of something to hide a track then I’d involuntarily think that “no, if I was solving it, then this thing would be obvious and I’d not fall for it.” I am fine being alone, I can stay alone and I have no problem with that. I’m very quiet and I observe a lot. I’m socially not good, I think a lot before I say things even when I’m with my relatives and I can’t start topics like with anyone which is not my friend or my family. I’m not considering smart as getting good grades as I’m completely against the concept of giving marks. I don’t try too much for exams as I know that they have nothing to do with anything i want to achieve. If schools taught us without grading us on our knowledge then it would be much more interesting and I’d definitely study daily then studying at the last minute as then I’m not learning for getting marks but I’m learning cause it’s fun and I want to learn. Giving grades just ruins it, as your reputation and your whole career depends on it in some cases. So, should I think that I’m smart cause it could result in overconfidence and superiority complex.

726,"To be clear I am a woman in a male dominated work place. Over my time in the welding trade I have become more and more of a feminist. I always believed in equal rights between man/woman, but never realized the gravity until I became a full fledged adult. I have multiple art works and jackets that’s say “the future is equal” the other night we were having a conversation and I asked if he was a feminist (I assumed he was). he said he prefer not to be because of how the movement is being used by woman (obviously meaning the “kill all men” movement ext.) He said he rather stay unaffiliated because of these things even thought he agrees that the movement is for equal rights and not just woman’s rights. He also says he won’t agree with feminist because they souly  focus on woman’s statistics and how people who call themselves feminist have destroyed movements for men’s mental health. Which has happened but I (and no other feminist) should agree with at all (of coarse) 

But on the other hand he agrees fully with the BLM movement (as I do too) and over looks the bad things that people have done in name of BLM. But won’t overlook the bad things “feminist” have done in the name of feminism. 

It really bothers me. I love him and it’s not a matter to break up over. But how do I deal with a man that doesn’t believe in feminism? Something I fight for daily, and promote constantly. I believe woman and men should be equal which is what feminism is about. I’m fighting for my rights as a woman. I just don’t get why he won’t fight along side me especially after being by my side after all the harassment I’ve gotten at work or in the streets for being a female. I know I shouldn’t be too bothered by it but it’s really on my mind constantly since we discussed it a few weeks ago. Any advice on how to overcome this?",16Dec2020,1
727,"If you want to you can skip the **context** and go straight to the **issue** below.

**The context is:**

I'm an engineering student in Europe and most of my classes or lectures are online. I spend most of my time almost everyday sitting in a chair using my desktop-PC, which has both academic and recreational purposes (gaming basically).

I realized that, before the pandemic started, I used to make physical notes on paper. But now most of them are digital. I even bought a graphic tablet and a digital pen (stylus?) to make notes in a more complex way and it's been really helpful for me to study. But... there are times in which I can't stand being sit in front of my desk all day anymore, or for long periods of time. 

Sometimes I have tasks or study sessions which consists only of reading PDF's or watching recorded lectures. During those specific situations I prefer to turn off the desktop computer and use my phone to read and watch videos from other places in my house. Like on the sofa or couch, on my bed, or even in the kitchen while having tea (with honey).

I try to make notes while I'm studying in that way but also maintaining the digital format that I want. And with a phone this is not practical. At all...

So I've been thinking a lot about getting myself a tablet for that purpose.

The thing is... I know the pandemic will eventually end at some point. And that means that online lectures will stop as well. So I'll have to go back to attending lectures in the faculty. 

I don't have a problem with that. The problem is that this time I won't have my desktop-pc to use the programs or the software I need to make my projects and essays related to engineering (like MATLAB, writing in LaTeX, Python...). So in that case, a laptop would make more sense.

**The issue is as follows:**

* I'm a student who relies on his parents income. That means I have a fixed budget. I've been saving some money (700€) and now I can afford either a tablet or a laptop
   * Idea: I thought about buying a tablet now, and wait 6 months to buy a laptop or when the online lectures are no longer a thing
* I want to be able to use a pen to make digital notes
* I want to be able to use the software that is required in a engineering career
* I hate things that weight. If I'm going to have something that requires me moving around a lot or if the tasks that I need to do at certain times during my day that are only reading or watching recorded lectures, then I'd prefer the tablet. But if I need to work on essays and with software or programming, then I don't mind having a heavy laptop for that purpose.

**My question are:** 

* Should I get a tablet now and buy a laptop when the era of the online lectures end? (probably at the end of 2021)
* Should I get both a tablet and a laptop now?
* Should I only get a laptop?
* Should I keep saving money and get myself a 2-in-1 laptop with a pen?
* Or should I abandon the idea of a tablet/laptop and stick to sitting in my chair all day and take breaks which could consist of taking a walk for 30 minutes or an hour

**The devices I'm interested in:**

* Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (350€)
* Laptop: anything that can run engineering software (500-700€), if I have a tablet then I don't mind the weight
* 2-in-1 laptop: Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 (1500€)

**Conclusion:**

Thank you for reading my post. Any type of advice is greatly appreciated! If you want to be honest about anything about my thoughts on this issue, please do! 

If you think I'm an idiot and that I should just stop whining about sitting all day and learn to take discipline, then I'll take that advice as well !

728," I am a mother of 3 and a stepmother of 2.  I love all 5 of my kids please do not mistake this!

 My husband pays his child support and any extras they need .We buy them shoes, clothes, extracurricular activities, medical and dental and even give them shopping money. it is very expensive.. 

I do not have a problem with him paying child support. It's all the extras we do that I thought child support was for that I have a problem with. obviously my husband should pay his child support and be there for his kids. but to keep giving them money is hurting our family. They live with their mom and stepdad. They go on at least 2 vacations a year. and the child support is basically free money for them since we pay for a lot of what the kids need.. they have a five bedroom house and they already have money saved aside to buy a boat. I am not jealous I am very happy for them and love that they are so well taken care of.

 my problem I guess or what I need advice on is what about my kids... we don't have money to spend on my kids.. they get the left over which is usually nothing. their clothes are getting too small and I don't have money to replace them and any time I do spend money on my kids my husband gets mad that I spent money because we don't have the money....

It hurts to know that my kids aren't as important to him as his first kids are..  We can't even buy a house right now because so much of our money goes to them. I work but most of my money has to go to bills and I really don't make a lot of money. so I save where I can but Its not ever very much.. 

after writing this I am just in tears and I really don't know what to do. My kids are very low key and are so happy and grateful for what they get and they never complain about his kids having more. I just want to be able to have clothes that fit them. and not have to get in trouble for it.",16Dec2020,1
729,"I'm a female in my late twenties and am very socially awkward which has always made it difficult for me to make friends. Close to an year ago my only friend moved away and even though we talk on the phone every now and then (our conversations are becoming more and more trivial as she's obviously moving on with her life and making new friends) I've been feeling very lonely and wish I could make new friends. My friend has always been very outgoing and makes new friends with ease, I, on the other hand, am the complete opposite. I have a hard time talking to people and engaging in conversations that last more than the casual hello you give the neighbors but I wish I had someone who I can go out to get coffee with or go shopping or to the cinema to watch a movie; just basic human interaction.

730,"So, 9 months ago, I moved out of my mom's house (parents are divorced)

She moved away as well, half the country away, and my father always lived quite far away as well after their divorced. 

Now the only people living in my area that I care about are a few friends, my boyfriend and my grandmother. 

So today is my birthday, it's right in the middle of the week, so I didnt bake myself anything, also I dont have a car so I didnt buy any cake. Also I had uni stuff to do. 

Because of Corona, my grandma couldn't come so she just dropped off my present, a dinnerware set, not really pretty or my style, but I'm a college student, I wont say no, I always need more household items.

So my boyfriend came around for an hour, gave me my presents, some manga I wished for, and then he went home cause we didnt have anything to do together. I then asked him what he had planned for Christmas, he told me he will go to his grandma with his brothers, but because of Corona I cant come.

I then realized that I also cant go to my grandma because of Corona for Christmas, and that my parents are away. 

It's my first birthday and Christmas alone, I mean my boyfriend did come around, but I didnt even have cake or anything. 

my bf and I were always not so affectionate and romantic with each other, but idk... I feel lonely. I'm even crying now, even though I never really cared that much about my birthday, Christmas or ""family time"" in general, people describe me as a relatively cold person... but idk, I just feel so lonely now, and I can't stop crying.

Is this because it's my first birthday and Christmas alone? What can I do to deal with it?

So for example, for my wife's bridal shower, one of her friends/acquaintances offered to plan her bridal shower for her.

We didnt ask for that anything be more fancy or have a budget. We just wanted it to be appropriate. We just wanted a little say in what would happen) 

My wife's mother seemed a little offended by the fact that we asked such a request and accused us of not being grateful.

733,"Okay... so obviously this is a very touchy subject. I found my SO’s suicide note while I was cleaning up a bit. It was obviously recently written due to the nature of what was written. 

I don’t know how to bring it up to them. They aren’t the type that like to talk about things like this... and... if that wasn’t bad enough... I found a double whammy as I read.

There was a section of individual notes written to the people in their life. The very first one was a note to Sarah (not real name) saying how much they loved her and wished they could be together. My name... is not Sarah. But I do know who Sarah is. My note was basically “thanks for trying even though I was a POS”

I’m crushed.... not only is the person I love thinking about suicide but it seems like they don’t feel the same way I do about them.

I’m scared to bring up the note.... I’m scared to break up with them... I’m scared anything I do will send them over the edge...

736,"Hello all,

I have a neighbor who has a problem with people who wear face masks. He has consistently come out onto his porch and coughed at me, my girlfriend, and our neighbors as we've walked by on the sidewalk near his first floor balcony for the past few weeks. I know this sounds ridiculous, and I'm not one to police people over their preferences or what they do in their own dwelling, but my neighbor is starting to get a little aggressive.

At first, I thought he was genuinely sick, or at least seriously coughing. He's young and he's out there smoking a lot, and that isn't what I have a problem with (in fact, I smoke too!). The issue is that we have to walk by his apartment to get to the mailbox, and each time we've gone in the last few weeks, he's been quiet until he sees we're wearing masks, at which point he stands up, walks up to the railing and starts hacking up a lung, coughing at us as we walk by.  He doesn't cover his mouth or make any attempt to redirect where he's coughing, and actually looks like he's ""aiming"" at us or something. Crazy, I know, but that's what he's doing. 

Just today, he did the same thing. He was busy looking at his phone until we got close enough for him to hear us, and he sort of did a double-take, put away his phone, stood up and started doing his coughing bit. We ignored him and continued on to the mailbox, and once we were about 20 feet away from him, it stopped. Immediately. When we walked back, this time through the parking lot instead of using the sidewalk, he immediately started coughing again. It stopped once we were far away enough, but then another young woman with a mask walked by and he started doing it again--this was when I realized it wasn't in my head and that he was, for whatever reason, being a dick. 

I'm not really sure how to handle such behavior. Usually I would just not walk by his apartment, but it's kind of impossible to avoid it.

Should I just continue to ignore it? Should I contact the office? How would you handle this? I think that just talking to him about it is out of the question, he doesn't seem like a very well-adjusted dude.",16Dec2020,1

744,"There's this one woman I am seeing on a weekly basis (for the past month or so) who does an *amazing* job. The first time I went to see her I could tell she was good. Perfect amount of pressure to where it hurts in a good way. So that made me come back. With every successive visit she does a better and better job since she understands my body better. And with every successive visit it gets more... intimate? On our 3rd session she started massaging around my groin with her feet, touching my balls sometimes. And on our 5th session I asked her to massage my upper abs and she asked about going lower and spent a lot of time rubbing my lower abs and my mons pubis (that made me pretty hard). I usually go for 2 hours and every session she scoots right up to me and has her thighs pressed firmly against my body for 20-30 minutes at a time while she's working on me. Kinda like how when you're at a bar and you meet a girl and she has her legs pressed up against you for a really long time under the table.

My sister is always asking me to go on her errands to stores with her or watch some YouTube video, my niece wants me to play card games or go on walks, my mom wants me to do errands and chores. 

I don't mind doing the chores or running errands, as it's just part of life, but for me that is social time and afterwards I want to just hide in my room when my family still wants attention and interaction from me. Ideally, they just ignore that I exist but that's not going to happen. 

Obviously, I spend time with my daughter constantly, besides when I'm at work, and that's just the reality of parenting. She doesn't really drain me socially. She plays on her own often while all I have to do is watch her and redirect her when she does the wrong thing or casually engage with her while she plays with playdoh or draws.

Is it wierd that I just want to be left alone for a good chunk of my waking hours? Is there something wrong with me that i should be concerned about?",16Dec2020,1
758,"My sister has been known to have little blow ups (not little but for the sake of positivity) and during these blow ups it’s almost as though she has psychosis, she interprets things completely wrong, she explodes with anger, there have been instances that she’s cling to a moving car screaming at my mom over something so unimportant I cannot even recall, and then proceeded to walk inside and call someone explain everything my mother did that was horrible. My sister also has a deep rooted hatred that sort of formed out of the blue, she calls him homophobic and sexist and racist, mainly sexist, and although I am a male I have not seen this to be the case at all, he may say some things that can be perceived as sexist but he has done nothing to make her hate him so much. She has since moved to Denver for college but tends to get very very stressed out about things and with that very anxious aswell, it is not uncommon for her to get angry with my mom (they call daily) and say something along the lines of “I’m not coming home for summer” “I’m not coming home anymore” “you know what don’t come and visit me anymore”. As of right now she is back for winter break, but around 2 weeks into her winter stay at home, my father took employees to the airport and took a car charging adapter from the car thinking it was one of his employees adapters whom were using this car for months prior to my sisters return from school (little did he know this was the charger my sister bought because there wasn’t one in the car when she arrived back home) my sister became infuriated when she saw that her charger was no longer there. I went off skating trying to distance myself from the trouble I could see was approaching so I do not know everything that was happening back at home. From what I have gathered, my sister was extremely mad at my father, demanded 10$ for the charger he took and demanded an apology as-well, my father is a bit stubborn but strives for a relationship with my sister and so is very careful and does not discipline her and only aims to have happy times with her (which they were, prior to this one incident, over the two weeks she’s been here they were on great terms) and so he gave her the 10$ immediately and, again from what I’ve gathered, tried to explain himself most likely in a tempered way, and this response by him most certainly made her blow up, my mother who was upset about something at the moment as-well got involved and told my sister to stop being rude and this set my sister off even more, my sister proceeded to telling them she scheduled her flight back to Denver early, the 21st of December. My sister then went to talk to me where I was skating and told me that they are crazy, (I can agree to an extant but can’t all children? My mother can be a bit awful in arguments, she tends to play the victim and get very caught up in her emotions not in an abusive way but she is able to completely reflect on all of that once she has calmed down a bit) back to the story, she proceeded to say that they were terrible parents, and that she’s a “phyc-major” and that what they do affects the development of a child, she tends to ride her phyc-major a decent amount in attempt to prove a point or something. She also told me that she was suicidal when she left home and every time she comes back she becomes suicidal again (I do not know if the subject but it is a bit extreme to become suicidal over petty arguments amongst family) and I’m no phycologist but I do not think she should be in phycology for the sake of helping others, for most of her independent life she has not been able to keep herself together very well emotionally, and so I think it is not a good idea for her to focus on other peoples problems. This morning my mother walked up stairs and tried talking to her, she had to talk through the door, and told her that she needs to stop smoking marijuana (she has been an avid user since freshmen year and is now a sophomore in college) and  also told her that she is in pain and can’t just up and leave the second something happens she does not like, and that if she still feels sad that there was no shame on taking medication. My sister laughed and kept calling my mom crazy but I could tell she was crying while she laughed. I do not know what to do, or possible reasons behind the events, and I just do not know how to comprehend and interpret everything that’s happened. I do not know wether she is truly depressed or just immature and has a hatred for her  parents. I just want advice on this whole ordeal and things that can be done or things to do, I do not know.

761,"TL;DR: ""Roomate's"" dog attacked mine. I want her to either muzzle him, or pay half of the vet bills.

Hi! I do believe I know what to do, however the person I am dealing with has been a bit unreasonable (in my opinion) about the situation.

My boyfriend and I recently moved back to his hometown with our baby and my dog. He is on the smaller side, and old. We were told before coming down that one of the dogs here is dog aggressive towards small dogs, but there wasn't another option for us. So I've taken as many preventive measures as I could. My dog would never be out with this other dog if no human was around. Even when people were present, I was still nervous. 

Anyway, this dog has gone after mine 3 times now. The first time he knocked out a back tooth. The second time he drew a little blood. This last time he really fucked up my dog. His hip is displaced. I've already taken him to the vet, but we have to see if he needs surgery. Like I said, he's old, so if he needs surgery, he will most likely just be put down.

Today I spoke to the owner of the other dog about potentially muzzling her dog when  he isn't in his cage. It's not just my dog he has gone after. She refused, saying we were told what he was like before we got here.

So discussion didn't work. And despite what happened, I do like her dog. But now I'm worried, what if he were to go after my baby one day? I just don't feel comfortable staying here anymore. Especially if my dog has to be put down. 

Would I be out of line for asking her to pay for half of the vet bills? The way I see it, if I were the owner of an aggressive dog who hurt another, I would immediately offer to help with any bills. (Noting here that my dog did nothing but walk from one room to mine, and this other dog went after him.) I feel like it's a reasonable request. So I want to give her a choice: either muzzle your dog, or pay for half of the vet bills. 

Is this okay to do? I've never been in this situation before, and it's hard because we live together (we don't have anywhere else to go as of now.)

765,"Hello people of this subreddit. 

I currently am 21 years of age and a reletively long time ago, when I was I believe 13, I did something really bad. 

I, and nearly everyone I know, would consider myself a nice person. When I see someone who needs help, I help. I meditate(d), go to school, have hobbies, overall I believe the person I am now is a good person, who has done some fucked up stuff. 

I say all this not to justify what I am about to say, but rather give you an image of who I see myself as. I am not the person who did this, not anymore. I can't even imagine why I did this, it is literally as if it I am a different person. Again, I say this not to justify, but just to give some context of me I guess, for how far that is possible. 

Ok, so lets just write it. Obviously I have never told anyone this story, not my girlfriend, not my family or my friends. I feel myself getting sick writing this.

I don't recall how it started or what initiated the whole thing if I'm being honest. Anyway, I was about 13 at the time of it happening. Me and my best friend at the time were hanging out at a garage. His sister, who was only 10 years old, came and joined us. I dared her to touch my penis and play with it. This happend on multiple occaisions where we would, 'play a game' and I would say this. I clearly remember saying that if she wants to stop, she can whenever she pleases to. But I am sure I only told her this to 'cover my end'. 

For the last couple years I have been thinking about this even over and over again, getting more sick by the day. I just can't believe I did this. I try to be a good man, helping people and being kind. But one thing I can't do is change the past. I have done this horrific thing and I feel terrible. But I can't even imagine what she feels. I don't know. I am so sorry to her for doing this, so so sorry. How could anyone ever forgive someone for doing this. I don't think it is possible, I don't even know if forgiveness is necessary. 

Everywhere I go I feel like I am living a lie because who would do such a horrible thing. If I come clean with this I of course have no idea what will happen. My family might abandon me, my girlfriend leave me and I would end up with no friends. I might have to go to jail. But I guess it would be deserving. 

I assume, and hope in the deepest of my heart, that nobody has any similiar situations. But whether you do or you do not, what would you do?

What would you do if you were me?

I don’t feel like i’m going to ever be able to be loved or be a good partner. Our mutual friend is one of the only people I can really trust and I know she genuinely cares for me and loves me.

My friend always reassures me that I deserve to be love and in a happy relationship and that she thinks we’d be a good match but I can’t help but think that she’s just saying that to make me feel good (even though she’s told me she’s not. she knows how i think haha).

788,"LONG POST: NSFW - CW/TW: Sex, Nudes, Suicidal thoughts, anxiety/OCD

Hi, this post is express my guilt and to ask for advice moving forward.

Tl;dr: 
I used to catfish people on Grindr involving sexting and sharing nudes (the nudes were the real me, the face pics were not mine). I deleted all catfishing accounts/photos/chats. What should I do now? What steps can I take to try make things right/better?

The Full Story (long)

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

The Backstory:

In the summer of 2019 (when I was 19) until about 3 months ago (aged 20) I used a fake profile to talk to men on Grindr (a gay chat/hook up app). The vast majority of these chats were of a sexual nature (essentially arranging hook ups that I had no actual intention of going to, exchanging nudes and sexting). I used a fake name and a face photo from the internet but the nudes were mine. 

Every few months over the course of the last year or so, I would go through a period of like a week where I would have these conversations with men on Grindr. I would block all of them, often without warning. I never said that the face pic was not mine. Sometimes if they asked for a Snapchat I would give them a fake one I had made and we would swap nudes and talk there. I’ve probably talked to like 100 boys in this fake Grindr profile. The longest I talked to someone was probably around a week. 

When I was doing it, I never considered that I was actually catfishing. I didn’t intend to cause harm or go into it with the intent of getting nudes to expose anyone or be malicious with the conversations. I never shared the nudes I received, often didn’t even save the photos or screenshot the chats. 

My Realisation:

In September, I decided to stop using Grindr. But then a few weeks ago, I really realised what I had actually been doing on Grindr. I had been deceiving people - catfishing them - often in a sexual manner. I now realise how incredibly wrong and disgusting my actions are. Not only did I waste people’s time, have them share things with me they might not have shared if I used my actual face pics but I also left them abruptly when they might have been developing some sort of actual connection with ‘me’ (my catfish persona) on Grindr. 

This has left me with a lot of guilt, stress and disappointment with myself.  I’m so mad at myself for doing something so vile and deceitful. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone because the harm was in my lying - my acts were harmful and my intentions don’t change that. I feel like a predator and a creep, and I don’t feel like I deserve a future or to enjoy happy things anymore because of what I’ve done. I feel guilty that my friends still hang out with me and my family still talks to me because they don’t know what a shitty person I actually am. 

Advice Needed:

This where I would like some advice. I deleted all the chats, photos and accounts that I used for catfishing in a guilt-ridden, stress-fuelled rampage. But now I wish I could actually apologise to these people. I cannot hope to ever apologise to all of the people because there are so many of them, I don’t remember who they all are and they are also spread all over my country (since I did this while on holiday sometimes). 

Do you guys think I should create a new Grindr account to attempt to find at least some of these people and apologise to them? Or will this cause more hurt - especially if the people didn’t suspect I was a catfish and also because it’s many months (a year in some cases) since I last talked to these people. How else can I get closure from this? No ever told me they were hurt, but the idea that someone was hurt by my actions is deeply troubling to me. 

I’m also going to get help from a therapist of some kind because this has really affected how I view myself and I have been suicidal over this (please don’t be sympathetic - I know the focus should be on my victims). 

I want to move forward from this and starting making a more positive contribution to society but I feel like I don’t deserve to do that. No one in my real life knows about this and I’m just constantly consumed by guilt and worrying about the people I talked to on this fake profile. 

Closing Thoughts - to Catfishers and Catfish victims:

I will never be doing this toxic, disgusting shit again. I want to be a better person in the future but I know that cannot change what I’ve done in the past. To anyone catfishing right now - stop. Please just stop, apologise to your victims and seek help. You’re hurting yourself in ways you might not realise right now, but more importantly - you’re hurting innocent people. You’re still hurting people even if you don’t intend to cause harm - trust me, I know. 

To catfish victims - I am very sorry. I realise now how hurtful the actions of people like me are. You do not deserve to be lied to and violated. You have done nothing wrong and the guilt and shame lies only with the people who catfished you. I hope you are able to heal from what happened to you.",16Dec2020,1
789,"Hello, I'm getting into politics and when talking with people they get extremely upset/ don't want to be friends with me anymore. Are my political views bad?
I don't personally know where I stand specifically but I do have my opinions.

Generally I believe people who do the work and have the expertise should have a say/ run a business I believe the person who gets their hands dirty are more experienced and actually knows what to do rather than a top down system. 

In terms of government I want a very limited one I don't like regulation and so on unless decided by the people them selves not a state or representative I guess you could call it people's democracy? I've also heard the term direct democracy is it that? I'd also like rank choice voting

I believe in the free market but believe in order for it to run smoothly and fairly I believe the employees should be in charge, the workers decide on pay, hours, and general direction of the company, based on what's realistic and what the consumer what's / needs I believe such a system will work for most people, workers get they're desired pay, hours, don't feel like a cog in the machine thus actually feel like they're contributing to society which will create loyalty and workers will work more effective, enterprise while not maximizing profit through taking advantage of workers or moving over sees and turning the other way while children make your products but instead make a modest profit, and the consumers will have peace in mind knowing workers are treated fairly and are granteed good products because of treating workers fairly and using ethicly sourced high quality materials only bad thing I can see with this is instead of maximizing profit, you'll make a generous amount.

I believe every citizen should be garenteed healthcare, education, and housing by having the populations basic needs met they are no longer trying to keep themselves above water and can actually achieve more and be a better person, whether that be going to high education resulting in being more productive for your self but also the community or contributing to your community and volunteer. This will also help with the rise in automation most people work basic jobs and need higher education.

I believe in moving away from fossil fuels and moving towards renewable energy.

I also believe drugs should be accessible and decriminalized

With law enforcement I want them reprioritized to focus on victim Crimes, I also want them de militarized, I also believe when it comes to victim less crimes, it should be handled by social workers.",16Dec2020,1

793,So just recently I unfollowed one my good friend and her boyfriend’s account on Instagram. It was in the heat of the moment that I did that. Basically me and my boyfriend are having a rough time and I’m just trying my very best not to overthink and be anxious about the situation. My friend and her boyfriend constantly post insta stories about each and couple photos. I am super happy for them but at the moment I just feel it’s not really good for my mental health so I unfollowed them. I then realized my friend unfollowed me back. That’s not the issue to me. It’s that she had searched my name and realized I unfollowed so now she knows. I’m scared she might take me wrongly or something and I’m not sure if I was right into unfollowing her. I can’t really just tell her that please hide your stories from me cause it’s annoying me right. I hope I made the right decision and it won’t be awkward between us. I’m not a big fan of social media so I don’t think it defines my friendship with anyone. I just want to make the situation less awkward.,16Dec2020,1

795,"1 year of bliss &amp; 3 years of working on trying to find a flow. 

I was a messsss ok, 23 years old, didn’t plan or handle my finances,taking my time finishing school. I just did not make a habit of planning life out in general. I was and still am a very carefree type of person I’ve never been one to chase money or be very serious even. 
Obviously this can only last for so long when you want to enter “the real world”. Plan for a family, settling down, owning property etc... 
my bf who is 7 years older than me has his career together, has been saving money for a long time while I’ve been taking my time &amp; leaning on him quite a bit &amp; not really noticing how frustrated he was, waiting for me. 

Since 2020, I have graduated, I’ve got the full time job, I’ve been trying to plan things out through the worst year in history &amp; it’s not enough. He feels so wronged, he’s so resentful &amp; angry for all the time wasted thus far, me not listening to his wants and dreams sooner. (Mind you, he’d tell me he’d want to travel or move to a bigger place, and I’d get defensive &amp; take it as if he was saying I wasn’t enough &amp; a mooch or a bum. Years of this kind of fighting. 

Now that I’m listening &amp; hearing him &amp; doing more for myself, I’ve asked more from him. I’ve asked him to be kinder to me &amp; speak in my love language (words of affirmation) he says he can’t do that and I should understand why. he compares me not listening for all this time to me cheating for years, I’ve wronged him so much I should be thankful he’s still around. I should be more grateful and not asking him for kind words. I should get that he is angry and doesn’t want to compliment me or make me feel special. 
He says he needs time to forgive me. He needs more time to be able to do these things &amp; let go of ‘this notion’ of me. 

I am too in it to see, or know how to feel about this. I don’t feel good, I know that. Am I supposed to be more sorry? Am I supposed to know how wrong I was and feel like I don’t deserve kindness right now? 
Am I supposed to accept he needs time &amp; deal with the resentment until he’s over it?

797,"On mobile, sorry for any formatting issues! 

I wanted to reach out to see if anyone can provide me advice on a particular problem I’m in. So, I’m getting married next year and am looking for a way to include my biological father as I am not having him walk me down the aisle and I’m not doing a father daughter dance. 

Sparing any details my father was an abusive alcoholic growing up and I suffer from PTSD as a result. Ended up in a mental hospital twice and eventually I went NC for a few years. Years later after therapy and healing I met with him and my fiancé to discuss how he could be in contact with me, long story short I finally got an apology for the things that happened to me. Since then I’ve been in contact, but do not see him often. I have improved quite a bit since I was a kid from a PTSD aspect and he is “working on his drinking” and I’m trying to allow him to be apart of my life as long as he doesn’t retreat to his old ways (not even sure if this is a good idea). But, so far nothing terrible has happened...

Anyways, I am very uncomfortable with the idea of a father daughter dance, so I’m doing a family dance instead (I dance with my fiancé and the parents dance with their own spouses). I also do not want him to walk me down the aisle, so I will most likely be walking myself.

He was quite upset when I told him these things and he’s telling me he’s only dreamed of walking me down the aisle because I’m his only daughter. As weird as it sounds I don’t want to make him feel bad even after everything I’ve been through. I’m learning to forgive and move on so I can get on with my life. 

Another family member just suggested I should just do it for him, in order to avoid people whispering about me walking alone all night, and know that I’m not doing it for me, but for him. This scares me a bit. 

Does anyone have another suggestion for how I could include him in some way, to save me any unwanted altercations with him?

I had a perfect relationship for almost 5 years. It was awesome and fulfilling. unfortunately we both agreed to end it and now we’re close friends but we don’t spend time as much as before. 


The problem starts here, I’m too attached to him and i don’t know who i am without him, i still tell him everything and ask for his opinion all the time. He on the other hand already got over me, which is so good, and that made him spend way less time with me than before. And i get really sad when he’s busy or ignores me unintentionally. I want to fix this but i don’t know how. I have no other friends, no colleagues, no body to spend time with and I hate my family.

818,"Lately the behavior of both my parents has went from being overall shitty to downright unmanageable. 

A year or two before I graduated, my mother I don't think this woman has had running water in my lifetime.

The floor was on the verge of collapsing into a sinkhole and whole compacted trailer just reeked of animal urine. The place was so crowded and narrow that we had to take literal baby steps just to get in the front door to the living room, and sit on the couch.

She packed up her two dogs and stayed a few nights at my mom's, which turned into a year.

Her oldest dog was basically a walking zombie, constantly stumbling into walls with no ability to see, hear, or chew his food. 

Nearly a year later, the hemmaroids eventually got so infected that they exploded all over the floor and up cabinets. There was so much blood everywhere that it looked like someone got completely mauled. 
Only then did she agree to put him down.

A year or two later we eventually found a stray dog while looking for one of her friends and she decided to keep it against my will.

I just didn't want into get run over, as I knew we didn't have the resources to care for it.

This stray eventually had puppies with her sister's dog after the hotel she was staying at didn't allow pets.

She's kept the 5 of them locked in the basement with the occasional run time in the backyard.

We gave the male puppy to my sister, her sister took the adult male back, and the stray eventually got hit by car because the lady only attempts controls them with the tone of her voice.

She refuses to use any kind collar or harness on them, despite buying leashes, and if I try to put one on them she'll start complaining about how I'm being abusive.

If I tell them to quit violently licking all over me and into my mucus membranes or digging into my legs, she says I'm mean and calls me a ""crybaby ass"".

I had two guinea pigs as my pet of choice, as I had developed a routine of feeding/watering daily and cleaning cages every week or so.

I'm sure that unbearably filthy conditions that went out of my control resulted in the death of the first, and the lack of safety for the other.

The death of my oldest pig caught us of guard as usually keep on top of bedding first and foremost.

We've never had this issue before (even with how poor we were), but I'm assuming because of the pandemic we had a snag where we couldn't afford to refill the bedding in time to clean the cage.

Thr exact cause of death was unrelated to the bedding issue,
as she had a cyst on the back of her leg, which lead to bloat/cancer for the next one or two years, and finally ""ruptured"" after not being able to pass stool. She went from being morbidly obese to a hollow shell within a matter of seconds.

I know she was older, I cant help but feel horrible for how she suffered like that.

I couldn't bear to bother my parents about basic vet care again, as they only let me take the other one cause I traveled halfway across the state and decided that I should be able to get my money's worth out of them.

Even though I couldn't do anything to save my oldest, I should've at least put her in a tub where she was able to lay on a soft fleece blanket and make herself comfortable. By the time I got her a fresh cage, she passed the next day.

This was after my sister dumped her son's guinea pig on me because he wouldn't take care of it. I eventually ended up rehoming him after begging the fuck out of my parents, cause I was so fucking done.

My dad eventually moved in with us after he couldn't afford to pay the electric bill at his mother's abandoned house up the street. I'm in disbelief that he let my childhood home (which was pretty hoarded to begin with) become akin an absolute meth house, with the ceiling caving in the bathroom and bills covering every last inch of what little floor we had.

Boxes and clutter went from being a moderate to severe hindrance as a child, to filling up what very little space was left, making it downright impossible to walk around or salvage anything.

He's taken all his trash and has completely filled the main room upstairs; it's even become both a health hazard with literal garage lights/wires hanging down in mid-air AND a fire hazard with old crappy space heater, outdated TVs/radios strawn everywhere, cut up chargers/wires, and shit tons of half-sauntered motherboards laying around.

Not only are his electronics/glasses/etc. scattered all over the place, this deranged man leaves all his used Enbrel pens in a giant pile next to his mattress.

My father even brought over that nasty ass microwave from my grandma's which was basically caked in mold on the inside and sparked whenever someone tried to use it.

My mom's friend and I had to hose out the litter box because it became way too filthy for the cats to use and neither of my parents would offer to help. We found literal grubs in the bottom of it (not maggots) with no idea how they got there.

Back when it was real bad, all 5 kittens would have explosive diarrhea all over the house and I often found myself constantly wiping up diarrhea off of the floor, and would take pictures of it for proof.

I even ended up pulling a two foot long tapeworm out of my mother's cat all by myself because nobody else would help me. I had to work slow with nothing but a sheet of toilet paper and could even feel it create friction against the kitten's intestines. 

We eventually dumped 3 of the 5 kittens in one o the the most gresome car ride I think I ever went on, with them constantly shitting diarrhea with a clear jelly like consistency surrounding the edges and even ended up vomiting foam a few times. It's a wonder they didn't pass away from heatstroke in the floorboard

I've took photos for several months since February 22, 2020 (kitten's were born May 8th) but the ""evidence"" folder was somehow wiped clean while transferring files from my phone to my Google drive.

Practically everything we own is covered in roaches, egg sacs, and roach feces; all the way from old dressers and foam cabinets to the scratched up walls themselves.

I know it's my fault for dragging all my shit out in an attempt to clean and not keeping my word, but it's pretty much impossible to keep calm and motivate myself when it's such a challenge just to walk up the stairs and into the main room with all his metal/construction level junk in the way.

A few weeks ago, I went to the ER over a roach in my ear, only for it to be a complete waste of time (they refused to treat me since dad acted like a complete dumbass). I went back home and eventually had to have my ear flushed out with saline to get all the pieces out.

Just today my mother's friend (with my help) shoveled up literal mounds of used cat litter and trash stacked nearly 6 inches high scattered under both the ""dining room"" table and the one that my dad uses as his personal computer desk. With a snow shovel.

We have to constantly bleach the tub because the diarrhea was so strong it would literally stain it, not to mention that the tub is already close to caving into the basement.

We beg my mother to take charge of her life and get up off the couch but she refuses to. My dad has completely trashed the house but she just does not care.

My mother does literally nothing with herself (not even shower) outside of driving me home and being abhorrently glued to the TV. 

Apparently she's been like this her whole life, as absolutely nothing that her parents did (all the way from threats to punishment to bribes) would encourage her to listen. She seems to have a one track mind as she only talks to us about working at the toll road and the tobacco farm.

If we try to correct her she'll yell at us and go on about how we treat her like she's stupid.

She expects to be given things and makes everyone else do the dirty work for her. She goes on about how I'm going to care for her when she gets old.

I wamt to stand up and tell her to quit going to McDonalds 24/7, but its ultimately not my decision to make.

We have no way of alerting the doctors of the truth about those meds not working out for her.

I wish could stand up for myself but I'm just so fucking exhausted from the already backwards ideaology of my parents.

I'm tired of their lack of care towards anything and everything being excused by the ""Asperger's"", ""bipolar disorder"", and ""depression"". This happens EVERY single time I try to vent to anybody.

I have 2 of the 3 (I just call it plain ol' autism) and you don't see me acting like a ignorant piece of horseshit.

I should've known better than to give my mother guardianship, as my parents nose into my private mental health and get pissed at how I spend my money on ""non-adult"" stuff to keep me happy. Of course I could use a lil help with budgeting and earning money but I never get it.

I go to a therapy group about 9 hours a week, but I begin to feel more desolate and estranged from everyone else as the days go by. I can't get anything non report-worthy (or even) off my chest without people looking at me like I'm insane.

I vent on about the cats eat off the stove and jump all over the countertops: one of the two staff in charge of my day program thinks it's absolutely hilarious as fuck and deems it as ""normal goblin behavior"".

I've tried and tried to tell my therapist about how concerned I am for both me and the cats. I told her that I think I'm slowly developing PTSD and how absolutely terrified I am to do basic things like go to the doctor and open Christmas presents. I tell her that I'm scared of my cat being hit on like they do the others; he's already starting to be dragged around by my dad for shitting in the floor.

All I get in response is very little to nothing. She doesn't seem to do much of anything but keep her mouth shut all the time, even when I try getting her to talk about stuff she's interested in. She told me I could paint a birdhouse last spring/summer but never brought it up since.

I wish I had someone engaging, one to actually do activities and work on shit with. 

Everyone else just seems to have buddy-buddy relationships with theirs, or have the ability to pick out who they vibe with. I know I should try and switch by now. But when I suggested it in the past, they told me that she was the only adult therapist there who took my insurance or whatever the fuck. Unless I completely resign from my current program, I simply just don't have that option.

My therapist did the right thing and reported me to a social worker after I told her about how my mother gave her friend my EBT/foodstamp card without my knowledge and completely forgot about it.

After the whole social worker thing, my mother is threatening to switch me over to a ""new program"" an hour away and we have an upcoming evaluation with them.

However upon a quick Google search, it turns out their speciality is school-aged children and youth, which is something I could've used a long time ago. I'm pray to God that I qualify for whatever they have in store for me because it's become one of the ONLY options I have left.

I'm not that interested being shoved right into a nursing home fresh out of highschool, let alone full of people I don't even know.

I have severe trauma with people touching my shit and I'd rather not share a room with a complete stranger in a crowded ass, dimly-lit building.

I want to be in an actual transitional community where I can work to build my life back up and be a part of the local community.

I want to have my very own yardsale. I want to donate my old shit under my OWN will without having to worry about it being completely filthy and covered in roach poop. I want to display my remaining plushies/figurines on a shelf where I know they'll be loved and cherished. I want to actually organize through all my wonderful clothes without having the burdens of my parents refusal to go through THEIR clothes. I want to do my laundry with a working machine and finally wear something other than dirty, blood stained t-shirts and the same pair of pants for a month straight.

I want to style my own hair without anyone bitching about me wearing hair bows and hats.

I want to have my own furniture and an open room without having to worry about it being caked in cat feces, roaches, and piles of trash.

I want to go back to owning my own pet, or at the very least, save my cat from 14 more years of torture.

The obvious action to take would be to rehome them, but I've went from shelter to shelter and back around again only for them to redirect us to a place we've already been. M's Mutts is about the only notable ""rescue"" (that hasn't went completely bankrupt within a few months) and they're usually super cocky when talking to peasants like us and make it known that they ONLY take in dogs.

What ever non-profit organizations we can find that supposedly take in cats just leave me on hold entirely.

I eventually gave up the whole shelter thing since it was such a waste of time. I eventually went to online groups hoping to find
literally anyone available to take them. However, these groups have been filled with nothing but drama, complaints, and rehoming memes taking up the entire feed.

I've completely lost all fucks, especially since the mother cat has went missing after getting on our roof. People go on probably starved and froze to death on the roof or got brutally slaughtered by a coyote (which is what happened to our last cat)

I feel like I have no choice but to take him with me, as it's pretty much impossible (given my current circumstances) to get ANY kind of animal rehomed at this point. As for the grey one, I can only pray that it ""works out"".

I'm so fucking tired of being passed from children to middle aged adults like a hot potato. God forbid I even question it, or else I'm tryin too hard to ""fit in"" and that it's not healthy for grown-ups to be around peers less than several DECADES in age gap.

I really have nothing against older children, as the kids at my old autism program respected each other WAY better than I've ever seen anyone at my highschool do. 

At my current therapy, the youngest client there was in their early to mid 30s with pretty much everyone else being older.

We finally fucking do have a 23 year old, but he's obnoxious as hell and personally freaks me the fuck out (he's autistic and is overall cocky/loud).

I know it sounds rude but I do feel less lonely. I'm just sick of any single negative experience or minor complaint being reprimanded with people telling me to ""bE cArEfUl WhAt YoU wIsH fOr"" or some other edgy do-gooder bullshit.

He's not even a bad person at heart, it's just that we're not the type of autistic to get along (if you know what I mean) and I just have trouble connecting to anyone at all anymore.
 
I'm tired of being forced through drastic age gaps, only for people to get horribly pissed at me for not ""acting my age"" and refusing to openly chat with anybody.

I want to be in college so fucking much, but I knew it's just way too much of a burden on my parents considering that I was constantly failing high school and got banned from all the extra curricular clubs for such poor grades

I know there's a future out there for me somewhere. I have an appointment scheduled the 15th to get tested for disability. I know there's lots of things in my life to be grateful for. Like that ice cold, tasty mineral water that streams from the sink and my cheaply printed (but cozy) blanket that I purchased after a month or two of waiting. Hell, even the kids on Roblox being sure brightens up my day.

But all those things can only carry me so far, and we all know that the Social Security office loves to take their dear sweet time when it comes to filing for disability.

Idk maybe it sounds like I'm just being bitchy. It just feels like it just isn't enough anymore. Or that I could end up in an even worse situation.

The thing is, I'd much rather kill myself or even be homeless than to ever move back in with my parents.

""Take it one day at a time"" is the absolute worst piece of shit advice I think I've ever heard in my entire life, right after ""think positive"". I get it, if you have a sick child or a ice storm, you can still enjoy the smaller moments. But some like myself have it so fucking bad, that taking it slow only prolongs the suffering.

I've tried and tried and TRIED (for several years), basically pleading on my knees with the school system to help me find a place to live. Apparently all that research was for nothing, as I was told at the last second that I had too big of an IQ to qualify.

I sometimes wish I could go back and completely fuck over my ACT score. I wish I had the strength to pound on my bullies (as the everyone kinda sat on their ass and did nothing to stop the harassment) and lunge my teachers for getting so smartass with me over nothing.

I know violence never solves anything (my intent was never to actually hurt anyone). But I'm sure if I was more physically threatening back then, I would've gotten the actual help I needed much sooner.

I'm so fucking tired of being praised as this savant hyper-genius who would supposedly be in MENSA if I weren't so lazy. I'm tired of everyone telling me how ""smart and intelligent"" I am; it's gotten so bad that it's become a personal trigger for me.

I know the past is in the past, but just over all numb to basic human connection There's simply no hope for me anymore, all because people go from constantly wanting praise me as a god to just flat out ignoring me, instead of getting me actual help.

I swear to God if I don't secure a place to live by my 20th birthday and move out within a single month (April 20), I'm literally fucking killing myself. I don't give a single fuck what anyone else says. Not even the suicide hotline or mental health professional will fucking stop me. If the don't have an immediate plan in place for me and the animals, then I don't want their fucking shit ass ""positivity"" advice. I've literally listed so many fucking reasons to live in this post, but all of it is pointless if I'm just gonna be forced back into that filthy shit hole for the next decade.

I'd even take my cat with me to the grave so he can be free but I don't want him to watch him suffer.

I've tried contacting or researching just about every single autism/mental illness oriented organization in the state of Kentucky, with 90% of them being defunct and all of the remaining ones being halfway across the state and further. 

I'm much better off searching for hope in the Evansville/Newburg area, but everyone goes on about how ""scary"" it is because I don't know anybody. I've lived nearly my entire life within the structure of the public school system and very rarely stepped foot in a space that wasn't the house of an immediate relative or the local grocery store.

I don't give a fuck about """"the people"" as long as I'm not sexually assaulted, shot in the head, and my shit isn't burned to the ground or stolen.

I don't care what the fuck it is, just give me something other than a fucking hotline.",16Dec2020,0

822,"I'm 20f living in California. 

I'm so depressed. I feel trapped and run down. I was in a toxic relationship with one of my coworkers that led to me distancing myself from all my friends and damaging my relationships with my coworkers. We've just broken up but it's so hard because I literally have no one but him. He realized the toll his actions had on me and we are still friends but other than him I literally have no one. 

I live with my family, but my sister is high risk and since covid cases in our area have spiked recently, I am sleeping in the family mini van and can only come in with mask and gloves to use the bathroom and shower. I would quit my job but then I would have no contact with anyone outside of my family and even though I'm not as close with work friends as I was before because of my relationship, seeing and working with them feels like the only sanity I have. 

My parents relationship is shit. My mom is bipolar borderline schizophrenic and had a psychotic episode that lasted 6 years that deeply affected my family. She's been mentally healthy for two years which is amazing but my parents relationship is broken. My dad degrades her constantly (she is on heavy medication to stay sane, and because of this she is forgetful) and goes from being nice and happy to incredibly mean to her over things she cant control. They are staying together until my sister finishes her senior year of highschool in June. 

Being home and living with them is very hard emotionally because of the ups and downs of their failing relationship. They both treat us kids like therapists and me and my sister have emotional trauma from when my mom was psychotic. I had to help parent my sister from when I was 12 til now due to my dad working full time and my mom being extremely unreliable because of her illness. I had to babysit my mom while my dad was away. It was terrible and terrifying. I have completely forgiven my mom now, and she's doing amazing, but there are lasting effects from it. My dad and me have a very up and down relationship due to other reasons I won't get into.

I would love to move out and get a place of my own but the area I live in is so expensive that even though I work full time and make above minimum wage, I would not be able to afford rent and feed myself without burning through my savings. I have considered moving to Nevada but I am terrified that without the minimal support of the people I have at work/my ex, I'll spiral deeper into depression. 

I want to go to school but I would need to go to community college first and that would mean trapping myself at home for two more years. I hate this place. I feel stuck. I don't want to deal with the drama of my parents divorce while studying and working and living out of a car. I have never felt so alone and hopeless in my life. I used to be very confident but all that has disappeared and I feel like a husk of my former self. I am seriously considering taking off and hiking the pacific crest trail in the spring just to completely remove myself from the pressure of family, work, covid, my lingering toxic relationship and everything else that's eating at me. 

What can I do? Where can I go? How do I remove myself from this shit situation? Would moving out of state be beneficial or set me back further?",16Dec2020,1
823,"I'm in my late 20s. I've been a bartender for the last 5 years and have done well. Until this year, now I'm back with my parents and working a factory job.

I only have one life here, I don't want to waste it. I want to enjoy it and I really think I'd enjoy doing acting or voiceover work. Everywhere I look, it's paid subscription services. Is this the best outlet for a beginner? I've thought about going to school for it but that's such a huge commitment that I'm admittedly afraid of.

824,"I've been working as a host at a diner for nearly 6 months now. It's my very first job and when I started, it was a ton of fun and I met a lot of nice people.

But more and more red flags are popping up now. The managers, aside from one, are all rather crotchety. A few times, I've been asked to come in despite medical problems. Once, I couldn't physically stand up and had to call in right before a shift, but the manager told me that I wasn't allowed to call in even though I'd never done it before. And recently, someone I live with tested positive for C*vid and I had to quarantine. I made sure to call the second I found out and the good manager only said he hoped it passed and that I felt okay. A few days later, I had already been put back on the schedule. When I called again, I wasn't so lucky with who answered. One of the ruder managers told me it was my responsibility to trade shifts I couldn't come in for. (Even though I wasn't supposed to be on the schedule at all)

All of this, plus harassment from a few other coworkers, and my sister and I both believe it would be best for me to work somewhere else. But I'm really nervous about putting in my two week notice.

829,"I really consider myself an anxious extrovert. Some background: I've been trying to be out about being transgender this year and it especially really helped me feel better/open interacting with people, along with getting on meds. I acted pretty introverted in grade school and didn't talk to people so it's such a relief to meet new people as I go to college and go to virtual meetings, I just don't care what people I just met think about me? So I'm not too anxious around them and can be okay reminding myself if something goes wrong I can always leave. 

 However, it's the complete opposite with people I've known a long time and that are important to me. I feel paranoid and anxious so very much about either screwing up and being different from the person they need or being a bother. Otherwise I'm paranoid that they hate me, which is normal anxiety stuff and easier to calm down but lately it's become that I'm scared people are doing/planning things behind my back or peoplelying about stuff. Especially with my partner, I feel bad since we're both in bad situations right now (their dad was recently in an accident and mine is starting to get cancer treatment and related surgeries) and I think they'd be hurt if I told them what my anxious thoughts are telling me but I don't know how to stop.

Im 16 male. I study everyday for my straight A’s, my dream is to be a Environmental Engineer/lawyer/scientist. I play guitar, football (soccer)i have long, blonde-curly hair, im 5’8. 

A couple days ago i was driving, looked off the road for a second and was about to drive off an edge, i don’t know what made me turn or what reflexes i was given at that moment but i escaped death by a split second and it made me think. I have never had a girlfriend, or first kiss. Its not that im not social or that i don’t try, but it’s because i don’t like dating if im not actually in-love with the girl talking to me. However, this is seen as weird in today’s world, makes me seem out of place, I haven’t found someone i love yet. But im getting slammed for it? Public pressure from society, family and friends. Everyone says the same old shit “oh this girl asked u out, or that girl likes you” or “ that girl wants u just use her” but I don’t, and im seen as the bad guy. It doesn’t feel normal. I been friends with this girl for over 14 years been with her in her worst and best times. She got a boyfriend last year, we haven’t talked since. Is everyone this cold? Or am i in the wrong? Am I exaggerating this shit? Why does it make me sad? I feel down, im blessed with a great family, and amazing health and im infinitely grateful for everything i have. Yet.

I texted drew with the news and he said I couldn’t come home because he can’t get sick and call off work. My thought was A. I don’t think he can legally tell me I can’t come home. And B. I can’t stay with her. To avoid conflict I stayed with her(she’s a lifesaver). I started feeling better two days ago and so I went to get tested again yesterday.

This lady adored my sister as the daughter she never had and when my sister wasn’t around this woman was VERY nasty towards me, I don’t want to get into everything, but when my mum found out, along side a few other shady things, my mum cut her out of her life. 

I felt bad as my mum is not very good at making friends so I didn’t want to be the reason they were no longer friends, however mum explained later it was a “final straw” situation.

Regardless my sister, who didn’t know what she had done to me at the time, continued to see this woman and calling her, her aunt. She had a hand in my sister losing her virginity (yeah 50+year old being friends with a 17y/o isn’t freaking weird right)

My sister now knows most of what this lady did and still wants us to all sit at the same table “her family table” my mum and I have asked to not be seated at the same table however she’s being super stubborn about it. My sister said to “suck it up for one day” this alongside some other really crappy things my sister is having me go through for her wedding (dress issues and how she asked me to be her bridesmaid-long story) I’m debating not going at all. But she’s my only sister and I want to go.

A friend recommended I post here to see if there’s maybe another way of approaching this situation.

847,"Hey there,

I’m in Australia NSW and my lease is coming to an end. I’ve rented for 10 years and always had great rents history. However this passed 12 months have been hard with my ex not paying rent without me not knowing (yes stole from me) then I kept falling behind on payments and now my rental history from this house is terrible 😪

I was just going to put this house down as a private rental but my realestate friend said there’s a system that rental agents can run the address if it’s a rental these the property company is attached to it.

I don’t know what to do or say where I’ve been living over the passed 12 months since we can’t travel due to covid etc.

I don’t really have many friends or even family in this state who own their house either so I can’t put them down as a private rental either.

Any ideas anyone? Your ideas are super appreciated.

Thank you",16Dec2020,1

Hello everyone.
I’ve had issues with my moms boyfriend for several years and just wanted some outside opinions.
For some context I should say that my mother divorced my dad right after I was born, I don’t know much about the situation but I know he was pretty unfaithful and has been in all his marriages after that. Since then it’s just been me and my mother and whatever guy she had at the moment.I don’t think she’s ever been with a good guy honestly, one of them overdosed when I was young, another was abusive  etc.
When I was 13(I’m 23 now) we moved back in with my grandmother while my mom finished college. During that time my mom wasn’t in a relationship and we planned on moving into our own place once she graduated. She ended up meeting a guy ( let’s call him Tom)at a craft festival and they’ve been together since 2013.( he’s an ex Jehovah’s Witness and doesn’t have any contact with his family ). Pretty much immediately after we moved into our new place, Tom moved in with us. I was a little sad because honestly it would have been really cool to live by ourselves for a while before we had someone else moving in, but I guess she was lonely and everyone deserves someone right? I don’t have issues with my mom dating anyone, I don’t want her to be alone, especially now that she’s getting older 
I got along with Tom really well in the beginning but I think a year or so later things started to go sour.
He did a lot of weird things, he never worked and he usually just sat on the couch in the living room watching tv. The dinner table was behind the couch and I’d face the tv and pretty much all day he’d be looking at porn. He had a tablet my mom bought him so it was pretty easy for me to see. ( my mom bought him everything and he’s never had a job as long as he’s known us. She’s bought him  phones, a new truck, etc. )He didn’t clean or go outside so it really was an all day thing, every day.
I had a Netflix account I shared with my grandparents and I could see that he would often try to watch  R rated sexual shows. I get that everyone had urges, but it really just seemed excessive.
Whenever my mom was at work on weekends I would just hang out in my room and he would be in the living room. One day I walked out of my room and enter the bathroom and he was sitting in the living room masterbating. He put everything away and tried to act like nothing happened but it was pretty obvious what he was doing and I know he knows I saw him. Like just go in the bathroom if you had do to that. 
He cooked dinner that night and honestly I lost my appetite and my mother was pissed at me for not eating. I didn’t tell her what happened and I had assumed he would come clean and tell her what he did to make me uncomfortable, but at the end of the day he never did and I was the one to blame.
I know he used to go into my room when I was at school , if he ever needed an excuse he just told my mom he was looking for a pen or pencil. One time I came home and he had removed my door and left a nasty note.
Another time he had told me he thinks we should still have slaves, he told me that “black people just don’t like following the rules” whenever I didn’t do the dishes one night (I’m black). One time he took me to school and on the way there he told me “ you’re never going to be able to do anything beside flip burgers”.
I would be talking to my mom and he’d interrupt and say “ quit asking such stupid questions”. I just felt like he looked down on me and I haven’t done anything to him.
There been some other stuff he’s said too, he’s had a lot of screaming episodes,but you get the pointxthis would be way to long if I included everything.
He’s never said sorry for anything and let’s the rest of my family believe I’m crazy for disliking him . Whenever I try to tell my family my reasons for not liking him it’s my fault, I’m the one who’s in the wrong.  

All the guys my mom has been with she’s given them control over me, just because you’re sleeping together that means he’s the boss? That doesn’t seem right, I would think you’d date for a long time before that would happen, not 6 months like my mother and Tom.

I moved out when I turned 18.
I don’t go on family trips or gatherings anymore because I’d rather not be around him.

In your opinion do you think I’m being too harsh? Am I overreacting? Should I just let it go and act like nothing happened? What’s wrong with this guy?",16Dec2020,1

My 2 friends who also snowboard are way more above my level, and I would be a burden to them if I asked them right now.  I just want 1 day to go up and practice shit, as I am kind of rusty right now.

My other friend snowboarded in 7th grade, but I don't know if he still does.  I'm considering asking him, but we'd probably have to figure out how to rent shit, and that would just be a whole new can of worms.

They're talking about getting me a private instructor, but I don't want that.  I just want to go up by myself and work at my own pace.  I don't want lessons, I don't even really want to go up with other people, I just want to go by myself.  I've been doing this for 4 years now, I know what I'm doing.

I can't just drive myself either, because like I said before, they treat me like a toddler and so I don't even have a driver's lisence.

861,"TLDR here at the top-
I have a senior chihuahua who is mildly aggressive and getting worse as he ages and an 11 month old mix breed puppy who is just under 40lbs. There’s been two occasions where the senior has been the victim of the pup defending himself and it’s been very serious. I can have a very strict management approach and always keep them monitored and separate, but is that really a fair lifestyle for any of us? I hate to, but I think I need to rehome the younger dog and it’s breaking my heart and hard not to feel regret before it’s even happened. If rehoming is the right choice, why does it still feel like it’s not?

And the long version—

My senior dog is 14 and has a handful of ailments that come with age and breed. He has locating patella in both back legs, dental issues, going blind, back pain (something worsened by one of the fights). He’s never been particularly friendly and I fully acknowledge that it’s my failure (there’s a lot of me failing in this situation so heads up) to have worked harder to correct his aggression. I tried a few times but it just didn’t seem like it helped and I oddly enough had friends, roommates, and family all inadvertently working against me by encouraging behavior I tried to correct. But he’s old now and sleeps most of the day, barks too much, and doesn’t let anyone touch him much, even me some times, which I think is coming with a lot of his aging pains (he also has arthritis). 

In April, for a plethora of reasons, I adopted a puppy who they estimated at 4 months. When I got him, he warmed up to me quickly but was generally pretty apprehensive around new people. He was about the size of my older dog as a puppy so no one was really hurting eachother and it was clear the younger one was trying to play and the chihuahua often would snarl and he’d lose interest or I’d intervene. I had an entirely different challenge with his fear and decided to enlist an expert professional trainer who ultimately took him in for a few weeks to train him but primarily work on building confidence. Just before that, was the first incident. 

I don’t want to keep reiterating all my failures so please just know I’m aware of all of them, trust me I have ripped myself up and down about it. 

I had been leaving the dogs out together when I’d leave the house and nothing was a problem until the one day it was. I came back after a short period of time and my older dog was laying limp on the floor and I lost it thinking he might be dead. It was clear he was picked up by the younger dog (who is now just under 40lbs, the chihuahua is 7lbs) by the neck and either thrown or shaken but either way we ended up at the emergency vet and he was kept a few days because he wouldn’t use one of his legs and they couldn’t find out why. Once he came home for weeks of recovery, the other dog was with the trainer so not around. 

Once back from training I began keeping the younger dog in the crate and he seemed happier with structure. I was learning about how to keep up his new manners and continue to work on the anxiety/fear. The trainer explained to me that what most likely happened was the younger dog didn’t take the hint from the old one to go away and then when the old one attacked, he felt the need to defend himself and obviously didn’t take size into account. 

A few months pass and then the young dog swallowed something he shouldn’t have and ended up having emergency surgery for THAT now. He was home with the lampshade collar so he started to fall from routine since he was to rest and recover. Between the trainer and these vet visits I’m now looking at almost $6000 but luckily some has been reimbursed by pet insurance. 

I let them out of sight for just a moment while I grabbed something from the other room and I heard the growling in an instant came back around the corner to see the younger dog swinging the older one in his mouth growling while the older one was screaming. I can’t even get into how traumatizing this was to see and react to. I had to pry the dogs mouth open to get him to stop. Yes, cone on still. The injuries were less severe this time but I felt I pressed my luck more than I should have. 

I decided at that point I needed to rehome the younger dog. My older dog shouldn’t have to live in fear, the younger shouldn’t have to live a restricted life, and I can’t handle the anxiety of putting one at risk again and trying to trust the other around other situations. 

Most people I know agreed and felt terrible but at the same time I was met with a lot of judgement and criticism about my decision to keep the dog after the first incident. However the trainer told me we could talk about strict management because he knows I will regret losing this special dog when the older one inevitably passes in the next few years or less. The trainer is very passionate and committed to making sure this dog has a good life and is successful, as am I, but I’m just not positive I can provide that while protecting the other. I don’t want to run the risk. 

I’m spilling this all out here because I’ve made some rehoming efforts but it’s really hard for me because I love them both so much but I can’t stand the idea of him being gone and worse, what if he ends up in the wrong home? I’m trying to find a situation where the trainer remains in close contact/maintains a relationship but this time between right now keeps circling  me back to the idea I’m giving up on him and I don’t want to do that. 

I know at the end of the day it’s my choice, but I also really worry about the fact only myself and the trainer even consider the option to keep him. Everyone else I know is concerned for the other dog (as am I) and it’s a non-negotiable issue. 

I’m hoping maybe someone can offer some further perspective or maybe has had a similar situation they have experience to speak from what they did or would do differently. 

It’s a rock and hard place for sure but I’m walking a line in my mind of giving up on a dog that needs support to protect my older companion of many years, or keep him and carry the load to ensure I eventually get him to the right place so I don’t lose him. Separately, he brings me a lot of joy and pulls me out of some bad depression/anxiety just by being there and I can focus on him to feel like I have something good to count on. So while it on paper seems like a fairly clear choice, I am really just struggling to accept it fully. 

Help? Thanks for your time.",16Dec2020,1
862,"My name is Justin. I'm 14 years old and I'm feeling really conflicted right now.

I want to be an artist. I'm pretty young right now but I have this strong drive to pursue my dream of becoming a fulltime artist--to get paid to do what I love. Yeah, I know, it's a really far dream of grinding and challenges but it's something that I really want to do, and I don't think starting early is that much of a bad thing.

The problem is school. I'm only in Gr. 9 and I'm already getting overwhelmed. I don't like that. I don't like that I'm working for school and, even with my full effort, getting basically nothing out of it. School isn't helping me improve my drawing skills. It's just an annoying idiot at the side, screaming to a megaphone to pace up and finish the marathon quicker. The teachers there are always nagging at me to do my work, to get good grades, so that one day I can be looked at as ""successful"" in their terms of being ""successful"". I get it--they're just doing their job, I know. 

I push my decency to do my work, but how can I when I'm not enjoying it all? I hate that all my energy is being sucked to do what the school wants me to do, and I hate that when I come home, I still need to put my energy into shit that I don't want to do. When I do have free time and I've finally escaped all the school work, I'm left feeling so exhausted that 1) I just take out my phone, scroll through YouTube, and waste my time, or 2) I take my pencil, draw, and cry out of frustration.

The day ends and it repeats. 

I want to pursue my dream, but school is in the way. I want to become an artist. I love the feeling of grinding, that feeling of progress showing after all the hours you've put into your art. But I don't have that much time for myself after all of it has been sucked by school, to spend a satisfying day grinding to get better. And the only way I can clear a path to take some time off from school is if I miss a day or just don't bother with the work, and when that happens, I just feel so guilty and let down that I end up feeling too stressed to draw. The teachers will start bugging me and my stress level starts getting higher. When I do my school work, they will still bug me that I didn't do a single shit right.

I hate letting people down. My parents have worked hard to move us to a different country just so a comfortable school can be fitted in my normal lifestyle, and when I take that for granted, I feel absolutely awful. And I don't think that after all they've done to get us here that they will just start getting fond of the idea of me taking school for granted just so I can spend more time drawing. I feel so conflicted right now.  

Every hour that passes and I'm not putting my energy into drawing, I feel like a full shell of shame and frustration, and on the other side, every minute that passes and I still haven't finished my school work, I just feel so guilty that I'm taking my parents' work down a hill and afraid that the teachers will start getting annoyed or disliking of me not doing shit.

I don't know what the hell I've put myself into. I honestly don't know that much about posting in reddit. I'm sorry if this was too long or annoying or repetitive. Please, if you could, share some advice? I'm feeling really stressed right now and I'd really appreciate it. Thank you!",16Dec2020,2
864,"I'm going to try and kind of bullet point the main stuff so this doesn't get so long. 

Background: 

• I was sexually abused when I was 10-12 by my grandfather. It started the day before my grandmothers (his wife's) funeral. Nobody noticed because they thought it was grief. 

• I had multiple other traumas from 11-19. Including my mom getting cancer and attempting suicide because she had a cardiac arrest during treatment. My step father at the time came and got me to ""deal with it"" and went to watch TV as I forced my mom to throw up pills and call and ambulance. 

• I also had a bad school experiance where one of my teachers tried to sabotage me. I was bullied anyways for being different by kids and some teachers. She told other teachers I was under performing in math (I got a D grade in math then the next test she marked it as a 0 unmarked. I got A grades everywhere else. But it almost kicked me out of triple science and made it so I would only get C grade maximum on my actual final tests for GCSE's. 

• When I got to 19 I started gaining a bunch of weight and went to therapy. When everyone else was becoming an adult and going to college I was just trying not to have panic attacks. I got diagnosed with  (Complex)-PTSD, Anxiety, and depression. 

• My mom and I had money problems all along because we don't have family support. She's a single parent. I needed to get a job that pays well. So I faked having a bachelors in Business. I got a job in sales Ops with a large company and I did well at it. I left because we moved countries back to my home town. 

• Since I left the pandemic hit. I have been working online but mainly considering what I want to do. 

I'm lost and I have lost alot of connection with that I like. The pills I'm on for my depression make me feel really flat so I dont get excited or feel super passionate about anything. 

I feel like I'm staring down a tunnel where it's my make or break moment but I don't know how to unstick myself before the train of time and life hits me. 

How do I get back in touch with myself and find my passion and job that I feel really excited about?

Now he opts to just throw them out there with a working title or description but is upset people are still giving him advice.

Instead, he's opting to ignore them on the social media platform but complain to me when we hang out.

 He's become a textbook example of an Askhole but he of course only got angrier when I got short with him after 6+ straight minutes of playing around his feelings to explain it normally and used the term since he would understand it.

Whenever I tried to follow any sort of restrictive diet, she seems to interpret this as me wanting her to be cook dinner for me differently and gets upset at me for it. This wouldn’t be a problem for me if she would compromise and let me cook my own meals. However, she *insists* she cook dinner unless we get takeout that night and every time I actually manage to cook my own dinner, it at least feels like she is annoyed that I’m not eating her food and by the “mistakes” I make while cooking (read: me cooking not just like her). And since she tends to monopolize the food shopping, it’s difficult to coordinate getting the foods I would like to cook in the fridge and freezer without either asking her to go get it (making her feel put upon) or me just going to get it myself (to which she reacts with confusion since she “was just at the store.”) She will also buy sweets like ice cream for me *even if I told her not to* and will cook dinner for me anyways and include half a loaf of bread on the table as a side. It’s not only difficult for me to reject these foods because my brain gets high on those carbs, I get told I’m “weird” or “no fun” if I don’t eat what she gives me. She doesn’t even help with portion sizes (which she swears is the real trick to losing weight) since she loves giving us as much as we can stomach. She’s also super discouraging whenever I talk about dieting by saying that “You better keep those big pants because you’ll just get fat again anyways,” and shit like that. Basically, she’s a controlling asshole that says I need to be skinny but doesn’t like the lifestyle changes I’ve made (and will have to maintain) for me to do that.

Anybody have advice on how I could stick to my guns in this scenario? I especially find it hard not to give into my cravings even when it’s just a pint of ice cream in the same house as me, and my mom is something else, and seems to want me to stay fatter than her or something. I know that I could probably attrition her into letting me eat the way I want if I bring in my own food and just refuse to break my diet, but that means never slipping up for months at a time since any break I have will encourage her to push harder (speaking from past experience). 

Tl;dr: Cut out sugar and carbs because of addiction problems; how do I keep my mom from making me relapse?",16Dec2020,1
874,"I recently had another bicycle stolen :(

I bought a GPS device, I have hidden it in my new bike. I may also add a bluetooth Tile. I want to leave it out on the street chained up, with the intention of it being stolen, 'honeypotting' a bike thief. I would alert the police to the bike thief's home via gps location.

I will add that it is more of a 'trojan horse' lol as I want to find any bike thief's house with many other stolen bikes, preferably my expensive one that was just stolen.

I don't really know how to help right now, and I certainly don't want to stress her out more. Literally, anything will help. I'm not exactly useful for comforting, so I really don't know what to do.

877,"My mother and I (F) have always had a rocky relationship and I am now living overseas. She has had a series of strokes and now only has 25% of her brain functioning. Whilst I hated my mother, i don't feel that I can hold the severely unwell person that is blind and in a wheelchair responsible for my feelings. She has always been terrified of hospitals and will never stay overnight alone after having her spleen removed without appropriate pain relief and ignored by nurses and doctors as being dramatic. As my sister was her full time carer for the last 10 years she has been with her to reassure her and make sure she was comfortable with all precedures. Fast forward to covid times and another stroke requiring hospitalisation and a resulting bleed on the brain. She can no longer speak, only cry. My sister is escorted from the hospital and my mother is screaming in fear not understanding why she is being abandoned. Two weeks have passed without being able to see or speak to my mum. My sister was called earlier today to tell her that 5 days ago she was incapable of swallowing and was struggling to breathe. Feeding tubes and breathing apparatus was forced down her throat. In a moment of panic she ripped them out and has caused severe trauma and cannot currently breathe on her own. This has also resulted in several infections (and my mother has had an artificial immune system since her spleen removal). We are distraught at the thought of what she is going through, the fear, pain, confusion, and all alone. Today she tested positive for covid. 

How do I cope with this? I find I cannot think of anything else and I can only sob. I accepted long ago that my mother would die. But alone and in pain like this I cannot handle. As my husband tries to distract me I feel tremendous guilt for even enjoying the little things like a hug or a book. Look at me enjoying life whilst she is trapped and terrified and alone.

879,"Hi everyone, I really need advice because my family aren't doing anything for him. I'm so sorry that this post is long. 

My younger brother has been feeling depressed for the past two years. Last year was really bad for him, he attempted suicide and had self harmed. After that incident, he started going to counselling. 
This year, he stopped going to counselling because he says it didn't help. My parents also think he's fine now so they stopped bringing him. 
The thing is, I know he isn't okay. He still has breakdowns, and cries in his room, and gets angry easily. Once he bought alcohol and started drinking alone until he threw up. My parents claimed he is just in his ""rebellious teenage phase"", but I see this as a extreme cry for help and attention. After that incident, my parents were able to have a heart to heart with him and he has been communicating better with us whenever he is upset.
Most recently, he broke up with an online girlfriend and got into a fight with his closest friend group because they were being ""toxic"" towards him. He says he wants new friends and he doesn't know what to do with his life. A knife in our house went missing, and I instantly knew he took it. Although he declined, we later found it hidden in his room. He said that he forgot to put it back after using it, which I knew was a lie. 
We had a talk again and he says he feels hopeless and wants his girlfriend back but she doesn't want to be with him anymore. He also said he feels like he messed up everything with his friends and his girlfriend.
I comforted him for a bit, but I know he is still feeling sad and lost. I told my parents that he should go back to counselling because he needs someone licensed to give him advice and just to have another person to talk to. They told me that going to counselling won't solve anything and they don't want him to be on medication in case he becomes dependant on antidepressants.
For now, I introduced him to some of my friends, hoping he can find some enjoyment with them but I know he feels out of place. My brother is awkward and finds it difficult to make friends.

I don't know what I should do. I am trying my best to be there for him. I want to help him but I also have anxiety and this situation is taking a toll on me. I want him to get professional help because I find that our family might not be the best at comforting and engaging with him because they are still ignorant towards mental health illness. I am really anxious that something bad will happen and if I don't get him help, it will become worse in the future.",16Dec2020,4

While I was hooking up with all these men I developed a serious lying problem and lied so much I lost my friends and the girl I loved more than anything which made me want to have more sex, someone introduced me to e and I wasn’t addicted but I did anything for the pill. He made me do other more lightweight drugs but they never had the same effect.

890,"I'm early 20s and this is something I've been wondering -- how do you know when you're ready? I've been dreaming of the day I move out because I'm unhappy with my living situation and I've always wanted a place to come home to that makes me happy. I have an interview soon for a job about an hour away in an area I think I'd like to live in. I'd rather not drive there and back, especially since I'm still learning how to drive lol (or maybe I could for the first couple of months so I dont have to move right away? It's a M-F job tho so...it'd kinda suck lmao) so that means I'd have to move.

If I move, I wonder when I would be safe to see my family again during these times? When I move I'll be working outside the home and I'd be terrified to go see them and expose them to something (but I guess I'd have that same fear if I stayed home and worked in our city anyway). I know people do still visit their folks and I understand why -- I'm just too afraid to do it for some reason.

I'm so used to seeing my mom and sister everyday and even though I'm not happy with our living situation and need freedom, I've been bawling at the thought of not seeing them all the time anymore and I don't know how I'd adjust. It's not like we're always up under each other in a codependent way, but I still love them you know? Especially my sister. We kinda keep each other sane (considering the living situation) and I'm worried how she'd adjust as well--I think that's what worries me the most. Again, we're not always around each other 24/7 but we do like to hang out--randomly go into each others room for no reason, walk our dog together, go to the store, talk about school, hang out in the kitchen and laugh and talk while the other is cooking...just good sisterly stuff. I'll miss it. It makes me happy. I'm not worried about taking care of my physical needs at all (No student loans, start off making something in the 30's...not bad imo). And if we lived in a good area with a normal home dynamic then maybe I wouldn't feel like I want to move out but that's not the case right now.

And then with this pandemic going around, I feel even more hesitant -- you can catch COVID one day and be gone in a few weeks..but I guess its the same with anything else. Anyway, all these feelings make me feel like I'm not ready but I also wanna start my life on my own. What do you guys think? Am I being a big cry baby?????

BF (28) calls his mother mumma and it really weirds me out

My (28F) boyfriend (28) calls his mother mumma, in person and in texts. It’s not done in a jokey way, it is what he calls her normally. There is no cultural reason for it. His mum also refers to herself as mumma (ie she would text him saying “mumma tired” and he would reply with “oh poor mumma”). 

This has been an ongoing problem throughout the relationship as it weirds me out and creeps me out no end. 

He also randomly calls out “Mumma” for no reason when we’re at home (almost like a verbal tic) as well as Mary (where Mary is the name of his great aunt). 

I brought it up in front of 2 of his friends at the weekend because I’m getting so down and upset about it all but that just started 3 days of silent treatment from him for upsetting and embarrassing him. I probably shouldn’t have done that but what he does embarrasses and upsets me too. 

What should I do? I’m really at a loss! We own a home together and have been together for 5 years.

902,"I'm a 15Yo M and I was taken out of school at 6th grade for homeschooling, But after a year it became what is called 'unschooling' which is where kids pretty much just do whatever they want and learn the stuff they need to learn when they need to or want to learn it. And I hated it it. At first it was a kids dream, having summer break all the time, but after a bit of that, I obviously started to feel like I was wasting my life so I came to the conclusion that I wanted to go to highschool, and my mom said it'd be a  good time since it's about to hit the halfyear mark and that's usually when new kids enroll. So I decided to learn as much as I could (mainly math) to catch up during Christmas break, That way if I was able to join back after break, I'd maybe have somewhat of a chance. And so far, although I needed to go back on a few things, The math isn't as hard as I thought it'd be, I'm using a online schooling program to see how behind I am, and it seems so far that I'm decently up to par. I'll probably need to study some things when I get home sometimes in order to further catch up but I think I'd be able to at least get through. I would be ok with being put back a year, but I found out that some of my old friends are at the school I'd be going to, and if I was put back I'd also be put in the same school and grade as someone I really don't want to be near, That's a really selfish and dumb reason not to but that's why I'm wanting to go back to Highschool, and not into middle. If this doesn't work then I'll probably just go for a GED, but, I really want my social life back, And, I've been told that if I'm able to get a high school diploma over a GED I should, And, overall, I'd much prefer to go to school again.

903,"I posted my story to another sub but I need some advice on what to do next. For some reason, I was triggered yesterday and haven’t been able to stop thinking about something that happened to me (28F) 10 years ago.

I was traveling with my family and ended up staying out late this one night with my cousin. We went to the hotel pub to have a couple drinks and met a few other people. My cousin who is a few years older than me got pretty drunk and wandered up to his room at some point. I was having fun talking to a guy I’d met at the pub and we went up to his room. It was fine at first and I was interested, so we started having sex.

We had both been drinking and it was getting really late, so after a while I was getting tired and wanted to go back to the room I was sharing with my aunt. For the life of me, I can’t remember if I told this guy ‘no’ or ‘stop’ but I did tell him I was tired and needed to get back to my family. He told me I couldn’t leave and held me back so I couldn’t get dressed. I believe he also moved my room key out of reach or put it in a drawer. He was a lot bigger than me and I was scared for the first time that night and genuinely thought I might never leave that room. I continued to have sex with him/do what he wanted until he basically passed out and the sun was coming up. I was there for hours and so exhausted but I finally got out of the room safe.

To this day, I’ve always felt that I put myself in a dangerous situation with a drunk stranger, so anything that happened was warranted and basically my fault for being a stupid teenager. Now I just feel sick and anxious and I don’t know what to think. I don’t have a therapist right now and the wait for one with my provider is really long. Should I talk to my bf about this?

The comment was “rail me”. Now at the time I didn’t know her age really, nothing on her bio/ig bio and the comment was like a jokingly manner. After like a day or two of posting it, I deleted the comments, unliked all her videos and deleted my account out of panic. 

Now I’m wondering if I’m overreacting and I should consider this as one of those internet misunderstandings or should I be panicking if I get exposed for saying something like(my account didn’t have any personal info but I’m still worried)😕😕",16Dec2020,1
908,"I was hired as a criminal deputy clerk for district court on Monday, with ZERO experience, and three days in I am so beyond stressed out from the responsibilities. The sheer amount of information I'm trying to retain over an 8 hour period is just - not something I was expecting or prepared for. My boss is amazing and patient, and my coworkers are fantastic, but I feel totally out of my depth and I honestly question if maybe they made a mistake choosing me. 

I'm really trying to stay positive and remember that it won't be like this forever.

Really any tips or advice would be wonderful. Thank you all so much for reading this.",16Dec2020,1
909,"The only reason I'd be afraid of him would be because he said he'd slit the throat of anyone who hurts me. But even then, that tells me he cares too much about me to come after me. My family is scared that he, along with his gang, might come after me for stopping being friends with him. He said I'm his favorite friend and he'd do anything to help me. I shared the same sentiment. And still do. (I'm only not going to be friends with him anymore because my family wants me to stop but even then, if I thought it would hurt him, I wouldn't stop talking to him.) Should I be worried? Is their fear for me (and even themselves) logical?",16Dec2020,2

911,"As the title says.. My father came here from Europe and is a total douchbag. He is a deadbeat and left me and my brother I was 3 years old, because he wasn't ""ready to be a father""

I'm pretty sure his white card is illegal. He only got his green card by tricking my mom and immediately divorced her after.

He may be involved in a georgia murder of his friend Ashwin's father for a million dollar insurance policy in the mid 90s but I can't find anything about it online

If someone didn't deserve to be in the united states it is him. He came here and abused anything that came in his life

I haven't spoke to him for 6+ years",16Dec2020,2
