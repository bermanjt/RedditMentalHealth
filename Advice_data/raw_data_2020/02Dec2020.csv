1,"About a year ago a co-worker of mine passed away. I didn't really know him super well, and at the time  we weren't working together as I was away at college. When I was back for Christmas break I was hanging out with a a friend I had made through work and he told me what happened. 

Like, I said, I didn't know him well but he was pretty nice guy, unassuming, a bit strange but in a good way. The year and a half or so we worked together went without a lot of interaction. However, the few conversations we did have revolved around video games and music, the latter of which he had a keen interest in, and I came to find out he had been making music for years and even had a couple of EP's on a music sharing site. 

One day he handed a CD to a couple of us while we were at work and said that he would love if we listened to it but to make sure it got back to him because it was his only copy. We obliged and went outside to a car to listen.

I loved it. I don't know much about music but I think it's really good. In retrospect I feel bad, I really thought his music would be bad but I loved it so much and still listen to some of the tracks to this day, years later. The music itself is why I need advice.  

Every time I hear it I can't help but feel like it needs to be shared in some way. However I don't know if I should, or even how to go about it. 

He has his full name attached to both his EP's and it wouldn't be hard to find his public obituary, with his families names and the cities in which they live. This is where I have a personal problem. Putting his music out there, wherever it may be could draw unwanted attention to his family. As of right now the music is hidden away, me being the only listener as far as I know.

At the same time, he was a sad, anxious dude who didn't seem to have much going for him. he was homeless at the time of his death and the music he had made years prior and the newer stuff I had heard seemed to be a bright spot in his life. I want him to be remembered in some way and his music is the last vestige of his life. 

I want to clarify that I in no way want to sell or reproduce his music. I just want share the link to the music sharing site.

How do I go about sharing it in a safe and respectful way, If at all? Thanks in advance.",02Dec2020,1
2,"is it even worth helping my ''friend''? so I'm just about 17 ( in over a week ) and my friend is 18 shes a Jehovahs witness and I'm really openly queer and atheist. we only really speak at school since shes not allowed to have ''worldly'' friends aka non-JWS, and she's been a little rude to me saying she doesn't support my choice to be gay and such, transphobic, ableist. she likes to trigger my misophonia by purposely sniffling and gulping drinks, eating, I've told her about how those things make me feel and how much anxiety doing that gives me I've gotten panic attacks from her. another thing she almost made me cry the other day because she called my arm ''disgusting'' I have neurofibromatosis and I'm really self-conscious about it i have darker skin and tumours covering my arm. I'm kinda sticking around her even though my other much more progressive friends have told me to ditch her but she's in a really bad spot, her stepmoms really mean to her borderline abusive and her religion is by definition a cult.

4,"So basically me and my bf are planning on getting an apartment next year. He‚Äôd be paying for rent but I‚Äôd do everything else like grocery and phone/internet bills etc. I told him we should get a two bedroom apartment so when family visits they have a place to stay. He said he should get a computer room all to himself because he‚Äôs paying for rent. Which then led him to suggest when family comes they sleep in our bed and we sleep on an air mattress in the living room. I‚Äôm just not comfortable with the idea. He‚Äôd have other places to put his computer, the main reason he wants a whole room is vr. But I don‚Äôt feel that‚Äôs a good enough reason to give up the comfort in our own home if there‚Äôs a space for a guest bed.

7,"I (f) have had feelings for one of my closest friends (m) for almost five years. For three years, it was pining and yearning and being there to listen to him talk about all the people he had crushes on and being there for advice while feeling like a knife was twisting into me constantly. I didn‚Äôt want to say anything because the friendship was too precious to lose, until I exploded and came clean to him. 

Feelings were not returned. 

We still remained friends, very good friends (despite taking a little break.)

To this day we are still really good friends, blended seamlessly into how we used to be, and he has someone but I don‚Äôt think my feelings will ever go away for him. I am struggling because he is one of my best friends, but, I am also struggling just being around him. Most times, it is fine and I feel as though I can handle it, but when I slip? I slip and spiral. 

It has been five years of wanting and being friends and heartbreak.

I am someone who doesn‚Äôt fall easy. In about seven years, I have only liked one person, so that says something. Either I am indifferent or I go all in. I can‚Äôt even date others because... I compare. I know that is wrong, but I do. I set myself up for failure before it even begins.

I am thinking of taking another break, to cut my losses  and come to a place where I am good with being friends without expecting anything else. 

Do you think it is possible to be friends with someone you have feelings for or is that just doomed from the start?",02Dec2020,1

9,"Hello, 

To sum up a story my friend works for a company I‚Äôd also like to work for, I‚Äôve been at my current job 5 years in February and was originally planned that I would help create a position dealing with certain types of patients. This plan has been scrapped by my boss but my friend has always mentioned I should come work with her and I‚Äôve always loved the idea. 



Anyways; she messages me and lets me know her work is hiring and sends me the link (presumably her position as she‚Äôs being promoted in January) I applied right away on Wednesday, the employer messaged me back Thursday asking when I was free for a phone interview over the next few days, I happened to have been called into my current job and replied back to him Friday (under 24 hours)


I understand I may have messed up with my reply because my logic was I understand it‚Äôs a very busy season right now for all of us in the industry despite which ‚Äúbranch‚Äù you‚Äôre in and let him know I was free after X time on the weekend and free anytime this week after X time. 


In hindsight that was stupid on my part but to be quite  honest I work on call (most of us do) beside my regular hours so I always have a phone on me. 



Now it‚Äôs been a few days since Friday and I haven‚Äôt heard from the owner yet, I‚Äôm seriously interested in this job but not sure how to touch base again without a. Making it seem like he forgot ‚Äî he might just be busy 
B. Make it seem like I‚Äôm back tracking on my statement of being available all week 
C. Avoiding using my friend as a middle man, although she seems to think I didn‚Äôt mess up with my reply and confirms just like I‚Äôm swamped so are they 


Does anyone have suggestions on how to go about this? Thanks. 


Also: I know they have interviewed two other people but neither were a good fit so the position is still open.",02Dec2020,1

11,"So I (22F) had a coworker (19M) at the grocery store I used to work at who I could tell had a crush on me especially for the first 4-5 months that we worked together. Like I said, I knew he had a crush on me but I didn't feel the same way about him and had a bad experience dating someone younger than me before. I thought he was a chill guy that was somewhat my friend, at least a work friend.

When he still hard a crush on me from what I could tell, I got a boyfriend whom I'm still with over a year later and means the world to me. I can't believe I found someone so great. A couple months after this, it seemed my coworker's crush on me started to fade.

Months later around the time my coworker started working less and therefore me seeing him less, the thought of him would just pop into my head randomly. I didn't see his name or his face or anything, it was just the thought of him. Like I said, I never had feelings for him so I didn't know why this started happening. Now currently I haven't seen him for around 6 months because he stopped working at the store. This random popping into my head still happens and is worse at certain times more than others and it's so frustrating.

I also need to add that I once texted him something on snapchat him something that included that I knew he used to have a crush on me then he replied something nonchalant and unadded me from everything. This confused and surprised me as it basically meant I was losing a friend especially since he wasn't my coworker anymore. 

So I guess I just need some advice as to why the thought of my ex-coworker/friend randomly pops into my head when he is totally out of my life. I mean it when I say that I never had feelings for my ex-coworker/friend and that I truly love my boyfriend and want to get married to him. Please help.

13,"So there's lots of backstory and things I can say but I'm gonna ((try)) to keep it digestible.


I'm 17[M], my parents got divorced when I was 5-6, around 8 he stopped paying child support and left to M√©xico. I had taken trips to M√©xico every 2 years to see family and him, for my 16th birthday i moved M√©xico to get away from a really bad environment and to see my family there and all. 


At first everything was good, he helped me lose a lot of weight and we did lots of things together, but things have changed a lot. I'm 17 now, have been here for a year now and we get into fights pretty often. It usually starts from the smallest things and escalates pretty fast. I'd say there's actually a flowchart to our arguments lol.... Our fights have escalated to him taunting me to hit him and him pushing me or getting in my face. One of these instances started because I didn't put enough salt in the rice I made. So like I said, tinniest things.


So roughly I feel alone, i live in a country without friends, i have family but I'm not as close to them. Feeling like I can't be myself with my dad and that he thinks I'm just stupid and lazy. 


I've made applications for like 10 different jobs, I've walked to places like 3 miles away to ask about jobs because I didn't want to ask to use his car even though he has 3 (yes I have my license). I do the cooking, and clean the house, without ever complaining or asking for things. Like idk what else I can do honestly...

I try to do my own research, but the complexities of the various political ideologies and those who run for office just seems to be too much to actually understand.

20,"I have 5 hours to decide if I want to transfer or not. Please read my dilemma, sorry it's so long. I posted this on a different subreddit but I am panicking and really need some advice.

I am currently a first semester freshmen attending my local state school I got strong armed into attending both for financial reasons and familial pressures. I am paying literally zero to attend this school, but they don't have the majors I want. I am mechanical engineering, but I would have liked to double major with Biomedical or Aerospace engineering. My school has neither. A nearby private university has both and is praised for its ability to let students double major. Because of this I played with the idea of transferring all summer.

I started classes at my state school and I am miserable. I hate most things about that school (though I'm worried some of that distaste has to do with my feeling of being trapped there). I don't like the campus too much, a lot of the organizations and faculty feel a bit dysfunctional when I try to contact people, I am so unenthusiastic and unengaged in classes as I oscillate between falling behind due to a lack of motivation and feeling like my classes are too easy (even though saying that makes me sound like a jerk), too many people have the mentality of ""I went here because you're supposed to go to college after high school and I really just want a C average to get a degree and don't care"" which is disheartening because I was used to a friend group of try-hards who all loved school like me, my school isn't really as STEM heavy as I would want, a research position I was going to take got barred to me because labs got closed to undergraduate students, there are too many people who just want to drink and couldn't care less about school, and I just don't really click with a lot of people here. I know for a fact I would fit better at this other school and they do too as I got accepted for Spring 2021.

The catch is it is an expensive school. I am nervous to walk away from a full ride where I could do a full year co-op and still graduate on time by 2024 when I would be going $80k-100k into debt. This new school has so much more opportunity, though, and I could be making a better living because of the platforms that employers like to pick from as well as the increased hands on experience that engineering companies want out of college grads. The quality of education is ranked significantly higher than my current school but I'm also told that doesn't matter for undergrad because it's all virtually the same curriculum.

It is my dream school, but is so much money. The reason I'm so stressed about cost is that all of it is on me. It's not my parents or a relative helping out and there isn't a college fund for me except from what I've been saving throughout my life. I'm not saying this to complain or blame others, just providing perspective of my position. I personally am paying by myself. I might be happy those 4 years, but would going into debt make me unhappy post-graduation? I want to be able to buy a house and raise a family, and paying a few hundred a month for YEARS might hinder that. Should I stick it out for these 4 years at my state school and just grind through even though I'm unhappy for the sake of a secured financial stability in my future? My state school is the safe choice, but this one is the risk. There is more to gain but also more to lose and I'm not sure if it's quite worth it. I truly cannot decide after having this inner turmoil all month and now I have less than 5 hours to drop a deposit or reject my offer of admission.

When I open it it turned out to be a book about how to deal with add/adhd. I'm not open about this at all. I don't want his parents to know and my mom and some other family members also don't know. Just he and a few good friends. 

I felt hurt and ashamed and wasn't happy about the present and they kept asking what the book was about. I was upset mainly because he gave it in front of his party though he knows I'm private about this. Also a bit because it feels like o need to 'fix' myself. 

I can understand that he might thought it would help me or something. Now he wants to know what's going or that I don't lie the gift and if he needs to send it back.

I understand that this is not an extraordinary situation, but it‚Äôs been 5 months since she rejected me and I am starting to get worried, at first the situation went on as normal, there was denial, ignoring my feelings, this usually works as when a girl rejects me as the sadness usually wears off relatively quick, but I‚Äôve tried everything and I just don‚Äôt see the pain ending in any foreseeable future.

I‚Äôve tried everything to get her out of my mind; ignoring her, being her friend, trying to fall for another girl‚Ä¶ nothing, these things have somewhat made the pain phase out, but whenever I find myself talking with her, her laugh just brings me back to the crude reality. My friends have just told me to hook up with another girl, but right now there just isn‚Äôt another girl in the whole planet for me, and I don‚Äôt think it would be fair for the girl if I hooked up with her with absolutely no feelings, after having this conversation other friends have said that I should just say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and go after her again, but I do not think that is the answer, the second strike would probably just kill what‚Äôs left of our relationship, but even if she said yes at this point I‚Äôm not even trying to date her, I just want to get her out of my mind. 

After all this they‚Äôve all told me to let time do its thing, but I just can't bare it anymore, it‚Äôs the 100th night I‚Äôm staying up really late just hating myself and tripping over her and I hate it, I cannot go on living with my only expectation for a normal day being interacting with her in the slightest, which all hurts me in the long run, I cannot go on ‚Äúletting time do its thing‚Äù if every time I look at her we‚Äôre back at square 1, I need to be proactive about my problems, the thing is that I cannot do anything about it, there‚Äôs nothing left to try and I just don‚Äôt know where to go from here.

30,"I lost some weight earlier in the year (from 255-230). I‚Äôve been going through some major depression and anxiety throughout this year though. Along with that, I‚Äôve worked 3 different jobs since COVID. All those jobs were 60 hour a week factory jobs, so I ate whatever I wanted and just maintained my weight since the work was fairly strenuous. I got laid off from my job in August and haven‚Äôt been able to find one since other than some short stints at certain places. I‚Äôve been binging almost everyday, and I really haven‚Äôt found the willpower to slow down. Even when I feel disgusting and disgusted by myself, I still eat to cope with my problems. I‚Äôm 20m who lives with my parents for right now, and my mom keeps plenty of trigger foods in the house despite everyone being somewhat overweight. My parents honestly sort of encourage me to eat even when I‚Äôm trying to make healthier choices. I‚Äôve asked my mom to consider getting only healthier foods as it would be better for all of us, but it never lasts. At some point, she I guess she folds too and buys the chips, candy, etc. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not blaming my problems on her because ultimately I‚Äôm the only one who can fix me. This is just a factor that makes it so much easier to binge eat. 

I‚Äôve been scared to step on the scale lately, but I can feel the extra weight on me. Tonight I weighed 270, and it honestly hit me like a wall. I recognize I need to stop, but I don‚Äôt know how. Any advice helps.",02Dec2020,1
31,"Title says it all really. I‚Äôm 23M, and found out that someone I slept with 9 weeks ago has had a test, coming back positive, and I was the last person she had slept with before missing periods etc. 

She has already made the decision to get an abortion, and I‚Äôve offered my support best I can. 

I personally feel okay about the decision, as we are both going down lines of work that need our full attention, and having a child would make things pretty difficult.

I still feel insanely anxious about the whole thing, I feel like an idiot and guilty that it‚Äôs come to this. We were drunk and should have been more careful. What should I do? I know she probably feels 10 times worse but she doesn‚Äôt want to talk much about it understandably, I‚Äôm just terrified about this whole thing and could do with some advice on how to look at things a bit better.",02Dec2020,1
32,"Hey reddit,

So I agreed to look after my friend's cat for 3 months since she was pregnant, but it's been more than half a year already and she has already given birth and the cat is still with me. 

During this period I wasn't paid for cat-sitting, but she did pay for the cat's food and litter so that was fine until recently when I finally asked her when the cat is going back home, and she told me she doesn't want him anymore. 

Now I'm a broke college student who definitely cannot afford to keep this cat, since he is extremely picky and only eats the most expensive cat food. On top of that he is also quite needy/clingy and I won't have the time for him with my workload and internships next year. He's also poorly trained and it has been quite exhausting to take care of him. 

The problem is since my friend told me she doesn't want the cat anymore, she also hasn't been paying for his food and doesn't reply to my texts anymore. I can't continue buying him the food he usually eats as it costs almost 20% of my monthly income. I tried feeding him cheaper cat food but he just won't eat it. What should I do with this cat? 

TLDR: My friend doesn't want her cat anymore but I can't afford to keep him.",02Dec2020,1

39,"Bit of backstory: As of last year my mom (69F)  retired and thankfully before covid hit our state. 

Ever since then she's been in a funk since besides work and sometimes holidays, she never really goes out. The family stopped having get togethers  a long time ago as well.  

Since there's nowhere to go and nothing she wants to do she just watches TV or goes to the bathroom.  I (29F) never really minded since like her I don't really go out or much either since I don't have driver's license yet but I still try to bathe at least 3 or 4 days in the week.    

Lately though she's been starting to smell though I only truly smell it when she leaves the bathroom to use the toilet.  2 reasons she doesn't do it is because 1: Her weight and bad leg from when she fell in the snow a few Decembers ago.  She's worried because of these things she won't be able to get out the tub. My sister not to long ago when she still lived with us got her a type of long and endurable tub chair thing. It can hold up to 400 or 500 lbs. It been a while since I looked at the manual for it but I think it was around those numbers. She hasn't sat on it once since we got it. 

She isn't 400 lbs but still pretty close.  2nd reason is the awful tenants we have upstairs tend to use a lot of a water in the morning at times and she doesn't want to use it in case they've used up the hot water. Since she can honestly go in it at any time of day I really don't see the fear in this as much as her worry of using the chair. 

I honestly think her smell is getting worse and for the sake of her health and my nose I'd like her to at least attempt to do it.",02Dec2020,1

This whole subject really has me feeling down and kind of hating myself for it.",02Dec2020,1
42,"This is most likely going to be a fairly long post. I'll try to keep it as short as I can without missing anything. For context we are both 17 and im going to refer to her as ""C"". And I'm kinda writing this just to vent. 

So C and I have known each other since we where toddlers. We went to the same nursery and the same primary schools and we where just normal childhood friends who's family's where close. Towards the end of primary school (when we where around 11-12) C stopped coming to school completely. I didn't find out exactly why for years but it turned out that she attempted suicide. She was diagnosed with Phycosis, Depression and Bi polar which over time developed into Schizophrenia and a bunch of other things. 

Basically from then on she has been really isolated and missed out on everything a girl like her should get to experience because of her mental illness. She has tried to run away and commit suicide a few times each so she is under alot of supervision at all times. Her parents lock her door from the outside and she isn't allowed to leave her house without supervision. This might sound harsh and obviously it's not nice for C but she can't be left to make her own choices alot of the time. She can become very violent and has attacked strangers, she can become completely terrified and panicked very easily and no one trusts her not to hurt herself. 

Obviously I'm not a victim or anything here I want to make it clear that I don't feel that way. That doesn't mean that being there on and off for C over the last 6ish years have been hard. I have made mistakes and also been selfish so before I write this I'm well aware that I've done alot wrong. That's partly why I'm writing this out just to get it out there and so that moving forward I make no mistakes. 

After starting Secondary school i would see her a little bit when my family would visit her family and she was allways very excited to see me (not that I'm so great it was just because she was extremely lonely). One time i was asked by her mum if I could come and see her on my own and I did. Apparently what happened afterwards is that get and her family along with some kind of mental health professional, decided that I was basically a positive influence and that I could be trusted to be a friend to her and somone to help her feel more connected to the world. 

I would go and see her 2-3 times a week and we would just talk and hang out. The problem for me was her parents would allways want basically a summary of everything we talked about or did, and would even somtimes beforehand make me try and convince her to do stuff they wanted her to do. They also kind of implied that I should ignore her when she tried to turn things between us intamate or sexual. This for me over time became very difficult. For one I was and basically have allways been deeply in love with everything about her from looks to personality, and secondly she clearly felt the same about me. 

Things got to the point where I sat down with her parents and told them that there was a level of ""romantic"" tesion between us that was to awkward to ignore. I told them you can either give us both the freedom to do what we want together or I'll stop seeing her which I did. This was a really terrible thing for me to do to her looking back and after not seeing her for a few months she went missing for a few days. When she turned back up it turned out she'd met up with a guy she'd met online and they had sex (remember she was around 15 at this time). 

After this C was different she's never really talked to me much about it but basically the guy took full advantage of the fact the was young and mentally ill and was very rough with her like extremely. After that happened her parents got in contact with me again and asked if I'd start seeing her again and as I felt and do still feel responsible for her meeting that guy I said yes. 

By the time I started seeing her again I had a girlfriend but I didn't tell C about it as I knew she wouldn't like it. And at the same time my girlfriend hated that I was spending so much time with C. It had kind of become a joke at my high school that C was my ""side ting"" even though it was never the case. The day C found out I went to get house as normal and sat on her bed and waited for her to get out of the toilet when she came out she ran in and started attacking me. She really hurt me I ended up pinning her down and calling her parents in and going to the hospital with a scratched cornea. 

After that for about a year contact between us completely ended and I didn't hear from her or her family untill about half a year ago. I was asked to visit again and at first I said no, but was asked very nicely a second time and said yes. She was majorly apologetic for what happened and It didn't take long for us to get very close again. 

So here are my problems 

1)Her parents still are very majorly invasive
2)Her parents still want there to be nothing sexual going on between us (we have had sex a few times in secret) 
3)Her parents won let her leave the house with me 
4)She is very much at a breaking point with the above 3 issues and is very very low right now because of her lack of freedom
5)She really wants to come off of her medication but she isn't allowed by her parents
6) A few people have said that I should just leave this situation entirely and that I've allready done alot of damage do you guys agree? 

Awnsers for all these questions would be very much appreciated.

50,"Hi all, 

I hope this is an okay place to post this. I'm 22F and in the past 3 or so years, I've been hit on and asked out a lot at places like gas stations, walmart, market basket, and even once by the cashier at a mcdonald's drive through. I don't know about others, but I'm a very shy and soft spoken person so these situations are extremely uncomfortable for me. 

Tonight takes the cake however. I was small talking with the man (easily twice my age) in the checkout line of a grocery store and he even hinted that he had a SO. I literally thought it was just casual small talk and really don't think I was flirting at all. He'd forgotten his wallet in his car, so we ended up getting rung out around the same time, but he left before I did. 

He also didn't technically follow me to my car, but what happened was that he was driving past me when I was bringing my cart to the cart corral and was kinda staring at me as he drove past. I did a small wave, like the type of wave where you barely move you hand, just kinda turn and show your palm a little bc I didn't know what else to do. He then stops his car for a sec, but I keep on with my business and go back to my car and start it up. 

I then see him walking towards the car in my rearview and he walks up to the window. I roll it down a little bit and he said that I was really nice and he wanted to hang out to get to know each other. I paused because I didn't really know what to say, so in panic I just go ""um, in what regard? I have a boyfriend is all..."" I hate using that line but like, it's true I do have a boyfriend but I feel like people will think I'm shallow when I say that. Anyway he backed down after that and went back to his car, so at least he took the L well enough and didn't escalate. 

I sat in my car to make sure he wouldn't follow me, and drove home worried that any car behind me was following me. I've never been in a situation like that before and honestly I don't know if I handled it well. I feel sick and weird and creeped out. Don't know if I'm overreacting but I'm just really sketched out. 


I am a nice person, and I am trying hard to work on my social anxiety and try to small talk with people in the store or other times when I'm out in public, even when sometimes I normally wouldn't due to anxiety and stuff. I do that to try to get out of my comfort zone and work on my social skills (which I know for a fact I need to improve on). A lot of the times I do though, stuff like this happens. And this happens unprovoked too.

These situations make me very anxious and I panic trying to be as nice as possible because a) I feel bad enough letting people down and b) you never know who you're dealing with and if they'll escalate, especially because I live in an open carry state. 

I don't want to be restricted to only going shopping with my boyfriend, but I also don't want to be an ass to everyone I meet and just ignore everyone because they /might/ follow me to my fucking car. I don't want to become a statistic, but I also don't want to live my life in fear of going to a stupid grocery store or restrict my life because of how other people might react.

What do I do? How do I avoid this in the future? I'm low-key scared to go out to stores alone anymore, or even to the gas station because this stuff happens everywhere. I'm honestly not even super attractive and a little bit over weight and tonight, my face and neck were drenched in sweat and my hair looked greasy due to a leave in conditioner I tried and my glasses were all fogged up from my mask. But still I manage to attract unwanted attention. I'm at a loss and I'm stressed and scared and anxious.

54,"I currently have someone in my life who I have been friends with for close to 2 years. We have had our great times, but within the last 6 months I‚Äôve changed my life in many ways. I no longer smoke, drink, vape or involve myself in harmful activities which she still does. My other friends seem happy for me and think that it is fine, but she seems to be a bit threatened by my ability to change for the better so quickly. When I quit vaping she would constantly ask me if I wanted a hit in a mocking way. She would also put vapes up to my mouth to get me to hit them. 

She did this in a seemingly joking way so I didn‚Äôt really think too much of it then. Looking back, it‚Äôs probable that she didn‚Äôt like that I was quitting an addiction that she is unable to quit herself. When she could see that I was getting really serious about quitting, she said something like ‚Äúdo you want me to quit with you too‚Äù in a tone that suggested quitting is no big deal. She is still vaping 8 months later.

I have also noticed that she makes comments that she knows have the potential to hurt me. She will comment on things that are obvious insecurities for me in a somewhat joking way (probably so she can say it was a joke if confronted), but it‚Äôs obvious she means harm. I am not proud of it, but I have ‚Äòtested the waters‚Äô so to speak by poking  ‚Äòjokes‚Äô back at her when she insults me, and she does not take it well, just as I suspected.

She also has reminded me that I need her (I definitely do not) and has said that I would be ‚Äúpopping pills‚Äù with one of my old friends if I wasn‚Äôt with them (my friend group).

I constantly feel stupid, ugly, and scrutinized in her presence. She makes me feel this way by poking ‚Äòjokes‚Äô at me. The more visibly confident I am, the more she does it. 

Side note: holy shit as I‚Äôm writing this I‚Äôm realizing that I am 100% in the right if I choose to cut her off. Anyways,

She has talked shit about pretty much all of her/my friends. I know I‚Äôm not an exception.

Side note: holy shit as I‚Äôm writing this I‚Äôm realizing that I am 100% in the right if I choose to cut her off. Anyways,

Things are complicated because she is a part of my social circle and has even integrated her boyfriend into my main friend group. This means that if I cut her off it may turn into an ‚Äòit‚Äôs me or them‚Äô type of situation. She is also in a couple of my classes. If it wasn‚Äôt for these factors she would most likely be long gone.

I have always had trouble cutting people off. I kept both of my toxic ex girlfriends around because I was too much of a coward to cut them off. Now I‚Äôm facing a similar situation, the only difference is the relationship isn‚Äôt romantic.

I have someone who has been a friend to me for 2 years, and I feel that I should cut them off but things are complicated because shes involved in my social circle. She makes me feel stupid, ugly, and she criticized me all the time. What can I do?

I would love advice from anyone. Thank you :)",02Dec2020,1
55,"TW: Racism, cultural appropriation, self harm and emotional distress

For some context; I have CPTSD and a long history of self harm and being treated inhumanely by others. 

I‚Äôve been in a state of serious distress for the last hour or so. I did something really bad and realising that caused me to relapse and hurt myself. I had such a good record going, I hadn‚Äôt harmed myself in almost two months, but all good things need to end I guess. 

But because I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to physically hurt myself, I instead crushed myself emotionally and made myself cry to the point that I was trembling, dehydrated and could barely stand up. 

I did so by forcing myself to listen to this recording, designed for those with a hardcore humiliation kink. The voice on the recording kept repeating phrases like ‚Äúworthless pig‚Äù, ‚Äúfilthy creature‚Äù and things of that nature, basically designed to crush the listener‚Äôs ego and make them feel like absolute shit. I just forced myself to listen until I was bawling like an infant. 

But I feel like I deserved it. Especially after what I did that caused the relapse. I care deeply about fighting racism, supporting marginalised groups and showing solidarity. I‚Äôve recently become involved in the Indigenous Lives Matter movement and my fianc√©e is also Indigenous. She‚Äôs the only person I‚Äôve been able to form a strong emotional bond with, but that‚Äôs a different story.

Despite how much I care, I ended up doing something that proves I‚Äôm a complete hypocrite. I‚Äôm currently taking a degree in screenwriting and working on a script that‚Äôs one of my passion projects. The main character of which is Indigenous. And I just found out that this character, who is very dear to me (as are all of the characters I‚Äôve dreamed up over the years), isn‚Äôt positive representation and I don‚Äôt have the right to write him as such. 

I felt like a racist pig upon finding this out and that was why I forced myself to listen to that recording. My eyes are red and my throat is dry from so much sobbing. But I feel like I deserved that because of how horribly racist I‚Äôve turned out to be. 

I‚Äôm terrified of confessing to what I did because I‚Äôm scared that my baby will leave me. My OCs and my scripts are like my metaphorical children. I have no idea how to resolve this issue. I‚Äôm too scared to call a crisis hotline because I know they‚Äôll try and tell me it was an ‚Äúhonest mistake‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt matter. It doesn‚Äôt excuse what I did. I feel utterly filthy and disgusting. I‚Äôm disappointed with myself on so many levels and I can‚Äôt stop crying. 

My fianc√©e doesn‚Äôt know what I did but I know it‚Äôll break her heart if she finds out and she‚Äôll leave me. And I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to continue developing this project which was once my only reason to keep going during a dark time in my life. 

What on Earth am I going to do? I feel completely stuck and in an internal three way battle of anger, disappointment and shame. An incredibly stupid mistake could lose me the things I love the most in life; my fianc√©e and my passion project. Is there any way out of this?",02Dec2020,1

58,"I may have finally gotten kicked out

Honestly, it‚Äôs a good thing.

For the past few years I‚Äôve been living with my mother and attending school. My relationship with her has always been rocky. Essentially, she would start off acting nice and slowly become shittier until I‚Äôd kinda just break down, she‚Äôd then ‚Äúhelp‚Äù by doing nothing or making me take like +10 pills and vitamins and act like it was my fault I wasn‚Äôt magically better. She blamed technology for everything, denied I ever had depression or anxiety, and hated that most of my social interaction was online, awfully ironic considering she insisted the family move to an incredibly isolated city when I was young. It was the type of place on a dirt road where old people go to live out their golden years. There were also constant violations of my privacy, only some of which can be justified as parental concern, she‚Äôd always try to be looking at any notifications I got and seemed obsessed with whoever I was talking to, constantly asking questions and trying the people I interacted with despite me leaving for college in under a year. In recent years, I became more aware of this pattern and became progressively more unhappy, we would fight what felt like every other night and I knew even if I stayed quiet, she would find a reason to yell at me. Then after some research and a lot of talking to my counselor, it came to light that she showed many signs of being a covert narcissist, as well as covert incest (parent looking to child for emotional support normally provided by another adult). Just today, while talking to said councilor, she was apparently eavesdropping and heard me talking about how I felt. In response to this, she came into my room and told me I would have to move in with my dad like it was a punishment. Ironically, I have been begging for this for the past 3 or 4 years. Despite this being what I wanted, it being so sudden is certainty stressful.

TLDR Psycho mother eavesdropped on private counseling, wants me to move soon. Need advice on how to move.

But enough ranting I‚Äôm looking for advice on A) How to move a computer safely B) How to get accustomed to a new environment and routine C) How to accept that someone you thought was trying to help really wasn‚Äôt

59,"I just started my first year of college. Life isn‚Äôt too bad. I have friends, I‚Äôm not awkward with people, I meet girls and have fun. In high school I was always the nerdy best friend to the girls I had crushes on. I got friendzoned a ton and rejected often. I‚Äôm pretty different since the beginning of high school. I‚Äôm in good physical shape, take hygiene seriously, make sure I look my best before leaving the house whether it‚Äôs fashion or hair or anything else that could reflect who I am as a person. A couple times since I got here I found someone I connected with and when I was willing to make it more than just being friends or friends with benefits I got turned down. Is what it is. Since then I just kind of keep it light. Casual hookups only I guess. I do end up feeling lonely though. I don‚Äôt feel like I can open up to anyone. Be it friends from here, or from back home, I don‚Äôt feel like I can be open about it. My relationship with family is rocky at best and they aren‚Äôt great about this kind of stuff. I want to find someone I can be open with. I used to wear my heart on my sleeve but nowadays I feel like I can‚Äôt really be open about my thoughts and feelings with any potential candidate for romance until I 120% trust them, which I never really do. I really want to be open but don‚Äôt feel like I can go through being hurt and vulnerable again. I feel expendable with girls honestly. I‚Äôm not bad with them but I‚Äôm not a Casanova. But as soon as there‚Äôs a better option I‚Äôm tossed to the side. I try to have conversations that‚Äôll help kinda grow a bond or a connection but it always dies off when it‚Äôs their turn to respond. I don‚Äôt really feel happy getting with them either. It‚Äôs a little dopamine fix to hold me over. I‚Äôm not asking for a soulmate. I‚Äôd like a relationship honestly. I don‚Äôt know anyone I‚Äôd like to have one with at the moment and don‚Äôt know where to meet them but I just feel lonely. I don‚Äôt have friends I‚Äôm confident enough to be open with back home nor here. My family aren‚Äôt an option when it comes to being emotionally vulnerable. I just end up feeling alone and not in the way where no one likes me, but in a way where all these people I‚Äôm associated with, but none who can truly be there for me.

65,"I really need help and opinions, please...

I just got married this past year to the most amazing person I could ever imagine.  He is perfect in every way.  However, everyone has their baggage.  His happens to be his family. 

It‚Äôs just his mother and sister.  His father died when my husband was a teenager.  His sister is my age.  But both his mother and sister are the most helpless people I have ever heard of.  They are the kind of people who I absolutely hate.  They do next to nothing, can barely hold down jobs most of the time, drive 16 hours MONTHLY to spend literally all of their money on weed...  I can‚Äôt stand it.  And my husband has a heart that is way too big.

My husband and I share our money 100%.  We both work as much as we can at decently high paying jobs.  And a lot of our money goes toward paying their rent (another story - they were living with us for the longest time, and I FINALLY recently was able to convince my husband to kick them out - in addition to being lazy weed addicts, they are incredibly messy and have 3 very destructive cats), their food, their shoes, their meds, their doctor bills, literally ANYTHING they need. 

I keep telling my husband that he NEEDS to set down boundaries because they are obviously just taking advantage of him.  However, he is convinced that once we stop helping them, they will literally die.  They seriously starve themselves until we buy them food (and deliver it to them, and sometimes make it for them), they will do ANYTHING to get their weed EIGHT HOURS away, and they do not care at all.  They are ungrateful about everything that we do for them because it is never enough.  Anyway, we have tried not helping them for a few months, and it was disastrous.  They WILL NOT help themselves. 

The way I was raised, I thought all adults grew up and wanted to be independent.  I have a hatred for people who think that they deserve everything for doing nothing.  My husband just called me, very upset about this situation, and I have nothing new to tell him.  I can‚Äôt feel bad for his mother and sister because they don‚Äôt even try.  And they are masters at manipulating and guilt tripping him - they‚Äôve had years of practice, since way before I was in the picture.  I know my husband would never forgive himself if we stop helping them and they consequently die, and I‚Äôm sure that that is exactly what would happen. 

I know this makes me sound like a terrible person, but this has been going on for YEARS, and I‚Äôm over it.  I‚Äôm just lost on what to do.  There has to be SOMETHING that we can do to get out of this awful situation that is dragging us down mentally, physically, emotionally, and financially.  We will never be able to move on with our lives and start a family while we are still taking care of them.

Recently, I have been diagnosed with distress, anxiety and depression due to the shift from classroom set up to work from home. Im currently having therapy sessions and I can say it greatly benefits me.  This shift on work set-up took a toll on my mental health along with other factors since I still live with my parents and was not able to move out when I got work due to financial reasons and me supporting my siblings in their academics. My SO broke up with me and has not talked to me since the break up. This is my first relationship in my 20-plus years of existence and I'm having a difficult time letting go. 

And just today, one of my siblings tested positive for Covid and will be sent to an isolation facility in a shortwhile. During the interview, it was found out that most probably, he caught the virus in his work as he still comes to site everyday.

77,"My (20f) boyfriend (21m) streams on Twitch in his spare time, an activity which i wholeheartedly support because I know how happy it makes him. I always host and share his streams, and try to take part as much as he wants me to and make it as easy as I possibly can for him, because he also works and doesn‚Äôt always have time to juggle them both. 

Today he wanted to stream the Fornite Live Event, but it was very last minute and we were busy when we figured out it would start in only an hour. So while he finished what he was doing, I set up his stream for him. The entire time he was streaming, I was there, making comments in the back like I usually do and cracking jokes. He says he likes when I participate on stream, so I try to be present.

After the event was over, the screen was stuck on the countdown timer for the new season at midnight, and we weren‚Äôt sure whether it would stay like that or if our console was just being wonky, so he closed out the app and reopened it. However, before he closed it he turned off the camera for the stream. I was confused, and asked him why he turned off the camera just to reopen the app. He got super upset with me and didn‚Äôt speak to me even after he ended his stream. I apologized at the time but was confused as to why he was so upset about me asking the question.

I approached him after the stream was over asking what the issue was, as it didn‚Äôt seem like something to be giving me the cold shoulder over. He told me he was upset with me because I‚Äôm always questioning him, and if he does something, he does it for a reason. His reason was, he didn‚Äôt want anyone to see our homepage, because our friends also have accounts on our console, and their nicknames are visible. He says it‚Äôs a privacy issue. Furthermore, he just feels like the question was unecessary, and like i outed him on purpose. However, there are no pictures and the only thing that can be seen are their Miis and nicknames, and I just asked the question as it popped in my mind because I genuinely didn‚Äôt understand why he was just hiding our homepage. 

I told him I didn‚Äôt understand why he was so upset with me, and he said he should be allowed to be upset with me for doing something he didn‚Äôt want me to do on his stream. This isn‚Äôt his first time being rude to me on stream for doing something small. Another example would be when he was streaming BOTW, but he had work in about an hour and hadn‚Äôt begun to get ready for it. All I asked is if he was keeping an eye on the clock, and he got mad at me for asking while he was live. (He wasn‚Äôt checking the clock, and thanked me for asking after the fact.)

I feel bad for making him upset and doing something he didn‚Äôt like on his stream because his channel is something he treasures, but at the same time i feel like all of this is blown out of proportion. For a while he ignored me, leaving rooms i entered without a glance. I want to understand where he‚Äôs coming from, I just don‚Äôt understand why he got this mad. 

I tried to discuss it with him and he doubled down. He doesn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs overreacting because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a big deal to him‚Äù, and he‚Äôs hurt that I don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs angry. To him I outed him and embarrassed him, and it wasn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs business so why did I ask? He ended the conversation by conceding, but he‚Äôs still obviously upset.

which i did and i‚Äôve tried my best to help her which i think i‚Äôve done an okay job at but it makes me feel shit as i feel like i‚Äôm not doing enough to help her and if she did do anything very bad i would feel the guilt that i never helped her out to the full extent. however she‚Äôs still not okay but i try my best, but i would also assume i‚Äôm the main person she talks to about all that stuff.

that leads me to this point where i have no clue what to do as i don‚Äôt wanna leave her  but i don‚Äôt wanna keep us talking going for longer, for it to eventually end and upset her even more. and i also don‚Äôt wanna tell her all how i feel and carry on speaking to her as ‚Äúfriends‚Äù because no one wants that.

i‚Äôm assuming i‚Äôve probably fucked up a lot here but idk i‚Äôm just looking for some help so say anything you want idm",02Dec2020,1

I‚Äôm REALLY not used to guys being that way but I will say I‚Äôm pretty inexperienced as far as dating and relationships. I guess in a way he intimidated me plus from the beginning I didn‚Äôt think I was good enough for him.

Texting was great, we had great interactions but eventually he wanted to meet up again and I‚Äôd make excuses. I felt guilty because I wanted to go on more dates with him but I felt insecure.

88,"I was in pre-school, 2004/2005 I believe, when I met this guy. I'm not good at remembering stuff but I remember he was one of my best friends. He was one of those cool guys that everyone wants to be like but he was also super nice and he had a nerd/geek side, he loved videogames, trading card games and comics and his parents were kinda rich so he had plenty consoles, the classic ones back then.

We were in the same class in pre-school, then in the first 3 years of regular school. On 4th grade he switched to a private school because his parents were not satisfied with our teacher, I and pretty much everyone else thought she was great but his parents for some reason thought she wasn't enough, I don't remember his grades very well but I believe he had reasonable grades but I and all of our other friends always had +90% on pretty much all tests so they probably felt like he absolutely needed to have the same grades.

During summer vacations between 4th and 5th grade I would go to his house every Wednesday, we would play some videogames and stuff. I don't remember if I met his neighbor then or before that but he had this neighbor who was the same age as we were (he's important to the story).

When we were to go to 5th grade I went to a school and my friend was supposed to go to that same school, at least his older brother had been there I think and he wanted to go there, but then his parents wanted him to go to another school.

Back then I was a super childish and sensitive kid, when he switched schools in 4th grade it hurt me a lot and now he wasn't going to be there in my new school, in fact many other friends weren't going there either but he was the one that I cared the most. We had our ups and downs because he liked to ""test"" his friends sometimes by pretending he was mad at them, typical kids play, but he was still a really close person and I miss those days.

5th grade starts. I stopped talking to him. 

1- Because smartphones weren't a thing, and even phones were not in everyone's pocket especially in the pocket of a child so I had no way to talk to him except by asking my mom to call his mother; 

2- Because it hurt me to get separated from him, so in order to forget the pain I would avoid the situation, it became a barrier and it still happens today, when I'm separated from a friend I stop talking to him, fortunately there was two exceptions so I'm happy to say I have two great friends today;

3- I'm very socially awkward, I easily make friends here and there, nearly everyone likes me, but I find it so hard to communicate with people, I get super anxious when I have to start a conversation or when I have to keep the conversation alive especially when it's a difficult or uncommon situation like this one, okay I could call him but what would I say? What would we talk about? We are not on the same school anymore, why would he care about my school? 

His neighbor however was on my school. We would always say ""Hi"" and stuff but I was never very fond of him. And then there was this day where he told me that he had been to my friends birthday party, which I wasn't. That was the last time I ever heard of him and it hurt me as well, why didn't he invite me? Was he mad at me? Didn't he care about me anymore?

Many years have passed, almost a decade, for the most part I have forgotten about him, I live my daily life very casually but occasionally I remember and I ask myself what happened, where did those years go? When everything was so simple.

In those rare occasions when I remember him, I did once or twice look up his profile online and I found his Facebook, I had sent a request but it has been years since I sent the request and nothing, his profile picture is very old, when he was younger, 10-14years old I would say, it seemed like a dead profile, but things changed today.

Whereas before I could only find one profile now I found more and they all have the same name and birthdate, one of those was updated on April 2019. I don't know if he's still active in that account but it's a possibility. I have so much to share with him, I moved to the UK 2 months ago, I have a girlfriend, I have some interests he might be into as well like memes, especially since his profile picture on this last account is the dankmemes subreddit picture.

I wanted to really reconnect and be friends with him again but I'm really anxious about it, I don't know if I should sent him a message or not, I get super anxious about it.

TLDR: Spent almost a decade apart from a friend. Wish I could reconnect with him but I don't know if I'm capable, I get really anxious",02Dec2020,1

I guess I was really happy when we instantly clicked for the first time. However, I found out he was into some bad stuff not going into details but lets just say his life was really fucked up. Anyways, he dips on me and I don't hear from him until beginning of last week.  Again,I feel that spark but I felt like it was too early to confess to him although I have a bad habit of making it painfully obvious when I like someone. I knew he knew I liked him but y'know it was just too early to say anything but I genuinely thought he liked me too; he was saying I was pretty and apparently did tell my best friend he liked me. Then this Sunday he goes and tells her he got a girlfriend. Like?? What?.. So I didn't wanna be a homewrecker or seem like I was flirting with some guy so I decided to leave the girl alone and left the chat I was in with him. Next day I get a message from him saying he missed talking to me and broke up with her and that he didn't know why he got with her because he really wasn't that interested in her. I felt bad because they broke up because of me but at the same time I really wanted to keep talking to him. (Also for those who are saying why couldn't we just stay friends is that girls tend to not like their boyfriends hanging out with some girl who likes them for obvious reasons) We talked and I thought everything was good.

It‚Äôs all coming down on me

I decided to go to a music festival and I was supposed to go with my buddy let‚Äôs call him John, and I invited my friends ex who lived right next to the festival and told her to bring her friends. So my buddies ex let‚Äôs call her Jane and I bought our tickets. Our friends who were supposed to come with us bailed last second. So I drove to her moms house to sleep over the night before the festival so we can get there early. We went to Applebee‚Äôs and just fucking hit it off, (and I‚Äôve always been into this chick). We were flirting non stop and when we got to her house we fooled around and went to bed. Next day We go to the festival and buy a bunch of beer and sneak it in. We get tipsy and we are completely all over each other. We ended up fucking in the tent and it was surreal. So you can tell how the rest of the festival played out. Fucking like rabbits rolling face and what not. Needless to say we both agreed by the last day that it was the best time of our entire lives and we just had that connection. After the festival she went to Costa Rica for 2 weeks right before the covid shut down. And we facetimes 5 times a day couldn‚Äôt get enough of each other. The day she landed she drove 4 hours to my place and stayed at my house for 2 months after. She was late on her period and we suspected she was pregnant. (She is pro life) and you know it‚Äôs her choice so I told her that I‚Äôll be here for her and the child and that I loved her. And she told me she loved me too. She didn‚Äôt want me to tell anyone she might be pregnant. But I told my boss she might be because he has 2 kids and we are very close I just needed advice I was so stressed. And he invited me and her over one night and I told Jane not to accept a drink if he offered her one. And she immediately called me out and said did you tell him? I said no at first and she said don‚Äôt lie to me, so I told her I did but for the right reason to get advice on what to do. She freaked out hung up on me and ignored me and drove home by the time I got back home. She texted me a few days later came back and said that she shouldn‚Äôt live with me and that she should just visit because she needs that time to miss me and what not. I agreed and said that‚Äôs fine! We went to the beach a few days later I was drinking a few beers and I asked her what she thinks my flaws are? She replied ‚ÄúI just think you‚Äôve done too many drugs‚Äù I agreed, she then asked the same question (now I‚Äôm a very honest person and she has had quite a hard life) I told her she‚Äôs insecure and has anger issues and cares too much of what other people think. But I assured her I love her for her and that everyone has problems. After I told her she immediately started crying and ran off. I found her and she ignored me until we got home. Packed her stuff and left. Texted me a few days later breaking up with me saying she can‚Äôt be with me right now, then asks me ‚Äúdoes this mean you‚Äôre going to fuck other girls?‚Äù I assured her no I was not that I only loved her. So months go by she still comes over and I go over and we still fool around and have sex. I was confused on what she wanted with me and it was driving me crazy because I‚Äôm still so in love with her. So she was supposed to come over on my birthday and we were supposed to go out of town together. But it really didn‚Äôt seem that important to her. So I said forget it don‚Äôt worry about it. And started being very cold to her because I could tell that she just didn‚Äôt care. We were supposed to move in together in august so we can take care of the baby, but I was declined the apartment because I made too much $ (I guess it was low income housing) anyways I‚Äôm glad that didn‚Äôt happen now. I told her beforehand to come live at my condo but she refused and said she didn‚Äôt want to leave her family and said she would be miserable. Now after months of being cold to her and being extremely depressed not knowing who the fuck I am or what the fuck is going to happen. I decided to be nice to her again for the babies sake. I don‚Äôt have a college degree I haven‚Äôt been working that much due to depression, my mom is going to help me but my dad is so unsupportive. Jane lives 3 hours away and her dad who she lives with now hates me. So when the baby is born I‚Äôll be able to stay there for a couple of weeks but I‚Äôll have to go back and forth because he doesn‚Äôt want me living there. It‚Äôs just such a stressful situation and I‚Äôm looked at like the bad guy even though I was willing to do everything for her and the baby. And I showed it, but I felt used and I felt hurt. So I needed my own space. Life isn‚Äôt fair and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to do it. I signed up for college online and will to do my best. I pray that everything will be okay with my and Jane so we can be co parents. But I am so broken and weak right now. I know this will just be lost in the thread but I needed to just talk about it.

98,"I (18,M) have been friends with this guy (18,M) for 3 years in high school. We're on the same friend group so it was easy to bond. I was there when he was having problems but I can't say for sure that he was there for me because if I vent to him, he just says XD or something like that. We got separated just before the end of high school because of a fight between him and his girlfriend. I tried to help them to fix it because they are both my friends but my best friend just ignored me. The pandemic came and we never talked again. I was so sad because I lost someone valuable to me but if he can just throw away our friendship just like that then maybe it was better that he left my life.  
But then just before college, I talked to him because in our friend group chat he was having trouble enrolling in universities. So I helped him enroll in mine. Eventually, our friendship came back and we talk almost every day because we are classmates now. But he still doesn't appreciate me after all the things that I had done for him like helping him buy a new laptop and homeworks. I don't expect him to give me something special. I just want him to say that he appreciate me as his best friend. I even asked him what was I to him and he said that all of us in our friend group was his best friend. I know it's fine to have lots of bestfriends but I was there for him a lot. I want to be appreciated just like the way I appreciate him being there for me as my friend.

112,"Hi all, 

Just trying to get some advice from those of you who have had experiences living  in a sharehouse with an ensuite and a sharehouse using a shared bathroom.

My big question is: is it worth the extra bucks to get your own ensuite. On average, I'll be paying between $30-$50 a week extra just for an ensuite. Alot of places im looking at are really nice places that are quite reasonable in price, but they have a shared bathroom. 

On the other hand, really nice places with an ensuite are straight up out of my price range. Rooms with an ensuite that are quite nice are lesser quality houses, but they match the ensuite and price criteria. 

Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you!

113,"Hi everyone,

So as stated I have an older female coworker who actually just moved on to another job. I have always seen her like a ‚Äúwork-mom‚Äù and she would at times say that she saw me as a son because I‚Äôm near her son‚Äôs age. I‚Äôm 27 and she is about 50. Over the past year that we worked together her family went through a lot. Her spouse survived a major surgery but when the outlook was bleak, she would come to work and cry it out, and we‚Äôd reassure her that we supported her. Anyway, he survived and through that we all became close.

Fast forward, she‚Äôs moved on to another job but we still keep in touch. She takes me out to coffee, we‚Äôll talk and usually when we meet she‚Äôll have a gift (a jacket, a shirt, jeans) which I assume she just wants to get rid of. I‚Äôve met her husband numerous times. She loves giving me things and buying me food. She‚Äôs even given me furniture. She always asks how I‚Äôm doing, etc. 

Lately, she‚Äôs reached out to me more than the other coworkers I guess to check on me. She‚Äôll tell me that she checks on everybody but she feels compelled to text me separately. She told me that we are friends and that I can reach out to her anytime. Sometimes she‚Äôll text me at late to show me pictures of random things that she does around the house and have casual conversation. I pretty much see her as a nice coworker, but she‚Äôs so inviting to me and I don‚Äôt know, maybe it‚Äôs because she just likes my company. 

I know it sounds very innocent, so this is probably laughable, but I don‚Äôt want it to appear at all salacious to my girlfriend. By the way I always tell my girlfriend when this person reaches out. I‚Äôve been groomed by older women coworkers in the past and put in compromising positions. Is this one of those times I should be careful? She seems like such a sweet lady.

I tackled him to try to help him. My friend walked away with a bloody nose and he was so destroyed it was the last straw for him. He was utterly embarrassed by the whole thing.

Okay, so as the title states my friend is turning 21 in December and we planned a little something (under 8ppl) to celebrate. Only my friends don‚Äôt know (or maybe they do know) that I have a problem with alcohol. I‚Äôve never dissected it and looked at myself hard enough to see it before this pandemic but as someone who has had their stomach pumped 2 times and only 19 I feel it‚Äôs something to talk about and take notice of. The friends Im planning this party with said they want to get wasted and I was like ‚Äúuhmm yeah not me, I‚Äôm going to drink probably 2-3 shots or sip on some wine for the night‚Äù and they just laughed it off saying ‚Äúbro it‚Äôs going to be my birthday‚Äù and it sort of made me mad that they wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge the fact I was trying to tell them I have a problem. I talked to the one who‚Äôs birthday is coming up the last time I had my stomach pumped that maybe I have to take a look at myself and figure out why I get blacked out drunk every time I drink but I guess he forgot or doesn‚Äôt care about it anymore. Here my thing, if they want to get blacked out they can but I‚Äôm not going to tag along and be around that because I‚Äôm easily tempted. They even said we‚Äôre going to do drinking games and everybody knows those always turn out with someone getting too drunk. 
Now where I need advice is, how does someone go about telling their friends that they are being inconsiderate right now and although we‚Äôve been planning this party since the beginning of high school that I won‚Äôt be showing up because I‚Äôm easily tempted without sounding like I‚Äôm the one being inconsiderate because ‚Äúit‚Äôs his birthday‚Äù. any advice is welcomed.",02Dec2020,1
117,"Four years ago I met some people on xbox through mutual friends. About 2 years later they aquired my adress because of one of my friends stupidly told them. They have sent pizzas to my house and always made jokes about coming to my house. There have been times when they made unsettling jokes saying they would come to my house and do something bad, dont really want to say because it was quite morbid things. I am open to dark humor and I understand their humor but the things they said just unsettled me. After I asked them to stop making these jokes and they continued, I blocked them both and didn't have any communication for almost a year. This summer, I started playing xbox again and my friend convinced me to unblock them and they apologized and they never mentioned anything about coming to my house. As we became more familiar with each other again, they started talking about wanting to hang out and come to my house again. I have expressed that I do not want to hang out or have them come to my house, but they do not care at all. I stopped talking to them and stopped playing xbox around July, though we have continued streaks on snap chat. Today, I sent one of them a meme that relates to an old inside joke we had, and he said it was funny and we didnt really say anything more. About an hour ago now he called me and said that he and our other friend are coming to my house next weekend, to which I told him not to and asked why. They said we have known each other for years and he wants to meet me, but I have no interest in meeting them or pursuing a friendship anymore. The only reason we still text sometimes or snap each other is because I really do not have many other friends and I feel like I am clinging to old connections because it is all I have had for years. I don't want them to come to my house because I am worried about what their intentions are. I cant prevent them coming because they will come regardless of what I say. I dont want to hurt their feelings but I genuinly dont think of them as friends anymore and I am somewhat afraid because of the morbid ""jokes"" they have said. What should I do in this situation? Should I get the police involved? I am just worried about the well being of my family and myself, I dont know what to do.",02Dec2020,1

126,"TL;DR: my teacher won't grade late work because it's been too long, parents don't think ADHD exists, and I might fail. What do I do?

Here's the situation. I'm almost certain I have ADHD and it has made staying on top of things extremely difficult, especially with online learning. In the past, I've had late assignments, but always managed to finish the semester with mostly A's and B's, maybe a few C's. This time though, I fell quite far behind with my late work.

My parents recently started getting really strict about my grades and forced me to work during the entire Thanksgiving break. It seriously helped and I got through more work than I ever have in my life, which I'm quite proud about, even if I did need help. The problem though, is that I just got a reply saying that my stuff for one subject, which I spent the most time catching up on (2 and a half days), won't be graded because the unit tests have already passed. That leaves me with a 55% in the class and one small, 9 point assignment that's still eligible.

We have less than 3 weeks left until break and I'm at a loss on what to do. I did do all the work, understood the material, and sent it in my original email, now it's just a single number on a stupid website that I need to go up, but my teacher won't put that in. I'm incredibly frustrated, partially at the class but mostly at myself. If only I knew what would happen now 2 months ago.

Here's what I'm thinking of doing:

I'm thinking of writing back and explaining, not to justify myself, but apologize and ask for a way to make up the points to hopefully go from a 55 to a 70. My parents generally help me with this sort of stuff (helped me take a D- to a B before, I should've learned my lesson), and are extremely supportive and understanding in every way except one, they don't think ADHD is real. I've done a bit of research and I've had nearly every symptom since childhood except that I did pretty well in school (learning is just as exciting as video games for me, it's doing the homework that I'm struggling with). I was thinking I'd tell my teacher about all of it, but I'm sure my parents would then see it and give me another lecture about how everyone has a little bit of it and they don't want the school to know about it or whatever. I'm also really worried my teacher will take it as an excuse to justify myself. I absolutely HATE making excuses for myself, and this is the one exception for me because of how much I've struggled and hated myself for it, but my teacher doesn't know that about me. On top of all this, they're on leave until January.

I go to one of those magnet schools with an entrance exam, but it's still a public school and has its flaws. I was put into this intervention group for people at risk and all they do is give us tips that would've been useful months ago, but doesn't help someone who has 3 weeks to raise their grade in an AP class.

Bit of background. I took over this room when I was around 11 or 12 (dont remember). The bedroom furniture I want to throw out and replace is my dresser and twin-size metal bed frame. These were hand-me-downs from my older brother who used to live in my room as a kid (he's now 32). Now that I have a job and can afford my own things, I ordered myself a new full bedframe and mattress. I also now have a double-tier clothing rack where I have ALL my clothes placed while my dresser is idle in my room.

I talked with my mom about wanting to get rid of the dresser and bed frame to make room for all the new furniture I bought for my room. She loves that I bought new furniture, but she doesn't want me to get rid of the old bed frame nor the dresser. She wants me to store them in the garage where it'll stay there. But the problem with that is that my garage is already filled with mountains of old stuff. I do feel bad because at the end of the day, these were items that my parents originally bought. This is my stuff, but it's not really ""my stuff.""

So I just wanted everyone's opinion on the issue and if it's reasonable to replace and not hold on any longer after 20+ years. I don't want to store it where it'll only end up in the garage to never be used again.",02Dec2020,1
136,"so this might be a long one because i do kind of need to unload. (also im on mobile sorry guys)

about 4 months ago i moved into a new place with a few roommates (roommate 1 = D, roommate 2 = M, roommate 3 = A)

D is the main renter, their parents are our landlords. D and M arent blood related, but are basically sisters and have grown up a long time together. they are very close. 
from move in, i noticed that M is very messy. like leaves food out for days at a time, leaves the kitchen sink literally full, overflowing with dishes, and always leaves lights on. i dont clean up after people, but i dont care about the messes. i get depression and falling behind on cleaning bc of it, but there is a clear double standard. 

everything was fine for a while, but more recently its fallen apart. D got very upset for a couple days because someone turned off the thermostat when they wanted it on. i told them that i had never touched it, and idk who did. all was good after that, thought it was over. then a few days later, its 20 degrees outside and im in a hoodie, sweatpants, socks, and was laying under my quilt shivering, so i turned the heat up to 65. later that day i go to work and get a very passive aggressive text in the roommate chat (without naming me directly mind you), calling me a liar over the thermostat and saying i quote ""there will be consequences"" if i alter the thermostat again. 

so i'm anxious, i send a response apologizing for altering the thermostat, but explaining my reasoning and asking that D come to me directly if they have any other issues with me. 

then someone eats some amount of D's food in the fridge, idk what it even was, but once again being passive aggressive towards me. 

fast forward a week, D, M, and A all leave for thanksgiving with family. i'm home alone and not seeing family for thanksgiving. they all know i'm gonna be drunk and alone for the holidays. so on thanksgiving i have 3 of my friends over to hang out and eat. one of my friends snapchats M and then my friend immediately gets a text from D asking how many people are at the house and whos there. and idk maybe this isnt a big deal, but i'm already very paranoid bc of mental illness, which is why i prefer super direct, open, communication. now those texts from D make me super paranoid, i just wanna run to my room and cry at that point, and i'm wondering why D couldn't have texted me.

also just to be clear, i'm 22, almost 23 and D turned 18 4 months ago. the being controlled and parented by someone almost 5 years younger than me...... wack. 

so everyone gets home from holiday. and M comes to talk to me the next day when i'm smoking out back. they ask if we're good. i tell them point plank that i am paranoid and uncomfortable by the hostility directed towards me, especially knowing that they were reporting to each other about me on their vacation. i still kinda defensive say ""we dont have to be friends, we just live here. we pay rent and move on"" now the energy in the house is super tense. no ones talking, i'm so uncomfortable. 

and THEN at work today my boss tells me that coworkers my SUBORDINATES are talking about our house drama bc D has been talking shit about me at WORK and to our mutual friends. i absolutely hated that shit. this has been going on for a while and i havent discussed it at work, with my roommates and my mutual friends, or even my closest personal friends. i have no desire to talk shit about anyone even tho i am super pissed by the way i get treated because i dont want any drama, any he said she said, if theres a problem i just like to fix it personally.

so thats basically the gist of my issues.

has anyone broken a lease early? i really want to leave. i recently had to go to my local crisis center to get my meds and a therapist back. i've been drinking, smoking, and popping pills nonstop, completely relapsing on my recovery. i'm bipolar and have ptsd. this living situation is making everything so much worse. i cant live here anymore and if anyone can just give me any advice i would be eternally grateful.",02Dec2020,1

The last time she tried to hurt herself she sent me a message letting me know and I was able to make sure she was safe. But now that I don‚Äôt know her address, how do I do that? Also, how do I help her through this? I want to let her know that i love her but I don‚Äôt know how to do that. I‚Äôve told her I love her but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs working anymore. She told me she‚Äôs not feeling super chatty right now. And I totally get that. But I just want to support her anyway I can.

145,"Met this guy on a dating app, we talked consistently (more so him reaching out to me constantly) for about 2 weeks before meeting. Our conversations did turn sexual at points- and it became apparent that we both hoped for a hookup after our dinner. Our date was this past Sunday, he took to me dinner and I wound up staying over after for a night cap. In my opinion- I think the date went well. We watched movies, fooled around, cuddled. He seemed very physically attracted to me and there was a lot of things we did that I wouldn't consider normal for the first ""hookup"" (let me add he practices a more dominant role in the bedroom and I have never been with someone like that before but I felt like I did a great job at keeping up and satisfying if I do say so myself). Next morning we said our goodbyes and he left me with a kiss and a ""see you again?"".

Now It's Tuesday, and I've barely heard from him... I can tell between our texts the energy from his end isn't there anymore. He went from consistently talking and texting me, now he barely texts me every 7-8 hours although I notice him on social media. I never expected this to go a certain way, and we both made it clear we still had things going on (him not being over his ex and me just getting out of a relationship in may ect.) I just feel more insecure and worried if I did something during the date to change his ""want"" for me. I guess once you get the thing you've been working for, there's no need to play the game. Since I noticed he isn't really as interested, I backed off immediately. I don't want to come off as annoying or feel any more embarrassed than I already do. I guess my question is, could it be I gave it up too soon? Maybe I didnt exceed his expectations. I wish he would just message me and say he's not interested instead of letting me off but slowly dropping me. It's torture.",02Dec2020,1

155,"Hello Reddit, this is my first post on here.

Earlier this year my family and I (f25) discovered my dad (m54) has developed a severe drug addiction. After almost a year of change in behaviour and constant disappearing and change in appearance. I discovered he was doing meth and had been for (at while atleast 3yrs). He is now unpredictable, jittery and aggressive. We have since tried to support him which has only resulted in my underperformance at work and dismissal, my sisters deferring her university year and my brother almost failing the last year of his mathematics degree. I don‚Äôt know how my mum is continuing to operate and work with all that we are enduring and I applaud her for it.

Anyway fast forward to now, we have made the decision to not accept him back into our home because we do not feel safe and do not want to be around someone who is making no active changes to their addiction despite claiming to. 

2weeks ago he came and collected his things. Surprisingly he was calm, made a speech about how he hasn‚Äôt always been a lame dad etc (which is a lie) and how we will never see him again (another lie). We are financially in ruins from him, our lives have all been turned upside down and our mental states are in pieces.

Since collecting his things he has bombarded us with constant messages and calls, going from one extreme to the other I.e. him begging us for another chance then him wishing the worst on us. He says things like you will all get what‚Äôs coming to you and you will all regret this. Now he has decided to make me the target of his abuse and threats. He randomly comes and parks outside our building or circles it. 

My mum and siblings and I have all blocked him off our phones now because the harassment became too much. He came to our home a week ago saying he had made the decision to change and we said that we were pleased and asked what plan he has to enforce this decision. He had none. I made it clear that he needs professional help and that‚Äôs the only way we are willing to help him. He refused to accept this and the chat ended up with him throwing and smashing things around, claiming this to be his house (technically not) and if we want to leave we can, my sister having a panic attack and my brother having a bloody fist from punching walls and hitting himself due to anger and being distraught. He then begged us to forgive him and left. 

The next day, similar situation but him threatening to contact my in-laws (who don‚Äôt know about any of this) and me breaking down. 

He has now somehow come to the conclusion that I am the reason our house is cursed. I am the reason he is ruined. I am the one who is to blame. I really don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôve never brought problems to our home. I‚Äôve graduated and managed to secure an goof job (that I‚Äôve mow lost) and became engaged in the last yr. There isn‚Äôt a single bad word that can be said of my character and accomplishments. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I am the oldest and was the one who has taken the main responsibility to support him or vocalised our disapproval of what he is doing but I am now in the firing line of his abuse. 

He has been leaving voicemails to my entire family calling me a witch and saying that I am the reason for all this misfortune.

I‚Äôm afraid to leave the house as he continues to circle it daily and I constantly check the windows and door. I am scared of how unpredictable and impulsive he is. He also has a past of violence toward us. I also believe he has undiagnosed bi-polar.

What should I do? The threats aren‚Äôt a as severe as ‚ÄúI will kill you‚Äù but nonetheless I am equally afraid for my life at this point.

What can my family do? Is there a point in notifying the police if he hasn‚Äôt physically done anything and the threats aren‚Äôt clear cut? 

Please help. I would really appreciate it.",02Dec2020,1
156,"So a month ago I dropped off my resume at a coffee shop and was asked to interview there. Less than a week after I was hired, and then shortly after I had to quarantine. I was brought in for a few days of non-extensive training after that, and then this past weekend was scheduled to work my first day at one of their different locations for one of their busiest days of the year. Sure, I asked a few questions and was unsure about a few things. I figured this was normal, I worked that day with one of the managers, the one who had hired me, and it happens to be her first month of working there under the shop owner (the owner by the way has a reputation for being bipolar and firing for unfair reasons). I thought that everything went well, but the following day in the middle of my shift that manager pulled me into the back room and aggressively fired me with no explanation.

162,"This year I'm unbelievably exhausted. I just feel so tired, drained and numb almost constantly. It's really starting to heavily affect my life. I can just barely convince myself to get up in the morning.

This quad-mester (I have 2 classes a day. I go to school for one class for 4 hours then, come home and do the other class for an hour and a half) I'm really starting to fall behind. My law teacher assigns homework pretty much every single day and I haven't even started on the chapters we're suppose to do. My tech teacher only assigned 5 assignments I can easily knock out in a day but, I'm stressed about my law class so I keep putting it off. My marks are dropping so much. I never got a 33% on something till now. It'd be funny because I just so happened to somehow get honor roll this year though, I'm far too upset to laugh at that rn. I didn't really deserve to get honor roll tbh, I wish it went to someone who did.

My classmates aren't the best either. I had an acquaintance in tech but I can't really talk to them since they're seat is too far away. My only two friends are online so I don't have anyone to really talk to or help me figure out my work. To rub salt in the wound, all my classmates in both classes are friends with each other and they don't really like me much. I don't mean to be upset that they have friends but, it's just frustrating, you know?

I apologize for the small rant. How do I find the motivation to do my work? I started to put on music that helps you relax and focus but that isn't really working much.

I decided to look in his forgotten email and saw a lot of emails from dating sites such as POF ZOOSK and back door personals. Back door personals is described as secret online dating.

175,"Earlier today, 2 of my friends (M12 &amp; F13) and I (F13) were standing outside of school, waiting for acting practice to begin. 

For context, I live in a very small Christian/Conservative town in the Texas Hill Country. I take the pandemic VERY seriously, as my brother (8) is high risk (asthma.)

The boy, who we will call Greg, exclaimed out of nowhere ""Oh, we are outside! I can take off my mask now!"" After that, he took off his mask, coughed on me, then put it back up. I got really upset, then said things like ""That's disgusting!"" His spit got on my face. (The part that wasn't covered up with the mask.)

Right after that, we went to acting practice. In between 2 of the runs, I told Greg to talk to me after practice ended. I used my firmest tone possible when saying this.

After practice ended, I told him to go over there where nobody would hear us. He refused, so I started talking in front of everyone. Nobody really paid attention, including him. I explained that my brother was high risk, and that if he caught it he could potentially die.

 In response, Greg said ""Well I had it in January, so I don't have it.""

I was dumbfounded. I didn't even know how to respond. After that, I just asked for him to apologize. He refused.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, every Wednesday, I go to a youth group that is hosted at his house. I don't really want to go this week, and I don't really want to talk with him at all until he apologizes. I have a habit of holding grudges, but I feel like this is a bit justified.

Over the past few days, he's been mean to me plenty of times. (For context, he is almost 6 feet tall, while I am barely 5 feet.)

Yesterday, in math, I was trying to get back to my desk, and he was blocking me. I got pretty upset, and he wouldn't stop after I asked him nicely.

Right before the coughing incident occurred, I was talking to him and one of my other friends (the girl from the coughing story) and I said was telling a story about how I got locked in a room once. ""I was pretty much pushing my entire body weight to open up the door."" 

He and the girl said something that made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable about that, and I kindly asked them to stop. The girl stopped, but Greg wouldn't.

He was being super nice up until Monday, and I don't really know why he started acting like this. I don't want to go to youth group tomorrow for that specific reason, and I don't really want to associate with him anymore, even though I sit next to him in almost every class.

184,"Hi. Title. I really want to go to medical school now. A couple months ago I had an awakening and realized it wasn‚Äôt too late for me to change careers. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know how hype I was when I realized medical schools don‚Äôt care (and some favor) if you‚Äôre a music major. It is so exciting to me! Problem is, music is basically my identity. It‚Äôs how people refer to me. Whenever people meet me they‚Äôre like, oh it‚Äôs the music girl how‚Äôs your music? You play how many instruments again? I guess it‚Äôs not just other people too. I also don‚Äôt know if I can unmarry myself from the expectation that I be a musician because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always been. It was the only thing that made me special for 10+ years. It‚Äôs the only positive thing people noticed about me (except my best friends of course and family). Typing this out I feel like it‚Äôs such a stupid thing to be worried about. I also hav a full scholarship for music . I have to find some way to tell my professor of my instrument too.. she told me my freshman year I‚Äôd be a world leader of the instrument some day. I‚Äôve always been grateful for her mentorship but I can‚Äôt help but feel I‚Äôm going to be letting her down. 

I think I‚Äôve really liked the attention that music has gotten me but I think the pandemic made me realize that it‚Äôs not for me. Now that everything‚Äôs at a standstill, I could take a breath and open my eyes. I love music, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right for me. Ok now I‚Äôm going to go into details my reasonings:

I don‚Äôt like the modern classical / academic world. (I was planning to become a professor)

I feel like an athlete (physically strenuous instrument) and my mind is bored.

I‚Äôm not fit to be an athlete. I have recently been diagnosed with a heart condition. Which explains why my wrists hurt so much so easily due to lack of circulation. Also I get light headed when I stand and play (which is expected). AND my muscles get tired easily (can‚Äôt play for long or practice as much as I want to)

Modern classical music is a circle jerk that is parasitic to society. This is me being dramatic but I genuinely think there‚Äôs too many classical musicians and too much classical music nonsense being written and performed. (Imagine that contemporary art piece of a banana taped to a wall but it‚Äôs music)

I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm doing what I‚Äôm best at. Because my body sucks, it‚Äôd be nice if I could still reach my potential that doesn‚Äôt require a powerful body. Also I feel like my brain is just rotting. Most of the time i practice I watch/listen to tv so I can get my brain stimulated. 

I could have a chance to change people‚Äôs lives for the better on a decently large scale AND ALSO DO WHAT IM GOOD AT. I genuinely think I could be a good doctor (empathetic, love all people (even trump supporters even tho I‚Äôm a minority gay democrat), detail oriented, decently smart)

Nobody ever told me to be a doctor. So I‚Äôm not begrudgingly (or greedily) going to be put in a position where  people‚Äôs lives are in my hands. My mom has been incredibly sick for 5 years now because of a doctors mismanagement of her condition. It was completely preventable. If her doctor (dermatologist)  took ANY time to care about her patients her profession, the research papers coming out with new findings, I‚Äôd still have my mom. Now she‚Äôs a shell of who she was. 

And while I mentioned in the last paragraph greediness in doctors.. I also want to be able to provide for my family. My mom wouldn‚Äôt buy a sleep apnea machine because she couldn‚Äôt afford it. I spend a decent amount of my time reading articles about health and longevity research, and that is NOT good for her health at all. It would be nice to have a job in which I could buy her and my other loved ones the health care they need instead of helplessly watching them deteriorate just because I selfishly become a saxophonist. I just.. I feel like I have to do this. I have to be able to provide for my loved ones and I want to try to make a positive dent in the profession that hurt my mom. Idk if I sound crazy or if I sound passionate. But I feel crazy that I would be leaving behind my ‚Äúidentity‚Äù but I feel passionate about potentially becoming a doctor.",02Dec2020,1
185,"It seems like everyone in my life just makes me more depressed than I already am. I just want real and genuine friends for once. All of my friends end up being really toxic, insensitive or gaslighters. I‚Äôm tired of it. These friendships shouldn‚Äôt leave me feeling mentally terrible. Instead these people leave me feeling like there‚Äôs something wrong with me instead of making me feel happy or energized. And it‚Äôs gotten so bad to the point where I‚Äôm convinced there is something wrong with me and that‚Äôs why no one wants to be my friend or that anyone genuinely likes me. 

Example: I was apart of a group chat and we became close quickly. They knew I struggled with depression and they told me to always come and talk to them whenever I feel depressed. Once I finally built up the courage to finally talk to them about it, they kick me out of the group chat and tell me that I‚Äôm manipulative, saying I‚Äôm trying to make them feel bad for me and how I‚Äôm using my mental health for my own gain and how they have it way worse when it comes to depression.

189,"(Backstory for context) 
My ex girlfriend and I dated for 10 years broke up 6 months ago she was still a really close friend of mine even after the break up. 

She remained in our group of friends because everyone considered her a friend too since she was with us for the past 10 years.
We're also still living together because of Rona, and the lease doesn't end til 8 months 

(Situation) 
Recently an old friend started hanging out with us again someone who the whole groups knowns since high school.
Last time my friends got together my ex girlfriend told me she asked him out because she liked him.

It hurt me a lot because he was a friend that's always been around, and it made me question if she ever had a thing for him when we were together, and now wanted to follow up with it.

I know it wasn't jealousy because she had been going on dates with other guys, and I was happy for her. It was just the fact she went after a friend in the group felt like a stab in the back.

I told her how it hurt me, and asked her if she understood that wasn't cool to go within the group.
She said she didn't realize it would be a problem since we were all good friends.

I talked to everyone in the group to ask how they felt, and they all said that it made them uncomfortable, and they all agreed they weren't okay with it either.

In the end I explained that it really hurt me because it made me believe our love wasn't real. Also the group wasn't happy with her because they agreed that wasn't cool so we had to kick both of them out of our group.

She started crying and saying she was going to cut it, and let it go that it wasn't worth losing her only friends.
It hurt more because she didn't apologize for hurting me when she hurt me the most 

It felt like she was only sorry about it because she was getting kicked out rather than taking into consideration how she hurt me.

I did feel sorry for her, and still comfort her because I still cared about her. I told her she had made a mistake we all do, and shouldn't hate herself for it she just needs to apologize, and make up for it. 

She didn't try do anything about it she just gave up, and accepted it. She still felt like what she did wasn't wrong, and never apologized. 

Later that ""friend"" told me that she had gone to him to apologize for getting him kicked out of the group. It hurt when he said that because this whole situation I'm just here suffering, and just need her to talk to me, and understand that it hurts, and I just need an apology.

I ended up going to her room told her off for not apologizing to me, and apologizing to that ""friend"" when what she did probably didn't hurt him he probably didn't even care.

I also told her how it hurt that I had do console her when I was the one suffering, and she was the one who fucked up. She played the victim, and made it about herself. So I kicked her out of the apartment.

Now I'm barley making rent, and my heart aches so much since. I know the truth is I still loved her and I always will. I miss her, and want to talk to her to apologize for yelling at her and kicking her out, but I think I should let her be, and not see her for a long time or ever.

I don't know if I should move or be mature about it still, and talk to her.",02Dec2020,1
190,"Hello friends, I am humbly asking for some advice. Any and all advice is welcome. I am going to organize this all for ease of access and a quick read. Please hear my plea, I appreciate all the suggestions and brainstorming no-matter what it is. I would like to keep the tone positive and fun so sit back and tackle this horrible grammatical mess on your own time.

**;TLDR**

Use talents below to comment a job/career that you think may be a great combination for an alternate line of work! :D 

**Basis**

I am tired of my current field of work but afraid to leave as I do not know what ship to jump on. I am looking for job/career where I am not just a number puncher and able to flex my creativity and artsy fartsy talents. My issue is that I am simply out of touch. I am 30 and don‚Äôt know what kind of creative jobs are out there and what is in demand. My dream job is to be a Concept artist, but I have no art degrees nor portfolio to dignify even applying. I have degrees in Construction project management and Architecture and engineering. I don't want to be filthy rich, I am looking for the whole, ""if you do what you **love,** it ain't working"" kind of thing. Am I too late? is this a bad time to try to change?

**Talents**

I can Illustrate quickly and at a high level (at least in my opinion), I am a natural at animation and editing video, I am a musician and am attempting to record music at home, have an engineer‚Äôs mind, I easily 3d model cool stuff on Autocad then 3d print it out. I picked up computer science quickly and have knack for precision. I have other talents but these are the only ones that are relevant.

**Conclusion**

I thank you for reading this, I will genuinely love all suggestions. Feel free to PM, I am lost and disconnected, especially now during the pandemic. I wish you good health and many thanks in advance.

191,"Just wanted opinions on a birthday gift idea for my wife's 40th. I'm really overthinking things here. And covid isn't making it easy either.

We were supposed to take a trip from Canada to NYC. That's always been on her list of things to do.  But travel isn't happening now, especially cross border. 

We have young 2 kids in school. And she's currently unemployed, So getting out ANYWHERE and talking to other adults is a bonus right now.

Anyways I want to promise her a NYC trip when travelling is ok again, but not sure when that will be.  So as far as immediate or tangible gifts go. I've purchased her a handprinted shirt from a screenprinter she really likes.  But I feel for 40th bday something else is required.

So is jewelry a good option? Necklace or something like a bracelet?  Or is a spa/massage day better? I haven't given her jewelry in a while, but know her parents have sent some earrings for her.

Spa/massage she may not want to do alone, and if I go with her it seems like I've given the gift to myself also. But would something specific like a hot stone massage be good? 

Overthinking this.
She's crafty. Sewing, pottery. Likes all things creative. Reading, supporting local, plants Scandinavian things, mountains.

194,"hey all,

not really sure where to start. earlier today we had to put down our family dog due to spinal cord issues. he was fairly young and is the first/only dog we have owned. he slept in my room almost every night, and was there for me every day, both when i woke up for school, and when i got back home. needless to say, the last twenty four hours or so (we first brought him into the animal hospital around 7pm last night, as of writing it is 11pm the next day) have been absolutely miserable.

i wanted to ask for some insight/advice on two things -- basically, i want some way to memorialize his life, and am asking for good ways to do so:

1) photo albums: i don't have any experience making any, but i am basically looking for something that is sturdy and will last for a long time. this would be like a small book/album for pictures of my dog. does anyone know any good places/companies that do this kind of thing? i've done some internet research and have found a few sites, but i'd like some more first-hand insight before i commit to a certain company. right now i'm eyeing shutterfly -- does anyone have any experience with them?

2) commissioned art: this i had a little bit of a harder time finding people for, but if possible, i'd like to commission some sort of artwork of my dog. i'm pretty open minded with regard to the type of commission, so anything from digital artists to painters works for me. i am willing to pay however much is charged, so money is not an issue. i figure that this subreddit is likely large enough that some people reading this might know some commissioned artists themselves -- can any of you recommend me a few?

200,"I had 2 friends. They are married. I've known the husband for 10 years, which is longer than his wife has known him. We did not always talk during the 10 years, we have gone years without talking actually. I have never been physically or emotionally attracted to him. I met his wife for the first time about 5 months ago now, like I said I was hardly talking to the husband, so I never got to formally meet her. We became friends fast, but within the past few months she has got the idea that I love her husband and want him and vice versa. She's also said she's jealous of me. 

She's made it hard for me to be friends with either of them, because she's admitted to being a controlling partner, so I'm almost sure she's told her husband he can't message me first or talk to me as much. When before I was talking to them both almost daily and since the incident a month ago, he never even replies to my messages and she's just honestly a bitch and a bad friend at this point. I deleted them both off of my snapchat, which is my ONLY social media. He reached out and asked why I removed him, of course she didn't ask, she's probably happy as fuck about it.

202,"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm posting here but this is a long shot and I am desperate for advice from anyone. 
Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I‚Äôm 24 years old and 20 weeks pregnant with my second son. My husband and I already have a son who was born in January of this year. 

Since May my health has been going to complete sh*t. I live in the U.K. where health care is free and every single hospital and doctors surgery has been overwhelmed by Covid so my issues have gone mainly unresolved and ignored. 

When I was 13 dad died of pancreatic cancer that was early onset. He was only 35. His father also died of again, early onset pancreatic cancer at 47. I also have an aunt who passed from this disease however she was in her 80s (grandpas sister)

I realised back in May my symptoms were very indicative of such a cancer but I was laughed at by doctors and told I was too young. One doctor did take me seriously and ordered a basic ultrasound and a few blood tests back in July but these were unremarkable. I had hoped this meant I was fine, but in the past month I have gotten sicker and sicker and I know it isn‚Äôt related to my new pregnancy. 

For one; I am jaundiced. As in I have literally turned yellow in the past 24 hours. I have back pain, left sided abdominal pain and indigestion too - all signs that point to it being pancreatic cancer. Both my father and grandpa also developed jaundice very quickly with the pains they had been experiencing. 
My main fear and the thing that has ripped my family apart largely. 
I am not asking anyone here to diagnose me as I already know what it is. 

I finally realised this morning (I am in the U.K. so it‚Äôs 4am) that I had to call my doctors surgery and see someone today. So I called an emergency helpline who told me I could see a doctor at 11am. The best they can do. It is not an option for me to go to the emergency room on account this is the U.K. we are talking about and I‚Äôll be sat waiting until beyond 11am to even see anyone. 

I know that as soon as the doc sees I‚Äôve turned yellow they will order urgent scans and blood tests. I will have to attend ALL of the alone due to covid. My husband will not be permitted to be with me. I am terrified. I don‚Äôt know how to cope. 

How can I prepare to hear such bad news alone? I almost feel I don‚Äôt even want to know I‚Äôve got cancer but I keep telling myself maybe if I do have cancer they can prolong my life by a month or so just so I can spend more time with my kid. If I sit at home and ignore it I‚Äôll likely just die at home and have no quality of life (like my grandpa did) 
My dad was diagnosed, given chemotherapy and managed to stay with us for 5 months. My mom was told he wouldn‚Äôt have had this time at all had the chemo not have been started. 

I know in my heart this is it and I‚Äôm only 24. What are the damn chances? I‚Äôve clearly been rolled a horrible dice. I won‚Äôt even be able to give birth to my second son on account my pregnancy is still considered ‚Äòearly‚Äô therefore I‚Äôll be taking him with me.

So I need some advice and guidance with a pretty niche subject. I want to be a substance abuse counselor. 

So as of right now, I have my BA in psych with my focus on addictions counseling (much of the program was focused on this, techniques, treatments, etc..) 

I'm also in recovery myself (recovering alcoholic) and have a good chunk of time (about two years) and this has always been something I'm passionate about. 

I guess my question is, now that I have the degree, what are my next steps? I've looked at job listings and should I apply for those, and then they help me become licensed? I've looked at license requirements and a lot require workplace experience before even taking the exam. 

I guess I'm just a little confused and wondering if anyone else is in the field and wouldn't mind pointing me in the right direction. I'll probably call a few places but not sure if they'll have the time or if they'll be able to help much? 

Some additional info: I'm in Massachusetts.

It's my fault my grades are bad, it's because I don't do the homework. For some reason I just can't bring myself to do it. My school offers zoom classes and in person classes and my mom is making me go in person even though I have expressed many times that I really don't want to. 

On top of the normal stress that come with school and approaching finals, I lost my two year old dog to cancer in October and he was genuinely the only reason I wanted to come home and visit when I go away to college but now he's gone and I feel like I've lost motivation to go away because now I don't have him to visit. 

I think part of my issue come from my grief that is still killing me inside, but on top of that I'm just tired all the time and extremely unmotivated. I don't want to do anything. Some days are better and I can talk to friends but others I just don't want to do anything. 

I just don't know what to do. I know the logical thing would be to see a therapist but I don't want to pour my heart out to a stranger, and I don't want to tell anyone I know.

217,"My birthdays coming up so my distant mother has recently messaged asking what I wanted for my birthday. This brought up a lot of feelings for a number of reasons. My mom hasn't been that good to me and my siblings over our lives. She's manipulative, and would emotionally/mentally abuse and gaslight us our entire lives. I know that it hurts her that she wasn't able to break the cycle of abuse/neglect in our family and she does love us, but still. Last year, a lot happened when it came to getting me a present for my birthday. Without going into detail, it really messed with me, so now I don't want her to get me anything this year. Because we're distant she isn't particularly aware of all the reasons I kind of want to create space between us and I'm so intensely afraid to be upfront and start a whole new family thing just over this simple birthday thing, because I know for a fact that something will happen if I'm honest about my feelings. 

So what should I do? Should I just be honest and say flat out ""I don't really want anything this year""? Should I just bite the bullet, face my anxiety, and just say like a gift card or something? What should I do? Any ideas would be appreciated.",02Dec2020,1
218,"I have not had a pretty childhood. It wasn't horrible, to be honest, it's been very stable(from the outside). From when I was in elementary school, my brother's gaming addiction started. It wouldn't have been as bad as it was if he kept his grades up, but he didn't, triggering my Asian parents into a frenzy. .  It was just gaming, but the whole concept was new to my parents and they feared he would turn into a ""failure"". So, this led to nightly fights. Looking back at it now, it was horrible for a child to have to listen to her brother and her parents fight nightly, police called every other night, getting physical, etc. And no one ever seemed to ask if I was ever okay with all of this. I would pray, beg to God for the fighting to stop; turn on my music on blast in attempts to tune their yelling out; or just cry while they would go at it until dawn. 

But one day, I woke up and I was in high school. My mom and dad got used to my brother's gaming. I grew scared of my dad's voice. I grew very foreign to my mom's touch. I don't even talk to my brother anymore(though we live in the same house). I got depressed, drank occasionally, couldn't keep up with school, everything was crashing down the more I realized my family was not the image I imagined it to be. I don't really know what my normal family looks like anymore, because it's only been about three years since the chaos stopped. My dad and mom questioned me one night: why I was crying every night, what was stressing me out. 

I couldn't explain anything, because it wasn't school that was stressing me out but I couldn't bare attending(although I did). I could never catch a break, I cried when I woke up before going to school because I was so tired and stressed. Cried during school(when no one was looking), and cried myself to sleep. My depression got so bad this January/February. And when I didn't have any answers for them, my parents, being typical Asians, told me that mental illnesses weren't a thing. That hurt me the most. and I almost tried to take my own life that night. 

I am fine now, but they also have such strict rules for me that no other kids can understand. My dad wants to restart our relationship, but I hate him so much I don't want to. But when I told him I wanted to thik about restarting, he lashed out and said something along the lines of ""that's fine. It's just my fate then. I'll just pay for your tuition, whatever and then once you move out we won't matter"". But that hurt me more: the thought of not having a relationship with my parents. But I hate my parents so much. I don't talk to them anymore(its been like this for a while). What do I do? Time is running out, I need to make up my mind to either restart and have hopefully a better relationship in the future or block them out entirely. It hurts because they were never there for me when I really needed them(emotionally, mentally). It seems like everyone in my family moved on, except me. I'm stuck being that fourth grader crying, praying for the chaos to stop; but now I'm a high schooler.",02Dec2020,1

I‚Äôm a high schooler that has always had significant issues with procrastination and self discipline in online learning, though I was already struggling before the pandemic. 

I tend to slack off and spend time on my phone or other electronics. I can go to great lengths to not do the due assignments. When an attempt is made to take my electronic devices I become physically aggressive and use extreme measures in order to prevent that from happening. Even if they‚Äôre taken away, I would sometimes still refuse to do it.

I have recognized this and wish to change this. Christmas break has started on my school and I‚Äôd like to take this free time as a period to improve on my flaws specially on self discipline, procrastination and physical health. The former being the most important in my opinion as it will help significantly with the others.

I would be interested in knowing what I could do to:

1 - Not become so dependent on electronic devices

2 - Improve self discipline.

3 - Stop wasting time.

Different games that I never knew they'd moved onto, all of them acting as if they were on the exact same page with one another... except me.

I really want to ask one of them a simple question: ""Do people not like playing games with me?"" But for some reason, the idea of that terrifies me. I'm scared that he'll tell me that, yes - they don't like to play with me because x, y, and z. *But even more than that,* I'm scared that he'll say no - nobody has a problem playing games with me, and that he's sorry I felt that way. I dread the thought of him messaging me later and saying, ""We're all going to play *x* game, wanna join us?"" I'd hate for me to ever become one of them *that way.* The one people invite because they'd feel bad if they forgot about him again. It'd feel like a consolation. An act of pity.

Okay so currently I‚Äôm in the military. I‚Äôm being medically separated from here. The first thing is that I feel like I‚Äôm the only person of my rank in the office. Like normal people have like 20-30 people around they regularly work around but in my job we only have an office of 15. Of those people only 3 are of my rank. The people I can joke and fuck with. One of said people is leaving very soon. So there‚Äôs that. 

Said person, dude quickly became my best friend. He‚Äôs getting separated as well, VERY quickly, faster than I ever thought. Tbh I thought I would go first but him going first kinda in a way bothers me? In that that‚Äôs one less person I can joke to but also the person I regularly hand out with is going away. Then there‚Äôs the other thing, it feels like every time someone in a friendship moves away they ALWAYS become well, not friends. I know for a fact the second he goes away well become strangers. Even then, we live about a hour from each other back in our home state but still, not like here where we can hang out. We‚Äôve joked about moving closer to each other but he has a life in LA and my hand is being forced to live in San Diego since the hospital is there and I need to be close to it. So again, the second one of us get out it‚Äôll be bye.

Lastly, it really feels like I have no purpose in life. Like I don‚Äôt have a plan. Or even ‚Äúwhat‚Äù I want to be, bit career wise but as a person. 

Okay so my plan has always been go back to college, get a house, get a job. Get a dog and that‚Äôs it. 

But like for example, I don‚Äôt want to marry, I don‚Äôt want kids. I don‚Äôt have a family, I have no one to care for (elderly parents/ kids/pets) like I LITERALLY have no purpose.

229,"So I am going to start off by saying this is one of the most weird fucked up situations I have ever been in. Its extremely embarrassing but need some anonymous help on what do to, throwaway for obvious reasons. 

So I am a teenage boy and as a teenage boy I tend to masturbate a lot. I always just do it in the toilet where I sit while I am doing it and once I am ready to finish I stand up and go into the bowl. I always put the seat up and do it near mindlessly now because I am disgusting. Recently I kinda did it pretty mindlessly because I had just gotten back from a place where I was unable to do it. Recently my mom used by toilet and I had some insane fear that some of my sperm might have gotten on the toilet seat and may have gotten to her. (I'm so fucking disgusted and mortified about this). 

Anyways later I look back after she used my toilet and noticed something kinda stained and dried on the front of the toilet seat (in front of where your junk is), I franticly picked it off and cleaned it without fully really examining what it was and I am not terrifed that it might have been sperm that I did not clean up or carelessly left there. Now it was about three hours between when I masturbated last and when my mom used the toilet, do you think there is any chance that she got it in her? Do I bring this up with her as a precaution? I am pretty sure I am just overthinking all of this because I read online that sperm dies when exposed to air and those who are 55+ have only 1% chance of pregnancy's. Its also really unlikely that the stuff on the front of the seat got anywhere near her junk. I am not even sure it was sperm but I do not know what else it could be. 

Ridiculous I know. But for whatever reason its stressing me out a lot. Any advice on the manner is helpful, I can give more context about the situation if needed and maybe I just need someone to tell me to relax because there is zero chance of anything bad happening from this.

I‚Äôve hit the breaking point to the level where I contemplated suicide and had to get a psychiatric evaluation, only to be diagnosed as severely depressed and am on daily antidepressants. Just this week, our dad has a stroke. Thankfully it was mild and he made it home in under a week. 

We have a very catholic family. Like we go to church every Sunday (virtually for now) and pray every night as a family before bed. With everything that has happened in the family I don‚Äôt understand how God can be real when he wants our family to suffer. I don‚Äôt believe in that ‚Äútest of faith‚Äù crap. How is God protecting us when he‚Äôs making us all hurt instead of heal? Well, I don‚Äôt need anyone telling me if I should be catholic still or not. I‚Äôm just not sure how I go about telling my parents how I‚Äôm feeling, since I feel like the daily prayer and weekly mass is pointless since I no longer think it will help anything.",02Dec2020,1
238,so yesterday my mom grabbed my phone and idk how she found a video of me vaping that was 2 years old i never vaped before and shes not even mad because it happened 2 years ago shes mad because i lied about my step dad leaving us alone at night but the reason i said that its because she told me to call her if he leaves us alone again so she can pick us up from his house/she just called my called him to tell him why she took my phone and he called me to tell me that he was gon whoop my ass when i go to his house again but yea just because i tried a vape because of curiosity.anyways before and after that i never touched it again and it was only for like 3 seconds.but yea i just wanted to know what u guys think of my situation and what can i do,02Dec2020,1

I haven‚Äôt seen him in 3 weeks but we both want us to work so we‚Äôre slowly getting back into things but i haven‚Äôt seen him yet, simply going with the flow and seeing what happens. When we first talked after the break we talked about Christmas and I said we don‚Äôt have to buy each other gifts since we‚Äôre both struggling with money, plus what if we don‚Äôt work out and we‚Äôre stuck with gifts for each other.  But then he joked around about gifts he wants so I figured we were doing gifts.

243,"I'm currently working on moving closer to my university and am touring apartments tomorrow. My current manager has been asking about my move date/job switch to plan accordingly and the people that I'm close with keep asking If I've gone job searching and telling me that I shouldn't move without having another job lined up.

So i said fuck it, and sent out a resume to about 15 places in the area. It's super early but I thought hey, I'll probably get a reply in about a week. I already have a job interview (within an hour of applying). It's also tomorrow. In the heat of the moment I told him yes because I'm off this day and will be in there area, but didn't even think about the possible caveats.

How do I tell him I don't live there yet?
Am I even ready to put my 2 weeks in at my current job?
Would I be willing to commute until I get my apartment (~1 hour away)?

So the rush and happiness of already having a job interview is gone and now I'm panicking. Especially since it's basically the job I have now, but with better pay. So I feel like I basically shot myself in the foot with applying so early for a job I actually want. Will they understand I still need time? Will I not get the job? What should I do?

TL;DR applied to a bunch of jobs in the area I have yet to move to, accepted an interview without thinking twice about it. Now I think I fucked up my chances.",02Dec2020,1

She likes to say she‚Äôs been telling me this is coming but she hasn‚Äôt. This was completely out of the blue for me. She had been telling me I need to change my major to something more ‚Äúcareer oriented‚Äù (she really doesn‚Äôt believe in what I want to be) and to get a better paying job (I‚Äôve been looking but there just isn‚Äôt anything in this small town) 

After telling me I have until New Years, she left to go have thanksgiving with the rest of our family (I had to stay bc I couldn‚Äôt get off work and if anything really need to stay at work (that didn‚Äôt stop her from begging me to come to thanksgiving tho))

246,"My employer is a piece of shit. I know that for sure, and I've been trying to get out. It was small things at first. I have always prided myself on my honesty. That's why I got my current job, which is facilitating audits of a facility. This is my only experience doing this job in this industry, so I have no frame of reference for how it's supposed to be.

It started as small stuff that I wasn't a fan of but could understand the reasoning behind. Like, ""well we won't give details on that unless the auditor asks."" Very lawyer-like behavior. They told me that's how the job works.

Then my boss told me that it was fine to check a box saying I had reviewed something, saying that ""well you did this other thing, which is basically the same thing."" I told her I wasn't comfortable, but she said that's what I had to do. I went above and beyond to make sure I eventually checked that box 100%, but initially I felt very sketchy about her reasoning. I started looking for new jobs a bit around that time but not fully committed.

Then the pandemic hit. Things went to hell at work. I started searching for new employment in earnest. I've applied to well over 100 jobs and had a few interviews, but no luck. In the meantime, my boss and her boss asked me to put together a report. The boss x2 gave me incorrect information. I took her at face value. I had no way to verify, but she told me it had to be done. I was an idiot for blindly trusting her. But it was too late. Turns out she gave me wrong info. I felt incompetent and like a liar. When I confirmed it was incorrect, I immediately went back and fixed it, but I still felt dishonest.

Then the bosses asked me to change a number on a report. I got pressured pretty hard about it. It realistically didn't change any actual outcomes. Either way, there was proof that the company had screwed up.  I didnt agree or disagree. Slept on it. Came back the next morning, and VERY nervously told my bosses that I wasn't comfortable changing anything because it wasn't correct. So they both went in and changed it themselves. I refused to sign off on it, but I also didn't speak up to HR or the customer that they had done it, or to the bosses that they shouldn't have done it. It was a losing battle.",02Dec2020,1

251,"  My brother attends the High school I attended and in my experience this place is the definition of sexual abuse culture in high school; boys constantly harassing young girls, teachers looking the other way, Our own damn principal protecting SEVERAL classmates who were rapists and oh so lovely dress codes. I kid you not there‚Äôs an expose of someone sexually assaulting or harassing someone every other month. 

When I was in this school I was touched inappropriately by a classmate which I didn‚Äôt bother telling my parents because I know they would find some twisted way to make me seem to be a villain and this disgusting pig to be the victim. So when seeing several young girls on my Instagram timeline tell their story of my own brother making them uncomfortable, slut shaming them, and catcalling them, I almost had a break down.

 As a grown woman I want to do right and believe me when I say my main concern are for these young teenage girls and their safety. I want to talk to him but I really don‚Äôt know what to say and I fear that he will run to my manipulative parents and somehow deflect the situation. So I ask everyone who is reading this what should I say? Is it my place to contact these girls on behalf of my brother?",02Dec2020,1
252,"This happened a few years ago. I had a huge crush on my older brother's best friend, he was actually one of my best friends too. One night he started hitting on me and I was super into it, after a few days of flirting we hooked up. I was VERY inexperienced and didn't really know what to expect, but it ended up being a pretty good night and I felt comfortable around him. I wanted to date him but he said he wasn't ready for a commitment and we should just keep hooking up and I was disappointed but agreed to it. 

Slowly but surely, he started doing things to me that I wasn't okay with, or hurting me. He always seemed so apologetic that I let it go, but it eventually got worse. When I got angry or upset with him (rightfully so) he would gaslight me to the point that I just started doubting myself and thinking I was crazy for being mad. I didn't realize I had essentially gotten into a kind of abusive relationship with him. It took him essentially raping me to the point where I should have gone to the hospital for medical attention one night, to realize that he was a monster and I wasn't crazy for being upset with him. 

Afterwards, I panicked and didn't know what to do. I was ashamed and felt so stupid, I didn't want anybody to find out, so I never told anybody and I didn't go to the hospital. I did my best to cut him out of my life, but my brother and I were still in college and living with our parents in the summer so I was essentially forced to see him. It doesn't help that my family absolutely adores him. I hated myself for a long time, I was so angry all the time, it's been years and the memories of that night still pop into my head multiple times a day. I'm doing better now that I'm on my own and it's been so long, but I'm still not as okay as I thought I'd be. 

I feel guilty about not telling my brother. There were a few reasons I didn't tell him besides just being ashamed. The guy who hurt me was not just my brother's best friend but also his only friend. Back then, my brother was going through a very difficult time and I knew he was depressed and occasionally he was suicidal. I was afraid that if I told him he would feel guilty about what happened and maybe he'd hurt himself, or it would take his best friend away and then he wouldn't have any friends, or he wouldn't believe me, or worst of all I was afraid he would believe me and not care. I don't think that last one is likely but it was a real fear of mine. They are still best friends. 

At this point is it too late to tell my brother? Should I even bother telling him? I know he will be so upset about this, and I don't want him to blame himself but is it wrong of me to let my brother continue his friendship with the man who hurt me so badly? I don't know what to do. I feel that I have to do something, whether or not it has anything to do with telling my brother because I thought I would be okay after so many years but I'm not.",02Dec2020,1

This female coworker and I used to flirt a lot and it's gotten to the point where we've gotten drunk several times together at her place and been all over each other, but I've held back from trying to sleep with her because she seems to have a drinking problem and some mental health issues.

268,"So I'm a super anxious person, and I'm not particularly photogenic. Honestly I could go on and on about a lot of things but I can roughly boil it down to

1). Nobody really taught me how to force a smile for the camera unless I can directly see myself through a mirror or something.

2). I have no idea what to do during a photo

3). I feel really bad just taking photos while people are in my vicinity or watching me and I get super nervous and rush things to get it out of the way so I dont impede others or feel a need to wait till everyone's gone till I could possibly take it (which results in me putting off any photography until I forget to take a picture for myself)

4). I get hypercritical of any photos I do have, and delete them almost immediately. Its really bad, I'm 20 and the only photo I have of myself is one I submitted for my scholarship, I've deleted every single other one because I look awful in them and I feel bad just looking at it.

271,"Good evening everyone. So, this past year tbh hasn't been my best. I mean, aside from COVID-19 and the ensuing quarantine measures, BLM/police protests and riots, political bullshit and all around fuckery of this start of the decade I've also been trying to come to terms with the past and move forward. TL;DR of my life, have high functioning autism(was hella cringey growing up but am pretty normal now), parents with a very dysfunctional relationship and a sister with a history of mental health outbursts and fits. I'm also formerly religious and wasn't raised a fundamentalist but Christianity became a ''special interest''(common on the autism spectrum) and so it didn't help the cringe and I realized it caused me to waste even more time and opportunities. 



After graduating high school I was mourning not having a better experience since in the last months I had finally begun to have some social footing a hanging out with people a bit. Two people, a classmate and his girlfriend I had even kept in contact with for a bit afterwards and was invited to the guy's family's house for New Years. While I was there, I saw the two of them kiss(not just smooching, but him lifting her up by her thighs), and just them being a happy, playful couple like in their Instagram pics. Granted we don't talk anymore and they broke up since she cheated on him but anywho....At the time, I had felt a deep seated envy and self pity seeing how at the time(in 2018) I was still 18 and single and had also found out that an old friend had betrayed me in a terrible way. A couple times I tried to cold approach girls in community college or a bookstore, and while nothing ''creepy'' happened they were not fruitful environments and scenarios and pretty much most of my classmates were in relationships. I even made a couple of accounts on apps but it was kinda pathetic looking back since I didn't really have a real social life even then. I had went to 1 or two local comic cons and they weren't fruitful either but tbh I think I went about it wrong.


Plus a few months back my mother again asked if I'm gay and even said it is strange and not normal to not have a girlfriend and it was brought up multiple times on my birthday in June. I'm currently studying for my EMT license exam(finished a program in September) and plan to move out, possibly to a cheaper part of California or to another state entirely as well as looking into online schooling and get back into things like martial arts, improve my fitness and broaden my hobbies since many of my autistic tendencies have subsided. But even still, it feels like there's this constant sense of inferiority or unfullfillment by not correlating with the conventional life script(two parents who get along, childhood friends, teen years with dates and crazy experiences that you ruminate blissfully on when older, etc). I know this probably is something that's a bit too much in my head or influenced by TV and movies. One tall and stocky guy who had been a wrestler at my school told me ''don't judge friends based on high school because everyone is immature'' and one *cheerleader* said it was the worst part of her life due to some drama with a friend or something and didn't talk to anyone from their, and apparently this went for a couple other peers as well, saying everyone from our school sucked or it being drama. It did make me perplexed about high school friendships and relationships since nearly everyone just drops each other after graduation even if they stay local.


Point is, I know I'm not the same I as I used to be and am probably even selling myself short, but I guess due to lack of opportunities plus still being at home, with family drama and not being able to build a social life yet doesn't help my mood but I do feel tired of missing out. But going forward what things would you recommend for how to enjoy life and approach dating/relationships into 2021?",02Dec2020,1

288,"So I had an annual ball on the weekend for the youth wing of a political party in heavily involved with. A lot of very important contacts and my friends attended.  

This girl (who‚Äôs my friend) asked me to the ball and I accepted. The plan a few weeks prior was that she was going to come by my house first for a drink or two of champagne, photos then we head to the ball.   

However, the first hiccup started when on the day before the ball she hadn‚Äôt even asked her parents to give her a lift to mine for the next day.   Also on the day before the ball she went to a massive party, got very drunk and was hungover on the actual day of the ball. 

She didn‚Äôt come to mine at all which was disappointing because I had cleaned the whole house, made it nice, bought nice champagne etc. ugh 

Anyway, we go to the ball, everyone sees we went together, we got couples photos etc. But a few hours into it she starts making out with this other guy at the ball when I‚Äôm right next to her. She was with him for 2 hours dancing and hugging etc and I left early.   

I‚Äôm so angry, humiliated and disappointed that she would do that. Yes, she‚Äôs her own person and can do what she likes, but she asked ME to a ball which she knew was going to be a very important event for me because I had a lot of contacts there and it looked and felt so bad to have my date (even though we were friends) get so bored of my she got slutty in front of everyone and humiliated me.   

She made me look pathetic in front of all my university friends and legit people came up to me and asked about why the girl I brought to the ball was hooking up with other guys. They felt bad for me, it was so embarrassing.  

I‚Äôm angry at her and I‚Äôm not speaking to her. Is my anger justified? I felt so humiliated, sad and angry. It ruined the night for me which was supposed to be the highlight of the year. 

Yes we went as friends, but she asked me to it so surely she could‚Äôve just stayed with me until the ball ended instead of getting slutty at a very conservative ball?  Thanks",02Dec2020,1

306,"Currently dating this woman and things are starting to get serious. We‚Äôve been dating about 4 months and I‚Äôm really starting to like her. We like a lot of the same stuff, we get along really well, we have lots of goals in common. We are both small business owners and we both help each other out with that type of stuff. I mean, it‚Äôs going really really well. I would even say that I could see a future with her. 

We‚Äôre both 30 years old. I‚Äôve never been married. She had a divorce in 2017 or 2018 from her abusive husband. The guy really has issues. He pulled a gun on her to intimidate her just this past summer a couple days before I met her and then about 3 weeks after we met he actually attacked her in her home in front of the children one day when he was coming to pick the kids up.

He‚Äôs pretty much been on the run since then. He does have pending charges for the attack on her, but I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs been arrested yet. None of this stuff really bothers me though. It wouldn‚Äôt be a deal breaker per se, and I‚Äôm kind of just filling you guys in on this stuff for background info and really to speak to the kind of troublesome household the kids were being raised in.

AND THEN THERE‚ÄôS THE KID THING

She has two kids. A 3-year old son and a 5-year old daughter, which isn‚Äôt really an issue for me. I, myself have a 5-year old daughter. I love kids. I coach basketball. I work at a youth shelter. I‚Äôve managed group homes for troubled youth and been a pretty good mentor for a lot of kids over the years. Working with the youth is something I‚Äôm passionate about. 

More about our kids. My daughter is a very sweet child, she is extremely smart and very well behaved. She excels in school, is always highly praised for her behavior and how helpful and kid she is to the other kids and amazingly polite and respectful to adults.

For the woman I‚Äôm dating on the other hand it is the complete opposite. She has two extremely challenging kids. I have seen ‚Äúbad‚Äù kids before, but I have never seen anything like this in my life. They both openly disrespect her and disobey everything she says. Just the other day her 3 year old son tried to spit on her when she told him no he couldn‚Äôt have cookies. 

Both her son and daughter get in trouble very frequently at daycare/school. They have both tried to ‚Äúfight‚Äù their teachers. They use profanity, they have no manners at all. They fight each other. Her 3 year old son even had sexual tendencies. 

He was caught in the restroom naked with his sister‚Äôs doll naked. He had taken the doll‚Äôs clothes off and opened her legs with his penis out attempting to have sex with it. Another instance he took his penis out in front of his sister and rubbed it on her blanket.

These types of behaviors are troubling and I surely wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable bringing my daughter around her kids at all right now. That really bothers me, because I like her a lot. Like, everything about her is nearly perfect, but the kids are an issue for me right now.

She has admitted to me that at times she probably wasn‚Äôt the best parent and kind of lost interest in it overtime basically, because of the abuse she was dealing with in the relationship mentally, physically, emotionally and financially combined. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail, but it was pretty rough for her with the abuse and infidelity by her cheating husband. 

He was a horrible father figure for the kids disrespecting and abusing their Mom in front of them, and probably a horrible parent to them overall and it shows in their behavior. She‚Äôs pretty hard on herself and often says she feels as if she has failed as a parent already. She almost feels defeated now when it comes to the kids and kind of looks to me for guidance and help with disciplining them on a daily basis, and unlike her I don‚Äôt believe in whooping or putting my hand on a child. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve ever had to do with my daughter. I‚Äôve never even had to raise my voice at my daughter.

Her kids behaviors are extreme and I‚Äôve never worked with these kinds of behaviors at this age. I‚Äôve really never heard of anything like this. I‚Äôm usually working with kids 12-18 with these behaviors. So, this is a little different for me and some times a little much, because I kind of thought most kids this age were kinda like my daughter. 

So, now I‚Äôm torn. What do I do? Do I continue to date her and try to help her? When if ever should I allow her and her kids around my daughter? Or should this be a deal breaker? 

Please help.",02Dec2020,1

309,"My aunt was adopted into my family by my grandfather. My whole life, she has been in and out. Years and years of false rape allegations, abuse, and slander have resulted in jail time for my grandfather, and unnecessary stress and anxiety for my family and I. They used to call child support when we were kids and claim that my grandfather would beat us, that our family molested us... All sorts of disgusting, and horrible things.

All of these allegations were debunked. Time and time again it was proven that all she did was lie. 

After that summary I will get into the important part. My grandfather passed away a few years ago, and (obviously) the house was passed down to us. (She received absolutely nothing. Wasn't even mentioned on his will.) She suddenly tried to become buddy buddy with us and apologized for everything. She mentioned wanting to be on our side in case my uncle tried to fight us for the house or any sort of belongings. (I don't know too much about my uncle in all honesty, he lived across the country, but I've heard both good and bad things.) My dad didn't give them his information because he thought something was up.

Turns out that they wanted to try to get in touch with him so that they could get an extra hand on fighting us legally for the house, or God knows what.

Yesterday, we were notified that my uncle had passed away. After doing a Google search of his name, I found him on a pedophile watch-list website. All of his information (address, name, phone number, everything.) And more false rape allegations!! Basically saying that he sexually assaulted his sister with his father, yadda yadda yadda. I know it was them, and now that I am an actual adult, I want to deal with this. I didn't get to meet him, but I feel like I would feel so much better about everything if I could do something about this awful slander.

312,"I'm 17F and have a 23M friend. He's really nice and I haven't known him well super long tbh. Though he's been someone I felt okay saying hi to in passing for a while. 

He said he was having a bad time, then told me he'd been abused as a kid and so had his brother and sister, him and his brother said nothing but eventually they discovered his sister was, thats all anyone knew till now. His brother got drunk on wine and just told everyone.

Hes saying its messing with his head a lot dealing with this and all his mums questions, he jokes about suicide a lot but I felt a lot more meaning behind it and he was running a lighter over his hands, I'm assuming self harm.

We would sometimes put porn on the TV, and that porn would vary between straight, gay/lesbian etc. Recently he‚Äôs been getting a little frustrated with me because I‚Äôm not cumming like I use too. He always asks if I  enjoyed the sex with him once we finished. Well one day, when we had the house to ourselves he  asked if I wanted lesbian stuff on the TV and offered to have sex with me to that, as well as toys. Etc. To which I‚Äôve gotten off great. He asked me if I feel satisfied in this relationship still to which I replied ‚Äúyes‚Äù. It‚Äôs been about two weeks since I told him yes, to where I kind of let it sink in that maybe I‚Äôm not. I have been getting off to more lesbian stuff on my own time, and I‚Äôve been a little more curious on dating a woman since I‚Äôve only really hooked up with them when I was single.

I am a kinda fucked up person. I have a lot of internal problems that I am trying to address and I really need help. I am a 19 year old male who just completed my first semester of university and had kinda a rough time. To understand why we're gonna have to delve into my personal history. I have a severe form of OCD. The details are too long and not relevant enough to get into but I basically had a father traumatic time, I ran away from home a couple times, tried to commit suicide a couple times, get hospitalized, had run ins with cops, etc. This was about when I was 10 years old. Anyways, those details aren't relevant, what is is the fact that as a result of ocd and stuff going on @ home, my social life at scho was a wreck and I got bullied a lot. If you want more details or whatever I have a couple posts on this sub where I talk about that stuff and trying to get over the self loathing. Anyways, I eventually overcame ocd and managed to make friends and not get bullied anymore. However no one forgot the old me and I always knew I was second tier. I had deeply internalized that mentality and carried it with me to high school. It led me to be reclusive and mainly hang out with a small group of people or alone. Unlike everyone else I wasn't sneaking out to party or whatever. I still have this mentality in college, and it's become something of a self fulfilling prophecy. I got a long with some people really well at the start of the year but now I know I'm not welcome (they asked my roommate who he can live with me, this isn't just in my head). I am currently on a 2 month break where I am trying to change and improve myself but honestly I need help.


Basically here's what I'm after. I want to be a charming, charismatic, confident, funny, physically fit, and intelligent person. Currently I fill none of these boxes. I have been working out recently but honestly I have no idea how to learn confidence. I have been reading up on charisma and social skills but frankly it boils down to being a model of feeling good and letting that rub off on other people. Fundamentally I don't feel good. I get my self esteem from what other people think of me, which has led me to depression and anger at myself. I don't know how to change that and I don't really know where I should get self esteem from. At the same time, to feel good you have to be confident, be willing to take the first plunge to show others the fun you're having. Charismatic people don't strive for normal interactions, they arrive for fun ones. I am scared of being abnormal deviating at all from what I should be because frankly, I have been abnormal before and it was the worst period of my entire life.  Normalcy brought friends and safety, I don't know how to leave that behind. Basically what I want to know is, what can I do to learn to be more confident, how can I accept my flaws and past (there's this whole other thing where I feel I have to date and have done drugs before the age of 20 to not be pathetic and a failure cause that's what everyone does in their teens and therefore it's normal), stop fearing abnormality, stop getting self esteem from others' opinions, and how to become the person I want to be.


Also yes, before I'm asked, I do see a therapist. It's just expensive so I can't go all that often and frankly idk if they have these answers",02Dec2020,1

330,"I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out what‚Äôs happening to me, lately I find myself enjoying silence and solitude, so much so that I have almost completely avoided listening to music. Whereas in the past I used to enjoy music and listen to it nonstop, it was motivating, energizing and ultimately kept me going. My music genre interests have no filter and is of a wide range btw. Soon as life got harder, I started working harder. With music it seems like it tires me out faster or gives me a huge burst of energy all at once then I‚Äôd be so tired and weak to do anything else. I may be over exaggerating a bit but the point is one day I went a day without listening to music and it was hard at first because I‚Äôm one of those ‚ÄúLive breathe music‚Äù type of people and it was very foreign to me to go a day without music, however I felt unexpectedly more energized and more aware and ultimately stronger all around, it‚Äôs like meditating I guess, or going on a silent retreat. Soon, 1 day turned into a few days without music and now I‚Äôm at 3 weeks without music and sometimes I miss it a lot and I would have earworms from songs I heard a long time ago here and there. Today, I broke my streak and listened to a few songs and it felt AMAZING but not for long though and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm growing out of music(if that‚Äôs even a thing) or if I‚Äôm depressed and don‚Äôt know it? (Although I doubt it) basically what I‚Äôm asking for is why is my love for music dying and my newfound love for silence growing? And Is it normal? Is it healthy? Should I keep going?

331,"Okay. Basically this is what happened. Me and my friend had a big fight over something pretty small. She doesn‚Äôt want to admit she was wrong, and instead plays victim and tries to blame ME for her wrongdoings.

In any case, I ended the friendship. But I want to move on and put it past me. I don‚Äôt want to think about it more and more and stew on it. I just want to let it go. I‚Äôm tired of giving her power. She called me stupid names and essentially made me feel like shit.

But I don‚Äôt want to dip into victim mentality. I just want to move past what she did and just find joy and happiness in my own life. But every time I‚Äôm feeling happy or good about myself, I think about our big fight and how she dismissed my feelings and called me a childish bitch.

333,"Hey! I seem to have an ongoing problem, a lack of academic motivation. I know which field of science I wanna pursue professionally, and for that I need to have outstanding grades, but for some reason all my motivation dissipates quite quickly.

I‚Äôm definitely confident in my ability to perform well enough to enroll in a great university (not to sound pretentious), but I just need to be able to stay motivated to perform the best I can. 

Just to add, I found that making projects in the field helps me stay motivated; I‚Äôm just not sure how to hold on to that motivation long enough.

334,"My neighbors have I believe three sons living with them. Due to the street layout and parking situation, they tend to park right next to my house. They will sit in their cars and quietly smoke pot for hours, then go inside. I‚Äôm totally cool with that, no problem!

However, one of the sons comes home almost every night around 10:40pm, and he is absolutely blasting music. Window rattling. You can hear it pulling up from a mile away. He‚Äôll park and sit there for about a minute, music blasting, then turn the car off and head inside.

About a month ago I reached my limit and went outside off and said ‚Äú Can you turn that down?‚Äù Probably visibly aggravated. It might have helped for a couple days, then the same.

This evening I was outside waiting for him. I asked if he had a moment, introduced myself, and asked/pleaded if he could turn it down before parking. I tried to be as non-confrontational as possible, but I could tell he had an attitude about it. He said ok and walked away. I‚Äôm almost certain nothing will change and frankly I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it got worse.

Should I have handled it differently? Any advice on what to do in the future, if it doesn‚Äôt improve?

342,"Hi, please help me decide which of these moves fits me best. I keep going back and forth between both, I can't make up my mind. 

Info about me: 

I'm in my 30s. Moved and lived in my different parts of the US. Growing tired of moving and wanting to settle for good in a place next year. 

My priorities are: 

1. Buying an actual house (in a safe, quiet area) at a reasonable price so I can live by myself. I'm in my 30s, and I'm tired of always having to have roommates. I'm in my 30s, and I don't want to continue living like this. 
2. Getting a job that doesn't stress me and that I don't hate (w/ decent pay, benefits, etc.). 
3. Not having to struggle unnecessarily. Just leave me alone. I don't want to compete at anything/with anyone to live my life. For example: traffic, fighting for space at places - gym, grocery store, public transportation, work, etc., being in a hurry all the time, joining the ""rat race,"" etc. 
4. Long-term vision: What is this place going to be like in 10, 20, 30 years from now? Questions about overcrowding, infrastructure, job opportunities, migration and demographic patterns, pollution, safety, crime, etc. 

I've done a lot of research, and for my particular situation, I've narrowed my choices to these two locations:

Washington state - Here's what I think, in relation to my priorities: 

1. According to Zillow, the median house price in Seattle is $800k. In Tacoma $400k. In Spokane $300k. If I were to move to Washington, I won't be able to buy a house right away, especially in the Seattle metro. Also, I want an actual house. I've had a townhouse before, and I don't want that again. This would mean having to continue to live with roommates for at least a couple of years. I could pay for an apartment for myself, but that's also expensive. So gotta pick a poison, and both suck. 
2. Starting pay in my industry is $60k+ around the state, with good salary advancement/benefits/retirement. But I hate what I do, it stresses me greatly. So, hopefully, I'd be looking to get a job in a different industry. Overall, the state of Washington pays high salaries across the board, and job opportunities are abundant. This would give me a sense of security financially, and in having the opportunity to switch careers. 
3. I've never visited Washington state, but I've done a lot of research, watched videos, etc. The fights here would be with traffic, too many people, typical big city bullshit. 
4. I've got no crystal ball. I really don't know what Washington state would look 10 years from now. I'm a cynical person, so for me, I don't particularly see a pretty picture of this state in the future, especially in the higher population areas like Seattle metro

Indiana - Here's what I think, in relation to my priorities: 

1. Per Zillow, median house prices are: Indianapolis $170k, Fort Wayne $160k, Bloomington $240k. These are much more attractive house prices for me (I don't want to overpay for a house). So I could buy a house right away in Indiana.
2. Starting pay in my industry is $35k+ around the state, with meager salary advancement, benefits, and mediocre retirement. Jobs in other industries pay even less - bad wages across the board. If moving to Indiana, I would pretty much be forced to stay in my current industry which I hate (but maybe I could find a less disagreeable job within it - although I've tried that several times, and I never find it). Job opportunities in other industries are also much scarcer than in WA.
3. I've never visited Indiana. I don't really know what struggles and fights there would be here. Maybe some racism/discrimination? Although I suspect WA has plenty of that on incognito mode. But I don't really care much about this. There will always be people that don't like you for whatever reason. Ultimately, I just want to be left alone. 
4. Who the hell wants to move to Indiana? lol (joking/not joking - however, you'd be surprised, there's lots of people moving in). This is one of the reasons it's one of my choices. Obviously, the bigger cities like Indianapolis will likely face growth of big city problems, but overall, I think life conditions in this state will stay more consistent. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, both places have things that I desperately need/want and also things I despise. 

The pay and job opportunities in WA are very good, in contrast, Indiana has miserable pay and scarcer job opportunities. 

WA real estate is very expensive, Indiana has some of the cheapest real estate in the US. 

WA is a magnet for people, the state is considered hip/cool, frequently on lists of ""best place to live,"" etc. Not many people think about Indiana. WA has a lot of people, a lot of traffic, and more of a rat race lifestyle. Indiana seems to be more a laid back and quiet place. 

I really want to switch careers, and that would be much easier in WA. Unfortunately, I need a job to sustain myself - so this kind of takes precedence. I want to find a less stressful job so bad, that I think I'd be willing to endure longer commutes in WA, to and from work, of hopefully not more than 1 hour. I've done 1 hour+ commutes, and I hate it. But I think I'd rather have a terrible commute and live with roommates, than have a stressful job.

343,I hate school. I have ADHD and I always took a pill. Until 5 grade. Then that's when the d's and f's came rolling in. My parents took away my computer for getting such horrible grades this year. It was for a while but I got it back. So to stay on track I'm cheating on ALL OF IT. Every class every assignment.   School is fucking endless pain. My computer is the only way I can enjoy my free time. I feel like I'm a sack of shit and an asshole and a unhealthy person too. It is extremely unhealthy to be on a pc for a long time which I do. I transfered schools last year and that was even WORSE. I feel like my life is falling apart infront of my eyes or I'm being dramatic cuz I'm a teen. But I can't help but think what if they find out?

344,"So. Im a caregiver for elderly people. And a few months ago, I ran into some really bad luck. Where one of my clients died and the other ones family decided to take caregivers off. So I had no hours. Until I was offered a new client. I immediately didn't want to take it. Because it was 45 mins away, and my company told me that this was a hard client, and they've been through lots of caregivers, either because it was too much for them, or usually the case, the family didn't like caregiver and wanted a different one. And hes definitely the hardest client I've had. But thats not the main thing. For one. It was only 8 hour shifts. 2 days a week. And I absolutely hate 8 hour shifts. I prefer 12 hour. But probably the worst part, worse than the long drive and the 8 hour shift, is the fact that the only days possible for me to work with him are Friday night and Saturday night. And I take weekend classes on Saturday and sunday. Which means, I basically go to work Friday night. Then stay up all day for my classes, then go to work Saturday night, then have to stay up all day for my classes on Sunday. Which kills me by the end of it. 

So my dilemma come with this. So this week, I got a new client. On Mondays and Tuesdays..these are 12 hour shift. And the shift is like a 7 min drive from where I live. And if I wanted to, I could have wedsdays and maybe Thursdays as well. And I kinda want to pick those 2 days up and drop my other client. But I feel really bad about it. For one. I am this clients favorite caregiver, and I know it would suck for him to find a new one. And his wife saved me a plate of Thanksgiving dinner. They also offered to send me money one time when I was in a car accident out of state,  so I could rent a car to get back in the state. And they've just been really kind to me. So I feel terrible about even considering this. But this is getting a bit too hard for me. And im kinda miserable. I've considered just to stop taking classes. But im on a scholarship program, and if I stop now, I wouldn't be able to get back in the program later. So would I be a terrible person of I was to request to be taken off of him?",02Dec2020,1

353,"Sorry for the bad writing quality and length of this post. I ended up writing quite casually.

I've (high school junior) recently taken on a lot of extracurricular academic work, and I've been having a lot of trouble getting myself motivated. This has always been a bit of a problem for me, but the extra work and pressure from upcoming college applications has really accentuated it; I feel like if I allow it to continue, it could really affect my future.

Getting As has never been very hard for me, and I find school in general pretty easy. However, I'm also that kid who stays up all night on the day before an assignment needs to be turned in, always has something overdue, and frantically completes math homework during lunch every day. The reason for this isn't because I don't understand the work or don't care about doing well; on the contrary, I feel very disappointed every time I get anything lower than an A. Really, I just can't make myself do anything before the day it's due - and sometimes even then. 

I don't know why this is; I just always seem to default to browsing Reddit/YouTube or, more frequently, playing video games for hours until I've completely run out of time - and the worrying part is that I don't feel like I'm in control of this behavior. Even if I'm excited about doing some work or know that an assignment *needs* to be completed, I can never even get myself to start it. It's like I'll do anything to avoid working no matter what, like there's some unconscious part of me that renders me unable to change anything about my behavior. A lot of the time, I'll have been playing video games for hours and not want to keep going - i.e. I'm not even enjoying myself any more - and will mindlessly continue just to have something else to do, falling back into the same thoughtless habits as always. Sometimes when I sit down to start an assignment, I'll waste hours, then suddenly look at the clock and legitimately have no idea where the time has gone. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm backed up on overdue assignments and feeling really stressed about everything related to school - just thinking about it gives me a headache. I honestly just feel so helpless, because the last thing I want is to disappoint my parents and teachers or negatively impact my future, but at the same time I feel unable to do anything about it.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, whether in the comments of this post or in DMs. Thanks a lot for listening.",02Dec2020,1
354,"I had known my best friend for several years, and it was common that we would hang out, play video games, and overall have a good time.
He owns three cats, absolutely adorable cats all with their own personalities. My best friend most certainly loved each one dearly.
Then the pandemic hit. We didn‚Äôt hang out then, but we still enjoyed chatting and playing video games together online.
Then one of his cats passed away. I didn‚Äôt ask how. His words didn‚Äôt show much, but it was as though he was devastated inside. 
A week later, he lost another cat. We chatted for a small bit, but it was clear he was rather...disconnected. 
I‚Äôm concerned for him. He has brothers and parents to comfort him, but he explicitly stated he doesn‚Äôt want anyone to talk to him. He doesn‚Äôt return my messages.

What do I do to comfort him? Help him move on? I would drive over there to comfort him, but he rejected it and the pandemic provides less of a reason to visit.",02Dec2020,1

I am not particularly good at any skill nor have I excelled at anything in my life, however, I constantly compare myself to extraordinary people and I think that one day I might be like them. Whenever I write personal notes or journals, I imagine them as notes in history, far more significant than they really are. Even now as I write this post, I can't stop but think that people might see and be influenced by it. It makes me question my personal motives, am I just writing this post for some reddit attention? To add to this I have a complete lack of self-discipline, I study engineering and i just do enough to scrape by and go mess around with whatever else I'm interested in that day.

361," I absolutely hate sharing. Not with my family, friends, anyone. Every time someone uses something of mine, I get really irritated, feeling as if someone had done me a great disservice.

When people take a piece of my food without asking, I would glare at them. With a rising temper, I would venomously spit out, ‚Äúwhy did you take my food without asking?‚Äù Even when they ask, I would either reluctantly offer some of my food, or blatantly say no without remorse. It comes to a point where even if I offer my food, my family would just politely decline.

I share clothes with my siblings. They readily share their clothes with me. I try to do the same, but with immense difficulty. Whenever they try on my clothes (just to try on, not to wear out), I would get very, very angry. I would shout at them asking why did they touch my clothes without asking. Once, when they wore my clothes out without asking my permission, I screamed at them so bad when they came home. All parties involved felt horrible after that. I am very blatant in my disapproval and have expressed multiple times that they should always ask for my permission before wearing my clothes. I have said that should I say no, with or without giving a reason, they would not wear my clothes. So far, they have mostly respected that. 

I go by the same principle when it comes to using and touching others‚Äô things as well. Before taking or touching something of theirs, I always ask. If they say no, I drop it and carry on with my business with no bad feelings. If my siblings choose to not let me wear my clothes for whatever reason, I respect that and wear something else. More often than not I try my best to wear only my own clothes (we share a wardrobe). If I wear their clothes by accident without their permission, I would immediately apologise upon realising. I‚Äôd hate to be hypocritical. They always accept my apologies. Heck, I think they probably don‚Äôt even mind if I don‚Äôt apologise. 

The thing is, my family is generous when it comes to sharing. Or at least, much more generous than I am. Say we‚Äôre all eating different things at an eatery and I ask to have a bite of their food, my parents readily offer up their whole plate. Sometimes, even when I‚Äôm not interested, they give me their food. My siblings also readily share, with or without asking. The same goes for their material possessions such as clothes, equipment, stationery, etc. 

I am aware that I appear selfish to my family. More than once I have had that word thrown at me in an argument. I take everything in stride. I would like to imagine that I appear to be unaffected by what they are saying. However, what they probably don‚Äôt know is that I actually feel guilty and upset. Whenever I don‚Äôt share, I feel guilty. Because they are all okay with sharing, yet I am not. I try to, but I feel really possessive over my things and feel really uncomfortable about sharing my things. 

Also, I am from a mostly collectivistic culture that emphasises the needs of the group over the individual. This worsens my guilt and I am reminded of my shortcomings whenever I don‚Äôt share. While it seems that my family are mostly okay with my behaviour and mentality, I notice the micro-expressions they have whenever I tell them no. They would either get angry, shocked, upset, or all those at once. It makes me think if I‚Äôm being too much or if they‚Äôre acting entitled. To make myself feel better, I usually go with the latter. 

How do I feel better about sharing my things? I fear that if I don‚Äôt share, not even with the people closest to me, they would eventually resent me enough and distance themselves from me. I also understand that all humans are social creatures, no matter how asocial and reclusive I am. I just want to treat my family better and I believe that sharing without negative emotions is a good starting point. How can I be better?",02Dec2020,1

365,"My mom has a younger sister (47F) and she was married to my uncle (51M) approximately 18 years ago. My aunt was my favourite person in the entire world to me and even my mom came next to her. But it all changed after her marriage. My uncle is a sweet human being and he is closer to me than my father. 

After 3 years into the marriage, my aunt started having anger issues and since they lived on the first floor of our house, we'd hear them arguing. They didn't have children. Now 18 years later, the fact that they still don't have children festered into a huge issue even though they don't live with us anymore. My uncle started thinking of me and my brother as his own children but my aunt was not accepting of such a thought. 

She distanced herself from every family member and became a hostile person who constantly complains about every person. When my grandma was alive she was her support system and even though it had negative consequences, she still had someone to talk to. Now with my grandma's passing two years ago, she has become a different person altogether. 

She started having health issues which hasn't healed in the last two years. Constant cough, skin problems, and lack of appetite. She is balding and she recently developed insomnia. She has OCD and is constantly only bothered about cleaning the house in every way possible (which has become a topic of most of their arguments these days). She hates my mom and they don't get along because my mom talks to her like she does to me and my brother. 

With the lockdown, she has cuccooned herself even more and cut off almost all human contact. She doesn't have confidantes anymore and hates going out. She calls my uncle in odd hours when he leaves overnight for business. She sometimes has the habit of walking out late at night during arguments(its not a good neighborhood for a stroll at 11pm at night). 


Recently they had a huge argument and my parents stepped in and brought them home with us. She's been mopey here and wouldn't eat, wouldn't talk and now wouldn't even sleep. She won't take counseling or therapy, she won't work to distract herself (because her health leaves her tired). All she does is sit and stare or lie down. 

I want to help her but I am at loss for how. We still talk but she doesn't engage in conversations and she isn't active. I wish she would accept the fact that they cannot have children and try to adopt someone but she is reluctant about raising an adopted kid. Any advice or help appreciated.",02Dec2020,1
366,"Ok I‚Äôm going to try and write this as objectively as I can. So I have a friend from college. We were really close then, and in our final semester, due to her suddenly getting obsessed with the ‚Äúcool gang‚Äù we had a big fallout and stopped speaking. About a year and a half later - we slowly started speaking again. She made the effort. And with time we got comfortable and close again. She went through massive setbacks in life, with losing a parent, no clear career goals, zero motivation, depression and anxiety. I also did go through a phase of depression and anxiety around the same time. Through that, I‚Äôve really had to be her sounding board - trying and suggesting new ways she can move around and get going with life. She‚Äôs also been my sounding board as well. 

But the amount of effort is grossly unbalanced. It takes a lot out of me, as I kept on finding proper, precise solutions for her - telling her how to cope, convincing her to keep going for therapy, telling her to act or react in a situation. I never got that kind of support which is fine - I just need someone to vent to - though sometimes she is really flippant about my issues. But I can never take hers lightly - she gets extremely tensed, and makes everything a big deal. 

She found love, got married. But she fights a lot - and again I have to keep speaking to her to calm her down so she doesn‚Äôt destroy her life further. 

I‚Äôve noticed despite doing so much, I never really get the same support. From things like stuff I want to do, to emotional support, and public acknowledgment. 

She‚Äôs always displayed social PDA with all her friends except me. No photos of me online, no throwbacks nothing. It‚Äôs always her other friends. During her wedding she treated me very badly - which resulted in a bad fight - I ran away in tears and don‚Äôt remember anything from that week because I felt so guilty. She weirdly forgave me - didn‚Äôt react at all to the situation later. She was normal - something I couldn‚Äôt figure why. 

Idk something feels off to me. I just continue to give. But I don‚Äôt get that support back. And when I call it out, she insults me back calls me selfish - but is okay later when I apologise. 

Is there something I‚Äôm overreacting to or is she using me?",02Dec2020,1

Financially, continuing with the house purchase makes the most sense. Neither of us can afford to buy it alone and we want some stability for our son, somewhere he can be grounded and call home. Separating now and pulling out would mean 2 rentals costs, plus we need to factor in the extremely awful rental market at the moment.

370,"Please don‚Äôt insult me or call me names for this, I know I made a few mistakes but I‚Äôm human. I‚Äôm also 18. If you have nothing nice to say just leave, I‚Äôm hurt enough. 


I got Chlo√© on November 17th, and she was the best dog ever. She was also my first puppy. She was just the right amount of sassy, playful, shy and just everything you could ever want in a puppy. She was just 9 weeks when I got her, and was up to date with her vaccinations from what the shop told me. 

I decided to get her from there this shop ‚ÄúWestchester Puppies and Kittens‚Äù. (I hadn‚Äôt googled the Yelp or google reviews before my purchase). I walked in the store and immediately laid my eyes on Chlo√©, I knew she was the one. When I had bonding time with her, she was just special and I had to have her. This is where it gets fucked up. They tell me she‚Äôs $4,200. Now since this was my first time buying a puppy, I figured maybe it was a normal price. I figured since she was small, a cockapoo, the price was reasonable. They offered payment plans and I immediately accepted it. They told me I‚Äôd have to pay $158 a month and that was it, I figured it was a good deal. I was so desperate to have her that I had her run my credit so I could finance a puppy. Now that I think about it, it was the dumbest mistake I could of ever made. 

So I get approved, the lady has me sign a few papers but because I didn‚Äôt have my glasses on I wasn‚Äôt able to see most of it and also, keep in mind that I was eager to just bring her home. I get the paper work out of the way and bring her home. I went shopping for her and got over $600 worth of items from PetSmart just so she would settle in okay. The first day or two was amazing and all I could ever ask for, until she started sneezing and coughing like crazy. I had noticed a small cough when I first got her but thought nothing of it, but what made me look deeper into it was the many google and Yelp reviews I saw online. I also didn‚Äôt recognize the sound of a puppy‚Äôs cough since I was a first time puppy owner. Turns out this place was infamous for selling people sick puppies.

By the end of the first week she was snoring loudly as if she had trouble breathing, coughing like crazy as well as sneezing, very runny nose, she‚Äôd sneeze and snot would come out, sounds of choking, and just obviously having a hard time breathing. When I messaged the owner of the shop she informed me that she believed it was just a cold and that most puppies get sick around this time and that it was normal. She told me to bring her back into the shop to be treated by their veterinarian who stopped in each day. I did that and they told me it would be in her best interest to stay with them for a couple of days just so she‚Äôd be able to be seen and treated effectively. 

3 days go by, and I finally go to pick her up. They sent me home with two antibiotics, azithromycin and clavamox, and told me to give her the medication three times a day. They pretty much told me nothing about her diagnosis other then it was kennel cough and nothing more, yet the owner told me I should take her to their vet again for an x ray to rule out bronchitis. I figured if they were so sure it was just a cold, why recommend that I take her for an X-ray? Even though none of this sat right with me, I took her home and began treating her and just watching out for worsening symptoms. 

I kept reading reviews to this place and came across an actual lawsuit against the store. The lawsuit stated that the place was selling dogs from puppy mills, and lying to people about it. I then went through my papers again that Chlo√© came with and came across the name of the breeder. The breeder was someone from KS who‚Äôs kennel received numerous complaints and citations for the way the dogs were bred, the conditions they were in and how they were treated. All of this information about where she came from, the business I bought her from and how unprofessional she was, (according to the google and Yelp reviews, AND how she only communicated through text) had me questioning if I really wanted to put my credit on the line for a pup that might not even make it for another year or two. 

Then to make matters worse, I finally read the fine print and realized the payment plan wasn‚Äôt just for $4,200 but it was 22% APR and I‚Äôd be paying almost $7000 in total for a puppy that was sick the first two weeks I got her. It didn‚Äôt seem like a smart investment once I thought about it and I started to think about just how irresponsible it was for me to even get her under those circumstances...I knew I loved her, but I knew that all the red flags were right there..

I decided to bring her back. I was a crying mess the whole way there. Ironically enough, when I was saying my goodbyes to her, an angry woman walked into the shop and said she had just gotten her kitten from them a month prior and that her kitten died just yesterday. That was another red flag. I couldn‚Äôt stop crying but I decided it was still the right thing to do. I stood outside for about two hours reconsidering, trying to come up with a way I could keep her and nothing made sense. 

I‚Äôm home now and it really hit me when my bf was throwing her stuff away, trying to stop me from seeing it. I feel terrible and this doesn‚Äôt feel right. I want to go back and get her but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good idea...I love her so much and she was my first..but taking the business I got her from into account, as well as where she was bred, as well as the stupid ass payment plan I agreed to, I just don‚Äôt know.. would it be dumb for me to go and pick her up and take this on? Everyone around me is saying it‚Äôs a bad idea and I could just be blinded by how much I love her but this hurts... any advice? I‚Äôm literally on the verge of texting this woman back and telling her I want her back, I just need a plan to make this work.

373,"It's been almost two months since someone I considered a good friend ghosted me, but I'm still struggling with it... 

\[Apologies in advance for the length =p\]

Some background: I moved to a new city in late 2019. I was in the process of making new friends -- via the MeetUp app -- when the pandemic hit. The MeetUp group more or less shut down after that, and I only kept in touch with a few people from there. One of them was a girl from France (I'll call her M) who was working in the US for a year, and she happened to be the only person I knew still willing to hang in person. (While M was cute, I later found out she was engaged to someone back in Paris, so I was legit just looking for a friendship here.)

I'd been tired of the shelter-in-place rules, so it was great to get out of the house to see M every once in a while. We would hike, meet up for drinks, play basketball, etc. We also kept in touch regularly via text, checking in on each other (especially in those first few months of the lockdown) and trying to plan our next hangout. I got comfortable enough with M to tell her about some personal challenges I'd been facing: I've had several family members pass away this year, including my grandma and a few cousins. And she seemed understanding about it and tried to help me out. 

As the summer went on, M's schedule got busier. We still texted, but I was only seeing her once or twice a month at best. She also started going out of town for weekend trips with her coworkers and other friends (to make the most of her stay in the US, she told me). I found it weird that she didn't invite me on any of these trips, but I tried to remain respectful and didn't bring it up.

Since she was mostly gone on weekends, I tried meeting her on weekdays. M initially seemed receptive to my ideas, but then would always have a reason to cancel at the last minute (usually it was because she was tired from work). Again, I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and not push the issue.

But as the fall arrived, this kept happening over and over: I'd ask M to hang, she'd seem interested, and then when the day came, she couldn't make it anymore. It was frustrating. The last time I saw her in person was in September, after another cousin of mine suddenly passed away... I was having a hard time dealing with it, and I just needed someone to talk to. To her credit, she showed up that night.

Which makes what happened in October all the more confusing. I was trying to plan something with M, and even spoke with her over the phone. But when she bailed on that hangout a few days later, I finally reached my limit and confronted her over text. I was never mean about it, though. All I told her was how one-sided our friendship had felt lately, and that it was really tough to plan anything with her. I just wanted M to meet me halfway.

After I sent that message, I never heard from her again... the ghosting happened very suddenly. I tried sending follow-ups (spaced a few weeks apart), but got no response for those, either. If FB Messenger is to be believed, M hasn't really read any of my texts since that time -- they all have that greyed-in ""Delivered"" checkmark. I could see on social media that she was doing OK, just hanging out with other people...

The strange part was even though M wasn't responding to me on Messenger, she'd sometimes look at my FB stories (the ones that only last for 24 hours). I thought it was a mistake at first, but I saw her name pop up in my ""Viewers"" list repeatedly. I don't know what kind of mind games she was trying to play there, but that was extremely aggravating. I ended up un-friending her on all my apps because of that. 

&lt;&gt;

I've told my other friends from back home about this, and they all agree that it's very strange behavior and that I should just try to let this go. But that's the part I'm struggling with. M and I always got along really well in person, and I thought we were on our way to becoming really good friends. So it's very difficult for me to wrap my head around why she would treat me so horribly like this, especially after being fully aware of the tough year I've already had. 

What kind of person just gives up on a friendship overnight, you know?

I've gotten better about not thinking about M since then, but every now and then, she comes across my mind and I just feel depressed all over again. So that's why I'm here... if you've been ghosted by a friend before, how did you eventually get over it? Do you have any tips or techniques about staying focused on other things?",02Dec2020,1
374,"Hi, Reddit.

I'm a 19-year-old girl. I like to share my art on Instagram, and as I used to make fandom-related drawings, I have lots of followers who are minors. There is one particular follower who I have a problem with, a 14-year-old (they/them) who is very attached to me.

This 14-year-old has told me they are very mentally ill and have no friends, I have similar issues so I try to be kind to them. However it seems to be going too far, as they constantly tell me that they love me, I'm the best person in the world, I'm the only person who understands them, etc. They rant to me constantly about how they want to take their own life and all of that. The age gap between us makes me uncomfortable and I think it would be best to cut this off before things get worse. I'm not comfortable with a minor ranting to me about their mental issues. I want them to get help, but an adult stranger on the internet is the wrong person for a child to turn to. 

How can I cut this off without making them upset? They're very sweet and I hate to make them sad, but I feel that this friendship is inappropriate.

Any help is appreciated, thank you.",02Dec2020,1

379,"I‚Äôm currently a sophomore in college and I‚Äôm going to be transferring to a different school next fall. The difficult question is which school that will be. I did my freshman year at university of Arizona but I transferred to my local community college for this year because of covid and I wanted to save money. I‚Äôm trying to decide whether I should transfer to a different school or go back to Arizona. I liked living in Arizona compared to Illinois where I‚Äôm at now but I didn‚Äôt really know anyone out there before and I guess I‚Äôm not really good at making new friends because I didn‚Äôt really make any that make me want to go back. It was awful because I was living somewhere so beautiful but I had no one to enjoy it with so I was lonely for the majority of the time I was there. I was considering transferring before I decided to transfer to community college it just kind of worked out with covid. At this point I‚Äôm considering 4 schools: go back to Arizona, Grand Canyon University (AZ), university of Illinois, and Saint Louis university. I got family in St. Louis and both of my brothers go to Illinois, but the problem is that my credits don‚Äôt transfer well. Even it I took classes in the summer, I would be a year behind. It‚Äôs just so frustrating because what I really want is to live somewhere beautiful with palm trees and nice weather like Arizona or California and to have friends that I can always enjoy it with and go out with whether it be to party to go on an adventure or whatever, but I don‚Äôt want to be so far away from my family either. I know that I could just move out there after I graduate but I feel like I‚Äôll just run into the same problem. I love u of Arizona, but it‚Äôs lonely. I like Saint Louis U, but credits don‚Äôt transfer well and i only have one friend there so I don‚Äôt know how that will work. U of Illinois is ok, but I‚Äôve never really like it tbh. The only reason I‚Äôve been applying is because my family wants me to. So the bottom line is I either go back out west and run the risk of being lonely and depressed again or transfer to a school closer to home and have to pay an extra $35,000 to take an extra year of classes.

380,"So I (21 Male) keep having a dream that always ends the same way at some point, I am forced to wear makeup.

It started when I was a kid, I had a dream that my mom and sister were witches and was chasing me around with makeup they were flying at me with. I would always wake up before anything happened so I don‚Äôt know how that would have ended.

The first dream I was forced to actually wear it, I was at a water park. I was the last person in line, the lifeguard told me to stop, he said I would look good in makeup and took out foundation. He then held me down and started putting it on my face. I slipped away and eventually woke up.

The next few dreams I describe are the dreams I remember the most but there have been a lot of these dreams.

I dreamt I was at my friends house. His sister walked in and saw I was dozing off, she asked to do my makeup, I say only if I was asleep and couldn‚Äôt defend myself. She smiles. I eventually woke up from the dreams dream and I was at my house upstairs. My friends sister was in the middle of doing my makeup. She stopped but I was like, you gone this far might as well finish it. My mom eventually walked upstairs and the sister disappeared my mother saw her work and said she was just disappointed.

The next dream, I was in my room playing video games. Suddenly a random stranger busted in and just started putting lipstick on me. I honestly didn‚Äôt care cause I was playing a game, so I let it happen. My dad burst through the door and he saw me with lipstick and said that he didn‚Äôt have a son.

Next one I was in my living room and my sister asked if I wanted to try something new. I said sure, next thing I know, I‚Äôm strapped to a chair with makeup on and my nails painted. My sister then complemented me and said I was pretty.

Next one was when I was outside on my porch with my sister and cousin. They were doing their makeup when the conversation they had switched to doing a guy‚Äôs makeup. The both paused and looked at me and slowly grinned. They chased me with makeup until they caught me and did it.

I tried to post this in r/dreams but no one responded so I‚Äôm asking if anyone knows what they mean here.

I come from a really conservative family and they don‚Äôt like guys in makeup, so I‚Äôm nervous to bring it up to them.

So if anyone has any advice on what they might mean or how to make them stop, please let me know.",02Dec2020,1

Since everything is online I have only ever seen her through video chats. I brought up hanging out and she seemed interested. Yesterday she said she was bored and asked if she could come over to my dorm. I said sure and cleaned up a bit. She came over and we kind of just hung out in person for the first time. We clicked well and it was fun talking to her. There was definitely some flirting as well.  It got late and she asked if she could spend the night and we could share my bed. I was nervous because I've hardly hugged a girl so I didn't really know what I was getting myself into. I let her borrow a tooth brush and a pair of shorts. We shared my dorm bed and went to sleep. 

Shortly after we got into bed she asked if we could snuggle, I laughed, but she actually wanted me to be big spoon so we cuddled all night and that was that. I woke up the next morning with her head on my chest and we were pretty much on top of each other. I grabbed my phone and my buddy had texted me that he was dropping something off in the lobby and to meet him down there. This girl whos head was on my chest saw I was awake and I told her I had to go pick up something and I'd bring her back a coffee. Before I got up off the bed, her head still on my chest, I kissed her on the forehead and then said good bye. I went down stairs got the package and came back up with two coffees. I handed one to her and she said thanks, but said the kiss on the forehead was inappropriate and she just wanted to spend the night. She left and I could tell she wasn't happy about it.

You see, back in the summer, our family dog passed away (cancer). It wrecked me, hard, but I waited until I felt like I was healed and no longer hurting before I agreed that I‚Äôd be willing to open my home to a new rescue. I truly thought that I was ready, I gave it a lot of thought and consideration, I felt no regrets and thought it over hundreds of times, but...

Having another dog around has suddenly and unexpectedly dug up every sad feeling I had about my old dog passing away, and then some. And now it‚Äôs really taking a toll on my mental health. 

I had a complete sobbing breakdown. I struggled so hard to hold it together at work today. I took a day off the other day because I couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to get out of bed or stop crying after I accidentally called the new dog by my old dog‚Äôs name.

I‚Äôve nothing against this dog personally, she is very sweet and I know she would fit in with any loving home, but I just don‚Äôt know what to do with her. If it is affecting me this much, is it bad to consider rehoming her? She‚Äôs still new enough to our household that I feel like it wouldn‚Äôt effect her deeply.

Or do I just try to brave through these episodes and hope that things get better soon? I know I will get better eventually. I‚Äôve also considered and thought about it a lot more than any person should. I considered everything, even went as far as putting a side money for adoption and vet expenses. And now I just feel stuck. I fully, truly, 100% had confidence in myself that I was ready to take the next step in moving on. I don‚Äôt know what happened, or why all of that came undone.

389,"I (16f) and having a  really hard time lately with self-esteem. 

I generally like myself. I'm kind, and I'm funny, and I have a lot of interesting things to say. But I just don't have very many friends. I'm not like other high schoolers, and I never have been very much like other people my age. I've never been into makeup or social media trends or any of the other stereotypical modern high school experience things. Frankly, they seem pointless to me and I will never understand them. I don't judge people for finding them enjoyable, it's just not something I have ever related to. 

Lately it's become apparent to me that my limited group of friends are all starting to date (I had a girlfriend about 2 years ago and I loved her a lot, but my mom hated her so it was difficult to date her for very long. We're still good friends, but I haven't dated since then), and since they're starting to date they're also starting to get intimate with their partners. I don't know why but the realization that they're all growing up at a ""normal"" pace and living life like teenagers do makes me feel so left out. Am I missing out on something? I feel like I'm such a late bloomer, but at the same time I feel like I've always been so far ahead of my peers (maybe that sounds conceited, but what else am I supposed to think when I'm making career plans and they're vaping in the bathrooms? I don't know. Maybe that was mean of me to say, regardless. But I've heard from adults and kids alike that I'm really mature for a 16 year old. Most people think I'm around 18 or 19).

And I know in my head that in a few years none of this will matter, and I'll forget all about it, and nobody will care about the same kind of things. But it's just so hard to not fit in for years and years. It's so hard to keep hanging in there waiting for this to be over. It's hard to always be left out, even if I prefer my way of life.

398,"hi reddit people, 
lets start with i was raised by a narcissistic mother so in romantic relationship i will over analyzing and people please. so i have a hard time deciding what‚Äôs best for myself, that‚Äôs why i need you as an unbiased opinion as a contribution :) 

a few years ago, i‚Äôve met the most handsomest guy at a friends party, we had a lot in common and the conversation was great. we exchanged info and he took me on a data and it was great, our relationship was great for a few months but then he randomly started ghosting and it was clear he had lots of commitment issues. i have lots of attachments issues so that wasn‚Äôt healthy. and for about a year it was a really exhausting cycle of him saying ‚Äúi‚Äôll change, i want you, blah blah blah‚Äù and us being happy for like a week then it goes down hill. almost like chasing a high. i‚Äôve decided to give him one last chance and honestly it‚Äôs been going great, he makes time and effort, he‚Äôs so much better at opening up and communicating. but i still can‚Äôt help it but have that fear that he‚Äôll eventually go back to ghosting me and it hurts so much. to mention, my friends and family are not fans of him as they thought the extra mental health troll he put on me during my first year of college. 

when we were apart for a while, i‚Äôve made a guy friend on twitter (hence my title is boyS lmaoo) and he‚Äôs amazing, he‚Äôs very very nice. almost obsessed with me, in a good way. he also expressed that he wants to make this serious, except he lives a few counties away (about a 400 miles from me) and he also mentioned he‚Äôd be happy to catch a flight over this winter break. but then of course my ex came back into my life and i completely stopped talking to the twitter guy bc yk cheating is unethical and all. and i feel absolutely horrible that i‚Äôve lead him on, although we‚Äôve never met he truly seemed like he cared and was interested. and a lil part of me still wants to know how things would‚Äôve turnt out with him. 

being alone for a while might a good option as well as that‚Äôs my biggest fear bc i‚Äôm so afraid of abatement. and i like both of them so i don‚Äôt really wanna be alone lmaoooo
i think i‚Äôm just stuck as i don‚Äôt want hurt neither of them but most importantly not hurt myself bc this is already a really stressful time during finals. 

any words of advice is appropriate!",02Dec2020,1

400,"So I am a high school freshman and I found an internship on Reddit. It sounded interesting and I didn‚Äôt think I would get it but they were asking for anyone (it was posted to r/teenagers). Anyways fast forward a few days and I started the internship (it‚Äôs for a startup project by an entrepreneur) and when I looked up the guy who ran it he seemed pretty legit.  So far the team is made up of interns (like 20, unpaid) and we have tasks we‚Äôve been given to look for funding, architects etc. Here‚Äôs where it starts to get confusing. When I looked at the post on Reddit and looked at the guy‚Äôs profile, he posted it to lots of different communities (not too strange, right?). I start to go through each of the individual posts and some of the comments are saying that what he is trying to build is impossible in the time frame given, and he has no funding right now so he‚Äôs looking for free labor. I really wanted an internship but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being naive about this. Also he partnered me with some woman on a task but I don‚Äôt know if I should continue. If I ghosted them would that be bad (also how do you ghost lol)? Pm me tell you what it is (he‚Äôs on Reddit and I don‚Äôt want him to know lmao)

when i was 11, my mom became pregnant with my little sister and i was extremely upset. i wanted nothing to do with her. i'm not sure if it was jealousy or what, but i was angry my parents were having another child. when she was born, i refused to visit my mom in the hospital or hold her. i referred to her as ""it"" until my parents made me stop.
i eventually grew to love her, but i still cannot refer to her by her name. she is now 8 years old and has asked me why i don't say her name. i never give a direct answer. when referring to her, i go out of my way to not say her name and say ""she's in the kitchen"" or whatever she's doing when talking to my parents. if they ask ""who?"", i respond with ""who do you think?"" or i completely ignore their question so i do not have to say her name.
i really want to fix this, but i'm not sure how. i know it seems as easy as just saying their names, but i cannot bring myself to do that. i know if i do it, my parents and sisters will make a big deal out of it and i won't want to continue.
i don't know if it's something in my head, but i feel like a freak. i'm going to be a grown woman calling my sisters ""sister"" and ""you"" or ""her.""

I did something to my dog when I was younger (DO NOT ATTEMPT)

I used to do things to my dog when I was younger (DO NOT ATTEMPT)

Disclaimer before I begin: I do not approve of this behavior, I do not encourage you to do this, please do not attempt in doing the things that I did. It is illegal and comes with serious consequences. This is a confession.

I Repeat: DO NOT DO THIS EVER.

I was your average 13 year old boy (I am 21 now) doing okay in school. Had a good amount of friends and a decent teacher that was fun to be around. Life was alright. I lived with my parents (I was the only child) and we had a family dog (Husky).
However, I was always constantly horny, this is normal as I was in puberty and was full of hormones. This went on and I grew hornier and hornier and I knew I had to do something about it. Until one day I was watching my dog play around in my room until it turned its back to me and I took a glance at its vagina. Then the idea came to my head, I was grossed out at first and I was thinking that this isn‚Äôt right. But I was so horny so I thought I could give it a try. I waited one day until my parents were out and I was home alone. I placed my dog on my bad and spread its legs. I already had a boner and my penis was pumping. I instituted my penis inside of my dogs vagina super slowly (I never wanted to hurt my dog). My godddd it felt so good, it was heaven. It was so damn tight and moist. I was going in and out faster and faster, my dog showed no sign of pain nor resistance. My dog had its mouth open and was breathing slightly heavier. I came inside her after 45 seconds. I was very grossed out after that still thinking about what on earth I did that day. But I was a very horny virgin with no brain.
My dog lived a long and happy life after that, don‚Äôt worry.

I come from a fairly well off family, and when I was young if I showed slight interest in a hobby they would always spend a ton of money on gifts related to such hobby.

This was only made worse by them constantly saying things like ‚Äúwe just bought you a very expensive (whatever) and now you decide you don‚Äôt care?‚Äù Multiple hobbies from when I was little (art, music, vidya, etc.) were ruined because of this, and now I‚Äôm 20 and my parents still act this way towards anything I show interest in.

417,"Hi Reddit,
So I‚Äôm looking for some advice, there‚Äôs this girl I have know for about 3 months now and we have become really good friends, we talk most days (mostly via text) in a group chat and see each other once or twice a week at college.

I have just come out of a 3 year long dark period in my life and I honestly think she has woken me up and taught me how wonderful life can be, I‚Äôve got a massive crush on her and I‚Äôm debating with myself whether to ask her out.

The issue is that, we have the same friends. I‚Äôm scared that if I get rejected I‚Äôll loose them or things will just be awkward after that. It feels very all or nothing.

*more details*
Yesterday, we was at college and there was this guy two years younger than her harassing her, via snapchat. She had already rejected him numerous times and wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer so me, *crush* and our other friend decided to mess with this guy a little. After our other friend went home *crush* and I are trying to throw this guy through a loop by letting him see us together.
We went back outside and it was just getting dark at this point then she started talking about her exes seemingly out of nowhere. I eventually gotta go home and we carry on texting because this kid was still messaging her (which we found hilarious) a couple of hours go by and we are still talking about this kid,

My other friend says ‚Äú*crush* atleast you have someone who has a crush on you (referring to the kid) not everyone is so fortunate‚Äù

I almost immediately follow that up with:
‚Äú*crush*, are you going out with anyone right now? Because if you are you should just tell him and he might stop chasing‚Äù

She said that she wasn‚Äôt but that she was talking with someone and that she had already tried saying that to the kid anyway.

It kinda threw me through a loop because I‚Äôm really crushing on her and I‚Äôm not sure if I should give up, carry on trying, or just straight up asking her out. Like I said before I‚Äôm scared to loose her as a friend if she rejects me. Any advice or words of wisdom are very much appreciated.",02Dec2020,1

420,"I‚Äôm currently fighting to pass my business class (Grade: 67%). I‚Äôm missed two homework‚Äôs and that decimated 30% of my grade. I‚Äôve talked to the Professor and she refuses to reason and says her hands are tied, but wishes she could help. She says she‚Äôs simply tied to the syllabus and cannot do anything different then what it says( bullshit). 

Other professors within the business department also have due dates for their assignments but BECAUSE of COVID-19 they decided to be more lenient and allow students to go at their own paste or some of allowed us to remake up missed assignments. 

I sent a lengthy email to the head director of the business department to appeal. He took several days to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù just to later come back to me and say ‚Äúwhatever is in the syllabus is what I have to go by for an appeal of the grade, so if there is a deadline that‚Äôs what it is.‚Äù He said the Professor probably doesn‚Äôt want to make an exception for me and not for everyone else who could also be in the same boat. THEN he said ‚Äúbut you and me can make a side deal because see, I also teach this class and if you retake it with me online during the winter intermission then I‚Äôll keep all your good grades the same from this current class and let you make up the two assignments you missed. That‚Äôs all you‚Äôd have to do to pass.‚Äù WHAT?!

SCAM ALERT!!!!!

So he is willing to let me retake the class where all I have to do is make up the two homework‚Äôs I missed to pass and transfer my grade from the class I‚Äôm currently begging to get help in but that‚Äôs somehow not possible because of the ‚Äúexception‚Äù she would be making with me but somehow THIS is ok? I would say his ‚Äúdeal‚Äù is a way bigger exception than me asking to make up an assignment in the class I‚Äôm already in....

What do I do now as I go to the level two of the appeal?

Not necessary to read but these were the arguments I made in the email: 

‚ÄúGiven this new reality, I was under the impression that professors would work with students to help make this transition easier, but instead we‚Äôre faced with more hardship and less aid. For example, paying out of state tuition to teach ourselves courses with the same workload customarily lectured in 15 weeks now being condensed into 8 weeks.

These are my arguments:
1. There were no reminders of upcoming assignments being due for Nov. 8th or Nov. 15th and those are the only two assignments I missed. I have proof of every email sent out by the professor and those are the weeks no emails were emitted. The last email was sent out Oct. 31st. It‚Äôs not a requirement for professors to do this, but since she began the course by sending out the weekly notifications, it was unexpected for her to stop. Given that we‚Äôre paying the same rate of tuition and not being taught (not even through zoom) ‚Äîsomething as simple as sending out weekly messages to check-in and remind us that they‚Äôre here to help and lessen the burden of this new reality has believe it or not made a difference in our outcomes. My final grade in two completed courses proves that. They were both 8-week courses as well and I almost passed with a 90% in both. Both professors sent out weekly reminders of the approaching due dates.
2. There are 6 homework‚Äôs each worth 140 points. I missed two modules and that ended up being 30% of my semester grade decimated. The final is only worth 160 points. Hardly the value of one module. There‚Äôs no way to dig myself out of any hole even though I‚Äôve excelled in every assignment I‚Äôve taken including the final which I received an 85%. The final should be the best representation of my knowledge in the course.¬†
3. Other Professors have opened up the class to try and accommodate everyone‚Äôs schedules. Due to the pandemic and how it has affected academic affairs, why does it matter if an assignment is turned in Friday night or at the end of the semester when the semester is already shortened by several weeks? There would be no way to argue not having enough time to complete a task if you had all semester to do it. If there were assignments that needed to be graded by a human, I understand that would be something that takes time, and would need strict due dates to make sure the TA is not grading 300 papers at once, but that‚Äôs not the case here. A computer is grading it as soon as it‚Äôs submitted. I feel that we‚Äôre almost being set up to fail.
4. In the syllabus it states that the course and the university strive to obtain social justice and flexibility. Under flexibility it says ‚ÄúThe schedule is tentative and subject to change [‚Ä¶.] to specific needs of the class. The needs of the class pertain to the needs of the students it caters to. Tentative means ‚Äònot certain or fixed; provisional‚Äô. How is that being displayed in the class when the professor refuses to make any changes given the poor effects it has on the needs of the class?
5. I‚Äôve done extremely well in the class and have proven to have knowledge of the material. That should account for something. My Professor saying her hands are tied and wishes she had better news is appalling given the situation.¬†‚Äú

421,"During training we were fine, I legit thought it was a woman anyway and I just treated her normally. A few times she stood up and her bottom was entirely revealed. I felt sick having to look at it but I brushed it off as her being clumsy.

I call her ""she"" too so she feels comfortable. Again, no issue from me. I even helped her sort out a problem she was having with the manager who was treating her unfairly.

Now, however, she's been flirting with a male colleague who has told me he feels very uncomfortable and that she won't leave him alone. Whenever I'm talking with this colleague, she looks at me like she wants to kill me. I'm going to sound trans-phobic but I need to paint the picture of what the colleague is experiencing.

A big fat man named Richard is dressed as a woman &amp; is stalking my colleague on social media, tries to ring him at night via messenger, flirts with him at work in person and on work emails EVEN though the colleague has said he's not interested and he's very uncomfortable. This man also drops his trousers to reveal his entire ass literally about 10 times a day. He has since started giving me threatening looks at work because I talk to the colleague he's ""into"".

422,"So I (18F) live at home with my mum (48F) and my dad (63M). I'm getting really upset and uncomfortable being around my dad because he's almost definitely addicted to porn. For a bit of context, my parents are definitely sexually active, they make jokes about it, and when I was 13 I accidentally found their sex diary (with accompanying photos). Like they are entitled to their own life so I don't care about this although leaving it around with young children was not a good idea. What I do care about is the fact that my dad is constantly on porn sites while I am in the room (with my mother in the room too). He is always scrolling through videos, looking at pictures, reading stories and worse sexting random women on these websites. First off I've never looked through his computer, its the first thing you see when you walk into the living room and its a little hard not to notice the young lady's very large photo of her *cough cough*. My brother, who has now moved out, had also noticed this as it has been happening for a number of years and he is not discrete at all, he would let my brother fix his computer with open porn tabs on it. Like watching porn is one thing, but doing it in the same room at teenage children and messaging other women on there constantly is just vile in my opinion. It's gotten worse since my brother left and is now a daily occurrence. I keep seeing 'Family' stories on his computer when I'm in the room and pictures of girls not much older than me. I'm so uncomfortable in my own house, I won't even walk into the bathroom from my room unless I'm fully clothed and I keep something in front of my door so people can't just walk in. I don't know what to do, I have no family I can stay with and I need to be home to study for my A levels and University interviews. I have told my friends and they are disgusted and I know there are adults (teachers and a youth mental health worker) I could talk to. But I know if it went that far my dad could lose his job and I don't know how much my mum knows about him messaging people, or would even accept how bad it is as she accepts him doing other things (yelling and swearing constantly). She's got depression and I don't know what this would do to her. I'm just completely uncomfortable in my own house and I don't know what I can do or how bad things would get if I talked to an adult as it is an invasion of my dad's privacy and it's not a child protection issue as I'm 18 now.
Anyone know what I can do?",02Dec2020,1
423,"I am 22 M currently studying in my bachelor. I met this girl let's call her Anna around about 2 years ago. She was a constant member in the group of people that I was hanging out a lot with. we were roasting each other constantly basically a constant competition of who can talk more shit. 
And eventually started dating and and she kinda instantly moved in into my room. Everything was awesome for the first two months and I loved this girl with a burning passion.
I believed I was the luckiest man on this planet and ignore the forest of red flags that was in front of me. But after two months shit hits the fan in my life changed. 

I got the message from my dad that my mom lost her home and my dad took this monster in.
I instantly became afraid and worried for my brother my dad and my older sister because this woman is like a Lucid Nightmare that you can't wake up from and nearly drove my brother into suicide.

This combined with the Stress of studying broke me and I broke down in front of my girlfriend and started crying like a bitch and told her what was going on. After this night she never looked at me the same. 

I'm a big believer in self improvement and tried afterwards to have everything else in order. I Stop drinking like a maniac.   started to exercise and last round about forty pounds. I tried to study even harder and to be a good boyfriend.
I never forgot an important date an surprised her often  with flowers and a selfmade Candle-Light-Dinner.
I always put her needs before mine and tried to be less stubborn. 
 I really wanted this relationship to work so I would have a little bit of stability in my life
 but everything started to fall apart, our sex life became awful, she started to be extremely messy and did not react when I told her to her mess up, she was constantly annoyed and I had the constant feeling that she tried to push my buttons as hard as possible. she drove me Furious nearly every day,  but I always hade myself under control  and tried to be calm and rational. 

I offen tried to talk to the guy that I considered my best friend back then let's call him Max because he hade seemingly a perfect relationship with his girl and knew Anna really well. I told him that I had the constant feeling that she's doing some kind of shit tests on me. And that she's driving me Furious with that.
But his help didn't help at all. He basically told me everytime the same thing. 
there's no need to get mad, you're seeing things that aren't there,  you don't know what happened to her in the Past and and I told you that she will be a difficult woman to be in a relationship with.
This motherfuker eventually told me in a drunken state did he would have dated Anna if he didn't have met his girl.
Needless to say I was done with this friendship after this moment account. 

 the part of"" you don't know what happened in her past"" started to bother me a lot. I started to think the i needed to open up more so did she will feel comfortable telling me more about her past. 
 but nope I got nothing not even a single sentence. 
I started to believe that I was at fault hier. I became insecure because seemingly everyone knew something about the past of anna.

My desire for stability in my life grow stronger and stronger because it felt like everything around me was pure Chaos and I became obsessed about her past. 
I started to listen really careful to every little detail about her past thet her friends spilt out in a drunken state and learnt that she used to take more drugs that I could even name.  fucked around quite a lot( im nr. 19 btw.). Cheated on a couple of guys because of boredom. Had a couple of physically abusive relationships and had apparently no friends as a child and got bullied. 

I nearly lost my mind.
 I didn't really cared about the details because I believe that people can change and become something better than they used to be! 
 I wasn't a saint either
I just couldn't understand why she was keeping me in the dark even after i told her everything about my past. 
Every fucked up thing that I did in my life
Or relationship grow more miserable everyday. 
She became more and more depressed. And I started to basically do the everything in our apartment. 
 she was a disgusting mess but I loved her with my heart and tried to make it work. 
But eventually we were visiting her hometown again and met up with a couple of her friends one of them was too drunk to go home and she brought him upstairs to sleep on the couch. I didn't Trusted this guy it all because I overheard him a couple of minutes earlier saying that he would love to fuck her.  something feelt of and I sneaked upstairs and heard them flirting and lost it and exploded . I would have beaten the living Shit out of him if it wasn't for her. We went into a different room to talk she cried apologized and told me that she doesn't deserve me and begt for another chance and was foolish enough... 
Or relationship become better for while but than I started to notice weird behavio. 
I found out that she was cheating... 
 and finally broke up with her. 

I was So heartbroken
I couldn't concentrate myself and failed every exam in the semester and fall into a deep depression for a year. some weeks where so bad that I didn't had the energy to leave my bed in this entire week. Luckily I got my shit together again and found myself an amazing girlfriend who is the definition of an angel.

But im still Asking Myself
 was it my fault  that everything went down this way?

Plus Gucci has started sneezing again, i really dont want to go through this again. She also trys to make me feel bad by saying how much it cost put him to sleep, she says that the reason louie died is because I didnt clean the cage enough time, or the reason he was losing weight was because I didnt watch him eat every veggie, when I would watch him drag the pepper into the hideout. I mean its pretty obvious why he was not doing well. Guys, this is why you take ur guinea pig to the vet at the first signs of sickness. I actully had to BEG her to bring her to the vet, and when she finally did, it was to late. I just really hope we can get gucci a friend because I dont want him to die.

429,"TW: Mention of sexual assault and bereavement

I (19F) moved into private student accommodation this year with 4 friends for my first year of university.

I don't really know how to put this so I'm just going to list things in chronological order-ish. I moved into a flat with 4 friends (19/20, 3bFs and 1 M) and one stranger (32M). At the start of the year, everything went well and I adjusted to living independently for the first time rather well. I am doing a difficult course at a redbrick university in England so the work is pretty intense. I work 7 days a week, tending to aim to work from 10 till 6 every day, sometimes I work a few hours less and sometimes I work till 8/9 at night. After doing all of this, I'm still behind in two of my four modules. This is not from a lack of trying. Trust me.

Long story short, during the first few weeks of living in accommodation, myself and two if my roommates (19F and 20F) were sexually assaulted and harassed by the roommate I didn't know before moving in (32M). We reported him to the management of the building listing what he'd done in an email on a Thursday evening, we had a reply on Friday saying that the manager would deal with this on Monday as she didn't work weekends, leaving us all living with him over the weekend. We had a meeting with her on the Monday where she gave us two options; she could tell h that complaints had been made and advise him to move rooms or we could all move out (all 5 of us). When we first moved in we reported MANY issues with our flat and asked for them to be fixed and were told we would be given another option of flat to live in- they never got back to us so at the time we left it there assuming that no other flats were available. Because they didn't bother getting back to us about another flat then, we didn't have much faith in that being much different this time so we chose to have her talk to him. 

We assumed she would talk to him that day. She didn't. She left it a week. A week where we still had to live with him and avoid the common areas as much as possible as he would sit and watch us when we cooked and you can't leave because you were cooking and locking our bedroom doors because he had a habit of walking in without invitation and refusing to leave. Once she did talk to him, he refused to leave. The manager then said that she couldn't do anything else even though they have a 'zero tolerance policy' and told us we had to go to the police. 

We reported him to the police, made statements and he was arrested. This was one of the first days I'd had off studying since I started the course a month before. 

From about two/three weeks from moving in I heard a scratching in my ceiling which I recorded and showed to reception. They told me they'd get pest control in. Today is just over two months from moving in and yesterday, the mice caused a hole in my ceiling and fell through whilst I was studying onto my bed. Had I been sleeping they would have landed on my face.

 Two weeks ago my grandad died and on Thursday (6 days ago) I went to his funeral.

The rats were the straw that broke the camel's back so to speak. I cried in front of my friend of three years for the first time (I HATE people seeing me cry) and almost cried over even the smallest of things all day yesterday. I couldn't even face doing my laundry so slept under my duvet with no cover on. I can't concentrate, I was supposed to go food shopping two days a go but I can't face it so I'm living off of meals I've frozen over the last few weeks and canned soup and I have a test next week that I need to revise for as we as lectures I've tried to watch but can't physically focus on but I didn't work yesterday so I need to today or I just won't get everything done in time.

Oh, and the ex-roommate who sexually assaulted us is trying to move back into the building (not the same flat specifically) and the staff haven't said no, claiming it's up to the police but the police officers I've talked to made it very clear it was a bad idea and said that they would tell the manager that weeks ago. Our theory is that they'll let him back in once the investigation is over as it's unlikely to end in a conviction because they want the money from rent.
His stuff is still in our flat, they won't make his cousin pick it up so we have to live with it in the kitchen as a constant reminder. We even bagged it up for him.

I'm overwhelmed and don't know what to do. 
How do I concentrate better?
How do I deal with all this stress?
How do I not want to cry at even the smallest of things?
How do I cope with the grief?

TLDR: I was sexually assaulted, my grandad died and mice fell though my ceiling making my room unliveable. Help.",02Dec2020,1

434,"I's beeen a while since I had this idea running in my mind and I have recently learned her true nature of her character (I.e. it's only what my brothers told me because I am not currently in my home country due to study reasons)  


The story begins with this one girl (let's call her Lady Maskless) that got into our family thanks to my mother's colleague who started a relationship with her. My mother and the colleague would hang out frequently and that's where I see the problem. But, my mother has a lung condition and it I see it as a potential problem.  


Lady Maskless is your typical COVID denier (only talked to her for short time but you can easily make up an image asking the right questions) and she told me few weeks ago that due to her skin's condition that would, as she claims, cause her rash across all her covered face were she to wear a mask. This, I fully understand that would make one uncomfortable and it could be a health issue, and due to the nature of my country she needed a paper from doctor confirming she can't have a mask at all.  But that's where the hammer missed the nail.  


Fast forward 1 or 2 weeks my older brother was visiting our mum (he lives across the country) and he met this Lady Maskless in person, and learned her true nature. The way she handles the documentation from her doctor is the reason, I believe, she's completely fine and wearing a mask for a short period of time would not cause her any issues, if at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, whenever she goes to a shop/bus/train etc. she would never let them know ahead that she can't wear a mask for a health issues, instead, she chooses to behave like an arrogant prick, waits till they ask her out, smile from ear to ear and then unleash her favorite sentence ""*I don't have to have a mask, I have paper""*  in the most condescending tone of her voice she can do. The worst part of it is all, before she goes to any shop, she always goes like ""*I can't wait to tell them to (fuck off) that I have a paper and laugh at them afterwards how they got 'owned'.""*   


Well, this is becoming an issue but that's still not a complete picture. Not only she behaves just to feed her fragile ego, but whenever she sees fit she must mention and proceed to boast about her own behavior to others (which is, in my opinion, horrible), to look like a *badass*, and how she can ignore any restriction given to her. The other problem with her is that she goes easily 0-100 to her aggressive side so arguing with her will be pointless.  


The thing is, how do I formulate the message in a way to not trigger her bad side of her character and to not hurt her ego but also, to not damage any relation between my mother and them (Lady Maskless + mother's colleague), that's not my goal but if there's no other way how to solve that, I'll have to take this route.   


Because, in my opinion, if she has an issue to wear a mask for a few minutes while taking bus across the city to visit my mum or to do her shopping I have a valid reason to deny her visiting my family at all, as she could easily turned into a super-spreader and just cause more damage by her reckless behavior.",02Dec2020,1

My mom got diagnosed with breastcancer last year. She has undergone chemo, radiation, amputation and we (my sister and I) have been there with her through everything. Doctors visits, chemo days, sick days, holidays, good news, bad news. We don't live with her anymore, but we speak to each other daily and we both live fairly close (not together) and have flexibility at work that we can adjust our schedule when necessary for her. At the beginning of the pandemic this year, we got the news that there was nothing left they could do for her and she has months left to live. We've been struggling with this since then. Initially we all started planning and arranging things as far as paperwork, what to do with the house, her business, euthanasia, etc. but now that that's taken care of, it's just everyday life and we have happy moments and difficult moments. She's now in an experimental study to prolong her life a little. Doctors are very surprised she's still alive, they never thought this would be the case and they actually said last week that because of the study, the tumors that came back this year have already shrunk 70%, which they never thought would happen.

Now for the Christmas dilemma part. Our country has communicated that we can only spend Christmas with 1 extra person **per household** because of the coronavirus and the recent spikes. Problem is that we have 3 households and 5 people. My mom and her boyfriend, me and my boyfriend and my sister. Which means that if we follow the rules, we cannot celebrate Christmas together. Christmas eve (we don't really do Christmas day) is kind of a big deal for our mom as it turns out. My mom and sister already said they were not following the rules as this is a special situation: it might be her last Christmas. I was having difficulty with this because if everyone in the country thinks they are exempted and that they are in a special situation, we will still be in this pandemic in another year. But I was going to fold anyway as it could be indeed her last Christmas, and to not hurt anyone's feelings. My boyfriend was going to spend Christmas with his family, his parents live in another country for the time being and his sisters live about an hour away from us. But because of border controls and just safety in general, they decided last week as a family that they will not be spending Christmas together, and will just videochat the day of during dinner. 

Now this makes it difficult for me. This means that my boyfriend will be home alone on Christmas eve while I will be spending it a 2 hours drive(\*) away from home and cannot come back the same evening because of the corona curfew. I just cannot imagine leaving him home to spend it alone. He says he doesn't mind but I do. I won't enjoy myself knowing he's all alone having dinner by himself while the rest of the country is with the people they love. I talked to my mom about this and of course she suggested that he come as well. However, I talked to him about it and he put his foot down and said no. Reasons being it's what the government says to do + he can't see his family but then goes to mine? that's just not okay, and I completely support him in this decision. So I suggested to my mom that me and my boyfriend stay home and videochat everyone (my mom, her boyfriend, my sister) during dinner and afterwards. I thought I could still make it fun by making it interactive so I suggested I could make a quiz, we could watch a movie together on discord, etc. but she's having a difficult time with it. My sister told me that my mom called her afterwards that he's upset and that she wants to rediscuss with me (we haven't talked yet, but will probably tonight or tomorrow) and that she even wants to discuss this 1 to 1 with my boyfriend to change his mind which I'm not a fan of.

I don't know what to do. Will I be a horrible daughter for saying I cannot leave my boyfriend? For context, we've been living together for more than 4 years, we bought a house together, we will get married in the next few years so it's not a 'new' relationship or one that could be done soon, he's my partner, for life, and I don't want to leave him behind. Or should I prioritize my mom's Christmas as it could be her last? I feel like that would be the easy answer, if it weren't for leaving someone behind. I don't feel like it is my task (or my moms task for that matter, but she's wanting to call him about it, I don't like that) to change his mind to come anyway. He's his own person, he should be able to be his own person. Him and his family, they are the ones that are following the rules. He hasn't seen his family in over 6 months. We are the ones potentially breaking it, we shouldn't be telling him what to do.

In an ideal situation, of course we would spend Christmas together but if she wasn't sick, I would be putting my foot down as well and saying ""no, it's for everyone's safety"". But now that it could be her last I'm so torn. I just know the conversation will be very emotional and I'm worried she will be using her words to 'guilt' me into coming by saying she's dying and that I would choose my boyfriend over her and if she does that, I will cave or get emotional and mad about the whole situation and I just want to be prepared a little. Maybe I'm choosing wrong, maybe I'm overthinking everything. I feel like this whole situation is just too much. It's just dinner. But apparently she find it more important that I thought. Maybe I really should just leave my boyfriend home alone, he even said he doesn't mind, but if it was the other way around, I would feel so shitty. I wouldn't enjoy myself anyway, knowing he's all alone so far away. Also, it's just a meal together, we have plenty of other memories to keep forever. This is now turning into a possible shitty Christmas memory anyways, just from all the drama. Who cares if Christmas isn't the same as before, it won't be the same for anyone in the world this year but we can still enjoy it over chat, can't we. Essentially it's just another dinner. Also, she's doing much better say the doctors, what if this is not her last. Will we have another drama next year? Also if this is her last, Christmas won't be the thing I will worry about in the future. we have so many other good days and memories. I'm so conflicted in my thinking. Please help. Should I put my fut down and compromise and just do it over videochat or should I just ditch my boyfriend and the government rules and go anyway because it's so important to her.

(\*)My mom lives close to me half of the time, but the other half of her time she lives with her boyfriend in a house he built and that's about 2 hours from here. She loves it there. It's good for her health and very peaceful and quiet. We would be celebrating Christmas at that house, which is a 2 hour drive. This is relevant because that means I cannot go there √°nd come back home the same day because of corona curfew rules.",02Dec2020,1

I only really converse with my parents when I leave the house, when I come back, and meal times. My parents dont talk to eachother and they practically live on opposite floors.

I'm going to be moving in with my boyfriend soonish and I'm terrified. I'm afraid to share a space. I'm afraid to not be able to isolate myself and be alone when I need/want to. In the new house I'll have an art studio room so there will be a place to be alone but I'm nervous about sharing a room, sharing a bed. I should be excited for this step but I've been crying myself to sleep the last few nights just terrified about giving up my comforts. I dont want to ruin our relationship because of my own stupid thoughts, but I'm afraid to voice them to him. I dont want him to think I dont want to be there, I'm just scared of the unknown. 

Any advice?",02Dec2020,1
456,"So I am in a dilemma. We had purchased tickets earlier this year to visit my girlfriends family in Hawaii. We would be flying from Boston. We cancelled our trip due to the pandemic and we pushed the trip to Christmas with the hopes that things might die down.

I really think it‚Äôs just wise of us to stay home and get a credit from the airline and maybe go next Christmas. My girlfriend on the other hand isn‚Äôt as concerned as I am at all. She basically just keeps telling me we will take precautions and wear masks to keep ourselves safe. Now I‚Äôve never flown before, and I‚Äôm not so much afraid of planes or traveling.

Hi there!
I'm a 14yr old male which is in 10th grade.There is this guy at school who likes to bully me for no actual reason other to get attention from me (I guess). I became very sad (not suicidal) and even cried myself to sleep. We even told his parents that we'll sue them if he does not stop. He created accounts everywhere with my name and some insult. The school did absolutely fucking nothing (like most schools do).

Reasons:

Violent beheaviour against me, Stealing and breaking my things, Harassment, Insulting (Is sueable in my country) etc.

467,"Hi guys. I (20, F) am once again posting about my boyfriend (mid twenties, M) I'll get right into it: my boyfriend has digestive related health problems. It keeps him up at night, if he eats anything that is fried, sugary, basically not a salad, he flares up really bad. He has to get up to pee 9000x throughout the night. He has been to the doctor and no one was really figured it out, one just gave him meds that they give to older kids who still wet the bed, and they help him sleep very well. One thing, however, is he has never told any doctors about his laxitive abuse. He was overweight in highschool, abused laxitives, and now goes to the gym and is very attentative to his health. He knows laxitive abuse can cause permanent change to the stomach lining and large and small intestines, yet he said doctors should be able to diagnose him without that. I told him next time he does to confess, because currently they have no idea how damaged his gut can be. However....

He is also extremely depressed. He lost jobs over this ailment. He struggles sleeping, said he wants to die, but upon further question he said he doesn't want to die, it just feels good to say.... He does not believe in therapy at all. He thinks if he can find a cure to his physical problems, his mental problems will go away. While I 100% agree his physical problems have given him some mental health issues and made him depressed, I also tried to explain that his mental health can make his physical health worse. He does not believe that, or he does, but he still only wants to treat the physical issue. I explained it with my ezcema, it is caused by the immune system, but it can lead to stress and mental illness and self confidence issues, and stress can in turn worsen eczema like a violent cycle. He did not seem to respond... I told him while I cant force him, he needs to consider his mental health. I again suggested he see a therapist, he is in the army he can get one for free. I said if he feels uncomfortable, to at least start journaling again. He journaled during basic to keep him sane. 

I don't think he is gonna do either. Ive talked to his mental health before... How while you should take care of your body, he takes it to an extreme.. How not everyone casually abuses laxatives and stops... How he has a very rough childhood that probably affected him more than he likes to admit (he was the youngest child as his parents went through a rough divorce, one was not the best partner and abused the other.) He plays video games and I understand its normal to trash talk to an extent, but he takes it a little further than I am comfortable with. He also takes a lot of issue with himself being wrong, and apologizing, and says there is no reason to apologize if your wrong your wrong and you move on. I dont think these are healthy things, and his mental health and upbringing show even when he is not dealing with his physical health. Is there anything I can do to get him the help he needs? I thought of even throwing down an ultimatum to this, but I really don't want to do that because I know how abusive ultimatums can be, and I really dont want to leave him. 

Tldr: my boyfriend is suffering physical problems. It is giving him extreme mental health issues. He wants to treat his mental health by only treating his physical health, which could be a permanent thing that cant be treated. I think his mental health is amplifying his problems and he should treat it, he does not believe in therapy. Any way to get him to take his mental health seriously..?",02Dec2020,1

But the more i dig, deeper it becomes.

473,"So I am 23 years old. I am going into my last year of school starting this spring, for my finance degree. The only other job i have worked is a remote telemarketing job, that pays 10 an hour with some small commissions for each sale. I have been searching through indeed applying for countless other remote jobs, to see if I can find something better/more interesting.  


Well I currently have just been offered a job, after a couple phone interviews with 2 business partners in the real estate wholesale business. The job i would be working is commission only. I would be calling people from my home, and asking them if they want to sell their home. If they say yes, i would be peeling back the onion a bit more, asking them about the condition and things like that. After i get enough information from them, i would then transfer the to a higher up, to set an appointment to go look at the property.  


So basically my job is to set as many appointments as I can, so that i can increase my chances on the company buying the house from them. The company would then sell the property for a gain, and then 14-30 days after the company sells the property, is when i would get my commission for it. The man had told me that the average money I would receive from commission would be around $1,000 a house, sometimes more so of like $2,000 if it is a big property.  


Basically, i would not be receiving any money for the first month most likely, because he says i need to build a ""pipeline"" which I guess makes sense. He had told me that this is not the job for someone who cannot handle rejection and make a lot of calls per day. This is also a 1099 job, but he wants me to set up a schedule where i can put in at least 20 hours per week.   


I had also asked him how many others were working my position, and he told me i would be the 3rd person, as they recently hired the first two very recently. He had told me that only 1 person was making the calls pre-covid, and that he was very motivated and calling tons of ppl per week, but then covid happened and they shut down the wholesale side of the business for a few months. They are just recently getting back to starting up their wholesale side again, hence why I found their application on indeed.  


Thing is, is that I actually have a phone interview this Friday, for an inside sales job that pays $11.80 an hour, its not a 1099 so id be an ""employee"". Do i tell him that I need more time, and that ill get back to him at the end of the week?

&amp;#x200B;

Is this something worth risking? Does it sound like it could be a good opportunity? I like to think it is possibly a good opportunity, but it comes with the risk of not getting paid and then me eventually quitting and wasting weeks/ a month or so of my time. Then again, I am a college student living at home, where my father makes me pay pretty much nothing to live here, besides my phone bill. So realistically i have time to be wasted (not that i want to, but its not like I'm struggling to pay bills living alone). It seems like i could potentially make a good amount more at this job than the $11,80 an hour one, but i also could potentially make way less or nothing, and waste my time. The guy had told me that if i put in at least 20 hours a week and i am doing a decent job, that i could make around $40k a year doing something like this, but is that just him sugarcoating it? I have no idea.   


I had also asked him if ppl were really willing to sell their homes during this pandemic, and he said that it seems like ppl are just as willing to sell, and that he plans on 2021 being a big year for ppl to sell their homes. I do not have a lot of knowledge about real estate, but it has been something  that i have been interested in, even before this job came along.",02Dec2020,1

My dad is always telling me to find a career that won't be replaced by computers and this sounds like a career that wouldn't be replaced by any computers anytime soon.

I, have had a strenuous relationship with his girlfriend of like 8/10 years. I‚Äôve GENUINELY tried and tried and tried with her. But anytime I do anything slightly wrong, she (50F) will post on Facebook about how shitty of a person I am without directly tagging me. And I‚Äôve honestly never done her any wrong doing, my mistakes are forgetting to put a trash bag back in the can. Or not loading the dishwasher properly. But nonetheless, I always try my hardest to make it work and take her nonsense with a grain of salt. She has always been like this, even since I was a child before they started dating.

Then found out a couple days ago, they‚Äôre getting married this month and, I‚Äôve talked to him 3 times since he told my uncle and grandmother, and he still hasn‚Äôt told me, or invited me.

My (24F) boyfriend's grandfather passed away a couple of weeks ago. Next week we are going to say our final goodbyes to him.  It's going to be a very small, discreet funeral, and only the family will be attending. 


The only funeral I have attended to was when I was a child and my mom was the one who picked my clothes for me, so I really do not know what I can wear. Since it's just the immediate family (and us partners) I am guessing we are allowed to dress more ""casual"", but I am not sure what that means. Are there any rules or restrictions with make up, hair, accessiories or colours?

I didn‚Äôt knew he would approached me there. I went to the public bathroom then when I went out, he was standing not exactly in front of the bathroom but he was just nearby with other crewmen.

Then.. I found out he was 27.. and way older than me. I was so bothered by our age gap. I tried but nothing really connects us. He was looking for someone to get married with.

Hi everyone - I could really use some advice. My 17 year old nice is very obese. 

Some background: 
My parents have custody of my two nieces. They've had custody since they were little. Both of their parents haven't been around since the beginning. Her dad passed away a few years ago from a drug overdose and we have no idea where their mother is. Needless to say, they don't have a traditional upbringing. Additionally, My parents own a diner in the Midwest, and they are extremely unhealthy people. 

My 17yr old niece is about 6ft tall and around 280 lbs. She's  wears a size 14 in women's shoes too! So she's naturally pretty big. Her weight/diet is very concerning to me though. Anytime she's gone to the doctor she refuses to stand on a scale. The doctor has warned her and my parents about her being pre- diabetic. I've fought with her and my parents about her diet and how it needs to change. 

I live in Texas so I can't be with her every day....when I do visit home though, I try to get her to walk with me and workout with me. I try to make it fun.... I've even tried purchasing a gym membership, but she refuses to go. I know she's uncomfortable in her own skin. My parents said they tried to send her to therapy but it didn't work out. 


The only other thing I can think of is writing her a letter to let her know how stressed I am about this. 

I feel like at some point she has to take responsibility for herself.

it's been almost a year since we last spoke and i've started to become worried about them. at first i was extremely numb from the whole situation to the point where i didn't even realise how awful my behaviour was. since then i've become a lot more aware and acknowledging of it but now i am having a difficult time handling the guilt. i feel incredibly guilty for the way that i acted and the way that i treated them. i worry that the way i treated them is/will affect them mentally.

i know i can't change what i did in the past but that is what's eating me alive. i wish there was something i could do to apologise to them or to make things better but i don't really see that being a possibility. i wish i could help even though i am the one who caused this. my last concern is reconciling with them because i know i don't deserve that. i just want to know they'll be okay and if i can help it at all.

the last thing i want to do is bother them or disrupt their peace from me and i know for sure there's no way they'd contact me. moving on from the situation just feels wrong. it's like how am i supposed to move on and forget about all this and feel fine knowing i have deeply hurt someone. it's not possible and i really don't know what to do. if anyone has any advice that would be very appreciated.",02Dec2020,1

After putting up with three weeks of this I told her that we needed to not speak to each other for a while. Fast forward to a little over a week ago and she texts me (ignoring no contact and the boundaries I set up to specifically protect myself) to angrily rant about a quote in my Instagram bio which she thought was some sort of public degradation of her. So on top of everything else I know shes looking at my social media. Shes blocked but is definitely the type to create burner accounts just to look.

533,"Hello, I need an outsiders view and opinion asap on what I should do. So I just got a male 3month old german shepherd  puppy from a couple who said there new apartment didn't allow dogs. They said they got him from the amish but that was all the information I recieved regarding his background. When I asked the important questions like ""does he like other dogs"", ""is he aggressive"", etc. They said no he's super sweet and just plays and sleeps. The first day everything was going fine he was adjusting well didn't seem to be skiddish. But that night my friend was taking a picture of him and he lunged with a mean bark at her and put a hole in her sweatshirt from the bite. I tried to correct the behavior and tell him ""NO"". I kind of just brushed it off though because it was a new environment and he could just have been overstimulated or something. Then the next day everything was going good until I grabbed my sock from his mouth and he mean barked and jumped to bite my leg. I told him no and again tried to correct the behavior. Everyday since then there has been atleast one incident during the day when he does that. Yesterday it was really weird though because my and my sister had just got back from taking him on a walk and as I was going to hang up his leash me and my sister were just talking, not evening looking at him or showing any attention towards him and he aggressivley barked and bit her coat and put a hole in it from the bite. This caught us completely off guard because we have no idea what could have triggered him to do that. I asked the couple if he has ever done this before and they said no, but I find that very hard to believe. Ever since I got him I have been nonstop stressed out and crying the 24/7, which I feel horrible about because I don't want him to see me constantly upset. I thought he would help my anxiety, but it is to whole other level now, and I feel like I'm constantly nauseous. I'm only 19 and I always wanted a puppy,but I know I should have asked them more questions. It's  hard because I want the best for him and I know he is my responsibiltly, but I feel terrible. In my heart I feel like it's not meant to be because he needs someone with lots of german shepherd experience and has the time and skills to raise him, whereas I have only been around dogs raised with the help of my family.  I am also a student so I currently don't have a ton of time or access to a ton of resources. Because I dont know his lineage either I have no clue how his parents behaved or how the amish treated him. I dug myself in a hole and I need advice ASAP!",02Dec2020,1

538,"Hi all, first time poster in this sub. Appreciate any opinions or advice.

My ex wife and I split last year and the day after she told me she was leaving she changed back to her maiden name on all social media and legally a few days later. (Which I later found out was a bat signal for the guy she was seeing, but that‚Äôs a different story)

We‚Äôre parents to a beautiful girl that starts school next year. she has a very outgoing, bright and happy personality and makes friends easily.

We share the same last name that is definitely unfortunate in meaning to say the least. I was teased a bit as a kid and still get the odd comment when I meet new people from time to time, but I remember as a kid it was pretty rough at times. 

I‚Äôve been thinking about changing our surname to my mother‚Äôs maiden name so my daughter doesn‚Äôt have to go through the same thing growing up, Maybe I‚Äôm getting old but it seems kids are even more relentless these days. I approached my ex with the idea and she said she was thinking the same thing however she wants my daughter to have her name instead and was pretty firm on that decision, saying ‚ÄúI have no connection to your mothers name‚Äù (Even though she was willing to give up our name within 24 hours.) I remember the day she left telling me she was changing her name and she said 

I‚Äôm not really sure what to do, My daughter is the only family I have (where I live, I left home and moved halfway across the world for my ex) and I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of having a different name than her. But at the same time I don‚Äôt want her to go through the senseless teasing and name calling that could potentially change her amazing personality. There‚Äôs also the difficulties that may arise travelling with my daughter if we have different last names but that‚Äôs not really what I‚Äôm worried about.

545,"Ok, so I'm going to try and cut an incredibly long and confusing story short here:

Back in March I lost my ""job"" i was freelancing, but only with 1 company as it wasn't really planned.
I was told the work wasn't over and they would get back to me.

This was a pretty small company, who I'd been helping to increase their online sales, we were pretty friendly and the company owner came to my house a few times.
We planned to start another business together etc.

I lost this job supposedly because of the virus, but at the time I was excluded from all government help, so I was having a very rough time &amp; wondering how to survive.
Because of this my mental state was pretty messed up &amp; I believed that I had been fired, as I wasn't getting a response ( I'm still not entirely sure I wasn't fired).

We started arguing &amp; I told them I was taking down the hosting I was paying for, which probably slightly impacted their sales.
A few weeks later I apologised and offered to fix this.

I had silence for a while but then a response, after I explained what happened to me they said they would pay me to fix it &amp; we could ""draw a line under it""

I tried to ask if this would result in me getting more work &amp; they said they ""cant answer at this point as their sales have dropped""

My options really are as follows:
1) cut ties &amp; don't respond
2)do the work &amp; see if anything comes of it in future (risk a non payment)
3)tell them that I need to find a job &amp; can't justify doing the work otherwise.

Or any other suggestions?
My main concern with the 2nd option is that I'm essentially helping somebody very cheaply, who put me out of work with no notice &amp; never had the decency to tell me if the work would ever come back.

Also I could be being taken advantage of to fix the problems &amp; then they won't ever communicate again",02Dec2020,1
547,"If you happen to stumble upon this please take a second to read.

I am currently 21 years old from the UK who is going through a 'mid-life' crisis. I guess i am too young to be having one. Lets take this back to when i was younger:

So i come from a lower class family who's parents make enough to make ends meet. My childhood was OK i guess but i was always different to other kids. I was seen as very mature for my age and as someone who was very shy and introverted. I loved playing football and playing games, usually by myself which i preferred. If there was one thing about me which i still find weird today is I always thought about money and having my own business, wanting to be successful from such a early age. While kids are talking about sports and having fun the only thing i thought about was what was the best way to reach success at 12. I genuinely had this feeling (still do) that i will become so wealthy and successful, no matter what, like it was written for me.

Growing up my parents did everything they could to provide for me. But one thing that i never really speak about is the bad side of it as im not one to dwell on the past or speak about my problems. For example the fights my parents used to have affected me when i was young which i think has a part to play on my anxiety. Also, there was abuse involved but that is something i dont like talking about because i know they're good parents but were probably raised the same way so that's all they knew if that makes sense. BUT somethings that did happen were honestly unforgivable considering my age but we move.

So living like this sort of made me numb, every day was different. I had pretty low self esteem when i reached 15 as i started to care about how i looked. I was definitely obese and had no personality. From here i started working on myself started working out more and taking care of how i present myself.

16-17 i started to look so much better lost abit of weight became very popular and social. Everyone started noticing me and wanted to hang out with me. Life was great not until i met the wrong people and went done a path of drugs, girls etc. I really focused on the wrong on things which affected my grades and my whole purpose. I knew deep down this wasn't who i was as i was still that shy innocent kid but with abit of popularity now. Long story short i cut off all ties with everyone to focus on myself and my grades. This is where gym entered my life.

The gym changed my life. i have never been so passionate about something ever as i did for the gym. it was an escape for me, from this world and all its problems where for 2 hours a day it was just me and the weights. i loved every second of it. 18 i changed my physique to its best ever form, got SO many compliments from people, girls noticed me more. that part of my life was just studying and working out.

One thing i forgot to mention, I've always had a part time job from the age of 16 whilst in school. luckily as i was so mature for my age i got hired quickly. And as my parents couldn't buy me the new clothes or the latest technology i thought i would do it for myself. This helped me become so independent and taught me so much at such a young age. I started to schedule my days around work, school and gym that i never really had time to go out and have fun. TBH working on myself everyday was my fun and at that point i had no interest in going out or partying etc. I was addicted to growth and unlocking the potential i had within me. Everyday i would read my goals every morning and night so i could speak it into existence.

OK this is where life changed. So im 19 i finally go into university. Everything in my plan was going ahead just as i had expected. But as i started uni, i hated every moment of it and realised this is not for me. This messed with me and made me go through phase of depression. I had to reevaluate my whole existence. Because the career i thought i wanted to pursue is not the career for me anymore. So i left university after a couple of months.

This period of 19-20 was the worst part of my life. I gained all my weight back, i isolated myself from everyone and so confused in what i should do in life. I am currently working a typical retail job but the whole covid situation made everything 100 times worse.

Especially with gyms closed i think i am going crazy lol.

I currently love bodybuilding to the point where i study and research it. I also love gaming and watching streamers play. I LOVE good food and cooking and the idea of travelling the world eat different foods. I have definitely got an entrepreneurial mindset more than anything as instead of listening to music id rather listen to podcasts.

All i ask for is advice i guess... if anyone has some advice please do let me know!",02Dec2020,1

While I‚Äôve strengthened my mindset over time, my mentality and physicality has grown weak and tired of the failures.

I really want to stop complaining, stop making excuses, and just grind through WAY more than a week, because that‚Äôs usually about how long my changes last until I give up and try again.

555,"A household member tested positive yesterday for COVID-19. I now am supposed to get tested. I had lunch with a friend (who is my only friend) a few days ago which may be within the window of them being exposed.I am concerned about my family ember. My heart sank when I found out I could have potentially exposed them.

I am going to but I really am not looking forward to her possibly testing positive or whatnot and having to cancel an expensive trip that she has booked and been looking forward to for years. I had absolutely no idea and we have been very careful. We were outside half the time and stayed away from each other.  

How is a good way to notify them (provided I test positive). Of course, anxiety is bad but I'll be okay. If they are a true friend, they'll probably be pissed but understand. If they aren't I'll live - there are plenty of other fish in the sea. Just could use some general advice and how to phrase a text message. We are sorta close as in we talk about personal stuff and she is a good person. I am sure I'm overthinking this.  

Any advice on how to do this? 

Thank you!",02Dec2020,1
556,"Hello everyone!   


So to get to the point, I know this girl since 5'6 years ago. Me, her and her bf used to work together and I knew she had a crush on me 5 years ago. Last month we had a little chat after many years and she told ma all kinds of crazy stuff about how much she wants me so we met and we had sex straight away. She told me that she loves me and wants to have a relationship with me so we both considered we are in a relationship.   


Few weeks ago she said they broke up 2 months ago and he was the worst he never treated her like a lady and she needs a true man in her life. I understood that and i started to catch feelings for her and tried to be the man she needed. I knew she was hiding a lot of stuff, she was staying only on offline on messenger and doing all kinds of sketchy stuff like responding to my messages after 4-5 hours daily; she doesn't even work anymore.   


I'm pretty sure she wants to be back with that guy and I feel like he needs to know what kind of woman she is. I really really want to send him a message to tell him what happened because he doesn't deserve such a whore in his life especially because he left his fiancee to be with her.  


Should I tell him or not? I'm 80% positive I should do it. The only thing that is holding me back is that he may get crazy about it and misunderstand the situation. If I knew they were still talking I would have never had sex with her but she told me they broke up and she's so happy she got rid of him and she really wants me. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only guy she had sex with in this past 2 months and rn I have sings of chlamidia.",02Dec2020,1

558,"... so I asked advices on the internet ^^. 

Here is my situation : I have begun a job in march, just before the lockdown. Before that I was working in administration and I always had this job. So I wanted to do something else to see if it could be interesting and to evolve. My currently job is to support teenagers and it is a real challenge. From March to September, we were WFH so I didn't have a chance to do see what my job is really like. Then the persons who recruited me left and my new boss was fired in one month. Since then we had 3 differents bosses who take turns and it is not really confortable   because they don't speak the same language. I have a lot of issues to understand what I have to do and there is a lot of work, I'm feeling overwhelmed. I talked with the director (which is just interim) who recognize it was difficult for me and told me I have to wait until January because they will finally recruit someone (one of the managers we are already talking to). Then something bad happen : one of the teenagers speaks about sexual assault by the driver who brings her to the center. We call the direction (they were in a meeting all together) and they refuse to come and ask us to send her back home with the driver and that we will deal with it on Monday. We disagreed and manage to have the authorisation to escort her Friday night then Monday morning until we decided what to do. On Monday, the girl were heard by one of the manager and then it was passed to the big big boss. Then we were yelled at because we were too emotives and we don't have to discuss the decisions.

In the same time , I found out they were looking for someone at my old job and I let myself one week to decide if I wanted to stay in my current job. On the Friday, I was crying going to work and I took the decision to call my ex-boss. I had him on the phone on last Monday and the recruitment will be on late December. So I sent him my CV. Two weeks after the incident, the big big boss finally asks my managers to speak about the sexual assaults to the parents of the teenager (I didn't mentioned that they tried to protect her by changing his driver with another one, since the guy didn't show up at work).

The feeling I have not to belong there (even if my coworkers are great) and to be lost plus the way things have been dealt with the teenager's situation push me to go because I'm feeling really bad. I talked to one of my coworker and she told me to wait, that I should speak out to try to get things sorted out.

I am really confuse, I feel like I'm quitting to quick and my coworker is right, we have to fight. The problem is I don't neither have the strength or the desire. I know in every job there will be issues and maybe I'm to sensitive but I don't want to fight to do my job correctly. But I also have the feeling I'm going back to where I am comfortable and I'm afraid people think I'm a coward or I'm inconsistent in my life's choices because I don't have enough confidence.

559,"I have been dating a guy that snores quite loudly.

I already have troubles falling asleep in general, and in particular I struggle with sharing my bed with someone. On top of it I hate any sort of sound when I am sleeping, so the fact he snores is quite a big deal for me.

I try to poke him while he's sleeping so that maybe he moves to a more comfortable position where he doesn't snore as much. I did this before with other people whenever they started snoring and it worked out just fine, but with him it doesn't seem to work very well. 

We are quite honest with each other but I feel a bit embarrassed to share this problem with him because I actually don't want him to feel sorry for me. Also when it comes to snoring there's really not much DIY improvement you can do. Unless he checks why he snores with a doctor etc it's not something he has any control over.

This could be a deal breaker for me because I like sleeping, and I especially need sleep if I am busy the day after. This means I can't hang out with him if I have stuff to do in the morning, which means he can't be a long term partner.

If anyone has some advice or can enlighten me about the nature of snoring I'd be very happy!

568,"This is going to be slightly long, so thanks in advance for reading it all.

I (25F) recently came out to my family as bisexual. I‚Äôve known I was bi since I was about 14, but I never had the confidence to come out to my family until this year because I grew up in a very religious household. I actually used to ask my parents ‚Äúwhat would you do if I was gay?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwould you still love me if I was gay?‚Äù My mom always told me she would always love me unconditionally and her and my siblings have been the only supporting members of my family. My dad however always had this attitude of ‚ÄúI would still love you, but I wouldn‚Äôt love your choices and I would pray for you to change.‚Äù Which obviously did not make me want to come out in the slightest when I was a teenager and dealing with depression and super underconfident. I came out to my parents and my dad did not react appropriately, but it was not terrible. However he made some very rude comments about my sexuality and continues to tell me ‚ÄúI am living a life of sin.‚Äù I am not an atheist, but I don‚Äôt 100% know if I believe in God. I am spiritual, but my relationship w organized religion has been rocky, mainly because of him, and him saying that shit is not helpful or conducive in any way. This happened 7 weeks ago and we still haven‚Äôt talked. Then yesterday, my cousin(29F), that I live with and I were having a conversation about everything that happened with my dad and I and she started saying the most bigoted shit that has ever come out of her mouth (in my presence). She said my dad did not need to apologize for hurting my feelings because the Bible wants a man and a woman to be together. And that the only reason I think I was born bisexual is because society wants me to think so. Her and I have always been close and this was completely out of the blue so it hurt almost more than all the stuff my dad said, especially because we live together and it‚Äôs hard to escape her, whereas my dad lives across the country so I don‚Äôt have to engage. I am just really hurt that these people who are close to me are continually trying to invalidate my identity. In the end, I can cut them out of my life, but I would rather not. I just would like some advice on how to navigate this if anyone has gone through something similar. I know I will feel better in a few days but yeah, kinda sucks. TIA.",02Dec2020,1

There's a lot of fighting happening because everyone posting assumes everyone else is a troll, or a hacker, or trying to steal their info; and it has a lot of people up in arms. It has also made the simple enjoyment of writing very upsetting. Especially because the nature of something like unsent letters is as a place to vent everything without sending it. But then you'll get these bots (or maybe trolls) trashing the place, abusing everyone, mimicking people, replying as if its for them, and creating scenes like they think everyone is a part of a game.

Since this is tech, I was wondering if anyone could shine a light on the technical side of this, as it utilizes a lot users' private details and negatively affects most people who write with any regularity here. Is this a glitch? Malware? Trolls?",02Dec2020,1
595,"The overflow drain on the kitchen sink in my new apartment leaked today when I overflowed the sink on accident. The pip that connects the overflow to the drain wasnt connected, like at all. It was broken off. So water poured out all over my cupboard and floor, over my tinned and packeted food, decorative teatowels i have had scince i was a child (havnt put them up on the wall yet) and all over the kitchen floor. 

Used every single towel I i own to mip up the water, called the ""maintenence"" guy round to fix it. He stuck the pipe back where it goes and left. 

So when it inevitably leaks again (cos it will, no tape, no glue no thing. Just stuffed the pipe back in the hole) What should I do? 

Is there legal action that I would be able to take against them for not fixing it properly? Damage to my posseions stored under the sink? Call a plumber round to fix it properly, and send the landlady the bill for it? They are very lazy and everything they ""fix"" is halfarsed and not done properly. Before i moved, they fixed a window, and put the WHOLE window back in, upsidedown. -\_- Lazy, money tight greedy layabouts, the lot of them. They wouldnt even let me dry ALL my towels in the laundry room in the other part of the building. I dont have a dryer of my own so.

599,"I've been hiding something from my mom and it's killing me inside. This is probably going to be a long post, sorry in advance. If someone could read it til the end I'd be glad...
I've always had a great relationship with my mom. I mean, we had our downs and ups, but we've grown together from it, our entire lives. And I hate her for it. 
It would be so much easier if she wasn't such a lovely, awesome person.
I have no one to vent to, and it's killing me inside.
For some background, I'm a girl, 18 years and I already take some medicine for anxiety and depression. My mom does everything for me, I love her with all my heart, but there's just somethings that can't be told, even for someone like her.
I've always been a nasty lying bitch, too. I've lied to make myself look better, fancier, for people to think I'm better than I actually am and this is the first time I've admitted it. I catfished some people, not too bad, but I'm fat and I pose as some cute, attractive skinny girl, but in reality I just like the attention and pretend I have being the center.
Recently, I got into the sugar relationship world. I already knew it, from some years of dreaming before. I have some pretty nasty sexual kinks too, and this comes later. 
But, I got into this world through some groups, and I got it just a few days ago. And I got some old ugly guy to fall for me. Not that I don't feel attracted to him, too, but his appearance is just something *bad*, but he's extremely intelectual, reads and thinks just like me, we have the same ideals, and I fell for this side of his. I am smart, and I mean it. I have a huge power over my persuasion hability, and I know how to play with it, too. I can act coldly sometimes, but the thing is I'm just a crying baby with daddy issues who wants to pass off as some defenseless baby girl just to get attention. And I got it, damn.
Everything was going smoothly, kinda. Until I used my persuasion to get me a treat from this daddy guy, just because I've never had to work before and like things easy. He paid me, just from chatting with him for one or two hours, an almost 600 bucks gift, and promised even more.
That's when the real trouble comes into play.
I live with my parents. My dad is some retrograde punk, he is homophobic, sometimes even racist, with a very closed mind. My mom, even though she is a bit closed mind too, given her age and her growing background, is a puddle of light and wholesomeness. She worked very hard her entire life,  always helped others, learned from her mistakes... She is my soulmate, the love of my life, and I mean it with all my heart and forces. But she doesn't know how perverse and a gross bitch her daughter is. 
Given I live with them, and we're in a pandemic, every move I make, everything I order, just everything, they get to know since they're not leaving for work. And my gift is about to arrive. So I created a story in my mind, and had to act trough it. I invented I won one of those Instagram draws, and everything was going just ok at first.
But, of course, the bitch I call mom had to be so fucking perfect, she felt there was something off right away. Just so it becomes clear how much of a connection we have, she felt me move in her belly when I was around two months into, we always get sad together even if we're far apart... This is some inhumane shit, for sure.
She came and questioned me about this draw. Asked how I sent the my info for the delivery and I said it right away I deleted the messages. She asked me to show her my bank account. Luckily, empty, though. She looked me deep in the eyes and said there was something off, that wasn't making sense. And I lied to her.
I had to pretend I was mad at her when, in fact, I was mad at me for being such a consumist nasty bitch.
She had the fucking courage to come and fucking apologize to me. She's suffering from some unknown disease, mourning in the corners from the pain, and she had the fucking courage to say to me she was sorry she didn't believe me.
And this is where my suicide makes it's entrance.
You know, I always felt I would be the one to take my own life, and there's just no turning back. Everytime I lie to someone, part of me dies, to an unbearable point. I hate doing it, I made myself promise I would lie anymore, I really do hate. Even my anxiety is a product of it, since I pretended to be anxious for attention and ended up developing it for real.
But this... This is the most painful thing I've ever done in my entire life, and there's just no way I can tell her, at least for now. 
So, I think I won't last much longer. I just don't know what to do with me. I'm one of the most perverse and gross things that has ever set foot in this world, and I'm not exaggerating when I say I feel like this. I'm just so lost right now...
I'm also a scared cry baby, because I'm affraid of what will happen when I finally do it. I tried medicine before, since it seems a painless and easy way to part, but I've failed miserably. Well, I'm writing right now, isn't it? Haha funny thanks for laughing
Part of me, a majority of it, really died now. I know I wouldn't have the balls to tell everyone everything I've lied and magnified about myself when I'm as small as an ant, but I think it's so unfair for me to part and those secrets dying with me...
I know I'm about to die, my life is literally at my own hands. I won't be able to face properly my mommy anymore. I have ever existing, yet she loves me.
I hate her for loving me and I hate myself for loving her so much.",02Dec2020,1

614," A while ago I subscribed to an online service for a trial month. Later I discovered they have charged me for a whole year of service. So I contacted them and asked for them to refund the amount which they did. However I later realized that they actually only partially refunded me. They basically returned the annual subscription fee minus a couple months. I have only used the service for month, and even that month was supposed to be trial but they claimed a trial month is only available if I do an annual subscription. In any case, I'm good with paying that month, however I cancelled before the second month kick in, so they shouldn't have charged for that one.

Anyway after some back and forth I had to eventually ask the bank to chargeback that month. After they discovered that they basically threatened to sue if I don't pay that month back plus the chargeback fee. Now legally I think I'm in the clear. Financially, my bank already retrieved the money so I don't really need to take any further steps. However here is what I'm worried about :

\- If they do sue, then I'll probably have to hire an attorney, take a day off work, etc which will eventually cost me more money than this month. For them this will probably be business as usual since I imagine they already have their own attorney or legal department for this kind of disputes.

\- They also threatened to seek debt collection if I don't pay back which might hurt my credit score. I don't know how that works, and never been through this before, but do credit companies just take the debt collectors word for it and lower your credit score ? Also I hear debt collectors tend to bully and harass people which is a nuisance I don't need right now.

I mean on the one hand, I think the amount is not worth the hassle, on the other hand I feel extremely angry and frustrated that I might just end up paying money I don't owe, and they don't deserve, out of pure intimidation. The part about debt collection in particular is when they successfully managed to scare me. Reading through their online reviews, some people actually mentioned that the exact same thing happened to them, and that they did receive debt collection letters.

I would really appreciate any word of advice as to what the rational decision is ? Should I just cave to their threats and avoid this sort on online transactions in the future ? or just ignore the whole thing altogether and deal with it when they take further steps ?

He makes a lot of money, and he said like every 5 months, he could pay me 6k. I also have about 18k left in my trust fund. I know im coming off as selfish, and privileged here, but would it be wrong if I lived off of my trust fund, until this is all over? With the vaccines being distributed next week, I could see this ending maybe by the end up 2021, maybe the begging of 2022, and I made it 8 months on just 8k. Im pretty certain my grandpa wouldn't want me to do this, but im not too sure about my grandma. I KNOW my dad didn't woudnt want me to, and probably wouldn't let me, but I figured I'd try. Like I said. I know its selfish of me, and it probably makes me a bad person, but idk...even though I'm a 27 year old man, I still have trouble determining what's right, and wrong. Obviously I know killing someone, or beating animals is wrong, but on more complicated issues like this, not so much.",02Dec2020,1
626,"I have come to the painful conclusion that ugly or mediocre-looking people just don't deserve to be loved like on Tinder or Instagram, where good-looking dudes get matches and get hit on while mediocre-looking guys like myself are ignored. Therefore, I am resolved to have a plastic surgery to fix my nose and eyes. However, my father doesn't agree to pay for the surgery because he thinks that the plastic surgery has terrible side-effects and also that I'm not mature enough to make the decision. How should I convince him by making him see the reality as how it is?

627,"I don't want to make this too long but there's a bit of background that needs to be established. 

So my parents are super strict. Always wanting to know and be a part of every bit of my life. I guess the abnormal part of it is how intrusive and controlling they still are. I'm 22 years old and often I forget I'm not a 16 yr old child. I find myself having to lie and sneak around about what I'm doing. Oh and also note I live on my own and have since I was 19.

So anyway I'm 12 weeks into my pregnancy and the insurance bill is soon to come in the mail. So I am running out of time to say something. I am super nervous because they do not like my boyfriend and never have. We've been together for almost 3 years. He's not super driven which is in complete contrast to them. We've had some rocky times with his depression he can be distant and has a tendency to shut down and push me far far away when it comes so we've broke up a few times. Otherwise he's always respected me, we hardly argue, and honestly I cant even think of a time he's cussed at me. He's completely excited about the baby and has been so supportive this entire time so far.

Also note my parents have constantly told me since I was little they don't want to be grandparents till they are like 50. They sort of joke but deep down because how often this is brought up I can tell they have no desire to be a grandparent anytime soon. Also during one of our breakups they mentioned how lucky I was to not have a baby with him and how that would ruin my life. This is going to devastate them and completely change their view of me. 

So anyway basically I just need advice or maybe just come kind words to give me the strength to do this. I feel so scared of them and most time feel like I do not have it in me to tell them. I keep going over scenarios and whats the best way to do this but I know theres no good way to go about this.

634,"Hello, I've been googling around to find Korean edition books of popular financial or stock trading books with little to no success. I'm hoping someone out there knows better.

My reason for wanting to find Korean edition books is for my father. He only really understands Korean, and recently he's been getting in to the stock market and investing. I'd really like to buy him some books during the holidays so he can learn better practices. Ideally, I'd like to find books that help teach stock market technical analysis, but I don't really see any out there.

Some books I found (but not sure if they are legit):

[https://www.amazon.com/Wise-investors-Korean-edition/dp/8957820566](https://www.amazon.com/Wise-investors-Korean-edition/dp/8957820566)

I'm tempted to buy these books, but they are pretty pricey and there are no reviews so I'm not sure if they are legit. Also these books aren't really about technical analysis, but I personally liked reading these books.

Does anyone have experience buying stock trading books in Korean? Are there books that you'd recommend? Are there ways to find Korean editions of popular books somewhere? Or even stock trading books and/or technical analysis books written in Korean?",02Dec2020,1
637,"Hi. So my sister has a dab pen and sometimes when she leaves the house recently, i‚Äôll go in her room and take a couple hits. I don‚Äôt do this all the time, but I only do it as a last resort or when I have nothing else. Well this time, I was very unlucky and she happened to come back home when I was hitting the pen, and I had it in my room. It‚Äôs now the next day, and I heard her tell my mom that she can‚Äôt find her pen anywhere, and that she looked everywhere for it that it could‚Äôve possibly been. The problem for me is, the cart is basically tapped. When I got a hold of it, there was only a few more hits left, and I took basically the last of the oil. There‚Äôs only a tiny bit left at the bottom, my fear is if I return it (idek how i‚Äôm going to return it in the first place because if she finds it in a place she‚Äôs already looked, she‚Äôs gonna know someone took it), she also will see that it‚Äôs all gone. I have a cart of my own with a small but bigger amount of oil that I thought about transferring to her cart in hopes she wouldn‚Äôt notice that it isn‚Äôt her oil.

I know it‚Äôs long but please read it. I need advice.

I feel like no one hears me this house. I feel like I‚Äôm invisible to them but never ivisbke when they want something.

My mom wants me to always clean the house from top to bottom all by my self.

I get it you think oh that‚Äôs not bad. But it is there‚Äôs 9 kids including me so why only me?

I have four sisters, one is the smallest and the other two are older like me.

My sister who I‚Äôm a year older from(20) , gets treated like a damsel in distress, like she can do no wrong or so no wrong.


All my siblings the older ones, we all get days to clean,  me (21) I clean two days, sometimes I clean everyone else‚Äôs days. Because they don‚Äôt do it probably.

and my sister (20), she gets two days too. 

brother (18), he gets one day. 

brother (17) he gets one day.

Sister (15) she gets one day.

we all clean have our days to clean.

But me, and my brother (17) when we clean we clean from the living room, to the kitchen, to the toilet. Sometimes we tired so we don‚Äôt clean the toilet. 

The rest of my siblings they only CLEAN the kitchen. They believe that‚Äôs the only person that needs to be cleaned. 

My sister (15) she sometimes cleans the toilet or the living room, but she tired so I get it.

I bought this with my mom, she said my brother (18) he complains too much, so she doesn‚Äôt want to deal with that.


Then I asked her about my sister(20) she said my sister is stubborn, and she works  and goes to college so she can‚Äôt do it.

I use to work/study, and do the same hours, the same days at work as her, and I still helped my mom with cooking, cleaning, and with the kids.

My mom let‚Äôs my sister get of easy, when I say no my mom won‚Äôt take it as a no, she keeps asking again and again. I can be angry and she will still not take no. 

When my sister says no, my mom just takes it as that and leaves her alone.

My mom says my sister won‚Äôt listen, basically my mom makes excuses for her.

And that makes me feel like my mom would rather I end up tired to the bone or end up in a hospital for her to listen.

You guys don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs 11 people In this house and my mom wants to me for everything, kids related, cleaning related, anytime.

If I clean too long I get dizzy, this one time I was cleaning a lot that I couldn‚Äôt move my hand. I wake up with back pains , sometimes I can‚Äôt even walk.

All I want is to me treated as an equal by my parents, don‚Äôt treat us all different.

That‚Äôs all I want. 

No matter how I voice my concern I don‚Äôt get listened too. But they expect me to listen to them,

I feel so ignored, I‚Äôm getting sadder everyday.

Now I‚Äôm in university first year, I can‚Äôt afford to fail if I do, I have to retake the year.

I told my mon this but does she listen.

So my cousin got in a fight with her dad and moved in with us, so because she‚Äôs an only gir in her house, no one is going to clean their house so me and her went to clean there. And her mom left e country so it was her and her two brothers and her dad there. 

I came back with no being able to breath, running nose, back pains, and feet pains.

So her mom came here for a month, so we went to there house and clean two days before her mom came back. This was on 26 of November 2020. 

Then I had to go back there on 28 of November 2020, to clean day because she was having people over, and our clean that was done on the 26 wasn‚Äôt good for her standards. Her moms standards.

Her mom came back to my house to say hi to her sister who she hasn‚Äôt seen in three years.

My cousins mom noticed my moms house was dirty and stuff. So she told me and my cousin to clean it and that it was embarrassing.

We cleaned my house, we didn‚Äôt do the whole house we started with the living room.

So that day I clean twice in a day. 

And now my cousin has her wedding on 12 December and before that I have to go clean probably twice or three times before her wedding trust me.

No one cares if I died of cleaning.

I don‚Äôt hate cleaning, I enjoy it. But I don‚Äôt enjoy it when I have to do the whole house by my self while everyone around me is eating, playing gAmes, and making more messes. 

My house never stays clean for a day. 

My dad agrees with my mom when it comes to my sister. 

I‚Äôm in uni, I had to do a project while cleaning my cousins house twice.

Because my mom let‚Äôs my sister get away with so much, now my sisters believes she doesn‚Äôt need to help around the house or do any work.

You know how I said she only cleans the kitchen, she literally won‚Äôt go in the living and go to the dinner table and pick up the dirty dishes people left. 

She leaves it there because she thinks it‚Äôs not her job. My mom literally has to pick those dishes and put it in the sink for her. 

And also my sister has never once cleaned the room we share. I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs cleaning it, mopping it, sort out the clothes, and my little baby brothers clothes and put it away for him and me.

And I have to do my little sister and little baby brothers home work with them and give them food, and put them to bed everyday while having uni work due for me.

My mom has two failing kidneys, she‚Äôs Diabetic, she has Arthritisand so many other things.

That‚Äôs why I tried not to say no to her a lot. Because I know if I do she will end up cleaning herself or cooking herself.

She does this all the time, every time I say no. She starts cleaning or cooking just to make me feel sad.

My siblings literally sit around and watch my mom clean, knowing she‚Äôs not allowed to, but they don‚Äôt care.

They don‚Äôt care that anything bad can happen to make her condition worst.

Why does no one care about me. 

MyMom always says my mom did it to me so it‚Äôs not a big deal.

My mom came from a bigger family than us. Her dad had three wife‚Äôs and kids from our all them. She had a lot of sisters so I know she wasn‚Äôt the only one who did every her self. 

I already worried about failing uni because it‚Äôs hard and cleaning and cooking and looking after my siblings is adding to it.

I just wish I didn‚Äôt exist. I swear.

641,"I really don't know what to do. I am taking a year off school and am living with my parents at the moment. They want me to pay them back $4,000 that they paid out of pocket for my school before I return in august. I was working somewhere that payed pretty good, but no one was wearing their masks there. People would get up in my face and yell over the sounds of the warehouse, cough in their hands, wipe snot off with their hand before going back and touching things, and the supervisors did absolutely nothing about it and wouldn't even wear their masks. The working conditions just weren't great all around, but my breaking point was when someone got in my face, even after I reminded them to stay 6ft away and they accidentally got spit in my eyes while talking. I'm currently searching for other jobs, but there are just no jobs that work from home that I meet the requirements for. I do not want to get covid for myself, but also, my mother is a lifelong smoker and I just know she would not make it if she got sick. It took her a month and a half to get over a cold that took me 2 days to get through. She refuses to see that she's high risk though. I can't afford to live anywhere else though at the moment, and I'm starting to run out of the money from my last job. I'm terrified to go back to work, even as a waitress or something.

642,"Hi, Im 16 and I have been crosseyed since I was 8. I was in a knife accident that left one of my eyes damaged.. I was lucky to still have vision in the eye but, I developed  strabismus (cross eyes). One of my eyes looks outward.

This accident ruined my life. 

For physical problem: I get weekly painful headaches that sometimes affect my teeth and ears, I have double vision (I see 2 images of everything, one blurry, one not blurry), I have depth perception issues, reading can make my eyes hurt due to double vision, I cannot run or jump or do anything that's too ""physical"" and I cant do anything that changes eye pressure (roller coasters, airplanes, etc). For mental problems, I believe I suffer from anxiety, body dysmorphia and just terrible self-image issues. I had really bad depression from ages to 10-14, its when I started self-harming and developed an eating disorder. Im saying ""I believe"" because Im not officially diagnosed because my family doesnt believe in mental illness and would never get me  medication even if I was diagnosed. They would say pray or just ""get over it"" . The closest my family got to getting me help was threatening  to send me to call the police and send me to a mental institution.

I have been bullied ever since the accident and this of course made me become very introverted and I spent a couple of years unable to go to public places that wasnt school by myself.  I once cried because my sister wanted me to go to Dollar General alone, it was that bad. Im not trying to get your sympathy, I am trying to make you understand how badly the accident affected me.

In 2018, I realized that I cant keep living like this and I have been self-harm free for 2 years and I try to be more confident and realize that sometimes, the voices in my head arent telling me the truth.  But its hard. Theres no way to hide my damaged eye and I cant see it as a positive. Neither can I see my body thats filled with scar marks as a positive either. I like to act very happy and joyful but, I dont feel anything. When I see my body and my eye, all I think is ""Look at how you ruined yourself. This is all your fault.""

I cant change my damaged body or damaged eye but, I can make my eyes look more straight. I recently got strabismus surgery and while it has improved, its not where I need it to be. You can still tell my eyes arent straight/ My doctor told me that  there was  a chance I might need another surgery to properly fix the eye alignment issues. I think I need that next surgery. Also, if the next surgery works and fixes the double vision, I can improve my vision in the damage eye by getting rid of the double vision ( I always see 2 images of everything, one blurry and one not) and make the painful headaches I have due to the double vision disappear!

I cant stand myself, my reflection makes my skin crawl and I can feel the progress I made these past 2 years crumbling. I want to hurt myself, I am afraid to go outside (I am luckily going to online school), I cry all the time (when Im alone), I am skipping showers again and my grades are falling.

I have had around 4 other surgeries before this one (constant retinal detachment and other issues). I understand why my family thinks this surgery is dangerous because its a miracle my eye has lasted this long. My family doesnt want me to have another surgery but, the thing about eyes is the older I get, the harder the surgery recovery will be. Its December 2020 and I can maybe get it in Spring 2021 (March or April). I dont think my family understands how badly I need this surgery.  All of my family either thinks I shouldnt get anymore strabismus surgery or that I should wait a full year (2022).

I dont know how to tell my family that another year spent in this ruined body is hell and I would rather kill myself than continue living like this. Ive been having suicidal dreams again and I keep thinking of realistic scenarios where I kill myself. I use to be a very happy, confident and fun person before the accident. I loved myself, my body and had tons of friends. And god, I was so freaking beautiful (just looking at photos of me before the accident makes me cry). I feel like fixing my cross-eye is the only way to return to the happy, pretty person I use to be. I dont want to live in this body. I know its selfish but I just want to look in the mirror and like what I see. The first step to that is fixing my eye alignment. I am not one of those girls where ""self-love"" can work. I need change. 

Sorry for the long rant but, I guess I am asking for advice on how to convince my family to allow me to get the surgery, any advice on how to get rid of body scars and advice on how to learn to like my body (after the surgery). I dont want to die but, I dont want to live like this anymore.",02Dec2020,1
643,"TL;DR : there's a guy that I am jealous of in my school and I don't know how to get over it. 

Hey everyone. I need advice on how to get over a feeling of jealousy. I go to a really prestigious university. There's this guys that just got into my master's degree, let's say his name is John. He is quite good looking, seems pretty rich and is really really intelligent. At least he is good at studying. He has a lot of knowledge about everything, from politics to literature, but his true speciality is law. He is so good in fact, that he wants to enter another school after finishing university which enables you to become a top ranking civil servant. On top of that, he wants to do work in the same field as me (diplomacy), in the same country later (don't want to give too much details).   


Now, I've been in this school for longer than him (he just joined in the last year, whereas I was there since the beginning), so I got in my university program that enables me to live and study abroad for a year. I went to the country I want to work in, which is the same as the one he wants to work in, so I'm more knowledgeable than him on the language and culture.   


But I'm jealous of him. All the teachers in the school think really highly of him, as he is very smart and well spoken. He has a lot of knowledge, and excels at everything he does. I'm pretty sure (and hope) that he will achieve his goals, and it scares me because it feels like he might get my ideal job instead of me. He also wears suits all the time, which makes him even more detestable in the eyes of the young people that we are. 

As for me, I know my value. I'm really good at what I do, but less than him in a way that teachers don't usually notice me. I am jealous and scared of him because I feel like he will be more successful than me. 

How do I get over this sense of jealousy? I need advice.",02Dec2020,1

I do love him very much but often when I tell him things he doesn't answer or doesn't seem interested, I think it's because he's very tired from work and just sort of wants to go to sleep. He has a girlfriend that lives quite a while away so he only sees her like once a month on weekend, thankfully she bought a house just around the corner from my dad so that'll bring him some joy. Basically what I'm trying to say is that my dad needs something he can be excited for, I want to spark up the fire that I saw in him a long time ago, he used to play guitar, fix hi-fis, build things, ride bicycle, but now all he does is work. I know it's been a tough year for everyone and he definitely was hit financially by Covid so I understand that he needs to work more. 
What can I do to make him excited with life again?

Tldr: My dad was once a very enthusiastic person but because of past traumas and events he's become a dull, tired person. What are some things I can do to help him?",02Dec2020,1

I know most of my (girl) friends have done at least one of these, if not multiple. I'm just kind of worried about where I'm at in comparison to the majority.

But also, I'm not a very social person and stick to my own thing. So guys do not approach me, and I don't approach guys. I'm average looking but quiet in new situations. 

I know now is not the time to be meeting new people, I'm just wondering about in the future, when things are okay again. Maybe it's a stupid thing to worry about, but I feel like I'll be single for a while, and worry that one day I'll find somebody and be insecure about my lack of experience. 

Also, I know dating apps are super in right now and considered the norm, but the concept of it for me personally, is not ideal. As for now, dating apps sound scary and I'd rather meet someone in person first.

I have one sister who I remain in contact with but we aren't always on the best of terms. Which is why I'm coming on here. I've been doing my best to find an apartment but it just seems like I can't catch a break. 

Background info: I have a great credit score, mid 700's with almost 2 years of credit history, I've never rented before so never been evicted, and no criminal history, no pets as of now but would like to get a cat in the near future.

I've been looking for apartments for months but only really got serious about it a month ago. The issues that I keep having are: 

\-I'm not readily available to answer phone calls or emails from property owners who are trying to get back to me. (This is mostly due to my work schedule which varies week to week, most often it is 4 days a week. from 8:30 to 5pm.) Every time I do get back to them, it seems that the listing is already spoken for. 

\-Most of the apartments that fit what I'm looking for seem to be community-type complexes that have really horrible reviews online. 

\-The apartments that are easy to get are the ones that you have to share laundry with or literally have bugs crawling around. (I don't like sharing laundry as I'm under strict quarantine guidelines with the family I work for and also plan on going back into the healthcare industry after the pandemic is over which means a lot of sanitizing so I need my own access to laundry.)

I've been contemplating getting a buzz cut with my sister for the past few months but I'm getting mixed opinions from others about wether I should get one or not.
Some say I don't have the personality for it or they like my hair now but I'm kinda sick of it and it's not very healthy any way.
I've had long hair for most of my life but I've really liked the idea of shaving my head. I heard that if you looked good with a pixie cut then you should look fine with a buzz cut, I had a pixie cut when I was in the 5th grade, which looked okay, but that was pre-puberty so I'm not sure if I can rely on that.

I don't have the best self confidence but people say they got a confidence boost after getting a buzz cut. Is this really the case?

I know it‚Äôs long but please read it. I need advice.

I feel like no one hears me this house. I feel like I‚Äôm invisible to them but never ivisbke when they want something.

My mom wants me to always clean the house from top to bottom all by my self.

I get it you think oh that‚Äôs not bad. But it is there‚Äôs 9 kids including me so why only me?

I have four sisters, one is the smallest and the other two are older like me.

My sister who I‚Äôm a year older from(20) , gets treated like a damsel in distress, like she can do no wrong or so no wrong.


All my siblings the older ones, we all get days to clean,  me (21) I clean two days, sometimes I clean everyone else‚Äôs days. Because they don‚Äôt do it probably.

and my sister (20), she gets two days too. 

brother (18), he gets one day. 

brother (17) he gets one day.

Sister (15) she gets one day.

we all clean have our days to clean.

But me, and my brother (17) when we clean we clean from the living room, to the kitchen, to the toilet. Sometimes we tired so we don‚Äôt clean the toilet. 

The rest of my siblings they only CLEAN the kitchen. They believe that‚Äôs the only person that needs to be cleaned. 

My sister (15) she sometimes cleans the toilet or the living room, but she tired so I get it.

I bought this with my mom, she said my brother (18) he complains too much, so she doesn‚Äôt want to deal with that.


Then I asked her about my sister(20) she said my sister is stubborn, and she works  and goes to college so she can‚Äôt do it.

I use to work/study, and do the same hours, the same days at work as her, and I still helped my mom with cooking, cleaning, and with the kids.

My mom let‚Äôs my sister get of easy, when I say no my mom won‚Äôt take it as a no, she keeps asking again and again. I can be angry and she will still not take no. 

When my sister says no, my mom just takes it as that and leaves her alone.

My mom says my sister won‚Äôt listen, basically my mom makes excuses for her.

And that makes me feel like my mom would rather I end up tired to the bone or end up in a hospital for her to listen.

You guys don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs 11 people In this house and my mom wants to me for everything, kids related, cleaning related, anytime.

If I clean too long I get dizzy, this one time I was cleaning a lot that I couldn‚Äôt move my hand. I wake up with back pains , sometimes I can‚Äôt even walk.

All I want is to me treated as an equal by my parents, don‚Äôt treat us all different.

That‚Äôs all I want. 

No matter how I voice my concern I don‚Äôt get listened too. But they expect me to listen to them,

I feel so ignored, I‚Äôm getting sadder everyday.

Now I‚Äôm in university first year, I can‚Äôt afford to fail if I do, I have to retake the year.

I told my mon this but does she listen.

So my cousin got in a fight with her dad and moved in with us, so because she‚Äôs an only gir in her house, no one is going to clean their house so me and her went to clean there. And her mom left e country so it was her and her two brothers and her dad there. 

I came back with no being able to breath, running nose, back pains, and feet pains.

So her mom came here for a month, so we went to there house and clean two days before her mom came back. This was on 26 of November 2020. 

Then I had to go back there on 28 of November 2020, to clean day because she was having people over, and our clean that was done on the 26 wasn‚Äôt good for her standards. Her moms standards.

Her mom came back to my house to say hi to her sister who she hasn‚Äôt seen in three years.

My cousins mom noticed my moms house was dirty and stuff. So she told me and my cousin to clean it and that it was embarrassing.

We cleaned my house, we didn‚Äôt do the whole house we started with the living room.

So that day I clean twice in a day. 

And now my cousin has her wedding on 12 December and before that I have to go clean probably twice or three times before her wedding trust me.

No one cares if I died of cleaning.

I don‚Äôt hate cleaning, I enjoy it. But I don‚Äôt enjoy it when I have to do the whole house by my self while everyone around me is eating, playing gAmes, and making more messes. 

My house never stays clean for a day. 

My dad agrees with my mom when it comes to my sister. 

I‚Äôm in uni, I had to do a project while cleaning my cousins house twice.

Because my mom let‚Äôs my sister get away with so much, now my sisters believes she doesn‚Äôt need to help around the house or do any work.

You know how I said she only cleans the kitchen, she literally won‚Äôt go in the living and go to the dinner table and pick up the dirty dishes people left. 

She leaves it there because she thinks it‚Äôs not her job. My mom literally has to pick those dishes and put it in the sink for her. 

And also my sister has never once cleaned the room we share. I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs cleaning it, mopping it, sort out the clothes, and my little baby brothers clothes and put it away for him and me.

And I have to do my little sister and little baby brothers home work with them and give them food, and put them to bed everyday while having uni work due for me.

My mom has two failing kidneys, she‚Äôs Diabetic, she has Arthritisand so many other things.

That‚Äôs why I tried not to say no to her a lot. Because I know if I do she will end up cleaning herself or cooking herself.

She does this all the time, every time I say no. She starts cleaning or cooking just to make me feel sad.

My siblings literally sit around and watch my mom clean, knowing she‚Äôs not allowed to, but they don‚Äôt care.

They don‚Äôt care that anything bad can happen to make her condition worst.

Why does no one care about me. 

MyMom always says my mom did it to me so it‚Äôs not a big deal.

My mom came from a bigger family than us. Her dad had three wife‚Äôs and kids from our all them. She had a lot of sisters so I know she wasn‚Äôt the only one who did every her self. 

I already worried about failing uni because it‚Äôs hard and cleaning and cooking and looking after my siblings is adding to it.

I just wish I didn‚Äôt exist. I swear.

663,"I am in such a difficult position. I would really really appreciate your advice.

Last week I was walking home from work at night when I walked passed a car, there was a couple inside and they were pretty heavily making out i saw the man but not the woman, I felt a little awkward so I just zoomed past.

I got home and as I did a car pulled up and it was the very same car with the very same man only it was my sister who got out, I asked who she was with and she said it was her boyfriends dad. I instantly freaked the fuck out, so the next day I went by her boyfriends house when I knew she was going to be there and knocked on the door and his dad actually answered the only thing odd was that his trousers were on back to front, pretty indicative of certain activities and I could see my sister sitting on the couch and I asked whether her boyfriend was there, he said no and that he was at work, so I just left.

I am now in such a difficult position because on the one hand I don't want to say anything because it'll ruin two separate relationships potentially forever and on the other hand ***it is not me who has actually ruined these relationships*** it is is them.

665,"I don't wanna be one of those people who asks people to stop overreacting to certain things, especially over anyone's death, having lost 3 members of my family, I know how it feels. 

So my girlfriend's acquaintance or one-day friend whom she met at some convention last year passed away recently, and she has been overly sad about it to a point that it feels like she's overacting. Now, this is the first time ever that someone she knew has died, so I'd still think that her reaction to this is natural, I mean she's 22 and never witnessed anyone die, it can be a lot to take in, but she has been so miserable for 2 days that I don't feel like it is.

It would've been totally natural had she been her close friend or just a normal friend, but being so depressed about a person's death you met over a year ago, for more than a few minutes or a few hours at best, is not normal. And it's not like they've been texting each other ever since they met, no, they just followed each other on Instagram and that's about it. No contact whatsoever. But then a few days ago, someone posted on her account that she passed away and my girlfriend has never been the same since. She's not eating properly, she's not attentive towards anything, she's barely speaking to anyone, and she just sits around for hours at any random spot in the house. 

This is honestly very frustrating for me, as I'm trying my best to reach out to her, talk to her without making her more upset than she already is. Even her mum called me thinking we had a fight and that's the reason why she's upset, but I ended up telling her what's going on and I consulted her as to how to handle this situation. She asked me to bring her over but my girlfriend won't leave the house.

This is getting really hard for me as I'm a very short-tempered guy and I've been tolerating her for two days without lashing out on her, not that I ever do, but had she been like this for any other reason, we would've totally gotten into a fight. She has never been like this in all the 3 years that we've been together, so I don't know what to do or how best to handle it or if it even is a real depression/sadness or she's just overreacting.",02Dec2020,1
667,"So I was trying to get a sugar momma and I thought I was talking to a none scammer, but it turned out I was. It took a while for the idea of money to come up thus building my trust. I was trying to play it safe and be careful. After about a month or talking they said they wanted to send me money and gave me their information to pay off part of my credit card.

The scammer sent me money to pay off my credit card, but the scammer wanted me to use part of the money to buy bitcoin. The money they sent never cleared so I never bought the bitcoin but before my bank cancelled the transfer the scammer sent me a check.

I deposited the check and found out the next day that the credit card payment was cancelled. I told the scammer that I won't buy the bitcoin until I know I have the funds. I said I would wait 3 weeks to make sure the funds don't get cancelled. Now the scammer is threatening to sue me.

672,"Just so you can get an idea of who I am, I was one of those kids who naturally had good grades. My parents never put me in a gifted program or cambridge, but I used to get A's and B's like it was nobody's business. By the time highschool came around. I was able to keep up good grades (barely ever falling past a D) but I was a huge procrastinator. I would wait until the night before the last night to do a 2 week long powerpoint project, and still pass (and that was something I bragged about, too.)

Now, for anyone reading this who hasn't gone to college, a school year at hs = one semester at college. Basically, you have \~5 months to do the entire class (in fall at least). Now, given how lazy I am with assignments, I *may* have missed the entirety of my algebra and english classes (two subjects I excel at, which makes this even worse) and almost did the same thing with my business app class (microsoft office class).  


At the start of the year, I chose those two cuz they were easy and I could get them out of the way, They're also my only two non-call based online classes, meaning you do them when you feel like it and nobody reminds you about them unless you have a friend in that same class. See the problem? It's a recipe for disaster and I dove straight into it. When I realized I had missed about a month's worth of work, I had just started getting my first real job as well. I told myself I would email those teachers so that I could have a chance to do them sometime. Never happened. I never emailed them, the amount of work snowballed, I felt more and more stressed, and eventually it got to a point where I could do literally nothing. The final is coming soon and I know that even if I try to do anything I'll fail those classes.

The thing that worries me isn't that, I can always retake them in an irl class (which is way better considering the way I treat assignments). What worries me is what my parents will say when I, their big brain son who has barely ever gotten a D, suddenly has 0% in half of all his college classes. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

I've been trying to piece together a sort-of speech or something I can tell them or even write them, I already know why this happened, I know it's all my fault, I know what to do about it and I also know what not to do about it. I just want my parents to understand that I'm sorry for not taking college so seriously at the start and letting everything get out of hand, and also that I know what I have to do next semester. Please, if any of you know what I can do or say to make this as least-painful as possible, it would be greatly appreciated.

676,"Hi all, new to this sub, on mobile so apologies for grammar etc. 

I work for a contractor that designs cable infrastructure for major cable companies. I‚Äôm a supervisor that leads a team of 7 designers. I‚Äôve been in my current position 4 years and it‚Äôs been a rough road but I‚Äôm to the point where I am accustomed to my position and I‚Äôm the most tenured supervisor in our department. 

Back when Covid came to my country we were all sent to work from home which I came to really enjoy. Due to the nature of my position this was not something I expected to ever be able to do. The restrictions have lifted somewhat now and I have been back in the office for some time now. Lately I have been thinking a lot about my time working from home and how much I enjoyed doing so. Over the summer we moved into a house where we have much more space and I have plenty of room to create a home office for myself. 

I really want to work from home again but the only way I would ever be able to do that is if I stepped down into a high level designer position, which I know I would be able to do as it‚Äôs been done by many over the years in the company and I have a good reputation and have many valuable skills. 

Thing is, if I were to do this I would lose any chance of being promoted again, my pay would be docked, likely not by much but enough to be considered, I would go from salary to hourly and I would lose the freedom being a supervisor offers. 

Pros of doing this would be that I would be offered overtime which could result in me making more money when it is offered. I would have more time and energy and would save money by not commuting the 25 minutes each way to and from work. My partner says that he felt I was happier working from home and on his days off we would be able to chat while I‚Äôm working and spend breaks together. He works weekends so this is attractive to me. I would also get more sleep on a nightly basis not having to commute. 


Would I be stupid to ask my leadership about this option? Would I be making a big mistake I‚Äôd regret later? Tell me what you think please. Thanks!",02Dec2020,1

679,"**TL;DR: Am failing hard at life because of a lack of motivation, energy and concentration to do literally anything. Want to improve but have no idea where to even start or what my problem is in the first place. Have tried therapy (for ADHD) without success.**

Sorry if this is a bit too long and incoherent. Every time I try to express what I'm struggling with(like now) I just get overwhelmed and have no idea where to even start. 

I haven't had a social life or real friends since I was 14 (I can't even fathom the concept of being in a romantic relationship). I've failed high school twice, dropped out of college twice and am on track to drop out of college this year. In short, my life the past 5 years has just been a meaningless repeating cycle of failure. I don't know whether it's just because I'm *extremely* lazy, have an undiagnosed physical/mental illness or if I'm just extremely stupid.

I was a bright and, though always shy and socially anxious, reasonably socially capable kid throughout primary school and middle school, but I feel like ever since I was 15-16 I've become progressively dumber to the point where I can now barely process *any* information and almost feel like I'm always high or just 'perceiving' life without actually processing or interacting with anything. This was most evident to me when I tried (and failed) to get my drivers license. I know perfectly well what the traffic laws are but was genuinely incapable of keeping track of anything that was happening on the road.

The past 2 years I've finally actually *tried* to study but discovered I'm too sluggish and empty minded to keep up at all. I always end up rereading simple sentences a few times and just giving up from mental fatigue. I feel like like I should be able to do better but also feel like social withdrawal and negligence of my cognitive development in my youth have wasted my potential. I spent a lot of my time aimlessly surfing YouTube and reddit (and still do). I did have hobbies but, despite investing a lot of time on them, never put any active effort into them. 

I have no fucking clue what my problem is. I know most of you will probably say it's a mental illness like depression/ADHD/anxiety etc. but the problem is that all of these illnesses are just a label for a cluster of symptoms which in turn are vaguely and subjectively defined. I understand how this could be helpful to others, but to me it seems completely useless. I've been to a therapist and was diagnosed with ADHD, but the treatment was pointless because the medication didn't help and the advice essentially boiled down to very simple and obvious advice I was already aware of. 

I feel like I missed out on some kind of secret to life or like I'm missing some essential component necessary for being human. It frustrates me how literally everyone I know has this figured out and just naturally and effortlessly 'goes with flow' while I struggle with every single facet of life. Even in the mental health community there seems to be this consensus of some kind of internal 'force' that's essential for overcoming a mental illness, yet I feel like that's exactly what I'm missing.

I really want and *need* to change, yet paradoxically at the same time am too lazy and apathetic to actually do anything and can't even imagine ever being a functional adult. I feel hopeless and am desperate for any kind of insightful advice that could put me on the right track.",02Dec2020,1

682,"I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out what‚Äôs happening to me, lately I find myself enjoying silence and solitude, so much so that I have almost completely avoided listening to music. Whereas in the past I used to enjoy music and listen to it nonstop, it was motivating, energizing and ultimately kept me going. My music genre interests have no filter and is of a wide range btw. Soon as life got harder, I started working harder. With music it seems like it tires me out faster or gives me a huge burst of energy all at once then I‚Äôd be so tired and weak to do anything else. I may be over exaggerating a bit but the point is one day I went a day without listening to music and it was hard at first because I‚Äôm one of those ‚ÄúLive breathe music‚Äù type of people and it was very foreign to me to go a day without music, however I felt unexpectedly more energized and more aware and ultimately stronger all around, it‚Äôs like meditating I guess, or going on a silent retreat. Soon, 1 day turned into a few days without music and now I‚Äôm at 3 weeks without music and sometimes I miss it a lot and I would have earworms from songs I heard a long time ago here and there. Today, I broke my streak and listened to a few songs and it felt AMAZING but not for long though and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm growing out of music(if that‚Äôs even a thing) or if I‚Äôm depressed and don‚Äôt know it? (Although I doubt it) basically what I‚Äôm asking for is why is my love for music dying and my newfound love for silence growing? And Is it normal? Is it healthy? Should I keep going?

683,"I work for one of the largest tech corporations and honestly I am terrified to write this as I have heard of past people getting burned for talking about this Kinda stuff online which i find inappropriate in it own right but thats another story for another time. 

So with COVID running rampant where i live and my store closed down and they were originally having us do at home work which was catching up on past due trainings, connect with you team leaders and such. After a while though they have required us to go into a customer service role which i was okay with and excited to have more to do but then reality set in. 

This service role covers a vast array of everything that the company sells even though I was never given the proper training for over the phone trouble shooting and policy. The managers at my store when we approached them about this said things are on the way to make things better, well nothing really changed. We just got an additional hour of training time During a two week period. Most of the trainings if you actually do them take usually 30-45 minutes because its tach specs, specific scenarios and such. So you would only finish one section Maybe just on policy and never really make it to the technical stuff because those trainings they flag as important and it forces you to do them first. 

We have a ton of staff falling into depression, anxiety, and mental distress with others who were on meds, seeing counselors in the past and trying to improve their mental head space seeing themselves falling back into those patterns. We have been working so hard with the top scores even with those that are in the actual position we are in, which to me says something more but now we have people calling out because of the anxiety that coming to work produces because those who have worked Customer Service know what it is. We have people calling in constantly screaming at us and yes you have to have a thick skin but it also takes a good manager to recognize this isn‚Äôt the position we signed up for and that there is a reason we chose to work in a physical location. 

No i get some people thrive in it and others don‚Äôt and if you don‚Äôt to make something else of yourself in finding another job or changing your circumstances. I have been on both sides with a previous job that I had i worked CS for around 2 and a half years and absolutely loved but the last 6 months of that job others things were going on and I couldn‚Äôt stay around there. 

We still have a handful of people at home still as well working on meetings and trainings and they don‚Äôt do much all day Besides have group huddles about national button day Or some odd holiday that is happening. They rarely focus on actual Productive things for their self development in their positions Which is more infuriating that a small group of us got the short straw and now get to get texts and emails about the meetings we don‚Äôt get to join in on Even though they preach to have a quote on quote ‚ÄúWhole store mindset‚Äú. 

 We also found out they are benefiting from us all joining the program. We got confirmation from a manager that is at another location that all managers are gettin bonuses if they can get us into these roles. They get to sit in their little office space and when we walk by they will be on meetings but they‚Äôll be on their phones doing nothing but playing games. Or they vanish on us and we got no clue where they went.

I am not a cynical guy and the managers were amazing at one point, I mean i had a heart to heart with one last year about my own personal problems with medical issues and i felt truly cared about but now it is the same responses with nothing truly changing for us and as each day passes we see less and less of them. We even asked for any kind of compensation as those who are actually in this role are making more than us yet we are asked to do more than them and when brought to the managers they decided to compensate us with headphones that have given so far everyone in store sores on their ears from wearing and taking phone calls that cost the company next to nothing to provide for us.

As you can tell I am rambling so to sum up my point, i want to be so angry and frustrated with the company and my managers because this company used to actually be something and now its nothing. When we approach them its the same responses. We aren‚Äôt being compensated for our work when we are doing just as much as someone who is in this role and they decide to compensate us with awful headphones and we are all bringing our own at this point. The trainings are so condensed that we went from what was supposed to be a month long training into a new system down to about 3 days with the 4th taking calls and having ‚ÄúSupport‚Äú that was there but never responsive. We have people who are mentally suffering but are terrified of losing their Jobs and the company tells us to call another one who then tells us to suck it up as it is only a service available for those who have worked the minimum hours (I have been with the company now for over a year and still don‚Äôt qualify for it Even though i was working 12+ hour days when we were open)  which isn‚Äôt specified and I never got a concrete answer as to what the amount is. For those who have got it are worried about using it to much even though they need that time away and losing their jobs since they‚Äôve gotten in trouble for using the system they tell us to use Which for me makes no sense at all and i must be missing pieces but this is everything provided from a collective roughly thirteen people i have been able to discuss this with or have approached me about it. 

(I took it upon myself to help those in store by just talking with people on lunches and using my time off to get a cup of coffee and go walk with them on their breaks if they are at work and need someone to confide in.)

Anyways I don‚Äôt want to think ill of my managers but at this point I want an understanding that they won‚Äòt provide to us. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here I will take any and all advice at this point and yes I am looking for a new job even though I loved working with the tech and working in a physical location I am watching everyone around me slowly become worse and worse. I want to help them and tried to have conversations with managers and like i said they just tell us things are going to improve and to stay thankful i at least have a job, which yes you should be greatful for but that isn‚Äôt what the conversation is about. so any advice or if you are in a similar situation I would love to talk about it and collaborate with people on ideas or anything at all really.

They are aware I am trans and refuse to use preferred pronouns, etc etc. They make fun of me for being feminine and yell at me for every seemingly minor thing such as my preferred form of sitting. When I was 12 and younger I was forced to stay in a squatting position for at least an hour for mistakes I have made, or inability to recognize every device on the shelves we use to used to store old school game consoles. Also made many threats of bashing my head through a wall. I remember once while in Germany my mother had popped chunks of my finger nails off or cut under them and put plastic sandwich bags over them to prevent blood from getting on things. I'm unsure of the reason of this. I have been trying to cut my wrist for the past year but I usually just making little ""cat scratches"" on my wrist usually due to numb hands. Also started telling people I am trans without even asking me if i wan them to be told.  


I believe they are the reason I have constant anxiety. I have a minor panic attack every time I talk to someone. The worst panic attacks happen when talking to too many people or someone with intentions to make me feel bad starts talking to me. Recently with online schooling I kinda gave up on most of my classes after my parents started threatening to cut my hair.

Hey reddit,

My life had been pretty hard lately, my dad is not doing well, with every day his walking gets worse and if this continues like this, he won't be able to Walk in a couple months.
My dad is 73 and in so scared to loose him, i don't know how much time he has left.
My newborn niece isn't doing well either.
She has some sort of liquid in het chest that keeps returning and my sister is breaking.
She doesn't think that my niece is going to survive.

In Times like this, i could really use a friend to talk to, but that's not the case.
I had a good friend until a couple weeks ago and we were really close.
I told him everything and he was always there for me.
But since a couple weeks, he has stopped talking to me.
When i was younger, i had the same problem, but then i didn't have any other friends.
Nobody wanted to talk to me or even look at me for more than 5 seconds.
I was discusting to them.
I can't explain how much pain i felt.
I can see it happening again and at first, i did everything to stop it.
I ended up running out of the class crying, because nothing worked and i was scared.
I told him everything and he cried, because he didn't knew he had hurted me so bad.
But the next day, nothing chainged.....
Things in my family were getting worse and i stopped caring about friends at al.

I don't know what to do, i actually don't have any energy left to talk to him again.

698,"Hi, Im 16 and I have been crosseyed since I was 8. I was in a knife accident that left one of my eyes damaged.. I was lucky to still have vision in the eye but, I developed strabismus (cross eyes). One of my eyes looks outward.

This accident ruined my life.

For physical problem: I get weekly painful headaches that sometimes affect my teeth and ears, I have double vision (I see 2 images of everything, one blurry, one not blurry), I have depth perception issues, reading can make my eyes hurt due to double vision, I cannot run or jump or do anything that's too ""physical"" and I cant do anything that changes eye pressure (roller coasters, airplanes, etc). For mental problems, I believe I suffer from anxiety, body dysmorphia and just terrible self-image issues. I had really bad depression from ages to 10-14, its when I started self-harming and developed an eating disorder. Im saying ""I believe"" because Im not officially diagnosed because my family doesnt believe in mental illness and would never get me medication even if I was diagnosed. They would say pray or just ""get over it"" . The closest my family got to getting me help was threatening to send me to call the police and send me to a mental institution.

I have been bullied ever since the accident and this of course made me become very introverted and I spent a couple of years unable to go to public places that wasnt school by myself. I once cried because my sister wanted me to go to Dollar General alone, it was that bad. Im not trying to get your sympathy, I am trying to make you understand how badly the accident affected me.

In 2018, I realized that I cant keep living like this and I have been self-harm free for 2 years and I try to be more confident and realize that sometimes, the voices in my head arent telling me the truth. But its hard. Theres no way to hide my damaged eye and I cant see it as a positive. Neither can I see my body thats filled with scar marks as a positive either. I like to act very happy and joyful but, I dont feel anything. When I see my body and my eye, all I think is ""Look at how you ruined yourself. This is all your fault.""

I cant change my damaged body or damaged eye but, I can make my eyes look more straight. I recently got strabismus surgery and while it has improved, its not where I need it to be. You can still tell my eyes arent straight/ My doctor told me that there was a chance I might need another surgery to properly fix the eye alignment issues. I think I need that next surgery. Also, if the next surgery works and fixes the double vision, I can improve my vision in the damage eye by getting rid of the double vision ( I always see 2 images of everything, one blurry and one not) and make the painful headaches I have due to the double vision disappear!

I cant stand myself, my reflection makes my skin crawl and I can feel the progress I made these past 2 years crumbling. I want to hurt myself, I am afraid to go outside (I am luckily going to online school), I cry all the time (when Im alone), I am skipping showers again and my grades are falling.

I have had around 4 other surgeries before this one (constant retinal detachment and other issues). I understand why my family thinks this surgery is dangerous because its a miracle my eye has lasted this long. My family doesnt want me to have another surgery but, the thing about eyes is the older I get, the harder the surgery recovery will be. Its December 2020 and I can maybe get it in Spring 2021 (March or April). I dont think my family understands how badly I need this surgery. All of my family either thinks I shouldnt get anymore strabismus surgery or that I should wait a full year (2022).

I dont know how to tell my family that another year spent in this ruined body is hell and I would rather kill myself than continue living like this. Ive been having suicidal dreams again and I keep thinking of realistic scenarios where I kill myself. I use to be a very happy, confident and fun person before the accident. I loved myself, my body and had tons of friends. And god, I was so freaking beautiful (just looking at photos of me before the accident makes me cry). I feel like fixing my cross-eye is the only way to return to the happy, pretty person I use to be. I dont want to live in this body.

700,"I‚Äôm in a difficult position here and it‚Äôs been stressing me out... for context I‚Äôm 15 and in high school.

I joined a science research program at the beginning of the year and it is a ton of work. It‚Äôs essentially a program that lets us create our own science project over the course of three years and work with real scientists. I was told it looks really good on a college transcript and sets people apart from the others, but it is extremely hard and a ton of work.

We had to pick a topic at the beginning of the year and mine is astronomy, it is super interesting but it is a very difficult topic compared to others. It requires a lot of knowledge of math and chemistry and computer science, and I‚Äôm not advanced in any of them. I did a bunch of research and now we are expected to email potential mentors (real scientists with PhDs) and I don‚Äôt feel ready.

The work is too much for me to handle on top of all my other honors classes. I have a really high grade in the class but it makes me feel extremely stressed. It requires over 10 hours of independent work every two weeks and over 100 over the summer. I‚Äôm only a sophomore, that‚Äôs a ton of work on top of everything else.

This class is a huge opportunity but i don‚Äôt know what I want to do with my life yet and it seems very directional, maybe I don‚Äôt want to do astronomy work in the future, I want to explore my interests more.

However, it is past the drop out deadline so this would be considered a withdrawal and I would get a W on my transcript, and I heard that can be a problem I‚Äôm the future. I have a 4.0 gpa but I don‚Äôt know what withdrawing will do to my chances.

What do I do? Do I stay in this very hard and stressful but rewarding class, or leave and get a W on my transcript and possibly miss a huge opportunity? Please help!",02Dec2020,1

704,"So ten years ago I made an on-and-off friend over the internet. They were always a bit difficult. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. But they had strong opinions and liked making people angry.  They could be really nice or really agitating, then really nice again. They also lacked empathy in some regard (not always, but certain topics) so at one point I stopped talking to them because it hurt my feelings. They tried to reach out to once but I was still mad.

Years later I by chance moved to their location. I offered to meet up to settle things and they accepted and we became good friends and spend a lot of time together. 

They still had their edge, however not against me. But I‚Äôve seen them lashing out at others, like accusing a friend of their partner of trying to steel them or something to the point were that person was really hurt. I never approved of such actions but just hold my tongue, when they told me. They also had a lot of partners during our friendship and consciously picked fights with them. I bring this up to show how this person interacted with others, not because I judge promiscuity, I don‚Äòt. 

However, they were nice to me. Once they offered for me to move in with them but I declined because I kinda knew that they are Someone to change their mind on a whim and then I might be homeless. After a few years I had to move away for personal reasons. They said they were going to visit me and I could always come and visit.

However, one day they stopped answering my Facebook. In the beginning i asked if I did something wrong but didn‚Äôt get an answer. After a while I chalked it off. 

The problem is that by chance I had to go back to their city for a special occasion and I randomly saw them on the street there. They saw me too and looked like they‚Äôve seen a ghost. They had their partner with them who looked puzzled and they literally retreated, taking steps backwards.

This is what bugs me most, this interaction when they saw me, didn‚Äôt say anything to me and then said ‚ÄûLet‚Äôs go‚Äú to their partner as if I wasn‚Äôt there. 

I logically understand that if you knew you kinda fucked up with someone and then randomly meet them on the street, that‚Äôs a very likely reaction. Most people would have turned and vacated. 


This was quite some time ago and I‚Äôm still angry about it and I want to stop. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äòm angry though. Most of the time they were warmer to me than I was to them. Now I wasn‚Äôt unkind or anything but like I said, I declined their offer to move together and kinda always knew that this wasn‚Äôt to last - which makes me being mad about it all the more puzzling.


I don‚Äôt know if I did anything wrong and I honestly doubt it. Before they cut contact we didn‚Äôt argue or even touch controversial topics. I lived in another city. The only hint I have is that  once they told me how their partner was jealous of me because we chatted all day. However, their partner was present during that encounter, although I don‚Äôt know if they knew who I was because we never met. 

One thing I can pin down, though. Back then they were more affluent than me because I was still a student and they sometimes gave me a drink or something. I don‚Äôt think either overspend when buying gifts or going out or that I was behind but I kinda looked forward to buy nicer gifts for them some day. I don‚Äôt know of it makes sense. Now I never got to do it and that bugs me somehow. Also I somehow want them to know that I am no longer poor/am working although that never really was a topic. They did not put me down or belittle me. 

As I said I don‚Äôt understand what is agitating me here. Last night I thought I read online they had cancer and thought about reaching out but then decided against it. I don‚Äôt know what this means.

706,"Please tell me if this fits better somewhere else because I kinda think it does. I just don't know where else besides here to post this.

I've noticed that I generally just don't like people all that much. I'm a quiet guy and I basically don't make any friends. When I do speak up in a conversation or something I can sometimes be ignored. Doesn't bother me too much though. Not sure if that was relevant, but here's the real meat and potatoes of this: I've never found myself particularly attracted to anyone either. Sexually, yes. Romantically? No.

However, that completely changes whenever someone shows interest in me and gives me compliments (also provided that I'm attracted to their looks, obviously). So I am not one to initiate any flirting or anything because I never felt that way to begin with, but when it comes my way I feel obligated to reciprocate. If someone loves me, I love them back. But I never love first. Does that make sense?

Now what's troubling me is that I'm not sure I actually love them back. I think I might just be excited by the thrill or the attention or whatever else, I don't know... My feelings tend to fade over time so that may very well be the case.

I guess I'm looking for more of a ""why"" than advice. But here's this anyway: What should I do? Succumb to my feelings and ride it out hoping that things keep coasting along or should I stop these feelings as soon as they happen? Knowing that they're just temporary. My ""why"" question is why do I feel this way? Is this common?

707,"Greetings, 

I've been living in Southern California now for the past 10 years, which has been a lifelong dream of mine ever since growing up in Oklahoma. I was recently offered a good job opportunity in sales but like the title says, I must move out of San Diego and back to Oklahoma for the next few years. 

It's a great opportunity, and honestly California seems like it's falling apart (high state income tax, overcrowding/traffic, massive homeless problem, also not a huge fan of the politics) but the thought of leaving feels like i'm giving up on my dream and gives me anxiety. Even with all the downsides Southern California still has appeal, but I feel like it's almost impossible to achieve wealth here and that I will always be playing catchup and living paycheck to paycheck.  

The job opportunity and pay would be great if I took the job, but I know I would be missing the weather and attractions that Socal has to offer. Am I looking at this whole opportunity the wrong way? What would you do?",02Dec2020,1

I don‚Äôt wan to say that I‚Äôm a loner, it is more so that I couldn‚Äôt care less about any type of relationship. Friendly, familiar, intimate. I abandoned my family and moved to another country(I‚Äôm originally from a small country in the Caucasus mountains zone) for me It was as easy as going to the grocery store. I didn‚Äôt feel that I was leaving anything behind. I had been gone for 4 years, and now I came back due to Covid-19 complications. I didn‚Äôt miss anyone during that time, including friends and family, not even a particular place of activity. It was like MEH, and when I came back, I didn‚Äôt feel anything either when I saw everyone. I won‚Äôt go so deep about myself and get straight to the point.
HOW do I tell my family about it?(Considering the fact that I have ultra-conservative and devote christian family) How do I explain what I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feel‚Äù. Where do I even start.

712,"So I'm a 27 y/o male. I have a stable, well paying job. I live with my girlfriend of about 3 years in our home city. And every single day I ask myself - what's next? What's my goal? Whats my plan?

I guess let me back up a little bit more and give some background info on where my confusion and anxiety comes from.

I met my girlfriend in early 2018. We hit it off right away, and moved in together less than a year into our relationship (this was/is also my first real, serious, relationship.) Also in early 2018, I landed my current job. A job in a new career path that I had been studying for and taking courses to get into (post graduation from college).

At this point, everything was going so well. But also at this point, I was sort of just ""going with the flow."" The flow being the expected motions of someone around my age - finishing school, serious relationship, working full time, etc. I must mention though, that I was completely infatuated with my girlfriend and just wanted to spend every single moment and do everything together.

Before meeting my girlfriend, all my spare time was put into my hobbies. I'm a big outdoor activities guy, and I traveled a ton to partake in my hobbies (being from a place that has pretty much flat land, I was traveling to places with much more mountainous terrain).

But when I met her, my whole world got turned around and everything I did was either with her, or for us. I guess I can say that I kind of lost myself a bit.

Fast forward to late 2019/early 2020. After being with my girlfriend for some time, after settling into each others lives, I wanted to get back to some of my hobbies. I wanted to be more physically active again. So I had set out to do so, planning trips with some friends or going solo to hike/bike/ski/etc. I was open with her and she was well aware of my plans. She was also interested in partaking in a few of my activities. So we agreed that I could do my own thing so I could partake in my activities to my full potential without her holding me back as long as we planned some activities where we can go together and I can help her. So that's what we did.

Early 2020 comes around, and I head out on my first trip of substantial time without her (about 8 days). She completely lost her mind. She couldn't survive on her own. She barely ate. She called me every night crying. She was lost. She didn't know what to do.

Backing up a tad bit - when we moved in together, I had lived on my own a few times before but had been moved back in with the parents for a bit. She had never left home. She never really cooked for herself, did chores for herself, etc. She never really had her own life. She was and is still very dependent on her parents, and now, is very dependent on me.

So after this early 2020 trip, we talked about it, and she agreed to try better next time.

Pandemic hits, and were both working from home full time now. Fine. Nothing wrong here, I pretty much have my space to work all day and she has hers. Pandemic loosens up a bit, and I plan another trip. This time going with my Dad (who is also very active and physically fit). This trip was even worse than the first one. Her anxiety was on a whole other level. I had to call her in the morning, I had to call her at night. She couldn't get a word out without crying. It was honestly pathetic. And I tried to be understanding, and when I got home she was extremely apologetic. But it affected me in such a deep way. Like she completely ruined my trip because she couldn't take care of herself.

Okay, so yeah, I guess my girlfriend and I have some differences. But I honestly didn't and still don't think that it's nothing that we can't work through.

Coming back to the ""what's next"" in my life - for a while now, well over a year, I've played with the idea of moving. Moving to a location that better suits my interests. Given the nature of my work, it has always been a possibility, but with the pandemic and all, it became much more of a serious thought and one that I think of every single day.

Could I move and be happy? Yeah sure. It will probably suck at first, not knowing many people and all. But I don't have any doubts that I could do it. I'm more of an introvert anyway, so I'm not necessarily looking for a ton of friends. But could my girlfriend do it? We actually talked about it. We talked about moving, and she said she probably couldn't move too far. After all, she wants to be able to see her family. But I see her being unable to do it given all of the other things that have happened thus far.

And then comes the question of children. When I first met her, I had said that I wanted them. But again, I was kinda just going through the motions. She definitely wants to have children. Here I am today, questioning that decision. I don't know if I want children. I keep telling myself that maybe in the future, but if I think back 5 years or even 10 years, I never had a burning desire to have kids of my own.

One more thing I want to add - her family. I don't like her parents. They're kinda gross, only like to drink for fun, very rude people. Complete opposite of how I grew up. So any time I have to spend time with them, it puts me in a bad mood. I'm not sure what the relationship between in-laws is supposed to be like, but I absolutely don't have the desire to spend time with them ever. Furthermore, her parents and I have never really had a good conversation about anything. Meanwhile, my parents and my girlfriend get along so well.

To you guys, maybe you see this as black and white. Maybe you see it as that we aren't meant to be. But I do love her. I love spending time with her. But I also don't want to be held back. If I move without her, i'm afraid that i'll regret my decision. I don't want to let go of all the things we've done, all the memories we have. And if I do move, what if I hate it? Life sure will be different without her.

So here I am, confused, emotional, and asking the people of reddit for some advice on what my next steps should be in my life. Because every single day I run through this and every single day I think I have a decision, but I never do. I just don't know what I want next.",02Dec2020,1

715,"Let me start by saying that I do not consider myself innocent in this situation and I know and accept my responsibility that came with my actions. It's something I grapple with everyday and I am still learning to forgive myself for. I know that this is long winded and all over the place but I felt like a lot of this context is necessary to understand this guy.

This all started my freshman year of college on the first day of classes, when I \[F18\] met this junior \[M20\] who was full-stop, the most attractive person I have ever seen. I didn't think anything of it or express any interest because he was so objectively attractive that I figured that he had a girlfriend. However, from that first day that we met onward, this guy started coming on to me hardcore. I didn't pick up on it because I was oblivious and naive, until one day he invited himself to my dorm room to ""study"" and suggested we hookup, which caught me by complete surprise. That was the start of us hooking up (2 years ago). I was really starting to fall for this guy; we were spending so much time together and I was an innocent 18 year old who never had anyone touch her that way, especially someone so attractive and experienced. We were hooking up 6 days a week, multiple times a day at one point and to me, at the time, he really seemed like my dream guy.

Until one day, he told me he got a girlfriend (I'll refer to her as ex-girlfriend), so we can't continue our sexual relationship and just remain friends. His ex went to a college a few hours away from ours. I respected his relationship and didn't talk to him outside of anything class-related. Despite me backing off, he never changed his behavior. He would still act extremely flirtatious and suggestive. One night, he texted me and asked me if he could come over because he was upset and needed a friend. He seemed to be genuine so I agreed, but I texted him back saying that I would not be doing anything with him. He came over teary eyed, talking about how his childhood friend was found dead after going missing a few hours prior to that. I told him I was really sorry about that. Then, it was like his mood suddenly switched. He started rubbing on my thigh and biting his lip and asking to hookup. In that moment, I felt so bad for him and thought maybe this was his weird way of grieving, maybe he needed it to comfort him and I felt like I couldn't say no. So we did. Except this time, my hymen broke so I bled a bit and he got freaked out, asking me if I had an STD. I spent the night crying to my friends and washing my sheets.

He breaks up with his ex a few weeks later and we were back to our regular hookup routine. It's hard to justify why I continued to be physical with this guy, but I still had feelings and rose-colored glasses on for him. He also treated me like I owed him my body and would get really upset at me when he came over and I refused to hookup with him. Eventually, he tells me that he got a new girlfriend. It wasn't until later that I found out that he had this girlfriend long before he told me about her.

They've been together for almost two years now. While they have both graduated and continue to reside in my college town, I am now a junior in college. In those two years, he has cheated on his girlfriend with me, continued to contact me (most recently being two weeks ago), and overall shown me that he has not at all changed as a person.

I'm angry that I have to deal with the suffering and guilt of being the other woman and betraying my morals while he gets to happily celebrate anniversaries, seemingly guilt-free and without repercussions. I feel even more guilty because he's told me his girlfriend is a virgin saving herself for marriage (unless he's already gotten her to give it up now) and at this rate she'd be giving her virginity to a cheater. I'm scared to say anything because he has told me that ""no one would ever believe you, I always have a story"" and he's very physically intimidating to me (hes 6'3 and I'm petite in stature). On the other hand, I feel sympathetic towards him too. All things said and done, I have a soft-spot for him and I know a lot of his behavior is probably the product of his upbringing and religious trauma (he's the son of a pastor). I also don't know if he's got some sort of mental health issue or if he's just a boldface gaslighter. Sometimes he'll tell me that he did or said something to me before that he never did or convince me that something didn't happen (that definitely did), I suspect to convince me that I'm crazy.

My question is, do you think I should tell his girlfriend truth? Some of my friends convince me that there's no way she doesn't already know what kind of guy he is, but I know him and I know that he's good at perfecting a facade to get what he wants (he's done it to me after all). There's a chance she won't believe me, a chance he'll come after me, but also a chance that she'll marry him and have his kids and to me, that's worse. Part of me also wants to see them breakup because I feel like I've lost so much of myself at the hands of this guy and there isn't any justice. He's allowed to pretend like he never did any of the things that he's done while I'm still picking up the pieces of what I went through with him. I want him to lose something too. However, I know that is a selfish intent and that pushes me in the other direction of walking away from it and allowing it not to be my issue anymore.

TL;DR: Guy cheated on his girlfriend with me for two years, do i tell her?",02Dec2020,1

718,"So this might be long but I appreciate any responses. 
I've been working at a company again(I quit a couple years ago) since late October. The reason I'm back is my old boss, whom I left on very good terms when I quit, called me up and asked for my help. He knows I have medical issues and had a side gig with well paying clients(I was not hurting for work in any sense and he contacted me out of the blue). He had a position for me that he said he needed me specifically for. (Prior experience in field, similar position and rapport/manageability of people I'd be dealing with) he stated it would be temporary, no more than 6 months long and I'd just be doing this one job in this one location. I agreed. 

As for my side gig, I passed my clients on and announced I was unavailable for future bookings with new clients. I made myself fully available for this new position my boss asked me to fill. I show up a week early as asked, to get equipment and working area ready to setup in this new location. A week later we find out this new position and location is unavailable due to contract issues with rented workplace. The position is not needed anymore now and essentially doesn't exist until January 2nd of 2021.

When he told me this I said,"" well see you January 2nd"" as the only reason I came back was specifically for that position. He said I can't do that because it would require them to do the hiring process again and clearance costs, would make it financially unwise for the company. So since beginning of November I've been on a part time schedule and  doing random job tasks(lots not in my description) as well as a ""similar"" job position just in this location. I've been called in on my days off to do tasks in a different area not in my job description to assist other employees. I've been called in by not my boss, but his wife(she works there and is second in commandish), whom I'm also on good terms with(they consider me family, invite me to holidays and have a birthday lunch every year for me) I feel he's having her make those calls because he knows our relationship is close and I'm softer on her. 
My bosses wife just asked me to come in tomorrow and start full time schedule. I informed I can't I have a doctor's appt. So I start Friday (one of my days off)instead. I'll be doing something not in my original job or position description, also not in the area the position was dictating. 
Do I not deserve more than a day's notice? I shouldn't even be here in the first place. I didn't want this job. I quit this job in the past because I didn't like it, was unfulfilled and the toll on my health wasn't worth it. Now starting tomorrow (until supposedly January 2nd when the original position is available) I'll be doing exactly the same thing that I quit for in the past.

I feel I'm being taken advantage of, disrespected. Short notice call ins, out of job description tasks. I don't even have an actual work place/desk/office I just migrate to where I'm needed. I signed up to come back for the ORIGINAL POSITION stated by my boss. He was aware of why I quit in the past, aware I was only coming back for that specific new position. Aware I left my side job to come through for him and this company. Why am I still here?  Also don't I deserve better? Haven't I earned more than this? It's getting to the point where other employees are even upset FOR me. They are bothered by what's happening to me as well. Am I over reacting? Feeling this way for no reason?",02Dec2020,1
719,"Hi reddit, I (25f) am planning to move abroad for a month in March to do a teaching course. I have been talking about moving abroad for YEARS to the point people will roll their eyes when I talk about it because I have made so many plans without committing. 

The thing is I have been dealing with anxiety since I was around 17. It was very bad for a while to the point I didnt leave my house for a few years, stopped going to school (although I didnt officially drop out I just stopped attending) and had to leave uni as well. 

I have come on leaps and bounds in the last year or two. I finally got my first ever job, started volunteering with animals which is something I've always dreamed of doing and just generally started to get my life back on track.

I booked my course abroad on a whim before the virus had really taken hold. Something snapped in my head and I realised that if I don't do it now I won't get the chance. I was so excited and proud of myself and told absolutely everyone. I am still excited but as March comes closer I have noticed myself deteriorating. This lockdown is taking a toll on me even though I have been at work throughout so it hasnt been as hard on me as others. I am so stressed about going to a new place with no one I know in a language I don't understand. I am taking lessons but obviously I wont be fluent or anywhere near that by the time I go. I am panicking about Covid and getting trapped there with no support and no way to get home if theres a new lockdown. What if I get a job there but lose it due to a lockdown?

I'm also terrified of cancelling and proving to myself and others that I'm not capable. I feel like an absolute child. I have been waking up recently feeling like someone is sitting on my chest. I went to the doctor today, got some blood tests and asked to be referred to counselling to help me deal. 

Do you think I should cancel? Should I try to keep going? I dont know what to do and I dont want to drop out of something again as it's all I'm known for. Thank you for any advice.",02Dec2020,1

I start to accept the reality as it is and really looked beyond the current situation and said to myself:"" whatever I am letting go."" yet, the very next day, I woke up with anxious thoughts. I started to have my panic and intrusive thoughts. I couldn't hold myself. The air was blowing cold, I couldn't feel my feelings and let them just be. I felt it wasn't the right time to meditate. I wasn't in peace at all. A wave of depression hit me so hard. I started to look for my motivational resources. Didn't work out. I felt so down. Depression is not a linear line.

I've been noticing that Everytime i walk by she looks up to look at me and im the only guy at work that has actually full conversations with at work. Recently out of nowhere she told me that she went out with some guy from high school but she told me is was so bad that she told her friend to call her so she could pretend to have an emergency and leave. I didn't really know what to say a girl has never said this to me ever. So i just past it off like no big deal.

722,"Last Thursday, she hugged me and she just cracked. She started crying, I didn't know what was wrong and still don't. She later confessed to me that she has been feeling down because of things that happened in the last few months, I don't know what because she doesn't want to go into it.

She is always helpful, happy, and is always there for you. So it really breaks my heart to see her like this. Not only last Thursday, but last Friday and today she hugged me and just started crying. Thursday was the worse, she completely lost it.

I've talked to her and she says that she doesn't want to bother us with it because she feels like we're being obligated to help, I'm not good at expressing myself but I tried my best to explain to her that I do care about her and it breaks my heart to see her like this. I don't see her as an attention seeker, she is always closed and doesn't like to get attention to her. Only I know of this, I don't even know if her parents know that she is like this, when there are people around she controls herself but when we're alone she really goes down.

I've tried explaining to her that she shouldn't be afraid or scared to come to talk to me or to ask me for help, but I don't know how to express myself all that well so not sure how that turned out. What should I do about this?",02Dec2020,1
723,"Dear Reddit

Since I can remember, my mom struggled with manic depression as well as ADHD (unable to take stimulants due to a birth-defect in her heart). Nonetheless, she always gave her everything for my father, my brothers and myself and she did everything in her power to to make our life as good as possible. 

Between keeping a household, looking after my brothers and me and sometimes severe depression, she never really had the time and energy to pursue a serious career. In addition, the job she learned has become obsolete due to digitalisation (telephone line operator). Even though she already had (and still has) a lot on her plate, she always tried working at least part-time in whatever job she could get a hold of to help with the bills. Mostly she worked in office-jobs, sometimes at ware-houses lifting heavy boxes even though she has back and knee issues. However, she really had a streak of bad luck, with several of the companies she worked at closing down or laying off staff. 

Even though she was already in her fifties, she started a formal education as a medical office assistant to have an additional degree to show to prospective employers. She graduated at the absolute top of the school after putting in an insane amount of work every day while still keeping a household. Although she wrote literally hundreds of applications (customized for every employer, not just standard forms, not one wanted to hire her. 

Turns out, most employers do not want to hire her because of her age and 'lack of experience', even though she worked in related jobs forever. This obviously led to a lot of frustration on her part and did not help with depression.

She was scheduled to attend a month-long therapy at a specialised clinic for depression, which was now postponed indefinitely due to COVID-19. When we talked lately, she suddenly broke out into tears, telling me she feels worthless due to her not being able to get a real job. This has always been an issue for her and now that she has more time for herself due to us kids being older even more so. 

Of course I told her that she already had the most important job in the world, being our mom and the one that keeps the whole house even running. However, this (understandably) does not fix her problem and it breaks my heart seeing such a lovely person with a good work-ethic struggling so hard. I did a lot of research on jobs and I already found some jobs that I would consider realistic, e.g. as a virtual assistant or content writer for company websites. However, I want to make sure I leave no stone unturned in my search for a job for her, as she really had enough of bad luck in her life.

I am searching for part-time (20-50%) jobs that do not require an additional extensive education, have currently open positions (and are willing to hire people in their 50s) and do not require heavy lifting or walking for miles on end. In the best case this job could be done from home, as she is a high-risk patient of COVID-19 and it would enable her to continue working even if she eventually can visit the clinic.

Please Reddit, for the love of god, help a man and his mother, who always helped him. It breaks my heart seeing her this way and not being able to do something about it. I am writing this in tears myself so sorry if my writing is somewhat all over the place.

Thank you so much for reading and all the best

TW: suicidal thoughts

So my (f early 20's) friend (f early 20's) feels very alone. She doesn't have a good relationship with her family and she is single. She feels very lonely, and it's hard to meet new people in a pandemic. 
I try to help her as much as I can but I'm very mentally unstable and can't always do everything I would want to do. I'm extremely depressed and have c-ptsd that can't be treated rn. I've lost my job because of this. I really try to help her as much as I can. When we could go out, I would try to be a good wingwoman, I always helped her talk to men. I helped her with all her family problems and was always there to talk to her. I'm even going to spend christmas with her instead of my family.
But lately I don't know what to do anymore. I try to help but everything falls on dead ears. She doesn't want to go on dating apps, which is good, I don't like dating apps. But she also doesn't want to persue anyone herself, she thinks that sets an expectation in the relationship that she'll be the dominant one. I told her to maybe try to change the way to feel about this, through therapy possibly, so even if nothing changes that she doesn't feel so miserable about it. She doesn't want to do that either. She says that the only way she can solve this is either 1) cut every person out of her life so nobody can remind her of her loneliness or 2) kill herself. Of course I don't agree with any of those options and want to help her but she doesn't want any of my help. I've tried talking with her about her feelings but they are so triggering for me that I get really upset after we've talked. 
This friendship hasn't been the best, and she has tried to end it several times, and I try my best to make it up. Last time, I agreed and tried to break it off in a way that would not be too damaging for both (all the times she did it was extremely hurtful for me) but she got too sad and I stayed. Her reason for breaking off the friendship is that I do have a partner and recently my family and I have been on good terms. She doesn't like that because she feels lonely.

I don't know what to do because this makes me feel like I'm not good enough and it's very triggering for me. But I'm scared to cut her off because I don't want to be the reason she kills herself and she is my only friend. It makes me upset to the point of not eating or sleeping and even fainting of stress and dissociating. Does anyone have any advice?",02Dec2020,1
725,"Hey guys, my friend and I occasionally get into political discussions. It's not important what about, just know it was around politics. Usually, these discussions are civil, or at least lighthearted in nature.

This argument started when I shared a meme with political undertones that I didn't pick up on the first time. We started discussing it. I presented them with a piece of data that I wanted them to address. They ignored my question and data, which I presented and asked about twice, and said that they have a lot of data that 'proves the opposite'. I asked them to show their rumored data so that I can see it.

They never did, and they totally lost their cool. They gaslighted and said how horrible of a person I was for not agreeing with them. They said that we weren't best friends anymore. They said that they were angry and disappointed with me for THEM not showing the facts and the basis of their argument. Sorry, I like to form opinions around evidence? They made the claim that they already showed me the data and statistics in a previous conversation, and they weren't going to waste their 'fucking time' on saying it again because I wouldn't listen. That's false. I want to know what it was, and I remember having a discussion on the topic, but I cannot remember one piece of data that they presented on the issue, which they took as me 'not caring about what they say'.

I know they won't apologize. They will just stay away from me and cut off communication as they did once in the past. What should I do/say? I'm at a loss.",02Dec2020,1

She has gone to them about how I don‚Äôt do her dishes, where I park my car, blah blah blah. This is $250! Not dishes! When he approached me about not doing her dishes he said ‚Äúyou know what will happen if y‚Äôall can‚Äôt get along‚Äù which meant I would have to move to Cali w/my mom. What the hell is wrong w/these people? So now I‚Äôm all scared to call my dad &amp; ask what‚Äôs up(I hate going to them about anything cuz I know the response) but I don‚Äôt want to put tension @ Xmas. But I cannot let this go. She walks around like I did her wrong! I called my dad on tues just to see if he would bring it up but he never said ONE WORD! What should I do? How should I approach him on the unfairness in treatment between her &amp; I?",02Dec2020,1
748,"Hello everyone, This is a throwaway account. I really don't know how to comfort people properly, I've come to ask for advice so that I don't make the other person feel like..... Bad... When it's clearly not their fault. Because tbh I'm  a bitch when it comes to talking to people.
My older sister was sexually assaulted a little while back. She didn't tell anyone about it until recently. She told my elder sister, and my elder sister advised her that she should go to a doctor. The thing is she's still underage and needed a guardian to take her. We told our mother and my mom didn't take it so well. She was hysterical. We couldn't tell our dad because we are indian and have a very strong 'honor ' culture in our society. My sister would have not been safe. My mother takes her to our grandmothers house in other city to visit the doctor and according to my older sister she had to hear things like "" it would have been better to kill you"" from my grandmother.
I can't imagine the mental toll it must have taken on her. She'll be coming back this Saturday and I don't know how I should talk to her, we've never been really close but I really do care for her and I want her to know that it isn't her fault. What should I do or say to convey my feelings? What should I do to let her know it isn't her fault? She's been through such a traumatic experience, what things should I avoid?

750,"Basically what the title says but I wasn't sure how to word it and it's not sounding right. I have been working since I was about 14 years old. I've always been a server or bartender, sometimes as a 2nd job/side hustle, even after I graduated college and started working in my field. I've also worked in the medical field, doing both patient care and administrative type stuff.

A few years ago I was updating my resume and decided to make one with just my hospitality experience, and one with my professional/office/medical experience. At the time I was applying for multiple jobs and I figured that the medical office job would want to see my work history related to that field, not my experience as a bartender, and vice versa. If and when I have an interview, I do mention that I have other work experience but I didn't include it in the application process because I didn't know if it was relevant. I always have extra copies of both resumes when I go to an interview. 

So, is this a common thing? Or should I combine them all on to one? It seems like a stupid question but I'm curious as to what everyone has to say. I'm currently working on updating it again because I'm going to be applying for a few different jobs (thanks COVID), and I'd like to hear what people have to say about this before I start that process. 

If this isn't the right sub to post this on, please let me know which one is a better fit. I didn't think r/askreddit would be the right one. Looking forward to getting some advice on this!",02Dec2020,1

753,"Yesterday my girlfriend received a text from an out-of-state number that suggested I was harassing or making advances on them in some way and told her to tell me to ""stop it"". Despite this being false and unfounded, what disturbed me was that this person knew my name. 

Screenshot, with the number: [https://imgur.com/a/LlJHBHU](https://imgur.com/a/LlJHBHU)

What disturbed me even more was that, after my girlfriend responded by asking ""who is this?"", a reply came that she should ""know who it is"" and that she should ask ME for clarification. Most disturbing of all, though, is that this individual also knew my girlfriend's dad's name - and threatened to have their brother call him in order ""deal with this"". 

I want to know how this person knew my name, connected me to her, found out HER number, her dad's name, and texted her these things that seem to have no purpose but to shake my girlfriend's trust in me. Luckily, it didn't work, but his goes slightly deeper for me:

My family has received texts, emails, and phone calls with this MO for years. My mom has received them (and still does, occasionally), men she has dated have received them, and so have my grandparents. They are usually not overtly threatening; they are usually somewhat innocuous statements that are only disturbing because they contain intimate details about us that they could only know if they were somewhat close to us. We have a very strong suspicion that it is my estranged father, for a lot of very circumstantial reasons and also because he never seems affected by this. We haven't spoken in a number of years, until very recently I tried to make amends with him and we've only had an open dialogue for 4-5 weeks - and now, suddenly, these messages are returning?

I care very much about my relationship and am angry that there is someone out there that would want to sabotage it, but I am more so motivated by giving myself and my family closure in finding the origin of these messages. I've done some cursory Google searches and found that this number is linked to many claims of threatening messages. My suspicion is that this is a proxy number that you can pay for to send anonymous messages to.

Could anyone could help me find a way to find out the more specific origins of these messages? Perhaps there is a way to see the geographical location (which would prove it right there) of the messages in question, or maybe obtain a user log from whoever owns this phone number?",02Dec2020,1
754,"I recently took a DNA test that revealed I have a biological uncle on my mother‚Äôs side. My mother was adopted and didn‚Äôt know anything about her biological family.

I wanted to reach out to him for various reasons, including out of curiosity too to know if he even knows my mother exists and what the story was regarding her birth (which we still don‚Äôt know). I have a hunch he doesn‚Äôt because he was born years after her. 

After some searching I couldn‚Äôt find much on him other than a phone number. I gave the number a try and my uncle‚Äôs wife answered. I politely introduced myself and told her I wanted to speak to ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù. She asked ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù I said because he showed up on my dna results and I had some questions regarding it. I tried to keep it casual and brief so it wouldn‚Äôt invite too much suspicion from her. She wouldn‚Äôt allow me to speak to him and asked me to tell her first how I was related. I said I could tell her once I spoke to ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù directly, that I felt it only proper I reveal the results to him first rather than he learn about it secondhand through someone else. His wife still refused and said I could send him a message instead and gave me his email (it was a very anonymized looking email).

755,"Hello.  
I'm going to go straight to the point. I have no friends, and I can't make any new friends, no matter how hard I try. All-day, I do nothing, all I can do, besides school, is stay in my house and do literally nothing productive all day. I think I came pretty close to getting some friends a couple of times:

when someone introduced me to a discord server ( I can't even call him my friend because he won't interact with me in any way at all and mostly all he does is ignore me). I started speaking with a few people, they seemed nice. I played with them a couple of times. But then they just started ignoring me, no one would respond if I asked them if they wanted to play something, sometimes one of them responds, but they just change their mind and just won't even enter the call. I gave up on that, I guess I was just not good enough for them. The only other couple of times was just social interaction with people outside and then never seeing them again.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so alone. I can't talk with anybody. The best thing I can do is go onto games based on player-made servers and try interacting with the people there. Usually, it's fun and I get to talk to a lot of people, but after a short while, I would just leave and never hear from them again.

I plan on going to college next fall or take a leap year depending on global circumstances and I want to earn some money before I head off. 

Although I ""quit"" at the beginning of the school year, if they need help on a shift because they cannot get anyone else in and I am not super busy I will come in and help them out. This only has happened twice sense mid August so they are not taking advantage of me. The pay is good, 13-17$/hr depending on tips, my managers and coworkers are alright, I get food at cost, and I have a good relationship with some of the regulars. My only complaint is the occasional sexual remark by middle aged women. The first few times I freaked out but now I can ignore it fairly well. (thanks r/AITA). Also, just so you guys know my area has fairly low rates of covid the the GM did set up a good amount of protection, often  more than what my state demanded. My GM has also said that she will have a position for me if I want to come back full time next summer. 

I am considering this, but I am also considering either A: finding a higher paying job at a nicer restaurant, or B: volunteering at a hospital. 

But, I know I like my current and it pays alright, but neither of those are fully guaranteed during this time, especially if we get hit harder with covid in this area. 

I want to earn money so volunteering is not super appealing to me, the nearest hospital is 45-60 min away depending on traffic, and many of those positions require at least so prior experience.

775,"hello, first of all, i'd like to start with this: i'm an influencer. okay so: my brother (m, 17)  and i (f, 22) don't normally have heart-to-heart or serious talks. so we rarely, if not never, talk about our issues with each other. and we do fight but we also have our neutral moments and then the fun bro-sis moments.

however, one thing i hate is how he never respects me and especially, my privacy. i think i've seen him done this before but more often recently, i've noticed him secretly taking random photos or videos of me and sending them to his friends. when i catch him, he'd immediately hide his phone and act like he wasn't doing anything sketchy.

just earlier, i was lying on my bed and he entered without knocking (my bedroom's lock is the only one in our house that's not functioning for some reason) and was on a video chat with some guy named matt. he was obviously filming and showing me to his friend and even said that person was greeting me a happy birthday. i have no idea who the guy he was talking with was nor was i prepared for the sudden intrusion. 

although you could say it's because i'm an influencer that he's doing this, i hate that he doesn't even ask for my permission. i'm still 5 years older than him. and i'm a very shy introvert so getting my privacy invaded like this is something i hate with a passion. before you say, ""but you're an influencer?"" yes, i maybe one and i've been one for a few years now but i've managed to be as private as i can with my posts. i never share my photo's locations until i've been out from that area or it's been a while since i went there. or unless it's a sponsored post, of course. and i've been taking care not to share any of my personal details that people can use to track me with.

so having my privacy being disrespected in my own house, in my own ROOM pisses the heck out of me.

781,"First of all, thank you for reading my long post. I'm 26 and feel like I'm out of options and really hoping that someone can see my situation from an outside perspective and possibly offer a solution that I didn't see before. 

1. Why I'm in the situation I'm in

Basically, I have IBS that is severe enough to make me bedridden most days with 8/10 pain. I have seen multiple gastroenterologists and nutritionists, had every test performed, tried every diet, tried tons of different medications. Nothing has worked, and the doctors don't really have much else to try. I also have mental health issues that could be contributing, but I have been working with therapists and have significantly improved my mental health. However, the pain is now worse than it was a year ago, to the point that I can barely function. I left my physically demanding job a while ago and was planning to pursue a career in programming, but the pain is now to the point that I am unable to study effectively.  I frequently forget what I'm doing in the middle of solving a problem, and find myself reading the same paragraph over and over without comprehending it. I even have trouble getting into a tv show at this point because it is a monumental effort to focus my attention away from the pain. 

2. The situation

Right now, I'm living in my parents basement and doing Door Dash about 20 hours a week. My expenses are around $1300 per month because of my car and car insurance, over the counter medications, credit card payments (I have tons of credit card debt because that's how I paid for medical care in my early twenties), and medical marijuana. I wish I could quit weed and reduce my expenses, but it's the only way I can sleep (I have tried over 10 different sleeping medications that weren't effective). I have been making about $800 per month doing Door Dash, and my parents were making up the difference. They are also buying my groceries and cover miscellaneous expenses like my $400 car registration the other month. They said they can't keep doing this, but my mom is a pharmacist, they just bought a new hot tub for Christmas, and they are on vacation right now. They tell me I need to be responsible for myself and I can plan accordingly, but I feel like I don't have any good options. Even if they would keep helping me, living here is not healthy for me since my parents are very judgmental, controlling, and not accepting of my sexuality or beliefs that are different than theirs. I'm really pushing myself to work even 20 hours per week, and I don't feel like I could do a 'regular' job right now. It kills me because I have always been an over-achiever. I finished college at age 20, worked my ass off in a bunch of different jobs/industries, traveled the world, and got in athlete-level shape. I continued my lifestyle for over a year after the pain started, but it kept getting worse and I just couldn't do it anymore. I don't have any relatives or friends I can live with long-term, and I'm not sure what to do. The only person in my family who is actually helping me is my Uncle. He is the choir director of a well-known church in San Francisco and has lots of connections there as well as in NYC. He said he is going to make some phone calls and see what he can do. I can't live with him because he and his husband live in a one bedroom apartment and they both work from home right now. That could be an option when Coronavirus is over though. 

3. What I need

In order to feel safe and comfortable, here is what I would need. Access to medical care, a place to live alone or with people who treat me well, and around $2000 per month coming in to pay for credit card bills, healthy food (mandatory with my health conditions), medications, car expenses, and miscellaneous expenses. Obviously more would be better in order to save for emergencies. I know I could possibly work something out with the credit cards, but my credit is still really high so I don't want to mess it up if I don't have to. I know I will need to do some kind of work, but I'm not sure what I can do, and I don't qualify for Medicaid if I make more than $1400 per month. 

4. Ideas

One thing I thought of is to try to find an older person who doesn't require significant medical attention, but could use some companionship during quarantine, and someone to cook, clean, and run errands for them. It seems like this would give me a purpose and there would be some downtime for me to rest. I don't know how I would go about finding something like this, but it could work. I still hope I might get better someday, but I feel like I need a good plan for what happens if I am permanently disabled. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - I have financial, physical, and mental (due to the pain affecting concentration and working memory) limitations, and I am looking for advice on how to find a stable situation for the long-term. 

Thank you for reading, and please share all ideas no matter how unconventional. Even though I'm sick I still love trying new things, and am open to pretty much anything that would get me into a stable situation.",02Dec2020,1
782,"Idk why she does this

In the past I had this extreme crush on a girl. Lately it is getting better and I almost fully lost interest in her because I am meeting new girls and just because I am feeling better in general.

This old crush of mine always kind of made me feel like she wanted something with me but eventually she always said she wanted to remain friends. She basically rejected me a couple of times and kept me on the hook or something

. I haven‚Äôt like spoken to her in 6 months and when we do see each other there is always a slight tension but I try to ignore it.

But now something weird happened, suddenly she texted me, asking me how I am and stuff. I respond, her next text is : why did you call me? So I told her I didn‚Äôt call her, she says: you probably pocket called me. I look and: I didn‚Äôt even pocket call her. I tell her that. Next thing I know she leaves me on read. 
This gives me the feeling that I am a foolish person or something and that it seems like I am pursuing her again, that totally sucks because I feel pretty good at the moment and I don‚Äôt want any girl to think that I am pursuing her. Or act like I do. I am not a stupid bee who works for queen bee. 

Now I am like, why would she do this. What is the point, does she want my attention? Does she just want to torment me? Does she like me but is to afraid to say and she is just trying to give me ‚Äòhints‚Äô. she knows how I felt about her, why does she do this? She has done things like this in the past, and it always ends the same. Maybe another woman can explain this to me. 

Or maybe I am the one who is being stupid and I pocket called her but my phone somehow doesn‚Äôt show it for the first time ever.",02Dec2020,1

Anyways... I‚Äôve also never felt more sexual and turned on before. He really brings that side out of me... which I thought was a good thing. 

The other day we were texting and he said something along the lines of ‚Äúsorry babe but the other day why I wasn‚Äôt feeling it while we were intimate is because it was too much. I want us to be romantic, have passion and love. Not just sex or lust‚Äù

784,"So I‚Äôm not sure where else to go to about this or who to talk to. I don‚Äôt use reddit much, but I‚Äôve been dealing with some friendship drama for over a year now and it‚Äôs been weighing pretty heavy on me. 

To start from the beginning: about a year ago, I joined a small discord server with some friends and acquaintances of mine. For context, we were in an art/writing community on Tumblr, and we shared much of our works in the sever with one another. I knew most of the people in the server, but a few of them were just friends of friends. One guy in the server (let‚Äòs call him ‚ÄòJake‚Äô) was someone a few of my other friends knew, although I didn‚Äôt know him that well. I spoke to him maybe once or twice, and he‚Äôd left comments on my writing pieces that I thought were very sweet. All around, he didn‚Äôt seem like a bad guy, but one thing I noticed about him was that he was never able to take criticism. His art wasn‚Äôt bad, per se, but he seemed to be under the impression that nothing he made could be improved, and he would have fits if people criticized him in any capacity. It also should be noted that he had a VERY strong sense of ‚Äòsocial justice‚Äô, and would often be the type of make call-out posts on Tumblr or even Twitter at one point. Most of the time, these call-outs were totally justified, but I felt as though sometimes he would start shit on purpose. I barely interacted with him, though, and we both just existed in the same discord server and on our blogs. 

One day, I was busy working and wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the discord chat. When I got back to my phone, though, I noticed I had a message from another person in the server. The message basically said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Jake said those things about you in the chat, just know that most of us don‚Äôt think that way about you‚Äù. Confused, I went into the chat and read over the messages, only to find that Jake and a few other people completely trashed me, my writing, and called me a transphobe (Context: i had attempted to write a story that had a trans male character in it, but I am not a trans man so apparently this was transphobic of me according to Jake). I was shocked and upset, and naturally I went to Jake about it and asked, ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs going on? Can we talk about what happened in the chat?‚Äù But he simply blocked me and never responded. He blocked me on tumblr as well, and I found out from someone else later that he wrote up a ‚Äòblocklist‚Äô, put me down on there for being a transphobe, and then posted it to his tumblr, although apparently he has since deleted it. This led to me receiving harassment, and people who followed my blog got harassed as well. It upset me a lot, I withdrew from the server and didn‚Äôt talk to my friends for a while. Jake eventually left the server (or he was banned, I‚Äôm actually not sure which), I got apologies from my friends, and after some time it seemed like everyone forgot about it.

 I moved on with my life after that, I never heard anything else from Jake until recently. He didn‚Äôt contact me, but I found out through some screenshots and other interactions on tumblr that my friends are still talking to him like nothing happened. I was very hurt to see this, and I confronted one of my friends about it but she was just like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs going through a rough time, I just wanted to be there for him‚Äù. While I knew that his mental health wasn‚Äôt the best, it was startling to me and upsetting that my friends would just take him back even after what he did to me. It should be noted that I never received any kind of apology from him, and to this day he still has me blocked, so it‚Äôs not like I can confront him directly about this. 

I really just need advice on what to do next. I get that my friends can talk to whoever they want, and that it‚Äôs not up to me who they choose to hang out with, but it just seems like everyone just wants to forget what he did, or what that did to me. Should I try and bring it up with my friends again? Or should I just ignore it and pretend like nothing happened?",02Dec2020,1

790,"  I am writing today to seek your help, thoughts and inputs regarding a situation in the family court in Virginia. It is related to judicial corruption, conflict of interest resulting in serious bias again me a protective mother in the family court.  In 2012, after a decade of physical, emotional and financial abuse I filed a dissolution of marriage action in order to protect myself and my 3 children who were also the victims of abuse by my ex-husband. I trusted and expected that I would be protected and treated fairly by the justice system that unfortunately was not and is not currently, the case. Unfortunately, far from the refuge and justice I had hoped for in the judicial system, since 2013 I find myself victimized by a judicial system that appears to only serve the interests of those with the financial means to defend themselves, as opposed to a forum for meting out justice and giving a voice to victims such as myself whose only desire was to put an end to an abusive marriage. For the last 7 years I have been dragged in and out of divorce court in VA, and even thrown in jail. It appears to be the desire of my former husband his attorneys and the judge to strip me of my parental rights and to have me incarcerated at any cost. Due to the constant pleadings filed with this court and seeing no justice from the court or any end in sight, I have spent tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees and deceitful monetary requests from my ex, the sum of which have essentially ruined my life and left me impoverished, indebted and utterly unable to mount a proper defense of myself and fight for my children who no longer want to live under his roof. Currently I have been ordered to pay approximately $20,000 towards former husband‚Äôs legal fees or risk being thrown in jail once again. In August 2019, I paid close to $17.000. In February 2020, I paid $20000 all on top of monthly child support I paid to a man, a Bowie State University administrator who makes 10 times my income, put himself on Food Stamp benefit at some point and was recently caught shoplifting at Costco etc. In addition, I feel the judge is overly biased towards me, displaying a lack of courtesy and disdain toward me only exacerbating my situation. There is evidence that the Judge has connections to my former husband‚Äôs attorneys and their firm. One of the

partners in the firm sits as an advisor on the Judge's personal foundation suggesting a clear violation of judicial ethics. It is also my opinion that the judge‚Äôs bias comes from the fact that I refused to pay an additional $50,000 to a lawyer who happens to be the judge‚Äôs mentor. In addition, there is an abundance of highly irregular, unethical and possibly illegal goings-on. For example, in 2019, I was informed that my former husband had been contributing money to a trust account that benefits the judge in this case. On one occasion I was warned by my former husband‚Äôs counsel not to enter the judge‚Äôs chambers because only attorneys were allowed inside, yet 5 minutes later I witnessed my former husband walk into the judge‚Äôs chambers suggesting an inappropriate interaction between the Judge and my former husband while I was not allowed to be present. I no longer have the resources or energy to fight my former spouse or the Judge in this case. I do not want to lose my children and believe that I have not only been fighting my ex-husband but also the Judge and ex-husband attorneys. At this point, I am out of breath and need your input and your suggestions.  At this point having the judge recused himself seems difficult because though I agreed with my attorney to withdraw, the judge refuse to sign the withdrawal order preventing me to take any needed action pro se including the recusal I have filed. I do have several documents to back up my allegations. I just need your input and thoughts as to what to do at this point. I fear for my life because the next time he throw me in jail, I might come out as Sandra Bland (dead) especially that he read all my complains in the recusal.",02Dec2020,1

Post-graduation I made do and was taking gigs (I work in the theater industry‚Ä¶. RIP me) getting ready to move out and then COVID hit. I know I have to leave, my friends are worried about me. I'm just so scared that I'm making the wrong choice and I don't know how to be rational about this. 

On one hand, I'm absolutely petrified of COVID; I‚Äôve barely left the house since March, and I haven‚Äôt hugged or touched anyone either. I'm also pretty financially able to move out-- I have more than a years worth of rent in my savings and a good credit score. 

On the other hand, I'm not going to be able to get a job in the city, and even if I did, I don't know if I'd be mentally able to go-- I mean it when I say I'm petrified of COVID. I'm scared moving out is a really bad financial move and too risky, and I'm making a big mistake.

797,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short, TLDR at the bottom.

Backstory: I have a friend, S, and we‚Äôve been friends for several years and we are really close. We have had our fair share of fights in the past and some of those were because of jealousy(this was when we were younger tho)

Now to the part where I need advice. A few months ago me and S were at a party and some guys were there. We just hung out and it was chill. The day after one of the guys from the party added my snap, but he also added S around the same time. Nothing weird, since no one of us knew him well. 

He and I start snapping and he calls me pretty and beautiful, and after a couple of weeks feel like there is some connection between us, and every time I see a snap from him I find myself smiling. 

Now at this point, S hadn‚Äôt even mentioned the guy, well call him E, since he added her weeks before. So since S is one of my best friends, naturally, I tell her about E and that he makes me happy. I also tell her I think he‚Äôs flirting with me since he calls me cute and pretty and yeah. She gets all exited, obviously. 

But after this, I notice she starts mentioning him ALL the time. Out of no where, she texts me saying things like ‚ÄúOmg E just sent a really funny selfie! Does he send you selfies as well?‚Äù And ‚ÄúYou said you are snapping with E huh? Well isn‚Äôt he funny? Look what he texted me last night!‚Äù And I feel like she‚Äôs trying to make me jealous or something, she keeps bragging about how he texts her, and how they send funny filters to each other and how they are so comfortable with each other, something she had NEVER mentioned before I told her I liked him.

Obviously, I don‚Äôt want to confront her since they could just be friends and I really don‚Äôt wanna be the jealous bitch. But to be honest, I am. It bothers me so much every time she even mentions his name. And sometimes she ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù sends him an ugly photo of me and is like ‚Äúhahahah omggg you looked so weird in that pic! Sorry I accidentally pressed send teehee‚Äù and stuff like that. 

Just a couple of minutes ago she sent me a meme in the chat that she had screenshot from Instagram, and well, surprise, at the top of the screenshot she had a notification from E snapping her. It might‚Äôve been a coincidence but then again, she never sends memes screenshot from Instagram out of the blue and I feel like she wanted me to see that he snapped her.

What should I do? Should I confront her? Or just realise that maybe E and S are the better match and drop him? Ugh I don‚Äôt know. Please just give some opinions or advice, maybe I‚Äôm overreacting idk.

I started a massive weight gain after my mother passed away and yet at that point, I really couldn't care. I told myself if I ate myself into a early grave, fine, that's what I want. I was depressed, grieving and eventually I got better but the damage was done. I went from 180 to 240 and oh, I wish that was the worst of it. For several years I balanced that weight and yet didn't bother to correct the damage, I struggled with anxiety, I never left my room, I struggled with this idea that I'd never hold down a job because  I felt so incapable of handling anything.

My friend, however, refused to let me give up and put me in a position to be offered an amazing job at a start up company.

Now that I have money, I've been bleeding out money to feed myself food that is absolutely the worse for me, IDC if I don't even like it, I'll buy it cause I think it'd make me happy but I'll only eat so much and let the rest of it go to waste. I'm horrified by my own actions and yet it feels like I'm outside of my own body, like I've lost all control on my own actions. I've went from 245-280 all in the matter of two years and I'm so disgusted with myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I joined a weight loss program, something that's suppose to hold me to the promise of eating better, drinking better, encourage exercising and just be in a group of other people who are trying to lose weight. They send out a scale and your suppose to stand on it every other day and it sends it to this couch who helps guide you. I started to do it, but then I stopped. I slipped back into buying food, and I know I was gaining weight and I felt so bad - like I let someone down and still continued.

805,"So recently moved into a new build, owned flats (condos).

After about a month I randomly received an aggressive unsigned letter in my mailbox from the owner beneath me who I‚Äôve never met, complaining about me walking in my flat. She obviously wrote the letter when she was angry, as she accused me of stomping ‚Äúday and night‚Äù, calling it ridiculous, unfair, and inconsiderate.

I‚Äôm asleep by 11 most nights and as I‚Äôm WFH and otherwise spend 95% of my time at my work chair, in bed, or on the sofa (not healthy I know... but COVID life). I don‚Äôt do home workouts, pace, wear shoes, etc. I‚Äôm not very big and listened to my footsteps after getting the letter - it‚Äôs not heavy, I‚Äôm literally just walking.

She also threatened to report me to our management company though passive aggressive said she didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äòget me in trouble‚Äô, obviously not understanding they only service the building as we‚Äôre all homeowners and that noise complaints are made to our council (city) so I‚Äôm already sussing out she‚Äôs not very mature or informed (plus after Googling, councils are repeatedly asking people not to complain about people walking in their flats/doing laundry/vacuuming during a pandemic when we‚Äôre all at home).

She had one fair point about playing music late one night, which I‚Äôm happy to apologise about and avoid in the future as I didn‚Äôt realise the sound carried.

I‚Äôm also willing to get bigger rugs, but they already cover about 60-70% of the area I can fit them in, it won‚Äôt make much difference. I suspect it‚Äôs down to shitty insulation, but I‚Äôm not willing to tiptoe in my own home, and I‚Äôd like to communicate that her in an amicable manner.

However, she won‚Äôt answer her door when I‚Äôve knocked to address the issue directly (as I feel like we should).

809,"My (17M) brother (21M) has been diagnosed with Schizophrenia for 4 years now, he refuses treatment, he thinks he's fine, and my parents are doing nothing in order to protect the order in house. 


He had only been hostile to my mother until this year, he used to choke her and try to kill her in the aftermath of an argument. 

He's been cussing at me, and my sister for some time now but it never did get physical, because the last time he touched me, I threatened to call the cops and he never laid a finger on me after that. So I think that he's self-conscious to some extent, and he doesn't cuss at us when someone else is near. 



Since last months, he's been standing in front of our rooms and he's been punching our doors, pouring adhesive onto my doorknob, I think he does that so I can't unlock the door or open it. That's not even the way how doors work. 


A few days ago, he hummed ""This kid's the Satan, no doubt. That's not even my real brother. I will kill him."" 

I didn't really take him seriously, because he threatened such things all the time, but never really acted on them. 


Today, when I woke up (at 8 PM) and went out of my room, he immediately went to the kitchen without turning on the lights, and when I got in the kitchen, he turned to me while I was turning on the light. I saw that he was pointing a knife at me, he came at me and I started running. When he tried to stab me, I yelled out for my mom and dad, and I held the knife with my hand. My

My mother just defends him, everything he did, he tried to choke her to death, I was the one who saved her on those occasions. This happened multiple times, he beat her up many times.

813,"Good evening everyone. I am being accused of cheating on a group assignment in my statistical analysis class. This class is entirely on zoom and this specific assignment was done in the breakout rooms with there being 4 members. The accusation is that I shared the assignment with another member of the group and they copied multiple sections of it. The evidence that the professor provided was that in my research hypothesis statement, the word ‚Äúrate‚Äù could have been mistaken with the word ‚Äúrole.‚Äù The other student put the word ‚Äúrole‚Äù instead of the word ‚Äúrate.‚Äù Another point was that I wrote one of the formulas slightly wrong (mixing up N and M) and the other student did the same thing. 

What actually happened 
Obviously having college kids perform group assignments on zoom is not going to work out. Me and one other member finished the assignment on our own because we decided as a group that the best way to do this assignment was that everyone complete it on their own and we would compare answers at the end. Time was going down and there was only about 10 minutes left in the class so I asked if everyone was finished. Only me and one member finished and the others either didn‚Äôt know how to do it and they would look it up after class (since the assignment was due a week later) or were not completely finished. We decided that I would read the answers I got and the other member who finished would deny or confirm these answers, as this was the only plausible move. As far as I can remember, (this assignment was done about a month before the accusations arose), the other member who finished confirmed most of the answers. I also made it clear that the other members should check my work and do it themselves because some may be incorrect (which they evidently were). It turns out that both me and the other kid got the same parts wrong, but he looked over it and corrected it while I did not. 

When I was reading the answers, I read every part, including the incorrect formulas and the incorrect ‚Äúnotes‚Äù to myself I made on the iPad. (The assignment was done in the application notability). It is evident that the other accused student did not do their own work and instead copied mine. But again, this was a group assignment. I will admit, the point the professor made about the word ‚Äúrate‚Äù being confused for ‚Äúrole‚Äù does look sort of suspicion (I guess) and I have no way of proving that this was done based on the other student‚Äôs mistake. What the professor said does make sense but at the same time, this was a group assignment done in a zoom conference.

Potential punishment 
So the professor is going to send me and the other student a form and we have to sign it, either confirming or denying the accusation. I fully plan on denying the allegations since they are not true. If I am found guilty, i will have to take an ethics seminar next semester and will have a note attached to, not on, my permanent transcript. Any other violations will be put on the transcript. 

It is also my understanding that the board that will review the case will probably be biased against the students but I have no way of proving that I did not send the document to the other student outside of the zoom meeting. I am obviously angered by this whole situation. Furthermore, I also disagree with the accusation of cheating in the first place. I brought this point up to the professor since we had to have a meeting with her and she directed me to a small link on the Canvas page titles FAQ where she basically made her own definition of what group work was. Three main point she is making is that we worked outside of the zoom session but I can personally not see how working together as a group on a GROUP assignment is considered cheating. 

Thank you for reading and thanks for any comments you have on this situation.",02Dec2020,1
814,"  
I'l try to be concise, because I tried writing about this a couple of times and each time it turned out too long. I can't really talk about it to anyone else. I am writing about this as if it's in the present- but currently it is confined to online issues due to pandemic. It applies to any times without restrictions on meetings, I just did not know how to formulate it without making it too complex.   


&amp;#x200B;

* Where is this taking place?

Meditation/Spiritual community my husband is involved in. 

* Who is involved in the issues?

1) My husband &amp; me (m 42, f 37), his friend from he community -M (m, 50s?)  
2) as above + the manager of the centre, R (m, 60), his partner A (f, 40s), and two other guys S &amp; J.   


* Relationship context:   
\-We are together since 2 years, married since one. We are great together, there is much love and care and trying to solve any issues as they arise as a team. He is exceptionally supportive of me, I try to be the same as much as I can,  and we both feel very lucky to have met each other. He is a very patient and kind person, which sometimes can lead to being a bit too diplomatic. On the other hand, I am quite direct, and I feel that I need to constrain myself a bit with some of the people described here.   
\- My husband knows the people in the centre since many more years.  

* The problem: 

There is awkwardness between myself and M, and as a result between my husband and myself about shared activities with M. We don't really know how to approach this and find our way around it? We don't disagree about the issue as such, but at the same time neither really knows how to solve it, so there is this lingering discomfort each time they do something together.  
My husband meets M quite frequently. They take part in an online meditation/ discussion group, that M facilitates, and that my husband steps in to run as well. M needs help with quite a few technical things, so he rings my husband about that as well. They also meet occasionally to hang out, with other people in the centre. The are in touch at least once a week, but more like 2-3 times a week, despite not really being close friends.  I think however that M thinks of my husband as his close friend. This is how he acts in my view. 

There are also some misunderstandings between my husband and the people he knows from the centre when it comes to single- sex gatherings. At least on one occasion my husband invited me along to a meeting that he thought was mixed, only to retract the invitation because it turned out it was a ""boys only"" meeting. Neither of us is socialised in a way to be familiar with the singe sex meeting principles, so neither of us knews really how to handle it.  


*  The story:    
My husband is active in a spiritual meditation community from a very long-standing tradition- I will not give more details of that for privacy reasons. When we starting being more serious with each other he also started inviting me to some of the social events in his community. The people I've met there were all very open and kind and exceptionally friendly towards me. He is well liked in there, and active in some organisational aspects. People were happy that he's found a partner.   
 I was always interested in meditation and after a while my husband asked me if I wanted to join him in the online meetings with M,  two other guys, and one woman. They read a theory book and mediate afterwards.  I thought I'd give it a go. It did not go that well.  
 I am from a social science background and have an inquisitive mind. That's my training and personality. I never felt like my mind  did not fit with other people in my husbands group or large community, but it certainly clashed with M., at least internally, and eventually something I said rubbed him the wrong way. His personally irritated me as well, but I never was anything but polite to him.   
  I really tried being polite and respectful, I tried to not do anything that would intrude on their space- because I was a new addition and it was my then partners group, but I just did not feel comfortable with Ms way of running the meetings.   
He is somehow domineering and self-centred, and lacks self-awareness and social sensitivity.   
A lot off the topics were about his own experience, but presented as if he were an authority, despite not being a qualified instructor or anything like that. People were often tired, but he'd drag out the meetings to just tell or more of his personal anecdotes, and he never really engaged people.   
 Despite the tradition being all about spiritual inquiry, he doesn't have much curiosity or openness.  He came across as being judgmental of those who do not know about his tradition or practice. To me embodied everything that the big teachers of the tradition discourage people to be, and was arrogant and judgmental, rather than compassionate. The meetings felt self-congratulatory to me.   
My husband has a different mind to me- he is more patient, and he enjoyed the meetings because of the people and the sense of community, and he welcomes any opportunity to be in touch with his  practice.  
 He also knows what he thinks of things and does not need to talk about them with others.  It was quite different for me, because I was still working out my views and understanding.  I 've left after a while, saying that I can't commit to weekly meetings and that I prefer to just meditate for a while, before going into theory.  
But the thing that rubbed M the wrong way, and after which he became kind of passively hostile to me (very awkward around me, being negative after he found out my husband and I married, never asking my husband how I was doing, despite others doing this) was a question I 've asked in the last call. I asked how he- and the group related  and processed the recent events in their community.   
There were some serious allegations about the founding teacher of their community a few years ago. He passed away, and the issue has been since investigated and the organisation has been  putting in a lot of effort to reform and to prevent a similar issue occurring again. This, of course was concerning  to me when I first started getting involved with my husband.  I felt that if I am serious about my husband I would need to be fully accepting of his practice as well. I could not be with someone I've felt was into something dodgy. 

  
I needed to investigate where he  and his friends stood on all this. I tentatively asked others in the group the same question in social meetings and they were always very open about how they have processed it and what they thought. I have also attended a meditation class run at the centre and they were also open about the issues they were facing and the safeguards they put in place. I was not thrilled by this, but at the same time I felt they are all decent people who are trying to do the best of a bad situation. The larger tradition itself is great and interesting.   
But M did not have the same openness as everyone else, and is somehow rigid in his devotional relationship to the teacher- he views him as his guru, I think, and hence he thought my question was exceptionally rude and inappropriate and he felt offended. My husband spoke to him afterwards, and that's what I've gathered from what he told me. I did not speak to him about it directly, because I did not want to make the situation further awkward, and I've felt that there just isn't any possibility for direct and open communication with M, that by merely being the way I am I will manage to offend him somehow.   


So here we are now. My husband considered dropping out of the online meetings, but eventually he did not, because we both felt his relation to the group is separate from mine.   


The awkwardness is further compounded by the fact that my husband is also friends with many other people in the community, and around 2-3 of them are frequently in the centre at the same time, including M. He also treats my husband as his good  friend - he calls him up for support about computer issues (he doesn't use them much so frequently has problems with things such as backing up information, or booking flights etc.), and later reciprocates by inviting my husband for take way meals.   


My husband frequently invites me to come with him, but I feel that a lot of the dynamic in their little group is kind of guy-only, so I very rarely take him up on the offer, and it creates a bit of an uncomfortable mood. He'd like me to be with him doing something he likes, and generally we attend social occasions together, but at the same time I don't feel I'd be welcome there really.   
M is certainly exceptinoally  awkward around me not only because of the issue, but it is also my impression that he does not really know how to talk to women. Two of the other guys - S &amp; J are much more friendly towards me, but I nevertheless don't take up my husband's invitations almost at all, because I feel they are still awkward with a women in their group. My husband recognises this, but does not really know how to approach it. I don't know either.   


  
TBH I think that my husbands practice of wanting to include me in into everything is a bit forced, but at the same time there should not be hostility between partners and friends.   


  
 I think that we each should have our separate group of friends, but also be comfortable enough to do occasionally stuff together, and there should not be hostility between friends and partners. My husband is actually more of the opinion of doing more things together with friends and partners, rather than meeting friends alone, and most of the times I take him to meet my friends.   


Recently I've requested to sometimes meet my friends alone, because I feel that they might  want to just hang out with me once in a while to maybe talk more about their personal life. He agreed with me, but at the same time I feel it is very ironic that it is him who has a friend that is not really compatible with doing shared stuff together.   


  
I strongly perceive that M does not want me around when he is with my husband or with the other guys.   
He acts like a guy who really needs a close male buddy, and that he'd like my husband to be this person, and that he is hostile to the idea that he has a wife.   
My husband is saddened when I say this, and even asked me if I wanted him to stop meeting with this guy. I feel it would be a really awful thing to do to a partner, and I want him to have his own friends and relationships. I just wish those friends were also people I could also occasionally communicate with without such issues, and that there wouldn't be this dislike.   


A separate, but related issue to this is the ""boys only"" story, that I've mentioned at the start.   


Basically a while ago, before things with M became obviously strained, my husband said that ""R (the manager of the centre), wants us all to meet for a meal with M"".   


He interpreted it as R coming with his partner, A, and us being invited together.    


It turned out it was a ""boys night only"" for them, which my husband was surprised by, because it is  not something he knows (we both grew up in a culture where coed meetings are most common). It is was also not done within the culture of the centre, or at least he was not aware of it. - they usually meet for birthdays, or just to hang out, but in his experience those meetings were never explicitly single-sex.   


  
At the beginning of us being together the events that presented themselves were also ones such as birthdays, so it was normal for me to attend - because others came with their partners as well. Shortly afterwards I 've received a message from the managers partner - A, asking if I ever wanted to meet up for a chat ""without the boys"", I should hit her up.  


  
 I think we were both a bit freaked out with my husband about this... I think it would have been less uncomfortable if it was just a striking up of a conversation, seeing  if we could become friends, but the phrasing of excluding my husband from the start (a person she knew better than me), was just so odd to both of us. We never really figured out what it was about.   


  
The last thing that I wanted to mention, was the fact that before the lockdown started again here, M invited my husband to go to a trip to the woods to meditate. This is something he does quite frequently, but my husband never managed to join. My husband said that I am invited to come along. It was never clear where the invitation came from - if it was my husbands idea, or if M genuinely also invited me along to be polite to my husband.  The time-frame was so short, that I decided against it, despite really wanting to do this, M or not. I think we could have all just done our own thing, walk or meditate without talking,  with the benefit of safer travel and company.   


&amp;#x200B;

But, again I've felt like I would be intruding, or something about this felt uncomfortable. I love going to the woods, I don't feel comfortable doing it alone as a woman, and the lockdown reduced my ability to see nature, and we were facing the prospect of being shut down for another longer period of time, and yet I was left at home, and my husband went alone, because we could not navigate the situation better. I was sad that I could not go.  He was sad that I could not come.   


  
Today my husband had an online meeting with M - and he asked me if I minded if he did that. And I've felt it was wrong for him to feel he has to ask that- but at the same time I've also made a joke about how he was meeting with his lover.  And I know it made him uncomfortable that I said that. And I felt embarrassed that I've said that.  


&amp;#x200B;

How do I deal with this? And how do we as a couple navigate this? I feel that this guy is bad company for my husband, I don't like him, but at the same time I feel his relationships are his own, it's not my place to try to change that. Is it on me to get over it?

  


TL:DR my husband frequently meets a guy from his meditation/ spiritual group for practice reasons and to support him. The guy treats him as a friend. There is considerable awkwardness and hostility between us and it creates awkward situations for my husband and I, we don't know how to navigate this.",02Dec2020,1

I've been living with the same two people for 3 years and lately it seems like they don't have any interest in hanging out with me anymore. I wanna say about a month ago I started going to the gym and refining my study habits because you know, self improvement and stuff. So it seems like I'm always in my room or at the gym and in order to not lose my friends I'd constantly invite them to come with the gym with me or come study with me in the floor lounge but they always turn me down. Also it looks like a friend of theirs is starting to replace my spot in the trio. The friend basically comes over every day. Before, they'd ask me if I'm okay with her coming over and spending the night and I'd say yes, but now they stopped asking me if I'm okay with her coming over. One morning after the friend had spent the night I guess they had decided to get some food and so I was was talking to one of my roommates before they left and she was like ""we're going out to get food"" and then my two roommates and their friend left me in the apartment while they went to get food, I wasn't studying and so I was 100% confused as to why they didn't invite me. Another night I had been studying pretty intensely and after I was done I went out to kitchen to reheat some food and I see that they had taken some shots without me and the friend was sleeping in the living room. Honestly I felt pretty left out. Even today I heard them rummaging in their rooms and turns out they went to get food without me. Their excuse was ""it was an impulse decision"". But I still feel like they could've texted me to see if I wanted anything when they got there. It feels like the only hanging out we do is if I happen to be in the living room thr same time as them or if they need a ride to/from work. They only outing they agreed to come to is my birthday dinner happening late December and I have a feeling they only agreed to it because I told them they don't have to pay.

However, I don't know if I want to keep my roommates as friends. Like I mentioned before, I started going to the gym and studying more. All three of us complain of being fat and having crappy GPAs, but I'm the only one that's doing anything about it. All they do is smoke weed, watch TV, and drink. All I can think about is the ""you're the average of your five closest friends"" saying and so I don't know if I should just be friendly with them until the lease is up or be more assertive when it comes to inviting them places and maintain the friendship.

Have I simply outgrown my friends/roommates?

Roommates/Friends of three years stopped hanging out with me and I believe they found a replacement for me. Don't know if I should let it go or if I should try to keep the friendship.",02Dec2020,1
816,"I didn‚Äôt follow a typical life path. I moved out at a young age and had some help from my parents but not a lot. I was very broke for a long time. Then I made a little amount of money. Not a lot, but I was finally comfortable. This was the only year I was really able to buy presents.

But now I‚Äôm very aware that I‚Äôm apparently supposed to be getting presents by now, and I‚Äôm clearly failing at that. 

I guess this is what I get for not doing college at the right age and having a child young and staying home. 

All of my family members that are my age and younger are really successful and now I‚Äôm embarrassed for not being successful, and worried about my decision to prioritize other things over my career. 

Oh and on top of that I‚Äôm venting to the internet because I lose track of friendships all the time and have no one that I talk to.",02Dec2020,1
817,"Just a quick one to get an outside perspective, as emotions are running high here lol. My older sister (21) who is at uni in Aberdeen (3 hours away if you‚Äôre curious) recently came out as bisexual to my VERY religious and traditional parents. My mother was instantly upset and made that clear, while my father shares her concerns but is a bit more reasonable about it.

My mother compared being expected to accept my sister, to being handed a knife and being told to kill our neighbours... I don‚Äôt really get that but alright. It‚Äôs a very uncomfortable situation for everyone, and I just wondered if anyone had some wisdom to share.

Questions are appreciated of course.",02Dec2020,1
818,"I was excited about I looked without makeup. My skin got really clear and glowy so I thought I looked beautiful. So I sent him a pic of me without makeup proudly. And I all he text back was ""you look a little older"". I got hurt and asked him how old I look and he said ""40 something"". I got really angry and then he said maybe its just my eyes because he said they look heavy and then he said maybe its the lighting of pic. And then he finally said ""you look nice"". I was like why couldn't he say that in the first place??

The next day he wanted to hangout but I was still mad at him so I wasnt sure if I wanted to. Then he on the phone he said he didn't mean what he said that he was just testing my self esteem. He said its gonna benefit me.

820,"Long read, sorry. In High School I was on my way to run at D1 universities but my parents wouldn‚Äôt tell me about the offers I‚Äôve received in the mail and would throw them out.

I currently commute to a local university about 20 minutes from me. Originally, I was at a different school for my Freshman and Sophomore years, but after my parents threatened to take me back home if I was competing at a collegiate level of track and field. (they did not want me to do sports ‚Äì more so of a religious reason). I continued to run behind their back and look where we are now. I‚Äôm back home and miserable. I was doing so much better at my other university; doing a major I enjoy too. Straight A‚Äôs and everything.

I‚Äôve lost all motivation to do any school work since being home. At first I thought it was the new school I was at, or maybe it was because I‚Äôm living at home. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of COVID, etc. The school I‚Äôm at right does not offer my desired major. My parents are willing to pay for all of my education too, even grad school. But I don‚Äôt think I can toughen out 7-8 more years at the expense of my happiness. There is too much mental strain and I can‚Äôt concentrate.

I‚Äôve never worked a job before. My parents don‚Äôt want me to so I can focus on my studies; and they say it doesn‚Äôt make any sense since me working won‚Äôt benefit anyone. (relatively high income family). It‚Äôs not like I want to drop out of college forever or drop out to smoke weed, drink, party, and play video games. I want to work, and go back to college on my own terms when I‚Äôm in the right headspace for it. I originally wanted to go into PT school, but I don‚Äôt think I can do it if they want me to stay local for that also.

**If I were to take a break, I‚Äôd most likely get a job as an EMS / EMT, PT Tech, Nurse Tech - or something medical related. Given that I take a break for 2-3 years that should bring me to about $60-70k. I‚Äôd full on put that into savings and go back to a cheap community college when I‚Äôm ready to get better grades on my pre-requisites, or even get into a nursing program. - but right now, I have no idea what I want to do.**

They own everything I have, I‚Äôm tied to their bank account, I‚Äôm on their phone plan. They bought the my car, so they can take it away whenever they want to. They don‚Äôt want me to branch out. I know, I should be grateful. They do way too much for me, but sometimes their love feels like shackles; and I can‚Äôt grow as an individual. I have been having these thoughts since Feb of this year.

I‚Äôve talked to them about it and they want me to finish up my degree. Taking a break to work makes no sense to them. *I don‚Äôt even know if it makes sense to me*. I‚Äôm already spending 5 years in undergrad because I transferred, and it might be even more if I fail the current classes I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm barely passing chemistry, biology, and calculus. Just mere points off from failing. After all, I am a first generation American, so there is a lot of pressure to finish up a degree. They say I won‚Äôt be successful without it. But as I stated earlier, I do have plans of going back to school after my mind is figured out.

For more context to understanding my parents, some years ago, my sister was not allowed to live in the house if she wasn‚Äôt going to church with our family. She had work on the same day, and that caused a lot of conflict between them. She ended up moving out to a different state and is doing well on her own.I‚Äôve only been getting by, by being obedient. I swear I‚Äôm not rebellious; unless you consider hanging out with a friend to watch a movie rebellious.

Anyways, sorry about that. I came here looking for different view points. I know not everyone‚Äôs response will be the same, but I need other people to talk to other than my parents about this right now. Thank you.",02Dec2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

I just got a new android phone and am in the process of converting everything over. I am able to set custom ringtones and notifications for each contact in addition to the general ringtone/notification sound for the phone. For the last three-ish years my ringtone has been ""Crossing Field"" by LiSA (the first opening from Sword Art Online) and my notification sound as been the phrase ""I'm Old Gregg"" from the youtube video. Over time the audio file for Old Gregg has gotten wonky and now sound very much like my phone is saying ""I'm on crack,"" which has gotten some looks at work and around family. I've decided I need to change the sound now while I'm setting up this new phone or I will get lazy and leave it as Old Gregg for another three years. Any suggestions for what I could use as a notification sound would be great--I'm pretty open to different ideas (anime/memes/videogame soundbites/movie soundbites/etc). Only real requirement is it needs to be SFW and not crazy long.

Some existing notification sounds I have include:

* ""Life, uh, finds a way."" from Jurassic Park
* ""I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!"" from Rick and Morty
* ""Yay. Exciting news."" from Potter Puppet Pals
* ""Pikachu!"" from Pokemon

honestly i dont know which of my memories are made up to replace the bad ones or which ones actually happened. also i ALWAYS daydream like its something i would do for hours a day. sometimes i would daydream about anime or some shit but there are times where i would make up scenarios about real people i know. and its gotten to a point where ive done it too much that im confusing my made up memories with my real ones.

828,"Hi guys. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm sick of me.

If you look on my profile you‚Äôll see that i posted something a while ago about me and my ex. To make it easier, i had a boyfriend for over 4 years, but at the beginning of the quarantine we broke up because it wasn‚Äôt working anymore. We both wanted and needed that time apart from each other. Fast forward to july, I met a guy online whom i started seeing, but i made it clear that i was NOT looking for a relationship. We ended up having sex on multiple ocasions and i was really happy with where i was in life. I thought i felt at peace, but i was trying so hard to act like i was living my best life. I believe i was still in the post break up denial phase..the person i tried being at the time was not me, i was actually struggling really hard to get over the break-up.

August comes and my ex boyfriend wants to meet and talk for a little. From that moment on, NOTHING i believed i felt for the other guy, or just in general about my life, felt the same. To make things short, we end up together again and I break things off with the other guy right away. It was nothing serious, nothing exclusive between the two of us so please don‚Äôt judge me.

I feel happy with my boyfriend and grateful that we are back in eachother‚Äôs life. I needed the time away from him so that i could realise that in fact, I want no one else but him. The time apart has tought me how to appreciate him more and more everyday and i love him with all my heart.

The thing is that he doesn‚Äôt know about me having sex with the other guy while we weren‚Äôt together..he asked me about it and i Lied, because i knew that he wouldn‚Äôt like that thought. He told me that he met with several girls during that time, did some stuff, but no sex. I feel guilty everyday about lying to him, i am ashamed of myself, i am angry at me and i don‚Äôt know how to cope with this guilt i feel inside of me. This has gotten to the point that i can‚Äôt fall asleep at night. The happier i feel being with him, the more guilty i get on the inside..

I need help on how to learn to forgive me for having sex with the other guy and lying to my boyfriend. I can‚Äôt tell him that i lied to him because it will ruin our relationship. I know that coming clean to him would be the best thing to do, but please understand that if i am doing this everything will fall apart. I need advice on how to cope with the things i did while we weren‚Äôt together. I need to forgive myself.

Please feel free to share your experiences, your thoughts, anything. If not, i just needed to get this thing off my chest. Thank you.",02Dec2020,1

I'm sick of everyone telling me I need to respect her when she gives no respect to me. Then she always throws the ""There are kids who have it way worse than you.""

838,"tl;dr mom dead, dad moving on, brothers moved out in a matter of 5 months and im stuck here due to covid.

OOooook. mom passed away 5 months ago on the upcoming 10th... she had been an alcoholic for the past ten years, she didn't physically hurt us but emotionally she could be a b&amp;*ch. when she'd be sober she would realize this, feel like shit, drink to forget... the loop. kept going to to rehab, she had all these pills. when she would come home from rehab sometimes would just stay in her room all day and mix pills with alcohol...
i'd always check up on her, because we've almost lost her before, i'd always check her breathing. i was visiting my bf at the time and nobody checked up on her through out the day until dinner time, she was a vegetable already...

fast forward two months ago... my brothers are moving out, as was planned before she passed.... older brother moving out with gf and younger brother moving for his job. so i'm here with my dad because i don't have a job due to covid.
he joins this dating site and at first PUTS THE DECISION ON ME whether or not it's ok if he dates or not! as i had told him before, i was ok with him divorcing my other considering he was sick of her alcoholic bullshit but felt too guilty to leave her (even though imo i think it would've been a kick in the ass for her to change, but we never know for sure) i told him it wasn't up to me, to follow wherever his gut took him too.

at first there was this one chick, but that didn't last long. only conversing on the phone and online, but idk what happened.
he's talking to me about this chick, i think it's the same one, but no all of a sudden it's this different chick. he's on the phone with her for 3 to 4 hours evert single night... still now. talks to me about her, i'm ok with that, i feel a little guilty for my mom because before 10 years ago i saw them madly in love. they were together for 40 years, so yah i guess just habit of seeing him with her.

fast forward to a week a day ago ? about idk whatever
he tells me that this friday she's coming over to drink coffee in the morning, is stressing about meeting the family, blah blahblah.
she gets here, i politely introduce myself, go back to my room downstairs. my father than asks me to come upstairs to talk to her, that my grandma (of 90 who lives with us) is talking to her, he'd appreciate it. i tell him i need baby steps between her and i, he insists, i give in...
i talk to her for 45 minutes, mostly about my mother, she's lovely. during our conversation, my dad starts holding her hand.... after slowly starts scooting his chair closer and closer to hers. finally his chair is stuck to hers and he kisses in front of me. i notice she's as shocked and uncomfortable as i am, not moving a fucking muscle. anyways, i wait 3 minutes as to not makes things awkward, finally excuse myself.
i tell my dad later that i felt he disrespected me doing that, he would have never done that in front of my brothers. just because i am not as sensitive as them does not mean i am psychologically ready to see that. he gets at me.
he finally says he sorry once she confronted him about the kiss and told him how it was inappropriate.

than we're in the middle of the week, my dad asks if my cousin can take my gma in for a weekend in decemeber (this is while my bf is visiting) and that he'd get a hotel for my bf and i so they can spend a week end together at the house... i say yes, why not... free hotel and room service can romantic for bf and i, and i wont be thinking of my dad while i'm in a safe zone with my bf.

once i say yes TO THAT, he asks, ""well actually girls, you think this weekend yall can too?"" (mind you my cousin lives on my gma's property, gma lives with us rn because they're redoing HER house but my cousin's house is good. it's located right behind the wall in back yard) at first i say no thanks because it's too soon for me and if he's going to be doing that shit i want to be with my close friend, who isn't in town right now, she's coming back this weekend.... or my bf. he keeps insisting. i ask him to wait 7 days for my friend to get back, that i wouldn't care leaving... he calls my older brother to take me in. my bf tells me i just shouldn't have gone ,stayed in my safe space. forced my dad to get a hotel (when i suggested that, he looked at my like i insulted him)
and they could have gone to her place but she has kids my age, the younger daughter is out of the house but the son is stil there and she enough respect for him to not ask him to leave.... i got that from my dad responding ""well we'll go to her house once her son moves out in december"".......
Kthnx for me.

anyways, i called him a dick for not thinking about my feelings, i'm still crying every morning over my mothers death (didn't tell him that bc it doesn't change anything anyways) and that he was an dick for not being patient for not waiting until this friday for my friend to come... that i was leaving for the weekend either way so what's a week when at first it was supposed to be in decemeber??!

my gma called me selfish and use-tobe/kinda still is junkie uncle called me a b!!$%$ and that i was trying to ruin my dad's realtionship. my cousin, who is a huge hypocrite bc she went through the same crap and got pissed when her dad got with another woman 10 YEARS AFTER HER'S MOTHERS DEATH.
I KEPT REPEATING I WANTED MY DAD TO BE HAPPY, TO REDO HIS LIFE, JUST NO IN FRONT OF ME OR NOT BY KICKING ME OUT OF THE HOUSE! and they just kept repeating ""your dad suffered enough for the past 10 years""

840,"&gt;I guess everything started when I got the odea to get in a good school and actually focus on school last year. I do sport, so that was effected a lot that year, mostly that I skipped competitions and some training sessions. Also I had a problem with my knees which also effected my training very much. All of my friends that I could talk to and hang out were in my sporting group. I was very close with another person in this group like really close he was the only real best friend I ever had. The problem is that after focusing on my studies, I felt a bit out of touch but I still kept my priorities on getting into that school. I wrote the big exam, then caught up with my friends and hanged out a bit.

&gt;Then I got in. I was shocked at first, I couldn't believe it. Anyway, I spent the summer playing video games with my old classmates and hanging out with my sport friends which was pretty awesome one of the best summers I had in a while. Then came september, when I realized things were about to change. I hanged out with my friends for a month still pretty regularly then we grew apart. Then I made friends with some people in another school, with whom I played mainly video games with. Then I realised it was effecting my grades then I stopped playing with them. Also forgot to mention since school started I only went to sessions once a week or once every to weeks.

&gt;This is where start feeling kind of depressed. I feel like I have lost my old friends because we don't hang out anymore because I wanted to focus on school, but the thing is that I don't do anything at home, I just play video games aline or watch TV shows. My class is cool, but there is no such person I can call a real friend. I feel kind of overwhelmed I feel stressed because everyone is doing well and I feel lost, in my last school I was the smary kid, but now I am just below average, I want to be smarter but there is no motivation for me.

&gt;Online school didn't help in this matter, when I am at home I feel even more depressed, I have no one to talk to. I tried joining stuff like engineering extra lessons or debate club which I fellt would help me, it didn't really do anything it may have even made it worse, I was invited to a friends party which may have revived my chances for a stronger friendship, but it was on the same date as the competition I was preparing for with my team for two weeks. I picked the competition and I kind of regret it, to be honest I think I regret leaving my simple school, to this hard school, which didn't make me want to learn, made me any friends, it only made things worse.

&gt;I also am this funny guy that likes to make jokes, which I think helps me hide the depression that keeps getting closer to the surface. If anyone could help me where to start my journey of redemption cause, I really feel lost. I want to make changes but don't know where to start.

The driver‚Äôs assistant calls to let her know they will be arriving to deliver soon. On the day it was to be delivered it was severely down pouring. With all the rain and the barking dogs, they accidentally delivered someone else‚Äôs TV. A much more expensive, 75-inch TV. They pushed it right inside the front door. Nobody was ever asked to sign for anything. The delivery men attempted to take a picture or scan something on their phone, but they were never able to get their wet screens to work so they just left. Then, they called my house a few hours later, to deliver a TV (the one I actually ordered.) Confused, my mother explained to them that the TV was already delivered. She described the TV to the drivers and even texted the drivers a picture of the box in our home, and a close-up of the label. The TV we ordered was never delivered, and we were told to call customer service. As you can imagine, that was a nightmare and we were kept on hold for over and hour and a half before finally hanging up. An email was also sent to the customer service department to tell them a mistake has been made. We left our phone number to be contacted. It has been 4 days and we have not heard from anyone, and this massive TV is just sitting in our entrance way all boxed up. 

Anyway, I guess the advice I am seeking is, how much more should I be doing to correct someone elses mistake? And, at what point do I just chalk this TV up as an early Christmas gift? And advice or similar stories would be appreciated.

847,"I‚Äôm a first year college student and a first year American, and it‚Äôs hard for me to figure things out. I hope to get some advice.

I have student loans. It‚Äôs been hard and scary, but I am very happy I got excellent education. I got a letter last week saying that I qualify for a student loan consolidation and payment reduction program. (I work and teach at a public university.) I called the number provided and filled out all the forms. Because of covid, the interest rates have been frozen on all my loans, and I‚Äôm not sure what will happen in January with covid and with Biden‚Äôs administration. Once approved for the program, I would need to make regular payments. About half of that payment would be for program maintenance; the other half goes towards paying off the loans. After 10 years of regular payments while have a job in public service, the loans would be forgiven including all interest that has accumulated. I‚Äôve been trying to understand what may happen in the next months with Biden in the office. It‚Äôs not clear to me how any loan forgiveness regulations that the Democrats are fighting for would affect me, and how it would vary depending on whether or not I am in this kind of repayment program.

The other thing is that I have to pay a large fee just to apply for the program. It‚Äôs a bit worrisome that I would have to do that. They are asking me to pay half of it now, and the second half in January.

849,"I‚Äôm 20 and am 1 class away from graduating and getting my college degree, which means it‚Äôs time to get serious about the job stuff. I‚Äôm going into law enforcement and currently, I have only 1 reference on my resume (which is empty other than being a broke college student who lives with his parents lol), and it is the dean of the major‚Äôs department (as he knows me really well after I took several classes with him). 

In an effort to beef up my resume, I have been thinking about a 100% online job that I got when I was a teenager (16) a few years ago. The only problem about that was that I used a fake name (the Netherlands based company didn‚Äôt do ID checks), and I was being stupid (also partially because I was scared to use my real name in fear of creeps out there). 

The CEO at the time (before there was a hostile takeover by a much larger company) really liked me, so did her 2 assistants and the team she originally hired. I learned a lot from her and working with her team, and they were very impressed with what I could do. She said that her 2 assistants said that I put in the work of 5 guys lol. 

After the hostile takeover, she (along with the 2 founders) were axed from the company and there was a new team in place (I was kept along with 2 other employees from her team), and that‚Äôs when shit started. I was not being paid, they were promoting everyone else (except me), and they generally didn‚Äôt give me all the tools I needed to finish projects. To make a long story short, the new team and I didn‚Äôt get along and me being young (not an excuse), I published their emails and work phones in a mass email to all their clients as a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù before leaving the company. Then, me and a friend changed their Twitter password and change it all to black screens and left the account alone. I regret doing this, as I think about it now. They didn‚Äôt seem to care about it though and we moved on. 

I would love to use the old CEO (she‚Äôs CEO at another fairly large company in the Netherlands now) as a reference, but that stupid fake name stops me... and I‚Äôm afraid to reach out to her. I‚Äôm worried it might bite me in the ass to reach out and spark old flames. 

Should I email her, coming clean about my name and what I‚Äôve been up to (we haven‚Äôt spoken since she was fired by the merging company) and ask if I could use her as a reference?

Which is nice. But I didn't want to be a possible booty call. I thought neutral ground would be nice. I suggested him after the first date to find a loophole and said ""let's go out"". He was ""since last weekend everything was closed"" and the topic died for now. After calling many many places I found 2 - one being a pizza place (more student-like) and the other - posh, a bit too posh for my liking but not OTT. I'm not going to eat or be expensive. Here's the thing though. Should I kind of force him and change him to the degree he doesn't like and take him to place he doesn't like and insist on being wined and dined in a restaurant and then call it a night and leave him wanting more. Restaurant means no sex, apartment is more tricky. One friend said: ""let him show what he can do for you in his apartment, don't force too many things on a second date"", the other was more like ""say next time you'd gladly try vegetarian food in his place but this time we're going out"". Neutral ground. I already showed him I'm interested. I don't want to be too princessy and restaurant is more boring option and apartment is homey but coming to his place for the second time I'm afraid can send a wrong message.

Right now I have one  and a half year left in high school. I have finished around 1/3 of the courses and I got A(highest grade you can have in my country) in all of them. So I am indeed a good student, probably top three in my age group. Outside of school I have two business, one with a Friend and one alone. Both of them are in the early stages and I am probably not going to earn a lot of money from them right now but I dont reallt care because I do it for fun. Then I also play icehockey, I have been one of the better in my region and played in a team which came third in the national championship. So I am pretty well trained too.

I am telling you this so you have some background information about my choices.

‚Ä¢The first alternative is to apply and try to get in to a good university abroad

‚Ä¢Do military service one year and then decide.

‚Ä¢ go to a top university in my country. 

‚Ä¢ take a year of and work &amp; focus on entrepreneurship and then decide.


That is like the main alternatives but if anyone have a good idea I really would be happy to hear it. 

I feel like to go to university is a good thing to do but it comes with a huge loan that i probably going to pay of for a long time.
Millitary service would be fun but then I feel like I want to go all in and do it for a longer time and get a good position. 
To take a year of and focus on entrepreneurship is what I feel the most risky thing, but then I am not going to need any loan.

It's led me to bad events where the person I was clinging to emotionally previously had been super toxic, and well, that led to me being hurt.

I'm recognizing that I'm doing it again and I want to stop. It's not fair to my friends who I'm putting this burden on. It's not fair to me because I can't be emotionally independent. The feelings I get when I don't get attention make me feel ugly inside and they had been going away for a while, but then they resurged when I re-joined the website where I made the toxic friend (I was toxic too, I'll admit...) and I reconnected with some old friends.

I am so lazy. I haven't been able to take care of myself. My hygiene is less than optimal, but better than most people I know. I sometimes live in my own filth.

862,"So, it's going to be a long one.
I recently moved from South Africa to the UK, and had a planned the move for a year. I would be riding racehorses for a good wage and given accommodation for just the cost of utilities. 
Problems started when I spent my 14 day quarantine with my bf in London, I was always adamantly a country girl who saw I would never live in the city. I then spent a week with my cousin in Southhampton, literally a 1min walk to the shop. I fell in love with the convenience and the feeling of never being alone in the city. 
I don't have a car or a driver's license so when I ended up in the sticks for this job (I hadn't realized how rural it is) I had a sudden change of heart.

My first two work days have been miserable, riding and working with the horses hasn't made me as happy as I thought it would, I've realized after one to scary instances back home in SA I have lost my never to ride confidently. I feel isolated and out of place in a new country.

I can either carry on the job while wasting my time and the employers, but earn decent money, save well and have cheap accommodation being scared out my bracket every work day. With minimal time off to see family, friends and boyfriend in other towns, depressing me further. Stuck without a car for a while. Or move back to Southhampton with the little money I have left and look for something closer, more accessible with my previous veterinary experience to try pursue my studies. With the current economy I worry about the availability of jobs to me. I also can't be bunking with my cousin for an extended period of time as his gf and himself have been struggling recently.

Reddit what do I do? I know it's a mindset change but I'm scared of reliving a life I lived back in SA. Alienating myself from the people I care about and faraway from the ones I love.

I am not sure how to tell her I sometimes do not want to hang out every night after work. Sometimes it is nice just to go home after work ( where I spend time with her for 8 hours) and play a video game and be alone.

For example just now she asked if I wanted to have a drink by the fire here at the office after work. I do not want to. I am hungry, tired, and want to go home to my room. When I said I wasn't up to it, she looked hurt.

872,"Ever since my acne cleared up and getting into social media, my confidence has been over the roof. There are multiple occasions in which I have been approached in public where people would ask for my age, that I'm very pretty, compliments from random workers at the mall, compliments from the few friends I do have from school about my looks, etc. These encounters have inflated my ego through the roof and I never want these encounters to stop. There has not been one occasion in which I have gone to a busy public place such as the mall in which I have not been approached by a stranger about my appearance or them wanting to get to know me (though for some reason I am yet to be catcalled, I suppose its because I look my age and am quite young, and I live in a pretty nice and safe area aswell).

I've been having a lot of trouble making friends at school though, I only have two friends that I can trust and have normal conversations with but all of my closest friends are on the internet, our friendships lasting years and rarely having fights (when we do, we always apologize and rekindle the friendship without it becoming toxic). I think the reason why I have a hard time making friends at school is because all the men are terrible, misogynistic, racists, and all the girls are jealous of me or are intimidated. The ""popular"" girls who I consider to be just as good looking as me just want to start fights, and the girls who are less attractive than me are always bringing themselves down to compliment me, or are always passive-aggressive towards me and nobody else. To be honest, this jealousy/aggression I receive from many of the girls at my school only boosts my ego further because in my mind, I think ""Who wouldn't be jealous of me? I'm very smart, pretty, talented, and funny"" since I take all Pre-AP/APs and I'm part of my high school's GT program.

Is my ego too inflated? Or am I just confident? How do I bring my ego down, if it is too inflated? I've asked people to humble me in the past but they've failed to properly humble me so it just boosted my ego even further because I'm too ""great"" to be insulted/brought down.

we used to sit together ,i used to like her so much,we were best buddies i never had any friend in life so i fell for her ,i think she was also into me

This may sound strange but what are some ways I can be a good girlfriend? 

TL;DR: I (23f) have never really been in a serious relationship. I don‚Äôt have a problem getting dates, but I don‚Äôt really know what a normal, healthy serious relationship looks like exactly so I just avoid them. I want to try now. Any advice? I feel like an alien. 

I am a 23 year old girl. I‚Äôm not dating anyone right now but I would like to in the future. However, I lack experience. Not necessarily sexual experience but actual relationship experience. I worry that I‚Äôm too mentally fucked up, or self absorbed or something, for a long term relationship. But I have a lot of love to give and I want to try. I am not mean or angry but I can find it hard to open up to people, or trust them. I have ADHD and anxiety and bouts of depression. I love being alone and am passionate about my own interests, hobbies and career goals but I unfulfilled romantically and sexually. I worry it is unkind of me to pursue a relationship when I have so many unresolved issues, but part of me feels like I have been working on myself already for years, and worries that I will never be healthy or ready. 

Any advice ? 

Thank you",02Dec2020,1
878," Hello, thank you for taking the time to read this. It's a difficult subject, but I'm tired of holding all this hurt in. When I was 16, I was groomed and sexually abused by a man in his late 40s. At the time, I lived in Canada, where he still resides. Unfortunately nothing was technically illegal - 16 is of age and I never verbally told him to stop, even though he never got my consent for anything. He groomed me from the age of 15, physically imposed himself on me, and did all sorts of disgusting things to me. 

I live in Brazil now, and have lost touch with everyone in Canada, and I don't know anyone in his social circle. 8 years later and I'm still so messed up by everything he did to me. I have evidence in the form of chat logs. I want to circulate his picture around, his name, screenshots, everything. I need the world to know what he did to me. Where can I go to? Who will hear me? Any advice is appreciated

Thank you for you help",02Dec2020,1
880,"Pardon my formatting, I‚Äôm on mobile.

For context I‚Äôm 19 years old, financially independent for the most part and living with 3 roommates in student apartments. I say for the most part because I‚Äôm still on my mother‚Äôs medicaid insurance but I think I‚Äôm about to become ineligible for it. I don‚Äôt even know where to start to look for my own health insurance. I work full time hours at target but I‚Äôm hired as a part time employee so I don‚Äôt get benefits. I don‚Äôt even know how benefits usually work for the most part anyway. My parents are both extremely irresponsible financially and because of that I‚Äôm terrified of debt and having a low credit score, so I‚Äôve been extremely hesitant to finance things or open lines of credit. I know I need to build my credit but I don‚Äôt know where to begin when I can‚Äôt qualify for most cards. I don‚Äôt have the money to spare for a secured card right now, but I‚Äôm trying to be able to put money back for that eventually.

I‚Äôve been working 50 hour weeks lately because of the holiday season, but my manager told me to expect a sharp drop in hours come January when holiday season ends. I know I need to find a new job, maybe a second one or maybe an entirely new full time. I just don‚Äôt know what to look for or whether I should try to go back to school. I finished my freshman year of college at a liberal arts campus in Florida and I regret the choice to go every day because of the student loan debt it has left me with. I was young naive and desperate to get out of my situation and didn‚Äôt think about the financial consequences of student loans. Right now I have an outstanding balance of 2k that I would need to pay out of pocket if I wanted to go back to school in January. I‚Äôm working on saving to pay that off anyway because I don‚Äôt know whether or not it affects my credit, but I assume it does. 

I‚Äôm at a loss because there is so much I need to take care of that I have trouble managing it all, let alone taking any more steps forward. My car‚Äôs engine is knocking and I don‚Äôt know how much longer she has left. That isn‚Äôt even including the fact that the catalytic converter is no good (meaning I can‚Äôt pass emissions to get proper plates) and my temp plates have long expired, I don‚Äôt have the money to fix it nor do I want to with a rod knocking, and I‚Äôve already gotten lucky getting pulled over with no fines twice. I know i need to save for that, I need to save for the balance at school, I need to start making payments on my loans in January if I choose not to go back, and I want to be able to pay more than the monthly payments to put more towards the principal amount (principle? principal? you know what i mean) so that I can pay it off quicker and save money on interest. 

I still have all of my bills to pay every month and I don‚Äôt know what to do to make sure I can cover everything I need. I‚Äôm exhausted all the time working 9 hour days and it feels like i‚Äôll never have a job I enjoy because I haven‚Äôt been able to finish school. I don‚Äôt even know if I can handle going back to school with a work schedule as unpredictable as my current one. I just want to be smart with my money but I had no one reliable enough to teach me. I feel so immature and silly for not being able to figure it out quicker and for making those mistakes with loans. I‚Äôm trying to learn myself but it‚Äôs so difficult to absorb and apply while trying to keep everything else together. It feels so pointless to work myself to death in retail just to break even.

890,"I graduated from undergrad 6 years ago and have recently made the decision to apply for graduate school. To my dismay, many of the applications state that one or more rec letters must be from a professor who can speak to my academic abilities.


I went to a massive state school with 50,000 students. Expecting a professor to remember me is asking... a lot.
how can they accurately write me a rec after 6 years even if they do remember my name? Do I just email them and basically say ""hey remember me? I took your class in 2013 and made an A. Wanna write me a rec for grad school? thanks"" 

isn't is a little unfair for people who aren't JUST graduating from undergrad to expect recommendations from years and years prior? This could be the one thing that prevents me from applying because it's so intimidating.

892,"On mobile, so my editing will be straight up trash. My apologies.

I've been with my wife for 3.5 year total and married for one month. I love this woman to death. But we are facing a huge problem that neither of us seem to be able to come to a conclusion on.

Her dream since she was 16 years old was to become a funeral director. She's the kind of person who does tons of research on this kind of stuff, and already knows what schooling she needs, what the job entails (she even shadowed a funeral director in high school), and has a reasonable understanding of what to expect salary wise. Ohio has stiff requirements to break into the field, Texas, where we want to move has significantly less requirements.

I currently work as a truck driver, and due to my work schedule and my dispatcher, I am home for around 1.5 days a week or about 37-40 hours on average. Personally, after 5 years of doing this job...I fucking hate it. Its made me incredibly depressed, and put me in some pretty dark places. I've gained weight, and can't seem to be able to manage the stress. I make good money, so we don't really want for very much. 

The problem is, if I quit trucking all together it means a pay cut and one thats going to hurt. Ill be able to be home a lot more and be able to pursue my hobbies. Emotionally, I know I will fare better. However, the cost of that will quite literally be her dream as most funeral homes in Ohio are run by a lot of the same families and have been for decades. Its incredibly hard to break into the industry in Ohio unless you are related to someone or are really good friends with someone.

I don't want my wife to give up her dreams, but this job has steady eroded my mental health. Our lease on our apartment is up in June. I want us to be out of the apartment by then, whether its Texas or still in Ohio. As far as changing companies go, lenders want to see commercial drivers stay at their current company for 2 years minimum because of how high of a turn over rate the industry has.

Ok so I‚Äôve been doing some weird research for a while since corona and the subjects have been.... well a little taboo (I found an article that lead to one thing to another)

Basically I‚Äôve borne doing research into different laws in Canada. One that was a recent was its obscenity laws. I had a question regarding them and I posted on r/legaladvicecanada

Which got me banned bc I didn‚Äôt learn the first time that they don‚Äôt like hypothetical questions. I can live with a temp ban since I deserved it, but it was a comment that has me worried.

Please note that NO where in either post did I question the illegal-ness around a certain subject of porn NOT ONCE in fact I even stated that I know that it is illegal to have anything to do with it. I was asking about everything else that was considered ‚Äúobscene‚Äù. Unfortunately however someone interpreted it differently. They posted a comment basically saying ‚Äú‚Äî- is illegal, no fucking questions about it‚Äù (didn‚Äôt include the term bc just no)
 

I then got really scared bc I had NO idea how they came to that conclusion so I first tried editing it to clearly state that there was no question about it, but then I panicked about both the comment and the ban and deleted the posts.

Now I have ocd to an extent and now I am TERRIFIED that the comment may implement me in something that I want nothing to do with.

I have had to cut into my savings during the pandemic which hurt (but was absolutely necessary and I am grateful I had savings to cut into to begin with), but this obsession has been building for years, and has gotten to the point where I now see not eating dinner as an option for saving money. If I waste money on something (I accidentally left out a bag of milk, and milk is NOT cheap) I cry beat myself up, and punish myself by not eating because I feel like I don't deserve it. 

I used to have a healthy relationship to budgeting, but now it has become excessive. Everything always adds up. I stress about Christmas, I stress about groceries, I stress about gifts.

913,"TLDR: IM A YOUNG MALE WHO MOVED OUT TO LA ON MY OWN. I CANT SUPPORT MYSELF ANYMORE BUT I DONT WANNA GO PAIN HOME TO THE LIFE I WAS LIVING BEFORE. ANY ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT IS APPRECIATED.
‚Ä¢
To start I‚Äôm a 19yo male who lives in Los Angeles. I spent most of my adolescent life in foster care. Back when I was 16 my social worker found my grandmother, who took me and my sister in. I stayed until I was 18. I left my grandmothers home due to her being homophobic and our poor relationship. I was also heart broken at the time. I wanted to leave it all behind me. 
‚Ä¢
So I moved out to LA, about an hour from where my grandmother lived. I was working two serving jobs and going to school full time. I found roommates and made a life for me. The problem is Im realizing that I might not be able to go on like this especially with the pandemic. In a few months I‚Äôll be 20yo and I feel like I have nothing to show for my time out here. I had so many goals like getting a car and finishing school to get a decent job. But I don‚Äôt have a car I‚Äôve been living off of the money I was saving up and money I was allocating for the car I wanted. I failed half of my classes this semester and now I‚Äôm not working again. I feel so confused. The relationship I was in just ended and I‚Äôm having a hard time dealing with the pain.
‚Ä¢
This morning moving back home crossed my mind. Out here I‚Äôve been in good relationships and I‚Äôve been in sh*tty ones. I‚Äôve had a lot of jobs and I‚Äôve moved a lot. I‚Äôve been happy and I‚Äôve been sad and I‚Äôve been lonely. I just don‚Äôt know if I can keep it up. I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs liberating to do this all fresh out of high school. It was a great learning experience that a lot of people can‚Äôt say the same about. But I was so naive and in a lot of ways I still am because I had to grow up so fast. 
‚Ä¢
If I stay here I‚Äôll keep sinking until I run out of money. I feel like I failed. If I go back home it‚Äôs like I did fail. I‚Äôll have to get a job back there and hear my grandmother gloat about how I couldn‚Äôt do it. The only positive is I‚Äôll be able to save up and dedicate more time to school. Maybe get a car in a few months. Is that the right thing to do? I feel so lost and like a kid. Has anyone been in the same situation? If I go back how do I avoid feeling like sh*t? I don‚Äôt wanna leave LA I wanna stay :(",02Dec2020,1
914,"So, due to some circumstances, I have some nephews living with me, I recently discover that one of them, age 12, have been watching porn on his tablet,  I didn't say anything to him because I wanted to avoid ""the conversation"", whoever I felt the other more responsible thing would be setting up parental control, rather than blocking his tablet alone, I set up a NDS filter on the home router, so every device on the network gets blocked,  I know it can be easily bypassed if you're a tech person, but he's not, so I doubt he will find out anytime soon how to bypass it.

However, growing up at home I had full uncensored Internet, and looking for opinions around here seems like the general idea I get is that family filters can be bypassed, and being too much of a control freak create distance and distrust between your children and you, but he's not my son, I am not good with words, and I don't feel like I have a moral high ground regardless internet pornography either.

I've known Anna since we were babies (our parents are best friends) but our friendship has always come and gone. Not maliciously, we just always took different paths in life, but we haven't been close in recent years. I'd say our last ""falling out"" was a few years ago when she met her now fiance. I'm very happy for them and wish them all the best, but she asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding. I said yes because I was so excited for her, but I quickly realized I don't want to be one of her bridesmaid because I don't want her to be one of my bridesmaid when I get married. I'm in a long-term, committed relationship with plans to get married within the next couple years, so I apologize if it seems like I'm getting ahead of myself. It seems like a ""return the favor"" kind of ordeal. We only talk a couple times a year, mostly for holidays or bdays and we don't hang out when I visit my hometown (pre-covid). I truly am excited for Anna and wish her nothing but the best, but how do I very politely back out of the situation? I don't want to hurt her feelings by not asking her to be a bridesmaid of mine when I've made new friends that actually try to keep in touch in with me.",02Dec2020,1

I had a history of self harm, since oct 2019, and my parents think they cured me by telling me to love myself, and so i was cutting ever since then, in places they wouldnt see everyday, and on September 14th, I cut on my arms, it looked so fucking bad... but then so I told my dad in the morning on September 15, and we talked abt it with my mom and sister, and ever since then, she has not been the same. She doesn't talk to me at all. she doesnt look at me, she doesnt do fucking anything, she's normal to my dad and mom, but not me, and in like 1 week its gonna be THREE MONTHS without her talking to me. i tried to express myself to her, but she told me she doesnt care. so i dont try anymore. my parents said its my fault for self harming and thats a valid reason why she wont talk to me, and im starting to think theyre right. but i was already so fucking sad, and she made it so much worse by not being there for me, when i was ALWAYS there for her. i just don't know what todo. i cant express how fucking depressing it is. she blocked me on everything, except text, but i didnt text her yet, and im wondering if i should. i wanna say sorry, even though i dont know exactly what im saying sorry for.

She told me how she is relapsing into drugs, suffers from anxiety, has PTSD from suicide attempts,Self harms, is Emotionally and psychologically abused by her mother,

She says that she cuts to feel(like most) that it‚Äôs addictive

She told me how she was destroyed by a boyfriend who she really loved who left her after he watched her get into drugs and how he left after she tried to tell him about her problems. And by another guy who cheated on her 3 times in the span of a month

She told me that she‚Äôs going to therapy but that she doesn‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs helping her. Told me how she hates having her problems be the subject of entire conversations and how she would spend hours upon hours laying upon a desk coked out of her mind she has overdosed at least 6 times in the past 3 years

She got off the drugs and I remember feeling so happy for her but she is relapsing

she told me she worries that everyone will leave her I told her I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere

I told her she was the Strongest and Most Amazing person I knew(she really is) and how I would never be afraid to admit that no matter what the world thought of her

She said‚ÄùThank you that means the world to me OP‚Äù
‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had anyone to trust with this for a while‚Äù

She told me ‚Äúbeing so close to death changes you in a way you just can‚Äôt describe like a black cloud following you everywhere‚Äù

I told her how talking helps in ways that me and her could never subconsciously realize.

I told her to call me(i specifically told her call instead of message) if she was going to put a needle or knife In her arm or powder up her nose and I told her i would be there no matter what

And how I was going to help her get off the drugs and the cutting

I posted this in another sub and people just said I was a ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù ‚Äútrying to get with her‚Äù that I was an incel

I‚Äôm not I just want to support her because she is my best friend and I don‚Äôt want her to hurt herself I know I have to be her rock and just be there for her

We both moved on and the guy I started seeing after him ended up being someone I wanted to marry one day. Until I didn't... He was everything to me for over 4 years. I loved (almost) everything about him. He was sweet, funny, original, adorable, and had the sexiest smile. I loved his laugh, his hug, his arms, and nothing about him was unattractive to me. I fell the hardest I had ever in my life. The relationship had its ups and downs as they all do. He was slightly passive aggressive too. He never wanted to go with me anywhere. I invited him to everything that I was invited to but he never wanted to go. He just wanted to stay home and play video games. Then he got a job that took him out of town for weeks at a time. He could have come home, we could have spoken on the phone, but we didn't. We didn't think it was an issue. However, for a while I had already wondered if we had an expiration date because we wanted such different things in life. He wanted to go live in the mountains. I wanted to live in a big city. Even if just for a little while. He ended up changing his mind saying he did want us to have kids. Meanwhile, I never thought I could have kids and convinced myself I didn't want them. I wanted to get engaged and married but he wanted to push it off for years to come. We were perfect on paper. Had a lot in common and had a lot of fun together. Then...I don't know what happened. I fell out of love...again... 

I started seeing someone else the same as I had done previously. While I was still living with my now ex... I tried to end things several times but I kept going back like an idiot. The guy I was seeing was a great guy. Not at all a bad person but I couldn't stop and take a step back from myself to make sure this was what I truly wanted. I tried to talk myself out of leaving the ex. I tried to remind myself of how great we were together. I just couldn't talk myself out of it no matter what I did. He tried to talk me out of it. But I felt he was guilt tripping me into staying so I wouldn't ""regret"" it rather than talking me into staying because he loved me. Why do I do this to myself though? And why do I keep hurting guys who are so good to me? Why do I keep falling out of love and not actually trying to work things out? I just don't get it. The more I think about it the more I feel something is seriously wrong with me....

941,"My in laws (MIL is 65, FIL is 69) were laid off yesterday &amp; have been working for the same company for 26 years. They also laid off my soon to be Ex sister-in-law. It was a small family owned business that recently changed due to the owner dying and now they‚Äôre firing all the elderly staff and corrupt ones. My ILs were just ‚Äúelderly‚Äù, not corrupt. 

My husband and I went to help them file for unemployment yesterday, and for Medicare and Social Security today. I also started helping my FIL with a resume so he can apply for jobs to receive unemployment, working with my MIL tomorrow on hers. 

We talked to them about selling their house after Christmas and selling a few unnecessary things they don‚Äôt need ‚Äî they were financially well off so my husband looked at their financials and is helping them see what lifestyle changes to make since sometimes they suffered from affluenza. 

Is there anything else we need to be doing to help them? They were devastated, still are today, but I think us helping has helped my father in law calm down a bit to not have to do this alone. My MIL is a wreck. My husband works for the same company too and is making plans now to look elsewhere too.

942,"So I'm really mad because I wrote a whole post and accident left the post text and it deleted it all. But oh well that's my luck.

So let me start from the begging. My family is from Iran, and my parents and brother migrated here in the 2000's. The only real good and close family that I have is from Canada. And that consists of my aunt, uncle, and 3 cousins that come from my mom's side. Other than that the rest of my family lives in Iran. That includes both sets of my grandparents. I also want to add that there's a language barrier between us, as they speak farsi only and that I do understand it but I dont speak it fluently.

I've visited Iran twice when I was younger. In this past year I finally visited again. My grandparents (my moms parents) although had finally gotten their green cards and we were able to bring them to the US.

The main issues start with covid. My grandparents are old and weak so it was and still is really an issue for us to keep them safe. We are really cautious when it comes to cleaning things and staying clean, we as well dont leave the house unless it has to do with work or shopping. I do although want to say that if my grandparents weren't here we'd still be cautious but we wouldn't be so trapped in the house. I'd be able to go to school and at least see my bestfriend which I haven't been able to see since the beginning of quarantine.

I'm 17 and quite a social person, so being so stuck at home because of my grandparents, people who have barely been in my life, is so angering! It feels like my whole life revolves around them now! And I hate it!

My mom is a HUGE factor in all of this. Shes really sensitive when it comes to her parents, and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that she hasn't lived with them for a long time. But she causes so many problems. Me and my brother could call out my grandpa for doing something he shouldn't (for example we have told him not to give my dog bones because its dangerous and he didnt listen), and my mom will get really mad at us and defend him. Literally anything we say-THAT IS THE TRUTH- she will get mad at and defend them. She also doesn't seem to realize that just because she grew up with them, doesn't mean me or my brother have! (I cant exactly speak on my brother's behalf because I dont know how he feels about it). And that's a lot of the issue. She constantly expects me to give them hugs and kisses and say hi and ask how they are. She expects me to just love and respect them out of nowhere like they haven't been absent my whole life.

It makes her mad although when I dont do what she says. She thinks that I'm being disrespectful. For example this morning I went to get food from downstairs and I ignored my grandma who was sitting at the table. I didnt want to deal with anyone I just wanted to get my food and go back upstairs. But then my grandma has to tell me to fix my posture (look it's in the morning, I'm hungry and just trying to deal with my online classes. Standing up completely straight is the last of my concerns :| ) and then tries to hug me fix my posture and stuff. I also have my mom pestering me already about not saying hi to my grandma and I'm just annoyed and angry at this point. I was finally able to just leave and be in peace (side note: when I'm mad or annoyed I HATE being touched, dont come near me). 

Me and my mom were later talking about her appointment somewhere and she wanted to go to another store and I asked if I could come. Surprise surprise, she said no (like always, I can never leave the house. I mean there's more of a chance of her letting my grandparents leave then let me leave. LIKE WTF). And then she mentioned me ignoring my grandma. I told her that I in general I dont always say hi to people in the morning or when I first see them and she brought up the whole ""they are your elders you respect them"" bullshit. Look I dont care if you are older than me or younger than me, you have to earn my respect. No one is just given my respect because they are my family, ESPECIALLY if they have barely been in my life. I straight up told my mom that I didnt care and I left.

Later she came to my brother's room (it's right next to my room so I heard it all haha) and complained to him about it. She gave my brother the whole situation thing of ""if you were a grandparent and your granddaughter walked by and ignored you, how would you feel"" and he said that he wouldn't care (hey at least hes not so uptight).

In general I just have an issue with speaking to my grandparents. Whenever it's the morning and I want to go downstairs it just feels like an obstacle in my daily life. It's gotten to the point where I avoid going downstairs until they arent in the kitchen so I dont have to see or say anything to them. Also a lot of times I dont say hi and my mom tries to get me to greet them and give them hugs and kisses when I dont want to and luckily I get away with not having to.

I do want to add that a lot of my issues are more with my grandma then with my grandpa. If anything I'm really cool with my grandpa because he doesn't say much to me except for the occasional hello. He in general is more chill and doesn't care and I love it because I feel so much more comfortable like that.

And that leads to a theme of my issues. I feel uncomfortable in my own home! Whenever I'm downstairs I have to worry about dealing with my grandma, I have to worry about being respectful, I have to worry about greeting her and what I'm going to say if she says something. I'm also not a person that can speak another language comfortably. It's just out of my comfort zone and so it's now just a daily struggle for me. Also something that makes me uncomfortable is eating at the dinner table with all of them. My grandma will just stare at me sometimes and it makes me uncomfortable. She'll also say things that bug me. Like for example shes told me a bunch of times that I should come out of my room and walk around instead of sitting all day.

And this leads to another issuee, THEY THINK THEY KNOW ME WHEN THEY REALLY DONT. And I cant even explain how much it ANGERS ME. My grandparents know absolutely nothing about me and say things like they do!! Its like having a new friend that you're not even close with and having them run around claiming to be your bestie and know everything about you! I hate it!! It also ties into the thing I mentioned that my grandma says. She thinks I just sit around all day or some shit when she never even sees me! She just assumes I sit in my room all day, like she doesn't see a anything I do, what does she know?!? Its not just with stuff like that, she'll say other things that are not true about me or claim I like this or that. I cant think of anything right now of what she has said before but I can still feel the annoyance and anger from when she has.

All of these issues stem from one thing, and that's my basic relationship with my grandparents. They have barely been in my life, so I don't have the love and respect that my mom wishes me to have. She excepts me to just act like I've lived with them my whole life, and I cant!! And I honestly dont want to!! I dont want them to live with me when it's like the world revolves around them now!

Even before quarantine I had the life of a teenager. I would hang out with my friends every weekend, have sleepovers at my friends house and other teenager things. And I really enjoyed it because for once in my life I finally had the sort of freedom that I wanted! When i was younger it was such a struggle for me to hang out or sleep over at anyone's house. My parents had always been very strict with me especially because I'm a girl. But I had finally had my license and I finally had the freedom I once craved before. But no, that had to be taken from me. Ever since my grandparents came here and I was living my life my mom started complaining about me not being home and always going out (note that I went to school on weekdays and went out once every weekend to see friends or to sleep over). And you know why she was acting like this? Because of my grandparents! Because it's like a bad image for me to be going out, and to not spend time with them, and to not be home. IM A TEENAGER, WHAT DO THEY EXCEPT??? I'm not going to change my life because they suddenly appeared in it!! I dont care what they think about me!! And what? You want me to spend time with them for what?? So I can just sit there and stare at them watch annoying Irani news? They are your parents, not mine. It's not my burden to spend time with them.

That's enough for my ranting. I honestly just want to find someone whose been in, is in, or has a similar situations to mine. As well as similar feelings and such. I come here to talk about it because I dont want to talk to my family about it. I want to add that my dad has never said anything about the way that I've been acting and has never had an issue with it.

But thank you to anyone who reads this whole thing!",02Dec2020,1

945,"Brief backstory: I am in my mid 20's. I am a college graduate - 4 year BA in design. Looking to get into the creative side of an agency. --- &amp; maybe not even that - I just want to get my foot in the door.

A close relative (won't specify cause they may be on here) is in senior management at this agency and even outside of that, has TONS of connections in different states &amp; even knows celebrities. 

We have no beef at all and have never had beef. I like them. I'm guessing they like me.

After much asking and them hooking me up with someone I believe they KNEW wasn't serious about helping me (gave me the runaround), this relative got me a short shadowing with the company, and while I am ecstatic, it didn't lead to a job. My relative didn't seem interested beyond this. It was like they ""threw me a bone"" so I'd be quiet.

I feel like I am pulling teeth. I am not asking for a handout. I am not asking for everything to be easy. I am no slouch. I can hold down jobs. I am a good employee. I am prompt. I am respectful. I have my portfolio and all my other things together. I have good ideas and when I don't, I listen.

I feel like if my relative has a way into something (that is difficult to get into), how much do I have to prove to my relative that I am worthy of them helping me? They didn't even get where they are alone! It's not what you know, it's who you know.

We know that a lack of talent and diligence does not stop people from recruiting family members for jobs they are not qualified for. Like for instance, many celebrity children only have platforms because of who their parents are. Not because they EARNED it.

Honestly, I feel like this relative has no true intention to help me. When you WANT to do something, you DO.

That being said, how do I move forward? Should I cut this relative out of my life?",02Dec2020,1

I'm in a really shitty mental situation at the moment. My mind is flooded with guilt and stress.

I got my partner to leave her job as a teacher so we could relocate so I could be on a higher salary with greater job perks (rent free accomodation etc.). 

It now seems that the business is going to go belly up due to the directors spending. It's getting to the point where I cannot operate day to day without feeling like I've ruined her life (she had a long term prospect job as a teacher). 

We can move back in with family but we haven't lived with family since our 1st year of university so it would be a huge unwanted change.

949,My boyfriend is 10 years older (22f/32m) than me and today is his birthday. We had plans to go to one of his friend's house and drink with a couple of his friends. But then last minute (at 10pm on his birthday) some of his other boys called him to come over at this other friends place. They are 10 boys over there. All 10 years older than me and I never met half of them and barely know the others. So I told him to go without me because I didn't feel like feeling alone at the party because usually those boys just talk with each other and don't care about me. I do try to make conversation but they usually don't really try to make conversation with me. So I told him to go without me because I really didn't feel like being in this situation. So he decided not to go at all and stay at home with me because he didn't want to leave me alone because we initally planned to do something together. Now I feel as I should've went with him because it's his birthday instead of making him basically choose between me or his friends. What do you guys think? I tried telling him that he probably wouldn't LOVE going to a party with 10 girls being the only boy and not knowing those girls well. But he said he probably wouldn't care. I feel guilty and bad...

955,"Dear adviser, I accidentally catfished some i eventually developed feelings for. Any advice would be great! 

As we all have sat through the year 2020, we all are left a little deprived of social interaction. In one such moment of intense loneliness, last month I had downloaded this app that allows the user to talk to strangers from all over the world. Over years, in the spur of the moment boredom, I have used the same app several times to have small conversations with strangers that usually lasted for 1/2 days. I always used to get bored with it and I always used to delete and redownload it when I wanted to talk to someone new. I always knew that these conversations would never last and were only for time pass, so I had always told little lies about myself. For example: where I'm from, some made-up life experiences, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, going back to the point of this letter, I redownloaded the app last month and I met a guy from the UK, In my usual manner, I lied about myself just a little bit saying I go to university in London, I was back in my home country because of the virus, that I would be back in London once the pandemic gets better and I am doing online classes from home. Of course, in reality, I do not go to university in London, I go to university here. 

&amp;#x200B;

This guy and I talked for a couple of days on the app and our conversation never seemed to dry out, so when he asked for my number so we can text and call each other on WhatsApp, I stupidly gave it to him. I know should have told him the truth then, but I stupidly kept the lie going thinking that I'd eventually get bored of him too and I could block his number. Well a month later, we sort of have feelings for one another and I am still stretching this lie.

&amp;#x200B;

A little disclaimer here, I had been fortunate enough to have been to London several times in my short life as I have family living there and I know the ins and outs for the London lifestyle. This has helped to make my stupid lie a little more believable I assume. I actually had plans to return to London this year as well, to visit said family, but of course, those plans have been cancelled and pushed to the next year. So I will be visiting London again soon and after that often too. However, the matter at hand is I developed feelings for this guy and I am still stretching this lie. I want to tell him the truth but I am afraid of losing him. I genuinely feel like he sees me for me and these feelings are real.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, me wanting to tell him the truth, my escapist tendencies act up also. Meaning I want to block his number and just move on from his stupid lie. The problem is we both have feelings. I would not be crushing my own heart in doing so, I would hurt him too. I wish there was an easy way out and I really do not know what to do. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!",02Dec2020,1

This is my first reddit post so please be kind.

&amp;#x200B;

So backstory here; I am receiving help for a suspected eating disorder (I'm not proud and very embarressed to have people know, would not like advice on recovery either please) and currently getting tested for anemia and such. This means I'm always tired, VERY cold and have other physical problems to do with this. We also, for covid, have to have all windows open for ventilation and we have a strict uniform (shirt, tie and blazer. jumper is optional but barely anyone wears one and mine was in the wash at the time)

&amp;#x200B;

It all started today in tutor (UK) when we were told to take our coats off, bearing in mind its around 5-7 degrees celsius outside and inside the classrooms feel just as cold. Everyone moaned and groaned about it but we did it. Apart from my best mate, let's call him Pete. He refused because he was cold. After arguing for a min or so, her got sent out for ""disrupting our learning"" even though tutor is just for checking uniform and registration. It was a laugh, I admit but still, it was so cold you could almost see your breath.

&amp;#x200B;

By second tutor, I'd had enough. I politely raised my hand and we had this convo;

M (me): Can i leave my coat on if i have a medical reason?

T (tutor/teacher): No, it makes your uniform look scruffy.

M:Sir, I'll come over and tell you privately, it is so cold. 

I proceed over there and tell him what I've already mentioned (without any classmates hearing), which took so much energy and will-power because i had only just told another teacher who notified my parents and anyone who has dealt with this has felt the shame when telling people (head of house and counsellors know btw, I've had counselling before for other things) But i was fed up, freezing and just wanted to wear my coat. 

T: No, just go sit down

M: \*pokemon surprised face\*

I go sit down but then green card (people with issues have special cards that mean they can leave any lesson without question for up to ten mins to calm down, go to the toilet and such) and text my mum what just happened. My mum is great, amazing support love her to bits.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I just want to know what to do. I can't just keep freezing in lessons but i hate bringing it up to anyone and only two people (other than family and important teacher people) know, Pete and another good mate.

On the way to the bus stop not even 1 mile out from my crib I ran into friendly ppl one pulled a knife and lunged at me I grabbed it but in doing so I sliced my ligaments on my ring and pinky fingers smh. I got dropped shortly after and they took my wallet and chain. I'm not tripping about the chain but my wallet though. 

I said fuck it and just returned home called the source and they said there was nothing they could do for me because I'm not on file and they need my id and social. Filed for a new id using my ppls card and it just came in the other day. Went to get a new social but they won't open the doors, said ""you have to go online to file for a replacement through the mail, you have to send in your id and birth certificate"" so I have to go another two weeks without my id and social again and I'm dead broke.

970,"I auditioned and got into an orchestra that's city-wide (there are players from all over the city). The only orchestra I've played in is from my high school and it's a more relaxed setting. There are decent musicians but they aren't completely music crazy. It's more of a hobby to them. I also feel that way in which playing an instrument is just a hobby. Anyways, I got 3rd chair. The 2nd and 1st chair are seniors who seem to love it and want to become a professional musician. I'm not sure about the other musicians in the section but the city-wide orchestra feels way more strict and it gives me so much anxiety. The next sectional meet is tomorrow and I cant play all the music perfectly. It sounds clunky at some parts because I'm just not used to extremely high registers (notes like b6 are kind of awkward to finger). It's been about 2 week since the first meet so I feel like other people probably perfected it by now. I dont know though because I dont personally know them. I dont want to embarrass myself :(((((( Has anyone had a similar experience and how did you deal with the anxiety.

Also, this has been going on for months and I know that all the food is for him because my family and I had had talked to him about this about a year and a half ago and we thought he was better about this since.

976,"So I‚Äôm 18 and throughout my life I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend. Not to blow my own trumpet, but I‚Äôm a pretty decent looking guy, my problem was I used to be really shy and socially awkward. But in the years since I‚Äôve changed a lot and I‚Äôm more outgoing and confident. I moved away from home for university.

So about three months ago I signed up for some dating apps and I match with this girl, let‚Äôs call her Jess. So me and Jess get talking and we get along really well. She tells me that‚Äôs she‚Äôs got a few things that she doesn‚Äôt like about herself, like autism and really bad acne. I tell her I don‚Äôt mind, cause to be honest I do like her and don‚Äôt really care about that stuff. 

So we keep chatting like this for a few weeks and I ask if she would like to meet me, she says no. I don‚Äôt mind, cause she told me she‚Äôs kinda shy so I say I understand and we keep messaging.

Another week passes and I ask her if she wants to call me or maybe do a FaceTime. She again says no. Again I‚Äôm ok with this. 

Then the second lockdown happens and I have to move back, I live in the uk. So I keep messaging her throughout and we really do get along great.

She says she feels really comfortable around me and we get along great. But cue to today and she‚Äôs turned down another date, scheduled for when things calm down a bit, and this is like the 6th time she‚Äôs said no.

I‚Äôm wondering should I end things with her?

It‚Äôs been 3 months of just texting, and the occasional picture, but I‚Äôve never heard her speak or ever seen her in person. She keeps saying she‚Äôll eventually feel ready but I really just feel like I‚Äôm putting in a bunch of effort for no results. 

From what she‚Äôs told me she doesn‚Äôt have the best life, and I‚Äôve been nothing but understanding and supportive. She‚Äôs also told me she has suicidal thoughts.

I really don‚Äôt want to hurt her, but I‚Äôve never even heard her voice after 3 months, so is it really worth it.

So should I end things?

I don‚Äôt want to be scared, but I know that deep down, a part of me is terrified. Not of them, but of their way of thinking. I know what makes them act the way they act, but I can only do so much.

I know that seeing a therapist or psychiatrist is the best option for them. But they can‚Äôt afford it, and they come from an abusive family. Most likely, they would end up being punished, which just worsens their situation.

984,"I (17M) am extremely annoyed that my sister (18F) gets 3 bedrooms at home, while I get one. Here is the current situation with some of the bedrooms in my house.

- Room A is my sister‚Äôs main bedroom. It‚Äôs a big room and she uses it to keep all her stuff. It‚Äôs a complete mess. There is a bed there yet she doesn‚Äôt use this room for sleeping.
- Room B is my sister‚Äôs study room. It‚Äôs a small room and she uses it solely for studying.
- Room C is the room my sister sleeps in. It‚Äôs a big room. I used to study in here but my mom kicked my out so my sister could sleep there (despite the fact she has a bed in her other room). 
- Room D is my room. It‚Äôs a small room and I have to used it for studying, sleeping and storing all my things.

So basically, the current situation is that my sister gets two big rooms and one small room while I only get one small room.

988," So, I haven't paid a lot of medical bills in my life - I'm only 28 and I have avoided serious injury thank god - but I have a question about ethics and billing and medical practice.

2 month ago I broke my toe. I went to the urgent care to confirm it was broken cause it hurt like crazy and I have ""good insurance"". The took an x-ray, the doctor did something called ""closed reduction toe..."", and then I had another x-ray taken to see if the setting of the bone worked.

It did not work.

To make a long story short, I got a bill this week and I called the doctor's office to dispute it because they are charging me for the doctor setting my toe.

The toe that was not successfully set.

Like I said I am inexperienced in all this but mother-of-god this seems shady as hell. Charging me $400+ for something that didn't work?! How is that legal?

I get it - the doctor trained and went to medical school to have the knowledge to do this - but he still FAILED AT THE THING I AM BEING CHARGED FOR. In my frustrated state I cannot think of a single other thing you could fail at and then still expect to get paid.

Poor haircuts, bad construction work, terrible service and under-cooked food at a restaurant; NONE of these bills would get paid by me. You screwed up, YOU eat the cost.

TL;DR: Doctor tried to help, failed at it. Charged me $400 for the honor of him touching my foot.

990,"Kitten surplus due to covid

My mom feeds her barn cats outside. Some of which we have had for over 10 years. Sometimes a new cat will come by and my parents will catch it and get it fixed then release it again, leaving it to be another barn cat or for it to move on with its life somewhere else. 

Due to covid, her vet no longer neuter or spays cats. And now, a few months later, they are overwhelmed with cats! Like easily a few dozen or more. They poop everywhere, steal food from the main very loved barn cats, and are more or less feral and won't go near my parents. The vet basically told them to catch them, take the cats to another neighborhood a few miles away and release but that just seems irresponsible and dangerous. Plus some are just tiny kittens

What can we do? We've already given a cat to just about every single friend we have in the area. Its getting overwhelming
