0,"(I couldn‚Äôt think of a different sub so I chose this one, even if it‚Äôs not really right) 

I live with my 15 yr old sister, my parents, and my little brother. My sisters turning 16 (which is a big milestone at least in my family) in about a week. For my 16th birthday, I had a small party with friends, went out to eat with my family (which is a family tradition every year) and my parents took me shopping. However because of the Coronavirus my parents have decided to keep my two younger siblings at home and not really let them leave the house (school was cancelled in our district). Because of this, there‚Äôs nothing we can do for her birthday. We can‚Äôt go out to eat or have a party, she can‚Äôt see her friends, and they‚Äôre definitely not taking her to the mall. They don‚Äôt even know if they‚Äôre going to be able to have a cake for her. They feel awful about it, because at the moment her birthday is probably just going to be some Chinese takeout with a candle stuck in the rice. She‚Äôs been excited for her 16th for months and she‚Äôs pretty disappointed. Anyways, does anyone have any advice or suggestions for what we can do for her birthday?",17Mar2020,1
1,"So to start me and my brother are 20 year old adults. We game together often and obviously we have our fights as siblings do.
My brother wants to restart some of my games that I‚Äôve completed but I‚Äôve collected items and such that I don‚Äôt want to restart the games because I feel like everything I have in those games is a part of me.
He both does and doesn‚Äôt understand where I come from and has even made the point to me that they would still be the same even if he completes it. I‚Äôve offered to buy him the games but he will not let me ‚Äúwaste the money.‚Äù And he also won‚Äôt let me transfer any of this stuff away so he can play them. Granted I also have to pay for that but I would rather pay so I can keep my history so he can make his own.
Am I in the right for myself and the collected stuff I want to keep even if I won‚Äôt touch them again or should I just let him restart?
If I can clarify anything please let me know and I will edit this if needed.",17Mar2020,1

5,"The only girl I met was online and it‚Äôs was a bad experience but here‚Äôs why I think meeting a girl is extremely difficult from my own experiences 

1.dating apps are full of fake profiles and generally not what I‚Äôm looking for flakes trolls etc so in general not for me

2.meetup.com-sadly no one my age is doing this from my own experience and the only thing you‚Äôll do from these groups is get friend zoned with any woman you get in contact with and there‚Äôs so much competition these days!

3.through friends-I‚Äôve made quite a few friends online these and meet up with a few none of them know any single women etc. So no luck there and I don‚Äôt meet anyone else through them lol

4.bars/clubs-generally women aren‚Äôt interested in meeting people their they usually stick to their own little groups they go with and I‚Äôm not looking for a one night stand etc.


Anyone relate? You aren‚Äôt alone I think some of us just aren‚Äôt made for love‚ù§Ô∏è",17Mar2020,0
7,"So long story short i talked to this girl before she graduated. She hit me up one night talking about how bad she wanted me to come over, and she happens to have a boyfriend. I looked past that fact like an asshole and siphoned out her entire nude collection only to tell her i couldnt because my car battery was dead üòÇ (already came from the nudes and got my clarity back, she got a man) Keep in mind i never asked for this, she literally sent me videos of her naked saying my name and such. A couple weeks later one of her friends (who happens to be my fwb) says i hit her up and begged for nudes.....

Im pretty pissed off, should i send those vids to her boyfriend and let him know that shes unfaithful? Bitch really thought she would get clout saying I hit her up.",17Mar2020,1
8,"Hey, what's up everyone. I haven't been feeling like myself lately. It's strange, I know the things I care about, what's important to me, and what things make me who I am, but I've just been feeling kind of down and out of it some days lately, asking so many stupid unnecessary questions, and I know it's not me at all.

I have these artificial not real thoughts take over my mind, and it's causing me to lose focus often, and I know that these thoughts are not who I am, have been, and are only temporary.

There are some days where I feel completely fine and don't have any of these thoughts, I feel like myself those days. There's other days where I don't even recognize what's going on in my own head &amp; wonder how I even got here. It's not every day, just sometimes. And then the thoughts go away, but eventually come back.

I've had a lot of personal stuff going on lately, and I've been under a lot of stress, but maybe that's it, it's stuff I can't control, maybe it's just too much to handle, but I'm just confused as to why I find myself over-thinking all of this. 

I deleted Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat three days ago from my phone to try and re-connect with myself, maybe that'll help, I don't know. I've always been one of those people who in the past would spend as much time as possible on social media, but not recently.  It hasn't done all that much so far. 

Any advice on how to get someone to feel like themselves all the time instead of just some of the time would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",17Mar2020,1

They've extended it from two days to two weeks to three weeks since Thursday. Some districts are looking to close to the end of April or longer if need be. 

I'm not sure what to do about money. If it's just three weeks that's one thing and it's bad enough, but it keeps getting extended I'll be really screwed. Ideally I'd be able to do some work online so I can continue to self quartantine, but I wouldn't even know where to start with that.

I have 2 roommates and we live in a 2 bedroom apartment (a small one). My place of work has shut down for the next week, possibly longer. My roommates are still working: one at a restaurant and the other at a large factory. 

One of them recently started coughing, about 4-5 days ago. He claims he got a sore throat from yelling one day, but he's coughing frequently. I suggested he get tested, but he refuses to think he could be sick. He rarely covers his cough, all he does is turn his head away.

I'm doing all I (think I) can for myself by disinfecting any surfaces we all touch, washing my hands frequently, and avoiding touching my face. I'm able to quarantine myself, but I feel it's pointless given the circumstances. 

Any advice for preventing it further? Or should I fully accept that I have a high risk of getting sick? Thanks",17Mar2020,1

22,"**Throwaway** account for private reasons.Also English is not my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.

Someone I consider my little sister (Ashley) is being groomed by an adult. He is in his mid 20s while she is still 15. She is completely smitten and in love with him.I have met this man a few times when I was still living in the same village as all of the people mentioned. I have met his 'gang' and they are very dangerous to be around.He and his friends are also sons from high ranking police officers to village politicians. Nothing big but enough to get things get wiped under the rug. (***Which has happened many times with different thing***)

He is her first real boyfriend and first sexual partner. He has a girlfriend at the moment (**who is also underage**) that doesn't know about his 'affair' with Ashley.He is already forbidding her to talk to other boys or hang out with friends if any boys are around.He is also a drug addict/dealer who gets high infront of her. She asks him to stop doing the hard drugs but he just gets angry at her.He has also threatened her with a gun because she gets too annoying and 'childish'.

I have talked to her mother, she is afraid the more she holds her back from him, the more danger she will face. Her father is a deadbeat and not in the picture anymore.

I know I'm the only one she trusts with these things and have promised not to tell her mother about all the details (sex, gun, etc.)

I tried talking to her about him, tried rationalizing, tried explaining, tried showing empathy but nothing. Not a fucking thing. I don't know what to do anymore.Everything I say goes into one ear and out of the other.She talks about how much she loves him and how she can't leave him even though she knows it's wrong because she feels sad for the other girl. (**NOT because he is in his fricking 20s**)

I know how these things end and I'm just scared. She will either get hurt by him or hurt herself because of him. Please give me some advice to make her see the dangers.

I live on the other side of the world and cannot be there physically.

I will also post this on other subs to get more advice. I hope it's allowed, I am very desperate.

I've always god these paranoid thoughts and they have been more extreme recently.

28,"So, about 2 month ago, my long distance boyfriend completely ghosted me. I assumed something was wrong, but he stayed active on his other social media and eventually me blocked me from them. No explanation, nothing, just ghosted me. 

About two weeks after that I reconnected with an old friend. He was going through a similar situation with his ex girlfriend ghosting him as well, so we confided in each other and really opened up. Neither of us had anyone else to talk to who would‚Äôve understood as much. 

I guess I started to kind emotionally rely on him, but I didn‚Äôt think it was bad as he was doing the same with me. We got pretty close, and then today out of nowhere he said ‚ÄúThis has gone on for too long‚Äù in the middle of a normal conversation, and then blocked me on everything. No explanation. How could he do this knowing my abandonment issues and how badly my ex fucked me up? Now I feel like something is wrong with me that makes people want to disappear from my life. I feel like I have no one to talk to and even if I did, they‚Äôd just disappear too. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can feel myself on the verge of freaking out about this tbh. The only thing I can think of is that he‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs ghosted girls when he feels himself start to have feelings for them, but I don‚Äôt think this is the case as he is still in love with his ex and knows I am with mine.",17Mar2020,0

36,"I'm a 16F , my bf is a 19M . We have been dating for over a year now &amp; he use to basically live at mine. He stayed at mine for a few months &amp; then we decided to take a break from living with eachother &amp; seeing eachother on the weekends. Some family members moved in recently which means I have to share the room with my parents, with my bed in the corner. This means that I have been staying at his on fridays &amp; saturdays. I don't have a job, but my boyfriend works full time - 6 days a week. When he is at work and I am at his parents house, I talk to them &amp; sometimes even cook or bake for them. I help with the dishes &amp; help clean the house. I baby sit their grandchildren when they are not home, they run a food truck so I offered to help them work for free &amp; I have even packed my boyfriends lunch so he can save money instead of buying lunch.

For some reason they just don't like me &amp; seem to blame everything on me. If I'm not at his house for a week and his room is messy - it's my fault. If there are dishes that are in the sink &amp; haven't been washed if I'm staying the night - it's my fault. There are 6 people living in that house not including the parents &amp; everything is blamed on me! I do not know what I am doing &amp; I truly do not feel welcome there at all. My boyfriend works from 4:30 in the morning to 7 at night. Sometimes he may not clean his room or do his dishes but I always try my best to help out because I understand that he works long days. His parents only work on the weekends &amp; are at home every other day of the week.

I overheard his parents talking about me one morning saying ""she eats so much fat food, shes the one making all the mess."" I bought my boyfriend &amp; I fish &amp; chips that night and wrapped the plastic neatly &amp; placed it at the side of the counter to throw out the next morning ( because the only bin they have in their house is outside down their driveway ) &amp; I didn't want to wake the kids or the parents up. 

To my face - they are both really nice. But this morning she took pictures of my boyfriends room ( which wasn't messy at all, only a beer bottle on the bench ) &amp; said 'I'm going to send this to her mum.' Why? What do I have to do with this. She is kicking my boyfriend out of her house at 19 &amp; I feel like it's all because of me. 

She then took a photo of the dishes that were left BY MY BOYFRIEND in the sink &amp; publicly shamed ME on facebook. All her friends &amp; family were saying 'she needs a slap' 'what a pig' etc . My boyfriend has told her so many times that it's not me making the mess ( aka one dish in the sink ) but him, and she still blames it on me. 

My boyfriend is now looking for apartments as he is getting kicked out of the house, she is making him pay more for rent since I stay on the weekends, which I understand . So i have stopped showering at theirs &amp; I have started taking showers at mine so they don't have to worry about me wasting their water. My boyfriend can't move into an apartment until a few months so I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I dont feel welcome at all &amp; I dont really want to go back there, but my boyfriend really wants me to. Is there anything I am doing wrong? Please give me advice.",17Mar2020,1

39,"I have interned for this company since my freshman year of college. Once I graduated they offered me a full time position. 

While I was in college it was a good experience, gave me steady income, offered Flexible schedule options, and I was not so stressful that it messed with my grades. It was not what I really wanted to do in life, but was a good start. 

Now I have worked there steady for almost a year. I hate the job. I have found my mental health declining due to not wanting to go to work and spend my day doing something I hate. I feel the job I have makes peoples lives harder rather than easier. And I feel that I could do more meaningful work. 

The job doesn‚Äôt not pay well at all, but the benefits are amazing. My health insurance cannot be topped, and the have great contribution options to 401k. It is also 5 minutes from where I live. Not to mention the people I work with are all very nice people (for the most part). 

I know full well that I want to leave the company, and I plan to. My question is how long should I work there.

41,"To begin I am 17 years old my girlfriend is also 17. Recently she got her phone taken away by her parents for about 2 weeks during that time I gave her one of my old phones so we could still communicate using snapchat. We have exchanged nudes in the past but not frequently. We both have each other nudes saved on our snapchat conversation. While her parents had her phone her mom saw and mentioned to my gf that she saw the nudes but also mentioned that she quickly looked away and made sure her stepdad did not see and put the phone in a family safe that only her parents know the code to. After she got her phone back within minutes stepdad broke it while in a argument with her which he later apologized for and promised to replace it. About 4 days after the argument where her phone was broken she got a new one and proceeded in life normally. It's been about a week and a half since she got her new phone and during that time she never had a need to text her stepdad and would instead call him most of the time if she needed to speak to him. Today he asked her to text him what she wanted to eat and she realized when she scrolled up that nudes from her old phone had been sent to her stepdad while it should have been in the safe. We checked the dates that it was sent and that was during the time when the phone wasn't in her position. There was nude pictures and videos that would normally require a password to access. I should mention that since she logged into snapchat on the used phone I gave her during the time her phone was taken, snapchat logged out of her actual phone because it can only be on one device at a time. She later realized that her stepfather has known the password she used most of the time including for snapchat and her email meaning he could log into her snapchat account. During the time her phone  was taken she was randomly logged out from my used phone and couldn't log back in for a period of time and the time and date match to when the nudes were sent.

We also both work still, her in an office and me in fast food. With all of that I don't really love the idea of sleeping in the same room as her. We have a suite style room, so theres a living area and another bedroom that one of us could move into when the others are able to come get their things, but we dont have a timeline for that.
I'm just unsure of what to do now. Should I ask to move elsewhere or wait it out? I don't want her to feel abandoned and I'm not too keen on being completely alone either but I want everyone safe.",17Mar2020,1
46,"I have terrible social skills. I question everything I think I know, even small things like simple words. I have no friend irl, I'm terribly insecure about my body. In all the 17 years I've lived I have not done anything impressive or achieved anything. Grew up in a tiny apartment with my siblings and parents that have been on welfare their entire lives. My parents are both losers, no wonder I turned out exactly like them. 

Growing up I played soccer but i sucked at it. I played video games but I sucked at it because of the anxiety. I have nothing to be proud of. I never could pay attention in school, I can barely keep my eyes open. I'm very dumb and ignorant. I don't know anything about the world. I never go outside and I too afraid to. I have no job and I don't see myself ever have the confidence to work despite everyone in my class works. They all have their own money while I'm dependent on my parents that don't work. I have no hobbies and nothing interests me. 

I tried suicide but I was too afraid to go through with it which I regret. That was last summer and I keep thinking about trying again. Im not mentally ill, I just hate life and I'm allowed to have my own opinion. I only value one person that I've never met or talked to, only texted on reddit. I hate my family and I start hating more things everyday. I have no confidence and no motivation. 

I'm struggling in high school and it makes me uncomfortable to be confronted by the teachers that i'm not paying attention or doing my homework. I feel so humiliated in front of my class. They are all better than me and It would be the biggest lie to be in denial. It's a fact. I'm not funny and not interesting. I'm very boring. I just want school to let me go and let me be homeless. I'm so tired of this. I have no dream, I just want to die.

56,"My son is generally a well behaved kid, and I feel like I've given him a lot more freedoms than the other 2 kids because he's always been the most trustworthy. 

Lately he's been caught doing some bad things and has been punished for them. He skipped school so he had his car taken away. Recently his step brother ratted him out for having a ""burner phone"" hidden in his room and when I searched his room I found the phone as well as cigarettes. 

When confronting him about this (and other more minor issues) he admitted that he's been cutting himself and said that he has in the last had suicidal thoughts. We are seeking mental health treatment for him, but due to the cornovirus stuff going on have basically been told that if there isn't immediate suicidal thoughts we have to wait.

 I've talked to him about why he is self harming himself and basically his answer is that I'm strict. I don't understand how having what he perceives as a strict parent is enough to justify self harm or suicidal thoughts, but I'm trying to not be judgemental in it and understand why he feels the way he does. 

For clarification, I don't think I'm strict. The things he is calling strict are these. 1) I don't allow the kids to have Snapchat. I feel like it's a harmful app for teens and only causes problems. 2) I make them turn in their phone at bedtime and don't let them keep them in their rooms overnight. This was a rule put into place because one of the other children was staying up all night talking to friends. 3) I limit social events to one a week. Also a rule implemented due to the behavior of one of the other children who would spend every waking second with his girlfriend if allowed. 4) I make him ask permission before he went somewhere with his friends and didn't give him freedom to just go wherever he wanted to. 

So I understand that he likely feels like I'm too strict in that he gets collateral punishment because his step brother has to have strict limits on how much he is allowed to do things and I'm willing to relax those rules to not be unfair to him. But overall I don't think I'm particularly strict? Certainly not enough to justify how he could possibly be contemplating suicide over it! 

The ""suicide note"" he wrote basically said ""fuck you mother. You pushed me to this because you are too strict and don't care for me."" I'm so hurt and confused by all of this. I just don't know what to do. I love this kid more than my own life, and the thought of him being gone makes me hyperventilate out of fear. I'm hurting for him, but I'm also hurting that he seems to hate me so much right now. And I'm so confused because I just don't understand how what he feels isn't a overreaction. 

I NEED to understand how he feels because that's the only way I know to help him. I don't even really know what advice I'm asking for, just that someone give me some kind of advice what to do beyond the mental health screening?  This whole thing has just really came at me out of no where, out of all of my kids he is the last one I would have expected this from.",17Mar2020,1

62," 

So this is a little bit of a vent session but also a legitimate question of whether I'm being petty and weird or if they're the weird ones.

I moved into my apartment in January. My roommate needed someone to move in ASAP because he was living with his girlfriend who wasn't contributing money towards rent and they were rocky anyway. He had asked me months earlier as well to move in but kept going back and forth in their relationship. I lost all hope, I actually really wanted to move in. He messaged me on actual Christmas Day if I was still interested because apparently he spent money on gifts for both their families, she wouldnt go to his parents house, and then went to hang out with friends as soon as they got back, he was done with her. He said no joke this time. So I move in in January.

He was a great roommate at first, there's toilet paper and paper towels and trash bags available. He's clean. We starting hanging out a lot because we're both creative people and into art and stuff. I actually was giving him rides to work occasionally and also btw, he's on methadone. They both are. So a couple days a week I get up at 8:30 on my days off to bring him to methadone then his job. I have no problem with this because I can tell he's depressed as fuck and mopes around usually when he's not working. I even made a smoothie for him one day and brought it to him at work because I knew he had a long day. He appreciates it. We talk about our past relationships a lot, he tells me over and over he could never forgive his ex for the lack of money and just other bullshit. Things are just generally going well.

Then one day he messages me telling his ex is over for the night and just wanted to give me a heads up, which I appreciated. But then every day since that night, she comes over the apartment when he gets home. After all the things he said about her, she's been here every night and now every day. They just stay in his bedroom with the door slightly cracked because he has 4 cats. It's awkward because I have to pass their room every night to go to mine and I try my best not to look in there.

I come home one night and bolt into the bathroom and see they've left the connected door from the bathroom to the living room open and have to shut it immediately or I'll piss myself. They're both in the living room watching a movie on his TV, I provided the fire stick. I yell out hello and they say nothing. Whatever. I eventually leave and walk by the living room and try to say hi and she won't even look up. He says ""sup"" and gives me some weird annoying look. Next night, come home, they're in my direct view as soon I come home in the kitchen and once again try to say hello, she won't even look up at me. Two days later he texts me if I can bring him to work and I agree so I can talk to him without her there. Keep in mind, they're supposedly broken up. We eventually talk in the car for all of three minutes and he says she had to move out of her new place and he feels too bad to leave her homeless (she doesn't have family she can stay with) and she feels awkward being there so I guess....that's why she can't even say hello? I ask him to just introduce me to her so I don't feel so awkward myself in an apartment I actually pay rent for. He actually has the balls to ask me ""why do you feel awkward..?""

He never does. A lot of nights I come home, and they're in the living room watching TV and want nothing to do with me. I used to try to say hi but I just walk past the living room straight to my bedroom where I hole up for the night. I haven't spoken more than like three sentences to him in person since she has been here. It's been almost a month. I finally introduced myself to her one day when I came home and on my way to my room, saw her laying in bed and just said ""Hi! I'm Danyahs. Nice to meet you."" Didn't even notice he was in the room too. I try starting a light convo and he just gives me these one word answers and just in general seems annoyed as hell that I'm talking to them. Literally shuts the door all the way after I give up on my attempt. The other night I came home and I immediately hear them just slam their door shut. I just don't fucking get it.

I'm getting pretty sick of feeling awkward in this apartment that they both lived in together alone before I moved in. She's over here every day even when he's not, despite him saying he wouldn't let her do that, and I mean she doesn't actually do anything. She never leaves his room but their door is always slightly open so I have to actively try to not look in there as my door is directly next to theirs. My roommate literally won't talk to me anymore. He doesn't ask for rides anymore (not mad about that) but it's like he knows he'd have some fucking nerve doing that.

By nature I'm a non confrontational person so I'm just super uncomfortable. I feel like a third wheel here. I haven't actually signed anything because she was on the lease which actually ended this month. Can't afford to move out right now, especially with my work being closed due to COVID-19. I want to rip my stupid fire stick out of that TV just as a big FUCK YOU to him for changing up on me like this. I'm sick of hearing them laughing and engaging and then I enter literally anywhere in our TINY apartment and silence, nothing. Does that make me petty?? Also, I'm sorry about the giant backstory/vent session.",17Mar2020,2

So far the issues I'm having. I've noticed that the floor of the entire apartment is warped, as if there was water damage previously. The carpet is new, but it doesn't address the fact that there could be mold underneath. I've also found a mouse trap in the upper shelf of one of the closets. This is after I've been told that everything was cleaned. The  ath tub drains extremely slowly and I an unable to use the never that blocks or opens the drain. It's kind of falling apart. The restroom sink also has issues. The ceramic or metal seems to be falling apart and the right hand nozzle only turns abut 1/3 of the way. On top of that, the ice maker doesn't work in the freezer and the internet company told me that something was wrong with the fiber internet connection to this unit.

I emailed the front office and asked them to call me so we could discuss a resolution to all of this.

But at this point I'm willing to pay to break the lease because I'm just so terribly disappointed in the quality of the apartment.

70,"Hey all. I'm having a bit of a toss-up in life right about now. I just got back home 30 minutes ago from being away at college for two months, because my university has completely shut down the campus. Before coming home I went to meet my girlfriend's parents and stayed with them for a few days. It was great, they were so spectacular, I actually started to feel alive for once.

Already my mom and sister have left to their rooms leaving me to basically sit here and browse Reddit and read my book. We don't have good internet, we don't have cable, we live 30 minutes driving distance away from everything.

My mom is constantly taking money from me. She has taken almost 10k at this point and I have so little money left that I have given up fighting it.

I don't feel good here at all. At college I finally started to realize what it's like to socialize, and I was getting pretty good at it. Now that I'm home I instantly feel like shit again.

I just want to move back to college. Looking at how my girlfriend lives, I realize just what is possible. I will never grow as a person here. I won't amount to anything if I stay here. I know it sounds like I'm comparing my home life to my girlfriend's, but I've always hated where I live. My mom hasn't been happy in years and my house is a dump that's never clean and doesn't have necessities like good running water or food. My mom is so poor that I have paid the bills for the past year. While living at college. 

It constantly eats away at me how trapped I feel without any money and now without any other place to go. And my home life isn't even ""bad"" per-se. It's just not good.

74,"Throwaway account here. Long story short, matched with someone on tinder who was super forward and had lots of revealing photos. I got drunk, texted back later that evening and said I wanted to see more.

Chatted on WhatsApp for a few and she (more on this in a sec), sent a bunch of photos. It wasn't was I was expecting at first but I was drunk, I'm cooped up in a hotel self isolating abroad and figured fuck it. Turns out the photos were of a very attractive trans woman.

I was skeptical of the photos as 1) didn't initially realize the person was trans, 2) the photos didn't seem to match up. They pressed for a photo so I sent one that wasn't me (just cropped out the face) and eventually sent one of my own but there's really nothing identifying in it (no face, no tattoos, nothing personally identifying in the photo).

I reverse image searched a few of the photos and there were tons of matches from escort sites ‚Äî go figure. I immediately deleted both photos in WhatsApp (for both parties), and unmatched them on tinder. At this point, I should have just walked away but called the person out for sending fake photos.

I woke up this morning to a text from them, new number with screenshots of various people from my Instagram account (since deleted) and demanding I pay them. This kind of spooked me as I just really don't want to deal with the third party what happened blah blah.

The chat history was luckily pretty benign. Furthermore, I'm not terribly worried about someone calling me ""homo"" or some shit for being surprised by someone being trans, thinking they were attractive and just rolling with it (drinking makes you stupid). It's more so just the threat being held over my head at this point and if they do really want to make a point, how far are they going to go with it...

Lesson learned obviously but I was curious if anyone's had any similar experiences, how they dealt with it, recourse, the fallout, etc..",17Mar2020,1

I had my sweet 16 party recently with my friends and family, my dads side of the family and we live 10 hours away apart so I rarely see them. One of them had a dab pen (They‚Äôre of age and it‚Äôs legal for them). My bestfriend and her boyfriend came to my party and I have been friends with both of them since the last year. My bestfriends boyfriend is the abusive type, tells her she cant go anywhere without him, hits her, and emotionally abuses her, while she just puts up with it. He has 0 filter and basically does what he wants with barely any consequences. We told them both that the cart was empty so they sadly cannot hit it. We were chilling in the room and my cousins wanted to go hangout with my dad and my uncle so me and my cousins left the room leaving them alone. 30 minutes go by and my bestfriends boyfriend calls me in the room to tell me that he snooped through my cousins purse and saw that the cart was full. I immediately texted my cousin this and she‚Äôs LIVID, she goes to tell my uncle. We heard a knock and my uncle came in, ‚ÄúListen, if you ever go through my daughters things again Ill break you‚Äù and left the room. The boyfriend got so pissed off at me to the point where I had to leave. He left the party pretty early. After a good hour he texts me ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so fake I cant believe you did that‚Äù , ‚ÄúIm gonna tell everybody you‚Äôre a snitch and im gonna get somebody to jump you‚Äù and the final, ‚ÄúYour uncle is a pussy and he shouldve manned up‚Äù.

80,"
I [18M] have been in a relationship with my girlfriend [17F] for over 3 years now. Ever since we met, she's had mental issues, even going to the hospital November 2018. Around January, I proposed that she might have borderline personality disorder and a specialist confirmed it.
I love this girl, or rather the person she is when she isn't having an episode, but recently moments when she's not in the midst of an episode are few and far between. She tells me nearly everyday that she wants to die and blames me for keeping her alive. With each passing day, I keep having doubts whether I love her or not. 
In January, when she was finally diagnosed, I started dealing benzodiazepines in order to pay for her therapy. This had some consequences I could have never anticipated, such as being r**** by a guy who later went to prison... Interesting couple of months .
(On a side note, her sex drive has completely gone away. That is to say, she no longer experiences physical pleasure from sex and I'm not sure if it isn't because of what happened to me.)
I would give anything just to have her back but the idea of her ever returning to being the person she used to be is slowly fleeting, and so I'm having doubts if this whole thing even makes sense anymore.
The issue is, I know for a fact that I am the only thing keeping her alive at this point and I couldn't live with myself knowing I killed her. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I won't be the one who dies first. I started getting these episodes of complete indifference whether I live or die.

Anyway, because of the coronavirus all the lectures are cancelled and he told me he is going home on Thursday this week, back to his hometown. In 3 days.

I‚Äôm really drunk and this happened about 45 minutes ago . btw. 

And anyway, his friend was videoing us. And it made me think, am I something to be embarrassed of? Why is his friend filming us right now? Is this a compromising situation? And I felt so sad and I told him that his friend was an arsehole.

84,"Good evening, I've been trying to get a girlfriend for quite a while though it just won't happen.

I've spoken to, approached and met numerous girls, though I still haven't managed to hit it off with any of them.

I have friends (the girls are taken) and family I enjoy spending time with and I surprisingly get complements like: ""you smell good!, nice shirt!, nice shoes!, I like your accent, where are you from?"" fairly often from people I don't even know.

I feel like the reason why I still haven't managed to get a girlfriend at my age (mid 20's) is most likely due to my social standing:

I have a job and I like to save up money, though I live with my parents and I help them pay the bills every month. 

I practice my driving skills (thanks to my dad) and I'm looking for an official driving instructor, because I don't have a driver's license nor my own car. 

Admittedly, I also think a lot of girls my age get turned off by me because I think I come off as too friendly/nice especially due to my ethnicity.

T.b.h a lot of guys (not all of them, though quite a few) who share the same ethnicity as me are often loud, vulgar and arrogant and so forth.

I think if I get my own place/move out, get my own car and driver's license and possibly start acting like the guys I've described, then I think I'll most likely have a better shot when it comes to women though I'm not 100% if this is the solution (I think I might be right).

Do you agree with my solution?

How can I get over the fact that I don't have a gf/partner?

Lastly, how can I stop getting jealous of other men who aren't single?

87,"Hey everyone! 

I will try to keep this as short and concise as possible. Basically I am looking for an outsiders perspective on an issue that I am currently having, as I realize my own views are colored by my emotions at this time. Before I start, I want to disclaim that these problems may seem trivial to some, and I fear that I will come off as privileged or arrogant by posting this. 

Where I'm at right now: Im 23 and graduated from college a little over a year ago. I have a good paying job and am about to finish paying off all of my student loans. I live at home with my parents and 3 siblings of whom I am the oldest. I love my family and enjoy the chance to be able to spend more time with them, however I'm starting to feel like living at home is bringing me down and affecting my happiness. 

The problem: My parents do not want me to leave, particularly my mom. As I said previously, I am about to finish paying off my student loans and have around $20,000 saved in a 401(k). My plan after I paid off my loans was to move out, but my parents are not on board. Both of them stayed at home until they were 26 and used that time to save up as much money as they possibly could and never really thought that any of their kids would do anything differently. My mom now wants to loan me another $6,000 to invest while markets are low so I can reap the rewards later. This is a great idea, but will also mean I will be stuck paying more loans for the foreseeable future. 

What advice I need: I understand that my parents have my best interests in mind, and that investing and saving now when I am young will get me miles ahead for my future. With this being said, I really just feel like I need to spread my wings a little bit. Would I be crazy to do such a thing? I have always dreamed of traveling abroad (I know now is not the opportune time) but I recently applied to some international jobs and have been given offers for several of them. I know I have the opportunity to put myself ahead for the rest of the life, but I've also feel like I've been delaying my happiness for a long time and don't want the world to pass me by. I also know the grass always appears greener, and I don't want to do something stupid just because I feel stuck right now. I would REALLY appreciate any thoughts or potential pieces of advice. Thanks!",17Mar2020,1
89,"I really need honest and genuine advice right now because I just feel so confused (for lack of a better term) and insecure about it. I‚Äôve made the decision to remain a virgin until marriage NOT for religious reasons but for personal and cultural reasons and it‚Äôs okay for me in my culture because that‚Äôs considered normal but in American culture I get judged so harshly and I just feel so pressured as of late. 

I used to be so secure in my decision and prideful in it, I used to walk around in a calm relaxed manner without a care in the world. But lately the way that westerners (that‚Äôs what we call Americans) have made me feel like just terrible. The most recent example I can give is when this older feminist type lady interrogated me when she found out and literally asked if I was a ‚ÄúJesus freak‚Äù for caring about that type of stuff and when I calmly explained it was for me and no one else she accused me of living on old outdated standards. It hurt my feelings a lot, but this has not been the first time people have made me feel shitty about it. 

Men pull me every which way on this, on one hand men are always talking about how much they love virgins and the other half are just so...awful. This dude told me that you‚Äôre either religious, mentally repressed, or can‚Äôt properly form relationships/have emotions if you are a virgin adult. When I‚Äôm telling you I cried up I‚Äôm not joking, I felt this aching pain in my heart like ‚ÄúDamn‚Äù that shit really hit me deep.

Sometimes I‚Äôll see them vent to each other and they‚Äôll start going on about how they‚Äôre each other‚Äôs best friend and that they mean the world to each other. I just watch silently, sometimes cry a little bit. I understand that these things happen, it just hurts. 

Is there any way to get rid of this pain? Seeing them be so close and just ignoring that I‚Äôm there sometimes makes me wonder if I should even be there. 

I haven‚Äôt had an official best friend since, forever. It‚Äôs a tough thing for me, I have a few close friends though. I guess part of me just wants to be that for somebody. I want to have a best friend.

I dated a guy freshman year but I never like fell for him, I just liked that someone actually liked me.

And then (just before shit hit the fan), I went on a date with a guy and it was so nice and awesome and he's so pretty!

So I run a small food business that employees about 30 people. We‚Äôve been ahead of the curve so far with regard to handling the spread of Covid. 

For example we closed our business to walk in customers and are making folks pay ahead of time to limit interactions.

My preference would be to close for two weeks. I could afford (barely) to pay the entire staff full salary for those two weeks, however I would have to count it as using their sick/pto time. I simply can‚Äôt afford to pay them for this AND more sick/pto later.

My fear is we close for two weeks...and then what? What if the state mandates we close for a month? I‚Äôd have been closed and lost all revenue during a time I may have been able to at least break even.

107,So I started talking to this girl on tinder we'll call her Jess. Everything was great we talked on tinder for probably about 4 or 5 days and then I got her snapchat. We continued to talk on snapchat and eventually meet up at her place a few days later. We talked for hours and got to know each other. It was such a good time. The next time I went over we fooled around and from there on we became really close. But during that night she told me that there was only one thing that might effect me wanting to be with her and it was that she was still friends with her ex. She's not from where I'm from and they both decided to go to the same college but ended up breaking up last fall. I said it shouldn't be a problem even though I had a weird suspicion.So moving forward we would see each other 3 or 4 days out of every week and talk on the phone every night even if we just seen each other. There was one day that I was asking her about her ex and we got into an argument. Now I was still weary about the whole ex thing as I'd guess a decent amount of people would be. There were some warning signs that I didn't realize until now but regardless. After the argument she ended up confessing that she loved me and wanted to be with me. So a couple days later I asked her to be my girlfriend and everything was fine until 2 weeks in. She came over drunk after being with her friends and was passed out in my bed. I just had a gut feeling to check her phone and I seen the texts. She was still in a relationship with her ex...after seeing this I confronted her right away. She admitted it and told me that she didn't want to be with him anymore and that she didn't love him. Jess told me that she had fallen out of love with him for months and cheated on him multiple times before. Believe it or not I forgave her. I told her she had to break up with her ex and we could be together. So the next morning she did it. She told me everything that happened and why she did it. We ended up breaking up about 2 weeks later but she said she wants to take a break and get back together once she's done working on herself. But the kicker is that she wants to still be friends with her ex. She has told me countless times that she only wants to be friends with him and has no feelings for him anymore.

111,"Tl;Dr: I work in a small busy grooming salon. My friend has a sinus infection and won't stay home or consistently wear a mask even though we come into contact with at-risk clients daily. Giving her reminders to wear the mask hasn't worked. How do I talk to her about it??



I (26f) work at a corporate grooming salon in Massachusetts (about 30 minutes from Boston). My friend (30f) called out due to a sinus infection yesterday but came in today because she can't afford to stay home. I have no trouble understanding why she came in, this is a financially stressful time for a lot of people. 

My big issue is that she was provided with a mask to wear at work since she is sick and she won't keep it on.  She's been coughing, sneezing, sniffling, has sinus pain/pressure, etc. She hasn't gone to the doctor for any type of antibiotics so she is most certainly contagious. 

On top of that another girl (f20) in our salon is also sick and was tested for COVID-19 yesterday. She is still awaiting results. 

Anyway, I asked her (f30) to wear a mask because we have a lot of elderly clients and our assistant store leader has an autoimmune disorder and I don't want her to get sick. She said she would get one in a minute and then put one on about ten minutes later. 

She. Kept. Taking. It. Off. 

It seemed like every time I would see her I'd have to remind her to wear the mask. She'd either pull it down away from her nose and mouth during conversations or just leave it elsewhere completely and have to go looking for it. She interacted with at least five different elderly customers today with it off, coughed on two clean dogs which were then taken home (not covering her mouth) and just generally spread her germs throughout the salon even though our Assistant store lead could get sick easily and she's in and out of our tiny salon all day. 

I don't really know what to do. I work with her again tomorrow morning and feel like I need to take a harder approach with her concerning wearing the mask. I want to do so in a respectful way that doesn't damage our friendship, but I feel honestly really angry and it's my opinion that she's being selfish.

I'm in the top 5% of my class, have worked for one of my Professors (I co-authored his online lecture script) and in student government, and have received a prestigious scholarship. My PI knows all of that. Not only is his behavior towards me confusing, but now I'm also wondering if what he wrote may hurt my application. I know that he is fair and I doubt he would write me a negative recommendation (the other people in our group say that has never happened). But I'm pretty sure his recommendation will be lukewarm or even mediocre. Unfortunately that would not add to my application in any way. I want my recommendation to reflect my achievements and character. I guess I should have never asked him in the first place.

I'm dying to send my application (I have 15 days left till the deadline) but I'm unsure what to do. I don't think I want his letter of recommendation any more but I don't want to be rude. I think I'd rather have no letter of recommendation than a lukewarm one that doesn't support the picture I painted of myself in the application. I could ask my former boss (the Professor I worked for) if he could write me a letter. He has done so in the past for my scholarship and the letter was excellent and very personal, AND he let me read it. Problem is, I'm not sure I can get a hold of him at the moment given the current pandemic. I will try to get a hold of him tomorrow.

I'm really confused and conflicted. A letter of recommendation from my former boss would be excellent, but he is a physical chemist, not an organic chemist, and my specialization is in organic chemistry. On the other hand, what good is a mediocre letter from an organic chemist who paints the picture that I'm just like any other student. Advice needed! Thank y'all.",17Mar2020,1

117,"I've never been in a relationship before, so I don't know if this is an okay thing for him to do. My boyfriend sometimes talks to his ex of 4 years (they were on and off, so more like 3 if you ask me) and when I ask him about it he says ""It's not like I hate her or anything, she just messages me sometimes."" Also might be worth noting that he follows her spam account on instagram, and she follows his.

He still talks to his other ex sometimes too, not frequently though. However, when I asked if he still talked to her he said he ""hasn't spoken to her in months."" But I saw him text her 2/3 weeks before that, right in front of me too, which made me kind of upset. He also follows her spam.

Recently, our food stocks have been running low, and we have a grocery trip planned tomorrow morning, when they (hopefully) restock. As my parents are not in a condition to take the trip, I convinced them to drop me off, and for me to quickly run through and get everything on the list since I have the best insurance/health.

I have done grocery runs before, but never like this. 

To be quite honest, I'm really, really scared.

Our community was never very diverse, and I'm Asian American. I've already been targeted for a couple racist attacks, and my grandpa was slapped last week over instant noodles.

First off, does anyone have any advice for me to deescalate situations like this? I usually don't respond, but these days people just get angrier. Do I stand my ground if someone wants my products?

Second, how should I best protect against the virus while shopping? Should I wear gloves? Wipe down products? Can I be near my parents after??

129," I work in corporate accounting for a retail company of 200 employees for the store and warehouse, and I have to walk through some of the warehouse to get upstairs to my office.

This morning, one of my team members showed up sick with a sore throat and a cough... I sent her home immediately and disinfected the office. I then asked my boss‚Äô boss if my team of 4 could work from home for at least the rest of the week. He didn‚Äôt put up much of a fight at all and said that if we could make it work, he was totally on board. We do require a lot of paperwork for our jobs, so I am tryin hard to make it work.

Others only my floor can‚Äôt work from home because of reasons (would have to change flow for too much and also we have a new hire who obviously can‚Äôt be trained remotely) and think we are receiving preferential treatment and that I am exaggerating for trying to work from home.

I am young and low risk, as is mostly everyone on my team, except for one of the girls lives with her high risk parents. I think at first, the CFO thought I was only asking for that employee to work from home, but when he asked to clarify if I was also going to work from home, he didn‚Äôt react adversely to my saying that yes, I would. I did make a point to tell him that obviously if his final say was no that I would be there. 

Am I exaggerating? I‚Äôm not afraid that I will die from the virus, but I am not indifferent to catching it. Everyone is just going about their business and while they are taking hand washing and preparing for a future quarantine seriously, my company doesn‚Äôt seem to be taking precautions to promote social distancing or much else than saying ‚Äústay home if you are sick‚Äù. People are still using the shared water stations, and HR is still making coffee for the break room where accounting, dispatch and sales can have some. I felt so uncomfortable and nervous today having people walk into my office to use the copier or the fax, I know working from home is not the norm for this company and we will not be near as effective as being in the office, but it seems like we need to make this a higher priority than staying on track to close the month in time or whatever other deadlines (mostly self imposed, except for sales tax) we might be working against.",17Mar2020,1

She's really cool, and we run into each other every now and then and she's really friendly and I even went to her place once and we chilled and talked about movies and such. I should say, she has multiple times self proclaimed her social awkwardness and her near inability to be social. In person it's hard to have a conversation with her because she's the kind of person who doesn't say anything unless you ask.

Anyhow, I like her, but aside from that I just want befriend her since we hardly ever talk. Only problem is most of the times I text her she'll leave me on read. She only responds to random comments 5% of the time, but she responds to direct questions about her life/hobbies 90% of the times.

At this point I know it's normal for her to act like that. I have no reason to think she doesn't want to be friends with me because she is always really friendly to me all things considered. She's also stated multiple times, indirectly with her posts that her entire social life is sustained by the few extroverts in her life who force her to come out of her cave every now and then.

Should I keep texting her every now and then? For example she left me on read today after I said a comment about a show. Should I keep sending her messages and trying to be friendly and get her to keep talking? For example, asking how she's doing or something in a day or two? How much would be annoying or just making a nuisance out of myself?

Friend had sex with a girl I liked and disregarded my request not to. Should I be upset and what do I do? Talk to him? Stop bringing girls over? Is this a breach of trust?


Story:
I have a roommate. Moved into a friend's extra room to save some money. He's generally a good friend and this was awesome of him, however we recently had a sort of ""friend code""  that was broken and I don't know what to do about it.  The reason this is in ask men is because it has to do with a girl. 

A girl I like--she is cute and fun. I met her through a former coworker. She flirts with me and accepted invites with me to do things and we have a good time. It has been two weeks since I met her and she even wanted to celebrate a two weeks of knowing each other over drinks. 

But my roommate decided one night ""I wanna bang (said girl). Is that okay?""

I said, ""dude, I actually like her. Me living here should not equate to me funneling women for you to make advances on.""

""So, no? If you like her I won't."" 

""Yes, I like her. At least let me get my rejection in before you wipe away everything I was working on.""

So he agreed he wouldn't. Or course you know where this is going and she came over on a weeknight anyway to see us both I guess. She insisted this was plans for all of us. My roomie said he wouldn't try and sleep with her. I went to bed stupidly at 2:30am on a work night. I knew neither of them would take the couch. They start speaking in another language (native to them) and I hear words like ""sex"" being thrown around. He's basically asking her if she ever did with what kind of guys etc. It goes quiet, I fall asleep and of course when I wake up her stuff is there and she is in his room. 

I messaged him an angry emoji. That was about it. He didn't apologize, not even sure if he has anything to be sorry about. He used a girl I liked for a quick lay and now I don't even want to bring girls over anymore. Do I have a right to be upset? I mean I feel upset. But is is rational to be angry at him? I'm more just upset he was successful to whisk away a quick bang with a case of mouth herpes. Like how confident do you have to be to make that even happen!? He just says not to be mad at him it just happened. It didn't ""just"" happen. Sigh. I cant expect to bring home sheep if he's a wolf. I'm just tryna get a relationship started.

153,"For some background, I am 17 and my sister in the story is 19. Let me preface this By saying I know what I did was extremely wrong but I don‚Äôt know how to go about dealing with the situation. So I have a spending addiction. From the moment I turned 16, I got a part-time job at a fast food company;now this was something life-changing because previously I have never had any means to buy any materialistic items or have spending money. Growing up, I didn‚Äôt have a lot of what my peers had because I come from a single mother household, given I‚Äôve never been deprived of necessities such as school items, housing,food, etc. but I never had any latest items such as electronics, fancy clothes or anything materialistic. It all changed when I got my own source of income and developed a spending habit. Everything was fine until I was asked to resign after an ankle injury in October. As I could no longer work as efficiently as I did before because I had to take breaks or sit down for a little bit because of my ankle. I was still earning a bit of an income due to selling/ ghost writing academic essays for my peers, but I was still living as if I had a bigger income. I dipped into my savings and ended up spending almost all of my money. Now here‚Äôs the part where all went wrong, my sister uses my Amazon prime account as I had three months paid so naturally she saved her card information on my account, and I accidentally used her card to buy a $20 item but didn‚Äôt realize it until the item came in. I put $20 back in her wallet but never told her that I used her card. Now I know what I did here is wrong but I don‚Äôt know how to confess to her but I continued to use her card for small purchases under the basis that I told myself that I was going to pay her back. It led To me racking up $317 in purchases on her card. Now I slowly started paying her back with my essay money and paid her back $50 into her wallet, I never commented any of what I was doing to her. My sister works at a higher paying job and has over $4000 in her checking‚Äôs and $16,000 in her savings. She never checks her banking statements as she uses a credit card and has all her bills on auto pay including her credit card. So she never noticed my spending on her money until today after she went to the bank and reported the strange activity. No I feel extremely guilty and was actually going to talk to her about a repayment plan but the bank started a fraud investigation. I was going to talk to her tonight after her night job and I had wrote a statement that I will pay her back and she could hold me accountable to the bank for my actions but she had already gone to the bank to get The matter investigated. I don‚Äôt know how to approach her and talk to her now but I really want to apologize to her and to pay her back every dime of what I spent because I start a new job on Thursday. I don‚Äôt know how the banks investigation is going to turn out but I feel so guilty. I need to Confessed to my sister about what I had done into
confessed to my sister about what I had done and to stop with my spending habit. Can anyone help me as what I should do so that I can be held accountable with the bank Such as them automatically taking out money from my account once I get paid from my job and it gets put into her account? Is there a such thing? But ultimately I really want to talk to my sister on a serious note and apologize about the whole situation because I truly feel awful that I let my addiction come to this. I want to work this out and to mend my relationship with my sister after I confess of my wrongdoings. I currently owe her about $265 that I spent on her card. how can I start the conversation with my sister? I need help and I‚Äôve take a step by cancelling my card and deleting amazon and all apps that i spent money on.",17Mar2020,1

I'm 24 year old, college drop out NEET who's recently moved to another city for the purpose of pushing my life into right direction. I started therapy and im taking meds. I pretty much pushed away all my friends or they pushed me away when they found out of one of my issues. All my friends (well, 98% of them) are internet friends i met online. I dropped college (computer science) because of depression. Twice. I was aspiring to be a programmer, and tried to learn a bit after dropping college but i just found out that im forcing myself to learn it, and after three attempts i think i've had enough. My last 5 years were the years where i focused on dealing with my health issues, or atleast alleviating them, but didnt really look up that much into my career. My mother thankfully does her best to support me and pay for my every need, though i have in mind that makes me lazy. Going to a job, and that is any job, has failed due to social anxiety. Yes, i've never worked in my life and I'm somehow anxious of doing it. I've had several hobbies. Thing is i never really stick to them for long. Games, latte art, butterfly knives, etc. but i never really mastered any of it, nor had any long lasting pleasure of doing. I'm a frequent MMORPG player and thats basically the main thing i do all day since i can remember. But i'm just decent, not even average, even though i spend whole day playing games. Nothing satisfies me. Whenever i try something new I'm discouraged really fast. Due to my health issues being quite under control now, i can do all the task a healthy person can. However if my financial situation gets worse, i may not be able to. And that includes job or career i will be pursuing. So i have to keep in mind that the best career for me would be the one that will not require me to leave home.

We currently have a kid on the way, and there has been many dramatic changes in just the past few months. But the issue is that I believe her father has a serious problem with me. He is a middle-aged man and a vet and most of the time he is really quiet and to himself. Although today was very shocking for the lack of better words. I see myself as a very nice and relaxed person and I constantly greet and like to talk although her father sits on the opposite side of that. But the issue is that today when I had bumped into him, I tried stirring up a small convo, he seemed reluctant. Although as he proceeded to leave the current room we were in he had then made a comment to me saying that I should not spook him, or else he might accidentally stab me in the neck with a kitchen knife.

I had donated to probably ten or twelve over the years (before the universe vomited suckage all over us and we went from comfortable to poverty stricken) and somehow I didn‚Äôt have a problem with them but having made one myself fills me with shame. Like,  ‚Äúbeing featured on people of Walmart‚Äù shame. 

I haven‚Äôt shared it anywhere yet. They recommend sharing to Facebook. I am scared to do it until I know I‚Äôm not going to totally embarrass myself. I worked really hard on it but when I go back and read it I come off as whiny. I tried to be factual but also inject feeling. But the facts suck, and I FEEL desperate and terrified and I think that made me sound too frantic and just kept me from having the right tone. 

I‚Äôm going to paste what I wrote below and ask for honest critiques and suggestions. I am not posting the link because I don‚Äôt want anyone to think this was a backdoor attempt at soliciting donors. 


Here is what I wrote. I did remove the photo captions since of course the photos won‚Äôt show here.

Be honest but please don‚Äôt be mean. Sorry it‚Äôs a damn novel. A lot has happened since December 2018.

Title: Help for veteran &amp; family grieving 
Goal: $2,500


I am not really sure what to say except that the last 18 months have had more heartache and chaos than I would have thought could occur in a hundred years.    On December 4, 2018 we lost our only child. Our perfectly healthy baby boy died from a cord accident the night before my due date. The months following were just...hell. My husband is an amazing man. He is a USMC Veteran (Alpha company 1/4 raider) and even on the days where he shook from his own sobs, he held me up. Literally. He is just incredible and the way he still loves and represents and talks to our son makes me feel lucky every day, even with all that has happened.    

Shortly after our son Rigel passed, I began dealing with a recurrence of a tumor I had previously fought twice. I had done multiple course of interferon chemotherapy and two surgeries. I am now in treatment again and it has kept me from working. My husband went back to work four months after our son died. We were so behind financially but we knew if he worked six days a week we could catch up by the end of 2019.    

Less than a month after returning to work, he broke a vertebral bone and was rendered unable to work himself. Thank goodness we live in a state where we were able to go on Medicaid and he has been able to pursue the intensive physical therapy. It has taken more than eight months for him to be in shape to work again but he finally is. Although he wants to be able to stay with me during treatment, he knows we won‚Äôt make it without him working.    

He was supposed to go back to work Monday, March 16. However, the coronavirus brouhaha has now pushed that back indefinitely. We are hoping it won‚Äôt be too long. But as of now, we can‚Äôt pay our upcoming rent and we are in danger of losing our storage unit where we owe $349 (3 months plus late fees). All of our son‚Äôs things are in there and we have begged them to remove the red lock so we can get our baby‚Äôs things out but they say they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù until we pay the past due bill. 

We also are so behind on utilities and other bills. Our apartment complex charges a $15 late fee per day and we have been accruing that while we can‚Äôt afford to pay the $70 monthly utility fee for water and trash removal. We owe it for the last two months.    

I am setting the goal to catch up on these bills and cover the $1125.00 rent for April. I am hoping by that time the quarantines and things will be over and my husband can go back to work.    

I‚Äôm happy to provide information on the places I mentioned that we are so behind on bills with. The apartment complex company is Four Walls LLC and the storage company is AAA King Self Storage in Greeley, CO. Excel Energy is the utility company. (Electric is a separate utility bill from the ‚Äúutilities‚Äù the apartment charges for) AT&amp;T is where I owe $39 for cell phone service which will be turned off tomorrow (3/17) for lack of payment. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.",17Mar2020,1
193,"Before my school closed for two weeks, I got a phone call saying to NOT expect the schools to close. Everyone of my teachers told us to not expect my school to close, so I thought it wouldn't be a problem if I left them at school.

Fast forward 2 days and schools are closed for the next 2 weeks and I need my books for google classroom. I know there is a teacher meeting at the school, which is tomorrow, but idk if they'll let me in. I just need some advice on what to do.

194,"Hi so I've been drawning since I was really young and it was a lot of fun
When I was 11 I got my first drawing tablet for my birthday it was an old wacom one
And I abused the hell out of that thing

Before I got that I used to draw on paper/ with a mouse
I obviously sucked tho

After I got the tablet I decided to improve and later at age 14 my mom bought me a huion 19.5 inch drawing monitor (im 15 now) 

I loved to draw on it and even finished a little animation project a month ago.

I've wanted to have a job where I can draw and design all I want, but there are no educations for that any where near where I am.

AND since I've figure out that I can't study art my passion for it is completely gone.

And. I don't want this pretty expensive tablet to not be used anymore, but other stuff has been overtaking my life, like school and because of that I only play video games instead of drawing to relieve all the stress 

I want to draw but I can't make myself do it.
What should I do I'm so confused 
I'm not sure if I should regret getting into art
Or whatever 
This is confusing me

I guess I just made this post to vent myself a little

Sorry if it's incomprehensible",17Mar2020,1

196,"Hello.

I‚Äôm a 26-year-old guy with some issues. I have my education and I have my social circle, but I have worries. So about 3 years ago, I committed what is actually considered a crime in the U.S.: after a night of heavy/binge drinking with an aunt who is my age and my cousin (male), I decided to act on an impulsive desire to have sexual intercourse with my aunt by deceptively asking her to help me use the restroom when we arrived at my cousin‚Äôs apartment at the end of our night. She entered the restroom, and because I was visibly inebriated, she did assist unbuckling my belt and pants. I allowed my genitals to be exposed and asked for further ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. She looked away and said ‚ÄúNo, bitch!‚Äù in the familiarly jovially insulting tone we usually that would call each other that.

I have apologized twice since this happened. Once about 6 months after this occurred (would have been sooner but we lived in different states). The second time was more recently - a few months ago. We‚Äôre now living in the same house which is my grandparents home, and the home where I was raised during my teenage years. This second apology was more due to the ultimate reason for me making this post, which is my guilt and the feeling that my decision 3 years ago caused an insurmountable fracture to the relationship between her and myself.

I am currently unemployed and job searching. I am trying to find the opportunity that requires my bachelor‚Äôs degree in mechanical engineering and, more abstractly, would be possible with the emotional support system here at my grandparents‚Äô home (where another aunt and her husband and two daughters, an uncle, my dad, my grandparents, and the mentioned aunt also live).

So my dilemma is just this: do you find that my act warrants me reluctantly moving from this house? I have created immense tension in this house amongst everyone who resides here due to my behavior as this preoccupied person that I‚Äôve become. I can‚Äôt achieve inner acceptance about these circumstances because I don‚Äôt think I should.

As for how my aunt has reacted to me moving into this house about a year ago, I believe that she is slightly bothered. It‚Äôs not ideal that I did what I did. She will never forget what I did. But I do think she has forgiven it. It‚Äôs simply that I don‚Äôt think the relationship is the same, and I might be lying by saying she has forgiven me. I can‚Äôt even forgive my cousin for starting to date my ex soon after I broke up with her about 3 and a half years ago.

Thank you for reading so far. Should I move to another family member or friends place and start life again there without the ideal support I find and my current house? I can‚Äôt really overstate how superior the environment at this house is compared to my other choices. My friend has a job that I could join him at in a position that does not require a bachelor‚Äôs and is in the electrical field and is located in a city 3 hours from my grandparents‚Äô home, and 9 hours from other family I need to see often. That family is the other group of people who I could live with - about 6 hours from my current residence. I would need to continue my job search with less emotional support and more responsibilities at that home considering I would need to be big brother while my and my three younger sisters‚Äô mother is in prison.

Typing this is definitely helping me understand how my responsibilities might not be as heavy as I am thinking. So, again, thank you for reading. Where should I stay? Do I have the right to stay at my grandparents‚Äô house where my aunt lives? Any insight would help!",17Mar2020,1
197,"So, I am an attractive and well-rounded guy, and am consistently putting myself out there via online and in person, but no one ever seems interested in going on dates... like at all. Humbly speaking, I am good in the looks department, I take care of myself, I am educated, I am emotionally and socially intelligent, etc. I am not aware of where people may be deterred from wanting to get to know me... everything just seems so shallow when I‚Äôm talking to or meeting people. If I do meet someone and they show interest, they seem to be over it very quickly.

How do I go about actually fostering an opportunity to know someone better? And what are some things I could assess on my end?

Additional relevant points: Gay culture is straight hook up culture x10, but I refuse to believe that it is so bad that no one is going on dates or wanting to find connections. Please no comments about my age, I have hooked up enough to know I want something more, and I am generally interested in older. Currently, I use Grindr, Tinder, and go out frequently. And although this post may come off eager, I am already careful about presenting myself as too accessible or too overt when talking to someone, because I know that‚Äôs a turn off.

202,"So basically, it feels like my life has gone from honestly pretty great, to just straight up shit in a matter of days. With everything going on in the world right now, I‚Äôm feeling really shitty.

Last week, I was a really happy guy, I woke up in the morning, I was excited to get to school and see my friends. Mostly I was excited to see this girl, who I‚Äôm not really dating yet but kinda am (I‚Äôll get into that later). I had a good relationship with my family members, enjoyed my hobbies, I was getting somewhere with that same girl, and overall felt pretty good. 

The main cause of all my problems is the Corona Virus outbreak honestly. Before it, I was able to go to my school, and see friends who live far away, and got to hang out w the girl of my dreams every day and had no worries at all.

Even after the outbreak I was still happy, it wasn‚Äôt that big of a threat yet. The last time I felt happy was when that girl was in my bed cuddling, rubbing up on me and just talking, which happened the day before yesterday. I felt really good still, in fact, I was hyped to have school be canceled for a little bit to just relax and unwind. My mental state immediately dropped yesterday. I woke up to more news about the virus, I saw my parents stocking up like it was the apocalypse. This gave me a lot of anxiety, but on top of that, it seemed like the girl was mad at me/annoyed abt something. Our texts have been dry lately and we don‚Äôt talk for hours at a time, even though we used to talk literally from sunrise til we fell asleep. I‚Äôm bored out of my mind staying at home. Cycling through the same process: Watching a YouTube video, then reading the news about the virus, then opening up Snapchat, thinking of something to message her, not able to think of anything, repeat. I‚Äôm having a lot of anxiety about the virus, but having added stress about her isn‚Äôt helping. 

Here‚Äôs some background about me and this girl:
We were good friends, then we both told each other we had feelings for each other about 2-3 months ago. She didn‚Äôt want to get into a relationship at first, was afraid of damaging our friendship, then kissed me and started to get sexually intimate and was ready for a relationship, but we still haven‚Äôt started dating. Now I‚Äôm starting to think she‚Äôs feeling conflicted about what‚Äôs going on with us. 

I messaged her today, asked her if everything was fine with her and she responded ‚Äúidk I‚Äôm stressed idk why, I don‚Äôt really know what to do about a lot of the areas of my life, and I feel one way, but I do something different, and what I want and what I need dont seem to coincide, and there‚Äôs decisions I need to make and no matter what I decide someone‚Äôs gonna be mad at me, idk hopefully I calm down soon‚Äù I can‚Äôt really read whether I‚Äôm involved in any of that. 

Idk I‚Äôm feeling like my life has no purpose/ no goal/ there‚Äôs no advancement to be made and I see no point in being here or making any effort to do anything. Any general advice helps, thanks :|",17Mar2020,1
203,"Context: Younger sister (16) keeps bringing her boyfriend to our house over our break from school. My mom works 14 hours most days (7am-11pm) and whenever shes home, he hides in MY closet, since my sister and mom share a room, and me and my younger brother share another room(we live in a 2 bedroom apartment). However whenever he's here, they're INSANELY reckless and have almost been caught on multiple occasions, and I know they're bound to be caught. My sister doesn't care about her consequences, but I know that I'll DEFINITELY face some harsh ones cause I have a really strict mom and I'm supposed to be protective of my sister.",17Mar2020,1
204,"My wife has post partem, I've been repeatedly told a number of more colorful outbursts that I dislike is normal and how some women process the stressors, but my limit was reached.

My wife was trying to change the baby while he kept squirming, I heard her hit the wall above him, yell, and curse at him. I came to his room to switchout with her and she had her hands around his face with her face pressed into his telling him she needs him to listen to her and help her.

I pushed her away from him and took the baby. She stood behind me crying the whole time telling me I don't need to check the baby she wouldn't hurt him.

I don't feel she understands he is his only little person with ideas and wants and he doesn't understand us. She thinks of him as a doll who should just do what we want him to do.

I get told by too many people though that children are huge stressors and they drive their moms crazy and every parents get angrier with their baby than they want. But I'm ready to call bullshit, this is seeming more and more like women not taking responsibility and giving too much leeway bc some sister power. No one ever wants to hold a woman responsible, it's always some outside force or terrible state of being that is put upon women.

I took today off and am scared to go back to work. I have a great work situation now, I wouldn't hesitate to give it up for the safety of my child, but I have it in the back of my head how normal I'be been told this is. Is this just women being too understanding of other women (her counselor is a woman) or is it really harmless?",17Mar2020,1

206,"Hello, I need some advice. I am in recovery from an eating disorder and also have a severe GI disorder (ulcerative colitis), therefore I have to eat smaller portions and try to eat as much as I can. My parents are both overweight and I am underweight, but I constantly feel an intense and overwhelming pressure to eat. I used to be completely devoid of any hunger or fullness cues, but they have began to return and sometimes I am able to finish my portion of food and other times I get full and therefore stop before reaching physical discomfort. Lately, this seems to be upsetting them and they are kind of making me uncomfortable with the intense pressure. For example, this morning my dad and I were having breakfast. He can easily eat 4 eggs, 3 pieces of thick bacon, and two toasts. Where as by 2 eggs and bacon and one slice of toast, I am very full. This morning I ate most of my food but left over some eggs because my stomach felt full so I stopped and he tried to pressure me to finish them even though my stomach was pretty uncomfortable, but I said no and he let it go. We relaxed most of the day and he is not a big snacker. He usually will eat 2 pretty large meals and some dessert or chips towards the evening after dinner, closer to midnight, where as I always have a mid day snack while I do my schoolwork and it keeps me really full. If I skipped this snack, I'd be able to have more room for a dessert after dinner but by mid-afternoon I feel hungry again since I'm working, and if I wait until dinner to eat anything I won't feel well at all. So a few hours later I had some granola with almond milk while I did my schoolwork, than I relaxed for a while before dinner. For dinner I had some pasta, a garlic biscuit, and roasted vegetables and felt extremely full so after dinner I got in bed and figured I would relax for the evening and maybe take a bath. Today was his birthday and we had a great day, but he was also full after dinner and my mom was not so she wanted some cake. We sang happy birthday and all that jazz and he said he was a bit too full for any cake right then and that he may have some tomorrow but that he was so grateful etc, and then my mom got very angry at me for not wanting any cake either. It was not a custom cake or anything just a little snack cake and my stomach is so full from dinner that i feel bloated and really need to rest or ill get nauseous and throw up from fullness. She began pressuring me intensely to eat cake and asked why i was full and i said i had some cereal just 2 hours or so before dinner so I wasn't terribly hungry but had some room for dinner. This happens often in my house. She works all day and I eat when she's at work obviously yet she expects me to eat like all double meals when she gets home at like 8-9 pm. I cant eat all of my food between 8 pm everyday and expect to function enough to go out and do anything. How do i address these pressures and how they are really getting to me? I am 21 btw and not a child. I always feel in social situations I am being rushed to eat or told how to and it makes it very hard for me to use the skills ive learned in therapy about how to eat mindfully and feel safe while doing so.

208,"So with the COVID-19 being a thing I have come to the realization that if I stay home I will be at greater risk than going back to my college dorm for isolated online learning.


At college each of the dorms are split up into gendered sections. Each section has their own bathroom and gives people the ability to close off the sections with doors. This makes quarantine easy as we can just close the doors and tell people to stay in/out.

I have my meals paid for there so food is not an issue.

My roommate also left to go home for the rest of the year meaning I would be alone in a room and not be in constant contact with a second person.

Half if not more of my schools population is just gone.


At home I am absolutely screwed.

My mother is a nurse. She has one job that will allow remote work but she has another job that is pretty much freelance work where they can call her for a temp job and she can go do it. She has outright told my dad that she would take jobs at high risk areas.

While she doesn't live with us she is here 4/6 times a week (pickup and drop off 2 days a week and every other weekend she takes them for the weekend) because she has partial custody of my younger siblings. She and I have a bad relationship so I avoid her at all costs.

One of my siblings is young and touchy and the other is a ""rebellious teen"" who doesn't like to wash his hands.

My mother likes to take them around town and seeing that they are still doing sports as long as they are open and my mother is going around to bakeries and shopping with them... it's not a good sign. I believe that she is very likely to at least become a carrier and my brothers would be likely to get it from her if someone in my family were to get it.

I live in a 6 person household with a senior who would have bad odds if they were to get it

My dad is also getting snappy at me. We never had a great relationship for the past couple of years and he is trying to keep me here because ""health over friends and school"" when in reality it's a selfish attempt to keep the family together.

If he falls back into taking his anger out on me verbally again I am worried that I would get stressed enough for my immune system to tank making me more likely to get the virus if it comes into this house.


My family has made the realization that my mother is most likely to get it, infect us, and if one of us gets it we are all going down since we live in a space where we HAVE to see each other daily. Even with that my dad is only giving me a maybe on me going back even though it would bump the household number down to 5 and I can have a better chance of not getting infected.


I don't have a car but my boyfriend is offering to drive me back if needed. I am 100% going back. I can have my health, education, and friends if I go back but I would be lucky to even have my health if I stay home. I know that no matter what it would be best for my boyfriend to get me since it would at least stop a 45 minute fight about how I'm ""selfish and stupid"" for leaving the family. But I would also prefer to not have a fight at home so my stress levels don't get high enough for it to become more likely to get sick.",17Mar2020,1
210,"Hello Guys. I'm 22 and took 100microg. Lsd and 200microg LSD 2 hours later yesterday for the 2nd time. I felt great and learned many things, felt reborn and healed while watching the plants in the garden while listening to FKA twigs and later on joined a ts server where my best friend of 5 years and my 2nd best friend of one year were playing borderlands. We often diss each other even tho I stopped since I feel like its childish and since I'm a looser struggling with uni and alcoholic parents whilst my 2nd best friend does well and my pal finnished tradeschool and is flexing with his money. I told my uni pal to not bring up university since I was heavily tripping but after 3 hours they started to joke about it saying I'm failing, i'm shit and have nothing going for me, then saying i'm crying for sure after i went silent (i cry often when drunk due to my situation so they knew I'm sensitive to that on substances). That fucking minute turned my whole trip into a nightmare with me crying, raging and feeling empty and lost like never before off ts for like 6 hours + a restless night. I didn't see them as my friends but as my enemies or at least competition even tho I know they were joking whilst they knew I was hard on acid + they knew how easily bad trips can happen. I'm still shocked even if they mog me outta fun 24/7 for it. I babysitted my college pal when he was hella drunk and even coped with him summing up my whole shit life to provoke me/make me sad and i once slept on the bottom of my own bedroom since there was only place for 2 on my bed when we all drank and yet they didn't care about my wellbeing. I dont know how to react. My uni pal disses me quite often and my other pal is just flexing, talking about his new car or some girls or doing kratom, alcohol, tilidin or coke apparently. They often offered me help but I still feel hurt with their ""bro just dont give a damn lol""-solution to me feeling lost and burnt out while my parents get drunk into fistfights like 2 times/week. I dont know what to feel or what to do. I still feel empty, lost and lonely after that bungeejump of a depressive episode Especially my best pal bothers me since he has changed in my eyes extremely since his flex.

We were good friends, then we both told each other we had feelings for each other about 2-3 months ago. She didn‚Äôt want to get into a relationship at first, was afraid of damaging our friendship, then kissed me and started to get sexually intimate and was ready for a relationship, but we still haven‚Äôt started dating. Now I‚Äôm starting to think she‚Äôs feeling conflicted about what‚Äôs going on with us. 

I messaged her today, asked her if everything was fine with her and she responded ‚Äúidk I‚Äôm stressed idk why, I don‚Äôt really know what to do about a lot of the areas of my life, and I feel one way, but I do something different, and what I want and what I need dont seem to coincide, and there‚Äôs decisions I need to make and no matter what I decide someone‚Äôs gonna be mad at me, idk hopefully I calm down soon‚Äù I can‚Äôt really read whether I‚Äôm involved in any of that. 

Idk I‚Äôm feeling like my life has no purpose/ no goal/ there‚Äôs no advancement to be made and I see no point in being here or making any effort to do anything. Any general advice helps, thanks :|",17Mar2020,1

I then proceed to ask if he shouldn't be quarantined as I'm aware some of my colleagues live and have close relationship with people in the high risk groups. school staff then tell me it should be alright because he has not shown any symptoms so far and that his wife is a doctor (like wtf), which I replied saying that in some cases the symptoms take more than a week the be apparent and for this reason I don't think it's a responsible move to go on with the classes.

222,"Hey all! Hope your day/Night is good so far üòä Anyways, My mother sadly ended up with cancer, and she is still recovering, getting injections and therapy the whole 9 yards, however. She was on EI for a year and 3 months (Till recently, March 6th) 

My anger is directed toward the fact that she HAD to start work again, due too the insurance company or whatever you call them who deal with sick leave etc saying she is ""Well enough to go back to work"" Even though her personal doctor recommends she fully recovers, but honestly... Corona virus in Canada is just starting to spread and where we live there have been at least 7 cases in the small valley we live in, and I'm worried my mother may contract the virus, she still has a compromised immune system, but as stated above, the place she works for, their health team (I don't know what they're called) say she is well enough to work ... But it doesn't make sense why they want her to work, even though the corona virus is around and she has a chance of catching it, which could become fatal. Do ya'll understand what I mean? 

Now, We have a few people supporting the house currently, My brother, my step dad and myself. However I don't think that is enough to keep the bills paid, as my brother will be moving out soon. I want to talk to my mother about her possibly leaving the place she works and stay off work for awhile till she's gets the OK to go back to work from her doctor not the health people at the place she works at.

 I can't stress enough how stressful it is know that a company (VERY Large company) pretty much doesn't give 2 fucks about someone's Heath and the possibility of fatality. 

So I guess what I'm trying to say is,  what do ya'll recommend?

235,"Hello all, 

In 10 days time my MIL is having an non-emergent operation. This is being held at Stanford in Palo Alto (Bay Area). Given the COVID-19 it‚Äôs clear she is in the highest risk group (over 60, heart condition, decreased lung capacity, and undergoing cancer treatments). Nonetheless, her surgeon decided to proceed with the operation this afternoon. Unfazed by the shelter in place for the region, or the fact that most hospitals are bracing for the worst. 

Unfortunately my wife and myself are stuck in Canada. No safe way to travel and be assured we can return home. Therefore we can‚Äôt attend the high risk operation. Even if we were able to leave the risk of transmitting something to her is too great. Naturally this is weighing on us emotionally and mentally. My wife however has all but ceased fighting to prevent this. Mentally at whits end it feels like reasoning with a brick wall. 

My question to you all is: to what extent do we try to stop this from occurring? I‚Äôm of the opinion that a parent taking an unprecedented and unnecessary level of risk is unfair on the child. Regardless of said child‚Äôs age. Is this a fair statement? Nonetheless my MIL doesn‚Äôt seem to grasp the severity of the situation around COVID and likewise the emotional toll she is placing on her daughter who is trapped some 6000 km away. God forbid anything happens and there is no way to act or really do anything up here, this far away. 

Yes I admit MIL quality of life is mildly diminished. But is it a far assessment to say she is being selfish here? I couldn‚Äôt imaging undertaking such a risk in these times without my child present or even in general when this much risk is present. Furthermore I feel that she is putting my SIL at risk (by making her de facto obligated to travel to the hospital). Along with all the quasi supportive family members that will need to be of assistance here. 

Thanks all in advance.",17Mar2020,1
236,"I've (23f) always been playful and goofy in my relationships I've been dating my partner (26m) for over a year now and I feel very limited to how I can act / what I can say.

Eg : 
-Can't play punch buggy because in his head it means I have hidden intentions / thoughts of hurting him intentionally.
-Can't talk loudly or I'm yelling. 
-Basically any time he thinks I'm upset he's buried it into his head that I'm truly upset despite me never saying I'm upset and I have to convince him that I'm not upset. 

I've made strides to becoming a better partner but now I've been told that I am harmful because instead of talking things out I apparently pretend that everything is okay and move on with my day and it damages the relationship because I'm not taking his feelings into consideration; I don't see when I do this he points it out days later despite us both deciding to talk things out when they're happening or if it is something it'll be something I think is dumb or unnecessary to talk about.

238,"Hey reddit. Created a throwaway account for this. I'm not sure what I'm hoping to get out of this, but if there is anyone out there that can offer advice, I would love to hear. I'm very confused.


Me and my ex-girlfriend were very deeply in love with each other. I don't think either of us had ever met someone that we were so compatible with, we have so much in common, similar interests, similar ways of thinking and approaching the world. We're both ambitious and have very similar values, similar sense of humour. We both made each other laugh, and think. I loved her for both her flaws and her features, and she made me so happy, and I know that I did for her for a long time too. Neither of us had met someone like the other before, and tbh for both of us it seemed like fate.


Since I was fairly young, maybe 15-16, I have battled with depression. It is in my family. I didn't cope with with well for a long time, self-medicating for it and basically not doing much to help myself. I started a new antidepressant two years ago, and for me it was like a miracle. In the year after that, I started seeing this woman, and I fell so in love. She made me so happy. I just love her so much.


I started a new graduate job last February, while she was still enjoying her post-uni gap year. So for a year, I was working full-time while she was figuring out what to do. She struggled a bit that year with figuring out what she wanted to do, and I tried my best to support her through it. Eventually she landed a graduate job which started the most recent February.


About 6 months ago, I didn't realise it at the time, but my symptoms of depression started to come back. It was hard for her, and I didn't see. My depression made me blind to it. I would get non-talkative, and withdrawn, and she found it really hard to cope with it. I wasn't exercising, or doing anything much to help me, which made it worse. About a month and a bit ago, she finally tells me she's had enough, and that she needs a break. Over that week, I did some really deep self-reflecting, and came up with a plan to address my depression and address how our communication had been suffering. I felt really optimistic after this, because I felt empowered to actually change. I signed up to the gym, stopped drinking, started therapy, started reading more, basically anything I could think of that would help. I saw her the Saturday of that week, and shared my plan with her. I still love her unconditionally. We had a nice enough day, and read our books in the park for a bit, had breakfast, then parted ways. She said she still needed more space, and I respected that.


We saw each other the week after. She asked me for more details about my plan. I said, I'm going to therapy weekly, I'm going to the gym 3-4 times a week, I'm not drinking anymore because it ruins my sleep, I'm waking up earlier, I've started a mood tracker and a journal. She got really upset. I asked why. She said that she just hoped ""I would have thought about it more.""


We ended up having a nice day after that regardless. We went back to hers, I made her tea, then I made her about a months worth of food that she can defrost for work. We made plans to see a movie that week, we talked intimately about our futures, she asked me intimate questions. I fully trusted her, and felt completely safe being vulnerable in front of her.


We started kissing, and then made love. Both of us have always been really clear with each other, that we can't make love with someone we don't love and trust. It was beautiful. Then we went for a drive and listened to Tame Impala's newest album, our favourite band for which we have tickets to see in a month. We woke up the next day, read our books in bed, and she made me tea. I had plans to play squash with my dad that morning, so I had to go after a bit. Before I left, she just told me, btw, I'm still really confused. I say that's ok, I understand, but I love you, and I will be patient. I go play squash, and comeback after to two missed calls from her. I called her back, and she broke up with me over the phone.
She said once I left, she just felt really bad, and felt like she needed to end it.


I told her I can't break up such a serious and special relationship over the phone, do you mind if I drive over. She said sure.
So I drove over in a state of shock and panic, and we spoke for maybe 20 minutes in person. She didn't really offer any more explanation that the vague answer of ""once you left, I just felt really bad"". I still feel no sense of closure.


I wrote and sent her a note last week. It basically said, look, I am sorry that my bad headspace affected you and made you feel anxious and distressed. I never meant to hurt you, but I did and I am sorry. I didn't realise how bad my head was, and there was so much I should have been doing to prevent it, but at the time I felt powerless to do so. However, since then, these are all of the things that I have been doing to get into better physical and mental shape, and they have been working.


She finally responded to it today. She basically said: 

1) Thank you for the letter, it was a really kind and sweet gesture and I appreciate the thought and effort that went into it;

2) It doesn't change anything;

3) Can we organise a time to swap our belongings? The way she spoke on the phone was so pragmatic, cold and indifferent. It didn't sound at all like the person I know.

I told her that her having sex with me the day before then dumping me over the phone made me feel used... She said that she was sory that I felt that way, but that at the time, on that Saturday, she did actually really love me and trust me and want it to work, but that on the Sunday, about 12 hours later she didn't. How can that make sense?


So reddit, I will be seeing her this coming Saturday to swap our items. I am still in a state of shock and confusion. I would like some advice on a few things if anyone is able to offer it.

1) Does any of this make sense? Is there anyone that can decode this in a way in which her actions make sense?

2) Is it even worth asking her to explain the reason for breaking up with me? Is there even a reason?

3) Is there any use in me trying to save this? I go from feeling acceptance, to hope, to despair, and each transition brings a lot of pain. I love her unconditionally, and am convinced that we are a fantastic fit for each other.

4) If she said that she loved me and trusted me on that Saturday, but then on the Sunday she felt otherwise, how does that make sense? A part of me feels like she still loves me, but is just really emotionally confused herself and made a drastic choice to just end it as a bandaid solution to her pain.

I don't know what to do. I love her so much reddit, I love her so much...

If anyone needs more details, please ask, I wrote this fast and am sure I missed out on some stuff.

TL;DR Me (24/m) and exGF (24/F) loved each other intensely and shared a beautiful 14 months together, but my bad headspace made the last 4 months made it difficult for her. She gave me a chance to address it, and I did. But then she broke up with me anyway, over the phone... If anyone can make sense of this in a way that helps, I would deeply appreciate it. I am seeing her this Saturday to swap belongings, and I am not sure how to handle it. 

I want closure, but I also want to end this on a good note so that she has a positive memory of me. I am not sure if both are possible.",17Mar2020,1

246,"So to give some (obvious) back story. I was bullied from the 6th grade up until I graduated by the majority of my class. They pulled out all the stops including name-calling, insulting my mom who is disabled, trashing my stuff, putting paint/dead stuff in my hair, spilling stuff on me, insisting I needed to be in the special ed class because I struggled with math, got physically bullied etc. etc. You name it, they did it. I was tormented to the point where I tried to commit suicide on 4 separate occasions. I was a wreck in social situations and didn't speak for the last two years of high school. It was also a small town where everyone is related to everyone; the teachers wouldn't believe me or step in because "" I know so-and-so, they wouldn't do that"".  High school was literal hell and I cannot describe how relieved I felt to go to college where none of them were. 

Since that time I like to think I have grown into the person that I should have been a long time ago. I got two degrees in college and graduated with honors. I got involved with charity work, clubs and groups that I love. I met so many new friends. I lost a lot of weight. I met my now-husband and we have been married for two years. I was able to find my voice and start a fantastic career as a cake decorator!  It's taken a long time to recover from the torment but I have tried to put it behind me. The other night I got a Facebook message from one of my bullies and it reads as follows: 

&amp;#x200B;

"" Hey...I just wanted to apologize to you. I was a bully to you in school And I'm incredibly sorry for that.I think about it and you more times than you'd probably realize. I'm a better person now and I've grown so much in becoming a mother it's been my biggest blessing and I cannot imagine someone treating my little girls the way I did to you sometimes. I just wanted to say you are a beautiful woman with amazing talent. Always have been. It's totally okay if you don't respond either, I understand both ways. I've been going through some stuff and I needed to make amends with that part of myself. I love seeing your beautiful cakes."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to respond but I'm not sure what to say. One part of me acknowledges how much humility you need to apologize 10 years later and acknowledge you did wrong. I am glad they grew as a person. The other part of me is kind of amazed that it took them having kids to realize how awful they were. I feel like they are sincere but also that this apology is kind of for themselves... I'm not sure what to do and could use some input.

250,"I work at a 6 man powder coating shop in WA 20 miles out of Seattle. Last Monday, my coworker (call him Mack)didn‚Äôt come in Monday( last week)  due to throwing up. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it, it‚Äôs not a symptom of the virus going around from what I‚Äôve read. No biggie right?

Fast forward to Friday, I call out sick last minute, claiming that I‚Äôve thrown up on my way to work. I honestly was just incredibly tired, I hadn‚Äôt gotten more than 3 hour sleep every night the entire week and I just could barely keep my eyes open at this point. I work two jobs and would‚Äôve been looking at 14 hours of work that day, something I definitely couldn‚Äôt do. I still made it to my second job obviously. TLDR i lied about potentially catching the same stomach bug as Mack and took the day off at my main job. 

Enter Bob.
Bob is my bosses son, second in command and the boss when the big guy takes vacation or just time off in general. He took us both ‚Äúthrowing up‚Äù as a covid 19 risk and went to get tested. His significant other was scheduled for a surgery soon, and so he also got tested for the peace of mind and safety between them. I thought no way there was even a chance of him having the virus, since I lied about me being sick and puking isn‚Äôt a symptom.

Fast forward to today about 5pm. A group texts rings off to him receiving positive test results. I almost immediately have a panic attack, my SO has a weak immune system due to medication that she takes nightly. Yet when I come to think of it I haven‚Äôt had much of direct contact with Bob, he has sat in the front office the past few days that I can remember and I haven‚Äôt really came close to him at all. I‚Äôm getting tested tomorrow morning anyways. 

But please reddit, what else should I do? I‚Äôve told my father who works in a large building alongside many others, with whom I just gave a nice big hug on Saturday. He isn‚Äôt going to work until I get my results, good man. I don‚Äôt know whether to tell my other job (pizza delivery) with whom I also came into contact with both Friday and Saturday night. I believe I should. 

My boss still wants everyone else to come to work, we have customers coming daily to receive parts and drop off parts. They sign the same piece of paper as another coworker of mine, someone who more than likely had more contact with Bob. I think nobody should come to work. Bob said just avoid the office which was where bob primarily spends his day. That‚Äôd be possible if it wasn‚Äôt where the security system is, and the door that everyone arrives to work through. At least one person has to go through that office in the morning, and again at night. Big boss is out of town right now and Bob is quarantine himself for the next week.

If by chance I *dont* have the virus at this point, I sure as hell don‚Äôt want to go back into my main work until I know it has been cleaned and everyone has had their test results back. 

This is literally why these virus spread and my Big boss just said the real problem is we don‚Äôt have a vaccine, and that it‚Äôs nothing to be scared about really.

Mushy gay stuff aside, we have a sex life, but it's very sparse and stale. She very rarely experiences sexual urges and mostly just does things to make me happy, and usually just basic vanilla stuff. However, lately it's been feeling more and more like she just does not want to do anything sexual at all and it's really starting to get to me.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post if your curiosity lead you to my post. Im a 30 year old single male born and raised in a pretty expensive city with a stable job. However due to the crazy increase in real estate condos (forget houses lol) are really expensive. A simple 450 sq ft condo pre-sale are in the $400-500k range now and used condos around 500 sq ft are about $400k-ish but very scarce. Forecasting the monthly spendings/expenses (such as mortgage, home insurance, TV, water, electric, property tax, strata fee, etc) on single income is tight to none. My bring home is about $60k before taxes. A huge part of me is saying its time to grow up and start adulting. Even with $100k down these cost of condos are still very expensive. 

My parents have offered to build a laneway/backlane home but due to our home it can only be 1 floor (ground level) around 300 sq ft at about $200k. The spacing is VERY tight and doesnt seem worth the money to make my parents give up the backyard for such a tiny hut. Their 2nd option was to rebuild our downstairs into a 1 floor unit for me to live in completely separate entrances so itll be like we dont live together but under the same roof. I feel really bad about this because they finally paid off their home and I dont feel like I have any right to take half the house away from them for my own living. I also feel like living alone means somewhat away and not under the same roof.

I've thought about buying a place with a buddy and just splitting it as roomies just to get our feet into the real estate market but most of my close friends have had parents buy them places or have GFs they now live with.

So my housemate [48M] who lives upstairs offered me a joint. Cool right? Wrong. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking this because I just smoked but I‚Äôm concerned he gave me weed just to alter my suggestibility or make me feel like I owe him. Here‚Äôs how:

He goes on about ‚Äúoh what if we get quarantined or whatever...‚Äù

Then he goes on about how we ‚Äòneed a garden‚Äô and ‚Äòeverybody needs to help‚Äô. Okay? What is he going to do if I say no? 

I was so dumbfounded by him saying:

‚ÄúOh you need to do a little more than breathe around here.‚Äù

So I said ‚Äò*really?*‚Äô and asked him what he meant to think of something to say. He told me ‚Äònot to play dumb‚Äô or whatever. He also mocked me when I said ‚Äòhmm‚Äô or ‚Äòuhh‚Äô as I was thinking. In fact I was thinking they have no business telling me what to do.

Then my brother said I will be ‚Äòeliminated‚Äô if I don‚Äôt obey him or whatever the hell he said. Then he called my mom and complained about me... he‚Äôs almost 30 years old. Pathetic and absurd!

1. There‚Äôs no lease and the landlord just verbally said they could live there. I‚Äôm assuming they have absolutely no authority telling me what to do?

2. Their argument was because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äònow the lawn‚Äô or ‚Äòplow the snow‚Äô I allegedly ‚Äòdon‚Äôt do anything‚Äô which is funny because the housemate and I are the only ones who do the trash.

285,"Due to all the unforeseen circumstances surrounding this past week and month, my sister's college had just announced the following:

""We have made the difficult decision to cancel spring graduation ceremonies. We are working on alternate plans to allow our spring graduates a chance to celebrate their commencement in the future and will solicit feedback and share plans as soon as we are able.""

I know a lot of universities in the US will soon follow suit or have already made the same decision. So here's my question:

What do you think should be done to amend this extremely unfortunate but mostly unavoidable situation? What should universities (or high schools as well) do to allow the 2020 grads to celebrate that will be as close to normal as possible? I know a lot of them were so looking forward to their ceremonies. I'm asking to see if a good solution arises among any of the answers that I may be able to suggest to my university (who will probably cancel their ceremony soon as well) or my sister's university. And perhaps others are looking for ideas as well.

289,"A few months ago I went to visit 2 friends for a couple nights of going out, we rented one room with a double bed just to save money. During the first night we ran into someone we used to know. This person continued to subtly hit on me through the night to which I made it clear each time I was not interested.

A few hours later we got kicked out of the club as one of my friends was too drunk. We all were, I cannot remember about 70% of the night. So what I am writing are the bits I can recall. Anyway we went back to our room and just spoke for a bit, all pretty much blind drunk as we can‚Äôt remember exactly what we did.

Sometime later the person we sort of knew came over (sober) as my friend had invited them. I remember walking out to the kitchen and this person had followed me and tried to kiss me again, to which I again said no as I am in a relationship. Sometime later this person went and pretended to be asleep in the bed.

When I wanted to go to bed I asked my single friend to sleep next to this person as I didn‚Äôt want to disrespect my partner by sleeping next to them. My friend declined and I was too drunk to care so I just got in. Eventually this person started to grind on me in an attempt to what I presume to have sex, I again said no. I then tried to wake up my friend to ruin the atmosphere that this person deemed suitable to try and have sex with me. However, my friend didn‚Äôt wake up.

Despite my previous ‚Äòno‚Äô this person tried it again, and I said ‚Äòoi‚Äô as into stop but they just continued their advance. I don‚Äôt know how many times I had said no but it was at least 3 in total. Eventually I gave in and slept with them, although I only remember a few flashes of what happened. I feel as if I was too drunk to fully understand the gravity of what I was giving into.

I don‚Äôt remember feeling threatened at all, but I can remember feeling almost pressured to reciprocate as it seemed the easier option. If I‚Äôm honest it‚Äôs hard to remember what I felt at the time as I was so drunk but I know I couldn‚Äôt think straight. I just can‚Äôt understand how the alcohol rendered me so mentally helpless. I think what must have gone through my mind was if I gave in and gave them what they wanted, they would stop and I could go to sleep. However I just couldn‚Äôt see the seriousness of what I was giving into while so drunk.

Since then I thought about it everyday and feel guilty and ashamed. People have told me I was sexually assaulted and it wasn‚Äôt my fault but I can‚Äôt help thinking it was. I told my partner what happened and they were very understanding and said it wasn‚Äôt my fault.

I personally feel that this person took advantage of how drunk I was and ignored my no‚Äôs until they got what they wanted.

I had never been to this particular Walmart, which was in a huge warehouse layout. After quite some time of trying (but failing) to find the shampoo section, I saw a Walmart employee (50s F) and approached her. I asked her, ‚ÄúHi, excuse me. I was wondering where I can find the shampoo section?‚Äù She glanced at me and pretended to not hear me, minding her own business. Originally, I thought she didn‚Äôt hear me as I kept a healthy and comfortable distance between us because I was trying to be socially conscious of physical space. There was like a good  couple of feet between us as we were the only two people in that aisle. Anyway, I projected my voice more clearly and with more volume and asked, ‚ÄúHi, sorry to bother you, but can you tell me where I can find the shampoo section?‚Äù She stood there, refusing to acknowledge my existence for a bit as I awkwardly stood there, wondering if she couldn‚Äôt hear me or... 
Then, she looks at me and she just shakes her head. And I said again, ‚ÄúOh...can you help me?‚Äù And she just keeps shaking her head, making a disgusted face/grimace at me and refusing to even speak to me. I was kind of shocked because I‚Äôve never been denied assistance or a response like that from an employee. I‚Äôm usually not a confrontational type of person, so, I awkwardly left and took another 20-30 minutes, trying to find the shampoo section. After I was able to find my shampoo, I saw her again (by chance) enthusiastically helping another customer. I was kind of dumbfounded.

I left the Walmart, but ended up being really bothered with the difference in treatment that I was provided and the treatment that the other  customer was provided. I was trying to figure out why and if it was maybe my demeanor or tone. But I believe I was being very cordial and well-mannered.

The only thing I can think of is that I am an Asian American and that maybe she was acting like that as a form of racial discrimination or...I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want to pull the race card, but I can‚Äôt figure out why I was refused service.

298,"Hello Reddit,

I'm looking for others' opinons/advice on this dilemma. I'm a 20 year old male currently studying in university. My entire life, I've lived quite sheltered, and have very little ""life experience"", as well as horrible social anxiety, however this year I've forced myself to do many things to step out of my confort zone because I just don't feel like my current maturity matches my age, and I want to fix that. Recently, I've had strong urges to move out of the home I've lived in my entire life, whom I share with my grandmother. The reason for this is because my commute is far, I'm constantly missing out on social events and library studying with new friends due to my bus route ending early, and just a general feeling that I want more freedom, I want to do things I haven't done before, and I want to learn how to be independent. My grandmother is in her seventies, and I help do some things with her (technology, house maintence, etc.), but she also helps me to do many things as well. We talk a lot together, and I think we give each other good company. My mother and father were never really in my life, so she is like both to me, as well as being my best friend. Her husband passed away around when I was born, so it has just been her and I. The issue is, she constantly (and rightly so) worries and panics when I dare to do anything other than the usual go to class and come home. I understand her worries, but I feel it's slightly impeding my progress in life. I brought the idea of moving out to her, and she said ""I was scared this day would come..."" and started crying. To be honest, so did I. I felt set on moving out, but after this conversation, I'm having serious doubts. I don't think she can handle being alone mentally. Maybe I am the one who can't let go given how much thought I'm putting into this. I want to take the next step in life, but I don't want to leave her alone for the rest of her life. She sacrificed so much for me, and it hurts so much to leave her. I'm not sure what I should do. Does anyone have any advice on what to do next?",17Mar2020,1

301,"Maybe I don‚Äôt have all the information. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. I don‚Äôt get it. Why are we implementing changes gradually instead of getting ahead of this and going into partial lockdown? 

 If we know a exponential rise in cases is almost inevitable if we don‚Äôt distance ourselves appropriately then why are malls still open? Why are we still allowing communities to gather together? Why are all these changes being made so slowly? It seems like we‚Äôre choosing to gradually make the changes needed, in order to not cause panic amongst the public. Why not get ahead of this and prioritize safety over public anxiety. So essentially, governments would rather the virus potentially expand its reach as long as it‚Äôs ‚Äúcivil‚Äù instead of trusting the public with the truth they deserve to know. This sounds familiar.

Dr. Li Wenliang was reprimanded by local authorities for ‚Äúmaking untrue comments‚Äù and ‚Äúseverely disturbing social order.‚Äù His messages about a SARS-like infection conveyed an urgency that undercut the official efforts to downplay the epidemic and its risk to the public.

Well to start I'm a senior in highschool, and I've like this girl since the end of sophomore year, we can call her Luna. Thing is at the end of that sophomore I heard she liked me aswell. So we snap snapchatted a little bit for a while but things just kind of faded off. I dont think I ever showed any interest mainly because I was too scared to. So here I am, summer of sophomore year confused on what I may have done wrong. Eventually that just didnt matter and I soon began to forget about her. Until I met this other girl who's name doesnt matter and we started dating. But that only lasted two weeks, for multiple reasons. One being that there were some points where I thought that Luna would start liking me again while I dated this other girl. So we were broken up, arguments happened, and all the relationship jazz. So fast forward to spring of senior year, we have a musical. I am apart of this musical... and so is Luna. And on so with this akward interaction. During this entire ordeal, which is where we mainly see each other, we dont talk to each other. I know I'm too afraid to talk to her, but I dont know what she thinks. I think she likes me at this point but again I'm not too sure. I'm good at picking up signs, but she shows signs and hides signs at the same time. Eye contact for example is really odd. I'll catch her staring at one point, and then never make eye contact again. I cant even make eye contact or I get this straining panick feeling. At to note that we had a little interaction because she needed to borrow my jacket for a scene during rehearsal. But then after that whole ordeal, nothing, we act like we dont even know each other. So then flash forward past all the days of confusion to the start of summer. I pull a ""Starting a Streaks with people who made my year impactful"" mainly for her because I'm to afraid to be direct. 30 minutes later I get a response. Let's go we're back at it! Until 2 days later of somewhat ghosting. Damn. Lonely summertime it is then. Now flashforward to the start of senior year. I dont know what to think of this girl but for some reason I refuse to acknowledge the obvious that is she doesnt like me like she may have used to. But I spend all this time choosing to be alone. Both in fear of having a similar relationship to my last one, and missing out on Luna. Homecoming... by myself, didnt even dance with anyone (we also had small weird eye contact there too). But she also had a date there. ""Just friends they are"" I thought. Until flashforward a few months later onto December of 2019 she really starts coming to mind again. And by that I mean there are times where I cannot stop thinking about her. But on so, I find out that that homecoming date of hers, was her boyfriend. And apparently they've been dating since the start of summer before hand. I finished off the end of that decade thinking of how much a fool I was. Or was I... again I thought to the optimist side of things and thought ""she ghosted me because she had a boyfriend, not because she dislikes me."" Although that's probably the case I still have trouble refusing to see it through. Flashforward to now, my last musical. We talked one time, about my god damn jolly ranchers that she asked to have. And that was it. A bunch of weird eye contact. And again I say weird because I know something off about it. It's like shes afraid to look or talk to me. But I dont want to jump to conclusions. Because even though she may not have a boyfriend any longer at the moment I cant be jumping the gun on things. Sorry if this is getting out of hand, I'm basically just ranting about how much this girl terrifies me. She seems so perfect and yet I know nothing about her. I start to question myself ""Do I deserve her?"". I've barely ever talked to her and yet I'm crazy for this girl. And I'm scared that in the smallest chance we get together will I panick and fuck up this relationship just like my last, and ruin everything. But anyways, or musical as been interrupted by the coronavirus stuff and I'm not sure what's going on. But it means for me that I will probably never talk to her or interact with her again. Because I think she hates me, or knows I like her, or maybe just maybe has feelings for me as she has had before. Maybe because I'm too scared to look at her she thinks I hate her. And I cant look up advice online because no one even considers my ridiculous situation. So tell me reddit what do you think. I feel like waiting to say something so that when I do and depending on the response I can just disappear and not have to see her again. I also heard from an unreliable source that she still has a boyfriend, but she also deleted all of her insta posts, but I also just dont know. I'm probably crazy.

i came into her room later and apologized again. still the same thing of just nodding, and saying an obvious lie of ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

One of those people I used condoms with and the other two were virgins. All of these were people I was casually dating. They were not one night stands. Trust was developed since we went on dates and got to know each other. I've always wanted to have a threesome and I hit up a redditor in my local area that made a r4r post. They are insanely attractive people that I would want to have a threesome with, but idk if I can. They want to meet at a coffee shop before and immediately head to the hotel for the rendezvous. They even said they will they will bring proof that they are clean. But idk if I can trust them! What if the proof they have is fake? Or what if the test is outdated and they have had various sexual encounters since then without getting tested after? They are also 10+ years older than me which makes me slightly nervous. My health is #1 and I don't want to end up getting some STD. If I do meet, I want to use condoms.. but not sure how that will work for oral sex. Do y'all use condoms/dental dams for oral sex as well?

She replied really angrily and said I wouldn't know so why would I ask. I thought maybe if I talked to her about something she liked then maybe she would have a conversation with me. It seems this did not work as well. I said ""Sorry, I was just curious""

She began screaming at me again and I finally decided to ask her why she seemed to always be irritated with me. The moment I asked she began ignoring me again. I was already feeling overwhelmed with everything else that was happening in my personal life and I had not cried in so long. So I began crying, something I don't do often in front of my parents, or anyone really.

I was so angry I couldn't earn at least one real conversation with her. I sat there for about 5 minutes just crying and she was stone faced just ignoring me and looking at the television. My father then came home and she talked to him normally about church activities. I had been reading up on things that affect the development of self in children recently and thought back to that. I realized my mother had never comforted me when I cried, even as a child.

She would usually ignore me and look away. One time I cut my finger with scissors accidentally and she just yelled at me and cared for me only when my father got home. She only 'worries' if my father gets mad at her for it. 

Why has my mother never comforted me when I am not feeling well or hurt? Why does she ignore me on purpose? How can I either fix the situation or try to forget how much I want her to love me?",17Mar2020,1

Hello everyone,

I would like to start off by saying first time posting but I need some outside opinions. I currently rent a house with my brother. He moved in with me after him and his ex broke up about two years ago, now flash forward he has been with his new G.F. for about a year and has had her at our house constantly since November 2019 up until present with her being there more and more. We had a discussion mid November with me explaining she is at our house all the time and that she shouldn't be there when he is at work. I stressed I do not want another roommate and I do not want her living with us and over every night. He acknowledged the conversation but later said he only told her she is not to be there when he is at work. Flash forward a week after that my brother is laid off (heavy equipment-winter shutdown). She did not work at the time so now they are both at the house all the time! This continues into the new year with her now at my house every night. In January I had enough and needed to say something so I brought it up to my brother; this time was not so civil as the first. It started off with me telling my brother she is over all the time and again I do not want an additional roommate. He said we are in my room most of the time and she cleans. At that point she had cleaned the kitchen once and hey they made the mess so they should have cleaned.... He also said she starts work soon she would be gone and when she works shift work she would not be there. A lot was said with him saying if that's how I was going to be (standing my ground she is over too much) they would find another place. We both went out separate ways with me saying after a 15 minute cool down I don't want him moving out. He acknowledge said sorry but we have not brought it up since. With him knowing how I felt he continued to have her over all the time.

Note: In March they went back on that and had her sleep at my house during the day after a night shift on a Sunday when i was off, now having to be quiet in my own house on my day off.

We are now in March and it hasn't got better.

All the bills are in my name so I have seen the increase in utilities that I believe they should be responsible for. However I really don't want her paying rent then she may feel entitled to be there when my brother is not. I always pay the bills on time as well but my brother makes me chase him down and never is the full amount when actually due. O I sent you x dollar amount for now. This is even after he has money to buy toys like (snow mobiles or ATVs) money to pay me is not a priority.

There has never once been a time where he asked me if she can move in, if they should pay more rent, if there is anything we can discuss to make this work.

Like I said at the beginning they would stay in his room a good chunk of the time but now they have been in the common living area A LOTTTTTT! She gets moody and thinks it is either her way or the highway.

Now we have her over 7 days a week:

\- using water (baths, showers) / plus having to wait for the shower or washroom with no hot water left at times.

\-we used to split certain things now its 2 to 1 and they are using more supplies in the house.

\- Her getting up and getting ready for work at random times walking up the house.

\- They are notorious for leaving dishes for days on end with me fed up sometimes at the mess and cleaning them up.

I am going to buy a house within the year but I can not live like this up until that point, getting walked on in my opinion.

I almost want to write and email or leave a note rather than speaking with him as I don't think he will be receptive and get angry because he is right.

Any help or recommendations are greatly appreciated.",17Mar2020,1

I‚Äôve lived alone for about 4 years now and rarely ever have anyone over. A week before the beginning of Spring, I was cleaning out my closet when I found a Dwight Bobble Head (From the TV show, The Office). I got it a couple years ago at a mall and I guess I never displayed it. I took it out of the box and put it on my nightstand. 

Two days later, I found it knocked over on my nightstand. At the time I thought maybe it simply got knocked over by something, I just put it back up. 

The next day, after coming home from work, I sat down to watch some TV. After doing so, I continued to my room. The Bobble Head was missing. I was certain I didn‚Äôt put it anywhere else, so I checked my nightstand‚Äôs drawers. Nothing. I check underneath my nightstand. Nothing. I checked under my bed. Nothing. I checked my closet, nothing at first glance. But then I looked through a big cardboard box full of junk, I found the bobble head. Funny, I thought.

At the time, I just thought I misplaced it, so I just put it on my nightstand again. I then went to bed around 11:00. But about 40 minutes ago, around 12:00, I heard a crackling sound, like a water bottle when you squeeze it. The bobble head was missing. 

I‚Äôm sort of afraid to look for it and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Am I letting my mind get the best of me?",17Mar2020,1
327,"so, some context.

I was an idiot kid who moved to this new school and i was terrified. I didn't understand normal people, as I was raised in a crappy private christian school with only 124 people. So when I met my best friend it was really the best thing that had happened to me in a long time.

We talked, we laughed, we hung out, we really just immediately became best friends. It was easy to talk to her, it was easy for her to talk to me, just a random, red-headed idiot boy who was oblivious to the pain I was going to cause her.

Its a small town, so everyone knows everyone and my best friend, I'll call her Kawi, has many relatives at this school. So when I joined this club, so did her asshole cousin.

There was a convention for the whole club, and during rehearsal everyone was talking and stuff and eventually i brought up (somehow) with the kid next to me that she dated this girl and it eventually went around the whole place. I was kinda stupid and didn't think it was relevant and it wasn't till Kawi talked about how her cousin, c, knew she was bi till i realized anything happened. But whatever, C can't do anything, right? So all Kawi did was pretend to be mad at me ""for lying"" as she told C, but only in front of C. 

We talked and continued to be normal friends and assumed it was over, but then C told her whole family. Her entire, conservative family. And they all thought it was me, the demon-child, who influenced her to become such a terrible, unholy demon. They all seemed to hate her, and she was close with them. She called her grandmother every night to pray, but she couldn't do that anymore- because they hated her. 

Even her mom didn't like her hanging out with me. She wasn't conservative at all. I had gone off to a mental hospital for depression and crap and Kawi was extremely depressed while I was gone, and her mom put two and two together and knew I was the reason she was depressed. I was also really close with her mom and her step-dad, so when Kawi told me her mom didn't want her to be friends with me I was really heartbroken. And I practically ruined Kawi's life, as her family meant everything to her. Kawi was the only thing I had and I went and screwed up her life.

I don't know what to do. I screwed up other things for her, too. I don't think I'm a good friend for her to have, she deserves so much better than this. 

She's such a good person, to everyone. She's funny and reliable and honest and logical and mature, and I'm just an inconsiderate idiot. 

I think I should just stop talking to her in total, I'm not good for her.",17Mar2020,1
328,"a while back a friend and I did a photoshoot with a somewhat dark theme. we took vintage child toys (jack in the box, teddy bear, marionette puppet, yo-yo, ball, jacks, slinky) and we took nice happy pics with each object, and then destroyed it or made it dark or broke it somehow in order to take a darker themed pic. it was kind of an artistic vision and a fun project we wanted to do, but now we want to do a part 2, and i was wondering if you guys had any suggestions for what toys we could use, finding things wont be an issue, as I made the marionette and jack in the box from scratch. our current ideas are: balloon, kite, deck of cards, nightlight, magic 8 ball, ballerina music box, chalk, and a wooden toy train.

329,"This is my first submission ever on reddit, so I apologize in advance if there are any mistakes 

So I have known this girl for 5, almost 6 years now, and she and I have been good friends. There have been long periods of time when we didn‚Äôt talk that much, but recently we got really close again. I have liked her for maybe 2/3 years, but never pulled the trigger and asked her out or told her any of my feelings. But we got really close at the end of last year and things were going really good. We talked almost every day, facetimed, hung out more often, and it was just really nice to be with her. 
Around December or January, I had told her I liked her, and she said she didn‚Äôt feel the same, but it was nothing to worry about because nothing could hurt us. So things continued as usual, we talked and hung out and all of that. And it was going really great for sometime, we cuddled, held hands, and took naps together. And I worked up the courage to kiss her one day, and she smiled. So I thought that maybe we might get together. 
After a while of good things, we had a mild fight one day, and it seemed to kinda crack whatever we had. She told me she needed space and time to herself, so I did that, give her some space for a couple weeks, with occasional ‚Äúhi‚Äù or ‚Äúhow you doing‚Äù texts to make sure she‚Äôs fine. And after some time of giving her space, I tried to talk to her again and see how things were between us, and she‚Äôs just been cold and distant now. She recently started talking to some guy and I‚Äôve tried to talk to her in person and get some closure, but it always fails, like she has something to do that day, or there‚Äôs someone else with her.

332," 

This might be a little long so bare with me. I started gaming when I was in my younger years, I'd say 5-6 when I first picked up the Gameboy Advance. Watched the older Tomb Raider games on the first Playsation, moving forward into the PS2 era as well, at one point picked up the games myself when I got older. I'm obliviously not going to name every game, that's every gamers' Nightmare. I thought an origin to the story would be appreciated.

I didn't actually start playing console games consistently until I got my first Halo and CoD Multiplayer sessions in. I'm currently 21 years of age and all I've done a majority of my life is sat in front of a TV screen playing some fantastical world, expanding my imagination and curiosity.

Here's where the negative part comes in. I've had slips of emotion that tell me games were starting to get boring overall way before the age of 21. I started doing this when Halo: ODST came out and it's gotten progressively worse. I'd sit on my lazy-ass and play video games for 8-12 hours a day. Maybe more if the day let me, I didn't care. But those hours are decreasing and my overall interest has declined significantly just in 2019 and the beginning of 2020.

At an early stage in my life, I decided that I wanted to be a YouTuber or Streamer of some kind and that's always been an extreme hungry passion within me, it still is. My body and mind physically won't let me record for long periods of time or even let me stream yet it's been my life goal and passion. I've tried on multiple occasions, it's like the world is trying to communicate with me but I refuse to give up on this regardless of what happens to me, I will go homeless before I let my passion be swayed from me.

What the actual fuck is happening? Why can't I enjoy games anymore, this is the only thing in life I'm actually decent at, the only place I feel happy. the last thing the world should take away from me, is this specifically. I'm a shell without Video Games.",17Mar2020,1

He legally can not be at his house when his younger sister is there, and we live within walking distance. So, even though he‚Äôs nothing but a trouble maker, we let him stay. He never gave us any reason to not trust him. My boyfriend is 21 and i‚Äôm 19. We live alone but his mom stays here pretty often since she still owns the property. Also the school in our town recently got shooting threats. 

LC : Little cousin
BF : my boyfriend
BM : my boyfriends mom
TF : our friend who thinks he‚Äôs sooo tough

So, I came home from work Friday, and my boyfriend says ‚Äúhey, LC confronted the guy who threatened to shoot up the school, and apparently he lives in the trailer park down the road and wants to kill me.‚Äù at first I was just like, okay this kid is just some weird psycho. Then TF asks to come stay the night like he also does every weekend. So I‚Äôm in a house full of some punk ass 14 year old, a 21 year old redneck man-child, and an 18 year old redneck who thinks he‚Äôs made of steel. 

Next thing I know, the school shooter wanna be, (Tristen) is in a group chat with all of us saying what cars are in our driveway, who he sees wearing what colors in the window, etc. This kid starts sending all of us pictures of the house, the cars, saying he undid bolts on TF‚Äôs truck, put water in my gas tank, everything. Our vehicles were never actually touched, it was just to scare us. This Tristen kid literally opened our locked door and left it wide open. He kept threatening all of us, and it was fucking scary. The second night was pretty much a party. My boyfriend‚Äôs cousin and my cousin came over. I didn‚Äôt want to be the only girl. Then the next morning it continued. We were being stalked by a psycho for 3 days. The third day, BM came home. We told her everything, of course. We had already written police reports, the cops searched our property numerous times, the whole shabang. None of us ever actually saw the guy except LC. He described what he was wearing, his gun, everything. This guy even shot at our house. 

So finally, Sunday night rolls around, were all still freaking out and waiting for this kid to show himself with a gun. (We also have guns, it‚Äôs rural Missouri) We has every right to shoot if he‚Äôs on our property with a weapon and the intent to harm. LC went home. BM left to go back to her boyfriend‚Äôs house. BF gets a call. 

LC WAS THIS TRISTEN KID THE ENTIRE TIME. THATS WHY WE NEVER SAW ANYONE. THAT‚ÄôS WHY LC WAS THE ONLY ONE TO SEE HIM. THATS WHY ALL OF OUR VEHICLES WERE UNTOUCHED. THATS HOW THE LOCKED DOOR GOT OPEN. EVERYTHING. LC is definitely NOT allowed back here. Ever. What can we say to press charges on this kid. We don‚Äôt want money, we just want him to learn a fucking lesson. His parents apparently shaved his head and smashed his phone but that is NOT enough for us. His mom (BM‚Äôs sister) won‚Äôt even talk to any of us now. We don‚Äôt know how they got LC to confess to this or what made him say it was him.

Then she called me asking to testify against him to get him evicted from her the house they live in by a restraining order. which she doesn‚Äôt need to stay at, her family has so much money, she has money, she‚Äôs MORE than able to get her own place so she won‚Äôt be out on the streets.

My dad plays a very important role in the choices i make in life, partially i have a say but i have to be very convincing, but he is someone successful to whom i look up to.

So my dad is telling me to do a masters because it will be helpful as a degree to fall back on if what i want to do doesn‚Äôt work.

Personally i don‚Äôt see how it would help me, i see it as one extra year of very very hard work that i don‚Äôt particularly enjoy doing.

One think i know is that working in finance or in any corp or bank is something i would not be able to do, I‚Äôm someone who stays on the move and would rather hustle left and right rather tan working for a multi million dollar company who pays you less than you are worth. 

Business driven would probably describe my mindset,and i have been making money in different ways and testing different business fields.

Honestly i would prefer going back to my country and try to build something from scratch, but the idea of this scares me and i hear about all these people failing in starting something for themselves and now in debt and regretting starting this in the first place.

Would be wise to find a job using my degree and live the 9-5 life, never be able to own your house and have to ask for time to spend on yourself (vacations)

I dont know if where I am asking the advice is clear but if any or you kind fellows there had the same experience and would like to share opinions and advice, it would definitely help my find my way.",17Mar2020,1

Here‚Äôs my situation I‚Äôm 17 about to turn 18 I live in California and attend college classes, I‚Äôll be 18 on the 18th funnily enough, I‚Äôve been talking to some old high school friends and conversation has gotten romantic and slightly NSFW. I‚Äôve known them for a while and we‚Äôve been talking like this for a few weeks and I may possibly have a date with one or two of these girls, the youngest being a little over 16 and a half, the problem is I‚Äôm kinda anxious and feel morally wrong talking to these girls now that I‚Äôm about to be 18, like suddenly I‚Äôm an adult and it‚Äôll be weird because they‚Äôre underage, I‚Äôm also worried that if I were to take one of these girls on a date and their parents found out I‚Äôm 18 they‚Äôd be upset no matter how I try to explain it. Well my questions are, 1 should I stop pursuing these girls even if it‚Äôs barely a two year difference when I turn 18? And 2 if so what do you think are appropriate age ranges for me to date it? I know these probably seem like stupid questions and they‚Äôd probably are but I‚Äôve had so much anxiety over turning 18 and so many questions so your advice on this and advice in turning 18 in general is very much appreciated.

343,"Somehow I became very fat and very miserable. I'm (26 f) 240. I could get away with saying 200 because of my body shape but either way.

I don't feel well. I don't have any friends. I've never had a boyfriend. When I was a little younger I was much more cheerful and outgoing but even then I had trouble making friends and boys have always seemingly actively avoided me. Nowaways I'm slightly more noticed as long as the guy is either 45 or 18. Which at 26 is more confusing and annoying that welcomed. 

I've been interested in plenty of guys only to find out theyre are at all interested or they are in a relationship. I mostly just date in my head, its pretty pathetic. I recently confessed my (obvious) four year attraction to a long time family friend and he told me he knew and always tried to make it clear we were only friends. It was pretty humiliating and now I can't even be friends with him anymore. I cut it off.

Ive learned now but have been used many times by other guys. The only friends I have are lifelong met-through school or church friends that are now busy starting their own families. At work I hear people talking about their kids, relationships, future plans, vacation. And I have none of that. I go home to nothing I just eat. I try to hide it but deep down I'm jealous and bitter and I hate them.

I never used to feel this way. Even when I was picked on in school and rejected I always was hopeful one day things would change for me. I was always nice and forgiving, doormatish and naive. I havent caught any breaks and as I get older I become more and more resentful and uncontrollably angry idk what to do or where to channel it. I dont mean to shift blame or 'blame the world' or seem like I have no control over my life. But Ive always gotten the short end of the stick in my life. Thats just how its been. I couldnt control the abuse and the circumstances I lived in and the things that were said to me.

Ive no money, I cant work and go to school full time so I feel stuck in my low paying job. Im not a golddigger but at least being in a relationship well take some of the stress off.

My family is really dysfuntional and I had a tough upbrining so Im sure that somehow part of my issue. After being invisible at school all day I would come home to abuse and manipulation by my parent. 

Recently my older brother and I got into a huge fight and he called me a fatass and basically pointed out every failure I have as if he could read my mind. So Its clearly obvious to others too. I was already down but that was the last straw. 

Ive been trying to make lifestyle changes and its pretty difficult. I havent lost any weight yet but I will. I dont know why I no man on the earth is ever interested in me and I don't know why I cant make friends. I slowly ballooned up to nearly 250 lbs and when I think of how fat ppl are portrayed and when I read the average commentary on fat girls I feel hopeless. Im whining but im so fed up, Im afraid i cant live this way for too much longer.
So is that it ? Do I just lose 100lbs and I get treated like a person ? Is it worth it now ?",17Mar2020,1

348,"Couldn‚Äôt post to r/legaladvice, because it‚Äôs personal. Welcome to my shit show of a life. So for some back ground, my boyfriend‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs step brother (so basically my boyfriend‚Äôs cousin) is 14. He legally can not be at his house when his younger sister is there, and we live within walking distance. So, even though he‚Äôs nothing but a trouble maker, we let him stay. He never gave us any reason to not trust him. My boyfriend is 21 and i‚Äôm 19. We live alone but his mom stays here pretty often since she still owns the property. Also the school in our town recently got shooting threats. 

LC : Little cousin
BF : my boyfriend
BM : my boyfriends mom
TF : our friend who thinks he‚Äôs sooo tough

So, I came home from work Friday, and my boyfriend says ‚Äúhey, LC confronted the guy who threatened to shoot up the school, and apparently he lives in the trailer park down the road and wants to kill me.‚Äù at first I was just like, okay this kid is just some weird psycho. Then TF asks to come stay the night like he also does every weekend. So I‚Äôm in a house full of some punk ass 14 year old, a 21 year old redneck man-child, and an 18 year old redneck who thinks he‚Äôs made of steel. 

Next thing I know, the school shooter wanna be, (Tristen) is in a group chat with all of us saying what cars are in our driveway, who he sees wearing what colors in the window, etc. This kid starts sending all of us pictures of the house, the cars, saying he undid bolts on TF‚Äôs truck, put water in my gas tank, everything. Our vehicles were never actually touched, it was just to scare us. This Tristen kid literally opened our locked door and left it wide open. He kept threatening all of us, and it was fucking scary. The second night was pretty much a party. My boyfriend‚Äôs cousin and my cousin came over. I didn‚Äôt want to be the only girl. Then the next morning it continued. We were being stalked by a psycho for 3 days. The third day, BM came home. We told her everything, of course. We had already written police reports, the cops searched our property numerous times, the whole shabang. None of us ever actually saw the guy except LC. He described what he was wearing, his gun, everything. This guy even shot at our house. 

So finally, Sunday night rolls around, were all still freaking out and waiting for this kid to show himself with a gun. (We also have guns, it‚Äôs rural Missouri) We has every right to shoot if he‚Äôs on our property with a weapon and the intent to harm. LC went home. BM left to go back to her boyfriend‚Äôs house. BF gets a call. 

LC WAS THIS TRISTEN KID THE ENTIRE TIME. THATS WHY WE NEVER SAW ANYONE. THAT‚ÄôS WHY LC WAS THE ONLY ONE TO SEE HIM. THATS WHY ALL OF OUR VEHICLES WERE UNTOUCHED. THATS HOW THE LOCKED DOOR GOT OPEN. EVERYTHING. LC is definitely NOT allowed back here. Ever. What can we say to press charges on this kid. We don‚Äôt want money, we just want him to learn a fucking lesson. His parents apparently shaved his head and smashed his phone but that is NOT enough for us. His mom (BM‚Äôs sister) won‚Äôt even talk to any of us now. We don‚Äôt know how they got LC to confess to this or what made him say it was him. 

TLDR: my boyfriend‚Äôs cousin pretended to stalk and threaten us for 3 whole days. what the fuck do we do about it?",17Mar2020,1
349,"I am currently studying abroad in Japan (until August this year). The situation concerning the corona virus is getting worse in my home country Austria. For example there is a sort of ban for going out, gatherings are forbidden and so on. Japan is still very relaxed about the whole situation and there are barly any restrictions. So technically, staying in Japan would be safer/more comfortable than going back home. But it is also known, that Japan isn‚Äòt testing a lot and not very consisting with it‚Äòs testing (not sure if it‚Äòs correct or up to date, but I‚Äòve read they only tested about 15.000 people total). All the other exchange students I‚Äòve talked to are planning on staying, but I can‚Äòt decide what to do. I‚Äòm afraid, that if I wait to much longer I won‚Äòt have the chance to go back anymore, because there will most likely be no flights. The opinions of the people I‚Äòve talked to until now are split and the arguments of both sides make sense to me. For example right now it is safer for me to stay in Japan and even my classes at university should start on time, but what if the situation changes and becomes similar to Europe? Or if there is a family emergency? Or if there are any natural disasters in Japan and I can‚Äòt get back home?
I am already in contact with the Austrian embassedy in Tokyo, Austrias foreign affairs office and the international office of my home and host university. I phoned the embassy today and they said, they see no problem if I stay in Japan and in their opinion it would be safer to do so. The Austrian foreign affairs office on the other hand said it would be better to use the possibilities of going back, as long as they still stand, but I have no clear information if they are just talking about travelers/tourists or about Austrian residents in Japan as well (one moment it‚Äòs just the travelers, the next it‚Äòs everyone).
I am really hoping for some advice or input, so I can come to a decision. I am just afraid, that if I go home now I am loosing a great opportunity and if I stay, I might be stuck here for god knows how long (no way to tell if I can even go back in August).

352,"I'm F/24, in a happy relationship, with all the regular little fights or disagreements of a normal relationship, but overall a happy and healthy one, so much that my boyfriend lives with me and two other friends as we share a 3-bedroom apartment.
Now, I have recently introduced two of my friends, M/24 (who I've had a crush on when I was a teenager, and when I say crush I mean ""the hots"", no romantic feelings, but not correspondend, so we remained just friends) and F/24 (we've had ""the hots"" for each other ever since we both came to terms with being bissexuals, but since I was already in my relationship when she came out, we never acted on it). Even before I introduced them, I knew M/24 would like F/24, cause she's pretty and nice, and I knew she would correspond on some level, cause he's handsome and nice, and although I still thought both of them were attractive, I had accepted that nothing would ever happen between either of us. 
Then, there was this party. 
I invited both of them, a couple of other friends, to my place, and we all got pretty high/drunk, and they started to make out, then they both started trying to get me to make out with them, but I was reluctant due to having already made up in my mind that this would never happen, they noticed my reluctance and then proceeded to make out with my boyfriend (which is fine, cause we allow free passes in the relationship), and eventually, I came around to and ended up making out with them too. Now, this free-for-all make out sessions happened on two other parties after this first one, but because F/24 had been clearly using the alcohol as a means to escape some stuff that's been happening on her life (I had to take care of her during my birthday party, cause she was falling all over the place, throwing up, the works), I decided to stop the parties until she comes to a healthier place, mentally and emotionally, so that the parties can be just about having fun and not an escape that makes her act in a way she might regret later on. 
However, M/24 and I have been becoming better friends through all of this, cause we're very much alike, and he's been insisting on hanging out, with drinks and all (although when she's not here, we just talk about life) and I know that behind the curtains they have also been hanging out (but in a ""date-y"" way), although nothing else happened between them either, and they might be getting feelings towards each other at this point, and I say ""might"" cause neither of them have ever been in committed relationships and have always been weird about dating.
So, with all of this situation, I've been feeling weirded out with them starting on (partly cause this is not the first time I introduce F/24 to a male crush of mine, and she ends up hooking up with them), and I don't quite understand why I feel this way. Part of me thinks it could be something as irrational as ""jealousy"" or a feeling like ""why her and not me?"" (I'm plus size, with great boobs and butt, and she's skinny and has a great butt, so there's also that), but I hate the idea of having irrational feelings, and since I can't fully understand (or accept) my feelings towards this, I also feel unable to decide how to act around and with them. I know I don't have feeling other than friendship for either of them, but I'm still attracted to them, especially to him.
I need some outside perspective, please. What do I do?",17Mar2020,1

I then saw that I got a message from her, and she said that she liked my art. We started chatting from time to time, passing to discord and finally voice chatting. Her voice was so high pitched and bubbly, I felt kind of jealous because I sounded like a guy, and she was older then me. Hearing her laugh put a smile on my face and I felt like maybe, I was growing up too quickly. I started to admire literally everything about her and I began to tear up. I hated my voice. I hated it. Why was she so perfect? Her art, her voice, her attitude.. when I told her about these things, fortunately she was very supportive and she said that she'll always be here for me, but I still can't help but envy her.

355,"I'm on a school team (not sports), and the other day our coach told us that if we told him we were insecure about ourselves during the competition, he'd tell us to leave life if it sucked so much.

He's a middle school teacher and I'm worried he'd say something similar to his students, as middle schoolers are not know for being the most mentally stable. I feel like I should report it, and I'd never forgive myself if anyone actually killed themselves due to his words. I am unsure if that is the course I should take, or if it would just be an overreaction. If reporting it is the right thing, then I'll do it, even if it means I am going to loose all of my friends.

357,"Since I was harassed off of some academic subs and this post was deleted from r/college, I thought I'd post this here. Out of these options, which sounds like the best choice? I'm asking for advice. 

Anyway, I'm currently in the dilemma of wanting to attend grad. school, not wanting to relocate (there's only one uni. in my city), but realizing that I've experienced too much negativity and embarrassment at my alma mater to go back there. I haven't applied anywhere, but I've looked into some programs, and I just thought I'd get others' perspectives on which sounds like the best choice (if I apply to any). I'm not naming the schools to avoid doxxing myself (or anyone else).

1. One program is in my ""second choice"" city. It's only a short flight from here, so I'd hopefully at least get to come back here during breaks and maybe even some weekends. While I don't think any city can be as exciting as my current one, this is a very metropolitan city with a rich culture etc. Although they have a program that's similar to what I'm looking for (a particular era of American history), it's not really the same area.
2. Another program is a *perfect* match to my research interests, and there's an advisor that I think I'll like there. (I don't think anyone will compare to the professor I had wanted here--or at least the idea I had of her/working with her.) It's also just a short flight away (or *long* drive/bus trip), however, I don't think I'd enjoy that city itself. They have some of the same entertainment there that they have here, but it's nothing close to the same scale, and it's a smaller/less populated town (which I don't like). Also, not having a car, it might be difficult for me to get around there.
3. The next program is in the city where I'm originally from, and the main benefit is that I'll be relatively close to my dad. My mother will also feel better about me at least having him nearby in case of an emergency and will worry if I'm anywhere else. (I'm also worried about not having anyone to call in an emergency, but less so in city #1 since it's an urban environment.) However, I didn't want to move back to my home state (quite a distance from here), plus, their program doesn't match my research interests well, nor do I see anyone there that I'm particularly interested in working with.
4. I can reapply to my alma mater. I LOVE this city, have family here, etc., and they have a new professor that matches my research interests (the other was retiring). However, the negativity/embarrassment, not to mention the constant reminder of my former professor's absence and our fallout, will make it a negative environment...BUT it's HERE.

Edit- I don't know if this matters, but I'm a nontraditional student (37F). Just wanted to add that for context.

Edit- Here's a summary of the negativity situations I've experienced at my university (in chronological order, not their order of emotional impact or how much they're factoring into my decision)

1. Their housing policies almost left me homeless
2. When my anxiety was out of control, I practically begged the director of their Ph.D. clinical psych. program for counseling, and they turned me away...several times (because my anxiety/OCD was too severe). While I understand that it was nothing personal, it was a rejection nonetheless.
3. had a fallout with a professor that I greatly admired. This was my fault, and I wanted nothing more than to apologize to her (arduously tried to have the grievance reversed/dismissed), but not one person in admin. would ask her to talk to me (*despite knowing about my mental health conditions and how distressed I was over the situation).* Then, some of them were/are following the saga on Reddit, where I started questioning my sexuality over this. I'm not ashamed over the same-sex nature of my feeings (this professor was gay btw), but regardless of the genders involved, it's a pretty awkward situation.
4. Despite our fallout and the fact that she didn't want to talk to me/accept my apology, it would still be difficult for me to be reminded of her absence there.
5. Had an awful experience at another counseling program at the university (incompetent and emotionally abusive master's degree student of family counseling), and when I complained to his supervisor (not the same one mentioned above), she was rude and obnoxious. Their director also refused to refund me for my sessions , so this was more negativity with faculty.
6. I had a fallout with the dept. chair as well when I complained about the way he handled everything. I'm not emotionally affected by it like I am with the former professor, but it adds to the tension I would feel in the dept.

362,"So I work at a non public school in Northern California. I won‚Äôt name them for obvious reasons, but with all the shutdowns and the recent bill governor newsome signed some of us were wondering if what they‚Äôre doing is legal. 

All the other schools and districts near us have shut down. So they announced we will be shutting down starting Thursday, until April 19th, an entire month. The company I work for owns the non public school and also some STRTP homes (group homes). So, they gave us 2 options, work group homes, or decline and essentially be laid off for the next month with no pay.

The Administration is letting her go at the end of the week and I don't have to worry about outing me to the parents and students since our government has suspended classes indefinitely  due to the NCOVID19 (I'll cross that bridge when I get there I guess).

365,"I'm 31 years old.  I have a 47 year old sister and my mother is going to be 71 this year.

So I'm an ex-con trying to get back on my feet and live a normal life.  Been out of jail for almost 2 years now.  I'm currently on special probation, county supervised, have 2 years left in July.

I have an apartment and live alone.  I had a full time job, but last month my work hours have been between 2-16 hours/ week or nothing at all.   I have no savings and I'm not even sure I will have my rent money by the 1st.  I still have my last months rent to use if needed.

My mom is retiring in August this year.  She has heart problems and was hospitalized in the past from heart failure.
He memory is declining also.  

My plan is to move back into my mom's place to help her with stuff around the house and to make sure if she does catch this virus(if she doesn't have it already), I can care for her.

I have no symptoms yet and haven't really had contact with anyone lately as I'm a introvert.   Does anyone know if this is a good idea to go down there and move in?   I'm afraid of infecting her, but I think she will eventually catch it from her work as she is a receptionist at a drug and alcohol center and they won't lock up and close!

My sister lives way father away from my mom and currently I'm 2 hours away from both my mom and sister in different directions. Bo one is really close to check up on her.

I just don't want my mom to deal with this alone.
In the past my mother wouldn't think twice to help me and she is a saint in her own right.  I just don't know what to do.

Also, I have a long history with depression and borderline personality disorder and have multiple suicidal attempts that landed me in a coma.

371,"Hello everyone!

I'm a starving artist and this shut down in the States is hitting me really hard financially. Tons of gigs cancelled. Lots of stuff booked but months down the road. I've decided one way out is to sell adult adult Polaroids (and/or adult art) online using a Paypal business account.

3 Ideas: 

\- Pre made, one of a kind polaroids for purchase. People have suggested charging anywhere from $5 - $500 and I'm not sure at all what to charge. I like the idea of selling less at higher quality and price points but am afraid of not finding buyers. 

I'm a good photographer, but there's a learning curve with polaroids. I think most of the appeal here is the authenticity and the knowledge that this photo is the only one to exist.

\- Custom: I take custom polaroids as requested by the buyer. They pay half in advance (so I don't take them then have the buyer flake), then I take the photo(s) they requested and receive full payment then mail the pictures. I wouldn't take this too far, but some simple requests would be fine. I'm thinking ones with custom outfits, positions, holding a sign with their name, etc. 

\- Adult Art: I have been toying with the idea of using my body as a 'screen print', i.e. painting my breasts/foot/whatever and then stamping it onto the paper and turning it into a full picture. I would send the art along with a polaroid of the body part I painted before/after stamping it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for the safest way to do this, as well as the best way to market it. I don't know what sub reddits to post to or if I should even advertise on reddit at all, as I know it's a pretty touchy subject on here. I'd appreciate any advice.",17Mar2020,1

379,"For those graduating college in the spring of 2020....

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody could've expected that just a few days ago, we were going to be leaving in what is easily the most confusing situation we've ever been through. Amidst global pandemic and death, we're supposed to be entering the world with our expensive sheets of paper, a smile on our faces and ready to start our lives. 

For me, it was not even five days ago when I found out that there will be no commencement, no pictures with my family, no handshake from the provost. Nearly every industry has halted in its tracks, and we're seeing a market crash to a degree which we've never seen before in our lives. Nearly every single one of my job prospects has now fallen through. I thought I was doing everything right... Getting decent enough grades, networking, getting my necessary certifications and training; Only to have it shoved right back into my face. It's taken me a few days to even begin to digest what is happening and what this even means. 

I for one can't move into my parent's basement, no safety net that I can now completely rely on. If you had asked me five days ago if I thought that I would be without my current job, a graduation, and a positive view on my future, I would have laughed in your face. But here I am... In two month's I'll be without a place to live, no full time job to go to, and a heck of a lot of debt to pay off. At this point in my life I don't want anyone's sympathy, because I am incredibly fortunate to have even been given the opportunity to be where I am now. I don't want people to feel bad for us. I want people to understand what it is exactly that they're doing to those of us just trying to get onto our feet for the first time. Those of us who just want to have a normal, average life. One where we can maybe have a home and a family some day. 

I know I'm not the only one. There are thousands of ""me's"" out there in the United States and across the globe right now. And many of us are looking out at all of you, all of you who's footsteps we were supposed to be following in, asking what do we do? What do we do in the face of a recession greater than the likes of 2008? What do we do when we can't go outside? Can't go to class? Can't go to work?

I try and tell myself that everything will work out in the end, and to just keep grinding and moving forward. I urge you all to do the same. There is no advice, and very few are on our team. We need to keep forging our own path and move forward into the world and change it for the betterment of those behind us, because those before us seem to have forgotten that there are still others to follow. Our eventual children don't deserve to grow up in a time where we risk global collapse from pandemics, war and a fear of science; They don't deserve to have what they've spent the cost of a house and four years of their lives on thrown into the trash in a matter of five days. They don't deserve to be lead by people they can't trust, and to be lied to constantly and fed misinformation. They don't deserve what we've been given. 

I don't consider myself religious, but may whatever god you do or don't believe in bless us all. The people of the world who are suffering most today, and those of us who will suffer tomorrow. They all need us now more than ever. I pray that the selfless people out there will be the heroes that we all need right now, and that you will be the ones who's footsteps we can follow, who's advice won't be ignored in the future. 

My advice to you all out there in the world right now who I share this situation with. Be better than the generations who have come before us. Be more mindful of everyone and the world around you. Because the ones after us will need us when times get tough, and will look to us to be the role models that we wish we had right now.",17Mar2020,1

The sex was good and we had some good times in our relationship, so I just put up with it, but I knew one day I‚Äôd have to leave her.
I even DID leave her once and she somehow got me to get back with her.
Now, here comes my big wrong-doing. I have always been attracted to men, at least to a certain degree, but I am NOT 100% gay by any means. I really enjoy sex with a woman. 
One day while we were out at lunch, some urge took over my brain and I just blurted out that I was gay and I was leaving her. My subconscious must have seen at as an easy way out without her being able to make me feel like a bad person for wanting to leave her. That‚Äôs how much she had me scared of her!
But I didn‚Äôt just tell her. I told my best friends, I told my co-workers, I told my family. Without any consideration or reflection I just came out as gay without any regard for what I actually wanted from life.
I almost immediately began dating a guy. It was fun. The sex was odd at first, but I got used to it. He and I broke up. I‚Äôve spent the last two years single and just hooking up with men anytime I want some kind of affection. I usually feel guilty and ashamed afterwards.
I realized recently that I want a woman. I may be physically attracted to men, but I know I‚Äôm my heart it‚Äôs a woman I want. I believe myself to be bisexual, but I‚Äôm afraid to acknowledge it.

There were SO MANY amazing, beautiful and kind women in my life that told me they were interested in me while I was dating my not so kind ex, but once they found out I was gay they moved on.

391,"COLLEGE 

So I‚Äôm 23 and I started community college at 18 after graduating. I started off as a nursing student because I had(still have) no idea what I wanted. All I knew and still know is that I want good money. Everyone told me it would be a good career and rewarding plus easy to find a job and the schooling wasn‚Äôt that long. I took about two semesters of nursing prerequisite and absolutely hated the science classes way tooo much math and memorization, especially anatomy. I also visited a family member in the hospital a lot around this time and saw that the medical field just wasn‚Äôt something I wanted. I was lost again but then I remembered taking accounting in high school and somewhat enjoining it so I initially thought to switch to accounting but after watching way too much tv and oitnb I decided I wanted to be a prison warden. I remembered reading that you usually have to start off as a police officer or guard etc to be a warden, so I started taking police academy type classes. I did this for about two more semesters and then decided I wouldn‚Äôt want to die in the line of duty nor would I make much money so I thought to switch it up to criminal justice so that my classes weren‚Äôt for nothing. I took two semesters of criminal justice then realized I really didn‚Äôt want have anything to do with that field either. So then I decided to go back to accounting but talked with an advisor and chose business administration instead. I took all the classes to get my two year and then transfer to a university for a degree in finance. I started taking classes at the university and did okay up until advanced accounting classes. (Back story: at the small community college I took financial and managerial accounting but it was mostly online and open book so I literally didn‚Äôt learn a single thing... thanks quizlet) I failed the accounting class and was kicked out of the business school until I get my gpa up. So I haven‚Äôt been back since and this was two semesters ago. I want to go back but trying to figure out fafsa. But at this point is it worth it?? I don‚Äôt even know if I want to do finance. I mean what kind of career could I really have in this small town with that type of degree? 

WHO AM I 
What is bothering me most about deciding is that everyone says to choose something you love to do but that‚Äôs just it there‚Äôs not really anything in particular I like to do that I can make a career from nor do I have any special skills. I don‚Äôt have any strong passions towards anything either like everyone else does. Whether you‚Äôre a music person, writer, athletic, gamer etc I don‚Äôt really have anything. My free time is spent watching tv or playing video games. (I know you can make a career out of games but like with everything in my life no matter what I‚Äôm just average at it). The 2 only things I‚Äôm sure of that I want in my life (aside from family and friends) are money and travel. I want to be able to not worry about my bank account. I‚Äôm sick of being broke i literally live paycheck to paycheck and I‚Äôm so over it. 


JOBS 
Another thing which may make me sound shitty is that I‚Äôve hated every job I‚Äôve had. I‚Äôve worked for Taco Bell h&amp;m Walmart (in literally almost all the departments even changed peoples tires and stuff) and a bank. I do admit thought that many of the reasons I hated them were issues more with the company than anything. (That‚Äôs made me think for a while now that I should start my own business not work for anyone else but I wouldn‚Äôt know what to sell. Im still thinking on that) I did enjoy styling customer at H&amp;M but I don‚Äôt see that as ever being rewarding in the future especially with all the online shopping. 


In all reality I don‚Äôt even know what kind of advice I‚Äôm asking for. It‚Äôs just been bothering my on a daily basis that I don‚Äôt do anything with my life. 


Ps: is it childish that In the back of my mind I‚Äôve always wanted to be a celebrity or like a streamer or some kind of online celebrity? Just don‚Äôt have the talents but it‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve actually truly ever wanted.

394,"I have been best friends with two girls since my freshman year of high school. I'm a senior in college now, and any time I catch up with them I leave feeling super just uneasy. I don't know if it's something that's changed with me or what, but I just don't feel like they are my kind of people anymore. 

For example, a few months ago I was catching up with them and we got on the topic of a mutual friend of ours. They were carrying on about how much weight she's gained, her diet/workout schedule (or in their opinion lack of), and basically just shitting on her whole life. Keep in mind, one of my friends was her roommate and the other was one of her REALLY good friends. Well this whole conversation really just rubbed me the wrong way because like any normal human I also gained a little weight after high school. It just made me wonder what they truly say about me when I'm not around. They've been this way since high school though I don't know why I'm just now seeing it. All they ever talked about in school was other people (their clothes/appearance/etc). 

Another thing that has bothered me is how entitled/spoiled they both are. They constantly invite me on all these extravagant trips but I'm a broke college bitch. I don't have the opportunity to have my parents pay for my every need like they always have. I'm not shitting on them for using money their parents give them but it bothers me that when I say I can't go bc I can't afford it they literally tell me to ""sell my plasma"".

So recently I've decided to just distance myself from both of them. Am I wrong for this? I just feel like we are so different in so many ways and they don't understand anything that I go through. It just makes me sad bc now I'm questioning everything about myself. I don't know how I ever was such good friends with people like them.",17Mar2020,1
396,"**I'm sorry ahead of time if this is VERY choppy and if I jump around a lot. I'm not the best at writing. Also thank you in advance for taking the time to read this. I know it's kind of long, but thank you so much for any advice you can give!**

Some background to start off: I (F18) just graduated early and am currently working full-time, sometimes up to 60 hours a week, saving up for an apartment. My mom and stepdad had my younger sister when I was about 10, she's now 8 years old. (Pretty big age gap there). I'll call my little sister ""G"" for this. So ever since G could start to speak she's always had this MAJOR attitude problem. Another thing to note, no she doesn't have any disabilities (Not that it's a bad thing if someone does have a disability!! I'm just saying this for clarification purposes). All of my family, me included, always kinda noticed my parents letting her get away with A LOT of things. When G was younger she use to spit at them and call them names, it was really really bad. As she's gotten older the attitude and talking back has grown with her. More attitude, less little kid behavior. She definitely acts like a 12 year-old beginning to go through puberty. 

Now onto what's going on now: (Keep in mind I use to live with my biological father, my mom lost custody of me when I was young. I also recently found out through reading the court documents that she's lied and manipulated me a lot throughout my life. Just throwing this out there because this is why i'm so torn on what to do, because she loves to guilt-trip). My mom loves to make little comments about G's behavior such as, ""Well she only acts this way because she wants your attention,"" and ""Wow she must learn it from you,"" and ""Well maybe if you weren't so mean to her, maybe she'd act right."" Things like that. Please keep in mind she loves saying those things to me whenever G is being a brat towards them, when I have nothing to do with the situation. (Also, I grew up with a very absent older sister when I was little. I've always tried my best to not be that way with G). Another thing to consider, I'm NEVER home! I'm always either working or I come home and go shower and head straight to bed because I'm exhausted. Also, my work tends to call me in on weekends and I normally don't get off work until past G's bedtime. I try to spend as much time as I can with G, I really do. But with her terrible attitude problem and with the way she speaks to people, it honestly makes me so stressed out and upset and I can't be around it for long before I get burned out. And sometimes I do find myself in the wrong saying things like ""G, don't talk to mom like that,"" which in turn I get told to ""stay out of it."" (which i do understand, my parents want to be the parents). I just don't get why my mother needs to make those rude comments towards me in a nasty tone of voice. G acted like this even when I was living with my dad and could only come over once a month, so there's no way I'M to blame, is there? I think it's just easier for my mom to point the finger at me because she hates admitting she's wrong. My point of view is: I'm not the reason your daughter is a brat, maybe you should've disciplined her from the start when she was young, I don't know. But what I do know is your child isn't my responsibility. She may be my sister, but she's always acted out. Not just around me. My biological father raised me to always respect your elders and to always carry yourself with integrity. I always try my hardest to be respectful. A part of me feels bad because I feel like I may sound snotty and i'm sorry if I do, but in all honesty I think i'm just so mentally drained from my mother and finally being able to get this all out is such a relief. Also, yes I have tried talking to my mom about the way she makes those comments towards me before. She normally makes a few passive aggressive comments and then stops talking once I call her out. At this point I don't know what to do, I feel like my relationship with my mother is falling apart again. She likes to either act like my best friend or fake friend who talks crap about me behind my back. I'm at a loss for words at this point. I've always been the one who's blamed for her child's behavior problems. I don't know what to do anymore.",17Mar2020,1
397,"This is something I've been wondering for a long time since I figured out I had some sort of perfectionism issue. I've never heard of it being classified as it's own illness nor heard of it being associated with an illness, though it seems to be spoken of as if it's normal. But I notice that it interferes with a lot of things I do, and has some sort of relation with repetition and boredom.

 For example, doing something and having it turn out less than perfect can result in the activity becoming dull and uninteresting. I notice it when I listen to music or play games because I always spot that part I don't like or a custom character I'm unsatisfied with (to the point of spending 90% of my gaming time creating and deleting custom characters). And through that repetition, whatever I'm doing becomes boring because I've done it 100+ times and I'm never satisfied with the results for long. 

I have heard of writing down the things that I find imperfections in, but a better understanding of perfectionist behavior would make that more understandable and more likely to help.",17Mar2020,1

my college is now transitioning face to face classes to online. i (19F) currently live oncampus, with three roommates. our campus as given us the option of staying On campus for the rest of semester, or going home. all of my roommates are going hone because they live quite close. i do not but was originally planning on staying in my college town this summer. 

though the university is letting us stay on campus, 
1. there‚Äôs no promise we get our original housing 
2. we cannot have any visitors anymore (none of my roommates or friends or neighbors or even family could come visit me)
3. i‚Äôm extremely worried about my mental health. im an extrovert and i like school and work and having a schedule, so i worry that being confined in basically quarantine, alone on my *very small* college campus with only online classes and minimal work right now will drive me mad. 

i have the option of getting an apartment, which i‚Äôve been wanting to do for a while, and live by myself, which would allow my friends, who all live close, to be able to visit me rather than Not visiting on campus. 
(this includes my boyfriend whom i am very close with and spend majority of my day with.)

i only worry that living alone isn‚Äôt the best choice for me right now, but it‚Äôs truly the only one i have. at least with getting off campus i can have visitors whenever i please. it‚Äôs just a LOT to consider and make a decision on in such a short amount of time.

We treated each other good and came to the realization that we work well with each other. She told me that she love me and it kinda threw me off since it was that early. Everything was smooth sailing until two days ago.

She told me that I shouldn‚Äôt hold onto her while she‚Äôs still not ready for a relationship.

430,"Okay so me and my boyfriend of almost 5 years had went through an opiate addiction. We both successfully got clean by going to a suboxone program. Well, he got kicked out of his program because he relapsed. It was a one time thing and he got back on track but the damage was already done. So, because of this, I wasn‚Äôt going to see him go without his suboxone and risk going back to his addiction so I decided to share my medicine with him until he got into another program. I normally am supposed to take it twice a day but because I‚Äôm sharing with him I‚Äôm now taking it once a day, so I have enough for each of us to have one a day per prescription. 

Well, yesterday I went to go get my medicine and was counting it and realized I was 2 short. I figured maybe it was because I ended up giving him an extra one as well as myself an extra one because I had missed my last appointment before this one so we had to go a day without. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal though, so I decided I would call them and ask if I could just come in a day earlier than my scheduled appointment. Well, now today when going to get my medicine I realized I‚Äôm now another medicine short. I didn‚Äôt understand how this would happen but didn‚Äôt think much of it.

I give him his medicine before he leaves for work, so I went to go slip his medicine in his cigarette pack which is what he always does, when I seen that he had a half of a strip in there (the suboxone we take comes in films/strips, not pills.) I know for a fact he had already taken the one from yesterday, and when he got home from work today I was sleeping because I took a nap. I believe he took an extra medicine behind my back while I was sleeping. Now because of this, we both are going to have to go a day without our medicine. This is really unfair to me because I‚Äôm doing him a favor by sharing my medicine with him so that he doesn‚Äôt have to go without, and I‚Äôm actually the one going without since now instead of twice a day like normal I‚Äôm only taking it once a day so that he can have some too.

The thing is, I know if I ask him or confront him about it he‚Äôs going to deny it and get mad at me for ‚Äúaccusing him of stealing‚Äù but I KNOW he did. Yesterday I was 2 short, which made sense because I gave both of us an extra one the day I got my last prescription because we had to go one day without since I had to reschedule my appointment. But now all the sudden I‚Äôm FOUR short without any explanation, and I just so happen to find one of my medicines in his cigarette pack where he always keeps it. So now not only did he go behind my back and take more when I‚Äôm already being generous by sharing with him while also taking less than I‚Äôm supposed to so that he doesn‚Äôt have to go without, but because of his actions now he‚Äôs screwed the both of us over because I will now have to go two days with no meds because of this.

If anyone has any advice on what I should do that would be very helpful because I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm highly upset that he would take advantage of my kindness and use that to go behind my back and steal from me and now we‚Äôre both screwed over for two days because of his actions and greediness. I also don‚Äôt know how to confront him because I KNOW he‚Äôs going to deny it and probably turn it around on ME and get mad at me for ‚Äúaccusing him of stealing‚Äù but I know he did.

Has anyone here worked professionally for a company for say, graphic design? I resigned from my internship and my boss is still asking me to pull in designs for him. Is this normal? 

I am not getting paid for it btw It's a 'favor' And Im afraid to say no because he's got kinda good connections in the industry and Im very new to it Like.. I dont even know why im listening to him. Sure Im new to the professional industry but isnt this just exploiting my network with him?

Would it make sense to mention that he is the head of a startup company and is hence trying his best to keep everything cheap/not paid? theyre a very small company so i guess he's just trying to pulls strings to get as much work done for free Like Im grateful he took me in as an intern and stuff since it was needed for my grade  But now that Im done, shouldnt he like.. not... continue asking for free work?

Like he's very sweet and all but graphic design in itself is boring to me ( again, I only took it because I have the skills and needed my grade )  I dont wanna keep doing it, especially if it's not paid I get that its a startup and money is always short but like its a waste of my damn time 

This is not a vent btw Im just

My friend decided it was a good idea to add this hippie harry potter (who liked minors) into a school group chat full of school children from ages 14-15 and this guy was in minor heaven getting young teens phone numbers he was gettin people there to call him daddy and shit 


But I 14m (at the time) was also a target turns out this guy is after all the genders my friend claimed to be non binary back then he was tryin it on with everyone but he sent me nudes and sex videos and told me ‚Äúyo im a homemade pornstar‚Äù then proceeded to show me a video of a clearly underage girl giving him oral through snap. He then urged me to send him nudes ‚Äúsend me your penis‚Äù he would say he would push this for hours tryna get a penis but I was not gona show my penis to this dude but this guy knew full well I was 14 too sendin me nudes sex videos askin for nudes he also asked my friend for nudes too his personality was ‚Äúsend nudes to me minors‚Äù


This is now a few months ago the same friend had met up with this guy (shes 17 now) and had hickeys from the night it made me think was she groomed at 15 to 17 yes the legal age in the uk is 16 but waiting like a hawk for it to happen egging on for nudes while she was 15 and even if she was 16 at the time it seems strange that a 26 year old would be trying it on and my friend isn‚Äôt remotely mature she doesnt even know shes bein manipulated and I try and tell her and she defends the dude but i found out something else that made my skin crawl a little this guy WAS A TEACHER not anymore but apparently his profession is motherfuckin 3d printing now. 



I want to take this guy down for making 14 year old me feel uncomfortable as fuck and for grooming one of my friends into gettin what he wanted from her then ditchin her to the curb. I remember his snapchat user. I forgot to mention I hadn‚Äôt sent him any pictures of me and then he showed me he had an album of pictures of me he also had an album of pictures of my friend.

442,"A few weeks ago, I was talking to my friend really late at night over. For the last few days, she had been really pretentious, and clearly distancing herself from us. She was also making new friends which she acted nothing around them like she acted around us. So I confronted her about her disingenuous behavior, and she said she wasn‚Äôt the most real person, or a very morally just one either. The conversation spiraled, and she admitted that she was trying to back out of our friend group, that she no longer wanted to be our friend. She went on to say that it was all a script, that everything between us was fake and all planned out. That she manipulated and changed her personality in order to get us to love and trust her. I was in shock. To give background, she had been my best friend for 2+ years. She was there for me when I was suicidal, she promised that she‚Äôd always be there for me, and I did the same for her.

After saying all of that, she told me to feel free to tell our entire friend group. So, I did. After talking with them, we uncovered a lot of lies she told, and peculiar behavior. I also told mutual friends within both of our classes, the friend group that she wanted to befriend, as well as her supposed crush. I can‚Äôt deny I was mad and upset. Did I do this from a place of revenge? I don‚Äôt think so, I did it because I didn‚Äôt want her to hurt anyone else, and because I needed our mutual friends to know what was happening. Naturally, with that many people told, word got out. Different people started asking and I couldn‚Äôt lie to them, and I was mad as well. So I told people probably more than I should have. I regret this so, so much. 

A week or so later I finally talk to her, and I find out that she had been feeling suicidal and completely isolated. When she said all of what she did, she was having an identity crisis and was scared of hurting us. She was sorry, and regretted everything. 

Now I‚Äôm currently trying to undo the damage that was done with reputation in our school, I just...don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna do that. I don‚Äôt even know who knows. I feel so bad, and guilty about everything. I want to undo a lot of my actions but I can‚Äôt.

I live in Kansas and 4 days ago the county I am in Ordered closure for K-12 schools, public libraries, and recreational facilities (which I would consider Crunch Fitness to be) until March 29th, but the management here have continued to disobey this city order and have not closed, and I have been the only one at work all night since we are open 24/7.  I am not too afraid of this stuff and try to stay rational in these times of mass-hysteria, but last night like an hour before I went to work the county next to us shut down everything that is not an essential place (restaurants, bars, gyms, etc) and the other gyms/businesses in my county have closed indefinitely; so I am feeling a little uneasy being alone in the fact we are open and I‚Äôm the only staff member here.  I want to tell my managers that I do not feel comfortable coming in for my shifts until the government here says it‚Äôs okay (the 29th as of now) bc I will probably end up going to my parents house for a while (I have no supplies/little food at my place) but I don‚Äôt want to pass anything to them, however I also don‚Äôt want to get fired bc I will be in a shitty spot once this stuff cools down as I assume it will be impossible to find work.  I start to think they might also shut down in the morning/tomorrow, but I thought they were going to shut down before today and these greedy pigs have said in our work group messages that we need to ‚Äúcapitalize on the public/competing gyms closing‚Äù to get new members, so I don‚Äôt know how they will react if I tell them I don‚Äôt feel comfortable coming in.  

I also don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm over reacting by feeling this way and I assume other staff members will be coming to work since we are open. 

I feel like no matter what I do I‚Äôm risking something; if I tell my managers I‚Äôm leaving town then I‚Äôm sure they will fire me for missing my shifts, and if I stay my parents/family will not want to risk being around me (which I understand as a gym is a germs paradise).  I just wish they would do the right thing and close bc throughout the day there is easily 1000+ people in and out of here, passing bodily fluids around, and not being anywhere close to far enough away from each other; and they are mostly ignorant gym rats that think they‚Äôre invincible bc of their huge biceps.

447,"I have a diagnosed social anxiety disorder. I mostly beaten the worst part of it and it's not disabling me irl, I am nervous at most, but not frozen.

I specifically have problems with online groups (the ones I mostly concern myself with are gaming ones), perhaps also triggered by not being able to see people's body language - I really love to have the additional cues to understand well the meaning of what they're *actually* saying (the nuances) - or to react with body language when I usually tend to just let the body speak, but online I don't have the luxury. (Esp. when it comes to new people and you don't know yet if they're using sarcasm/irony often or they're just serious. I hate running into such situations.)

For the second part not being a native English speaker also brings in some additional anxiety. Me potentially asking, ""hey I didn't understand for 7th time, can you just write it down"" just scares me. /o\

Then there's also me being a woman which means people might tend to throw in gender stereotypes or jokes, which I a) dislike and b) might not know how to react to if it's ""distasteful"" (subjectively speaking of course, I just don't really fit that many female stereotypes so what's actually angering me is the stereotyping regardless of my gender lol - and if ppl take it further and try to go the, ""but most of the women bla bla"", it just annoys me - I don't wanna stand out and I also think it's dumb to assume all [gender] are like this and that, it's like you're completely ignoring an individual in question).

I can sorta talk to random individuals alright'ish (for that reason I tried to go in some voice-chat sub and asked for anyone to chitchat me). But let's say a gaming group of 5 other ppl invited me. I froze and couldn't join the vc.

If the same happened with an existing friend (say, a group of 3-4 ppl total), I could sort of ease into it, but mostly by getting to know each person individually (in text/voice later on).

My questions are:

* Why do I specifically freeze in a groups (2+) setting? Likely causes for ppl in general?

* Why knowing already someone in it makes it easier to me?

* Why online groups are more anxiety inducing for me than irl situations?

* What should I work on? Any situations I can try to create / engage in to reduce the anxiety over time? Any mantras or whatever else you can come up with?",17Mar2020,1

449,"Hi there, Reddit! I don\`t even know how and where to start... Even though i started using reddit a couple of years ago ( i have the app on my phone and kinda used it without an account), today is the day that i finally made an account, just to post this here (i have been postponing this moment forever, thinking that i\`m going to figure things out alone, not wanting to bother anyone with my problems, but i think i hit rock bottom and i\`m completely lost). So, i was born in an Eastern European country, in a low middle class family. I\`ve been a good kid all my life, the shy and introvert type. My parents always told me to/ kinda made me study hard, so one day i\`m gonna be someone, so i did ... untill half of my high school career  i was the kid that got straight AAs at every subject, i was the best at every subject and stuff like that.  Of course with that (and lack of money) came sacrifices, like i didn\`t really play any sports (even though i kinda loved football at the time), i didn\`t have any hobby or like extracuricular activity except from gaming. So in the summer break between year 10 and 11 i worked a shitty summer job that changed everything for me. I realized then, that whatever i was studying so hard meant nothing in real life (thank you old communist school system for that) and that changed me. After that summer my grades and work ethic only went downhill, so down that i was doing nothing but gaming all day. I obviously started to get sad and pessimistic in general. That\`s when suicide started occuring in my life for the first time in hard times, but i got through it, i was confident and i had hope for the future (also bill bur\`s advice part from his podcasts helped a lot).Fast forward 2 school years, i graduated with average final exams grades and not a single clue what i want to do with my life so i decided i\`m gonna take a gap year (bear in mind i was 19 when i finished hs and that\`s the standard in my country) . Bear in mind, in that point in my life, i was pretty confident in my own abillities and what i can achieve in life, i had some good friends and was still gaming. So yeah, after graduation i applied to some jobs and i accepted the first one that called me back. I work that job for about 2 months. While i was working there my brother offered me to move countries and live with him in a Western country and i [did.](https://did.So) So everything changed. Since i came here i feel like i slipped out of a cliff and i\`ve been on a free fall and in the last month or so i hit the bottom. Since i came here, half a year ago  i\`ve been working nights, a radical change of lifestyle, i lost all my friends back home bc they all went to uni and continued with their life and made new friends, while i didn\`t, i lost the interest in the only hobby i had, gaming and i pretty much did nothing with my life for 6 months other than sleeping and going to work. I got so bad that i can\`t motivate myself to do anything, not even like basic stuff like getting a haircut or eating or getting out of bed. I wake up shower go to work come back and that\`s it, while all my friends and people my age are having the time of their life. I have nothing to live for pretty much, all my goals and aspirations just vanished. I cant even get myself to watch a series or a documentary, or read about something, or stimulate  my brain in any way. To be honest the gap year that i took is coming to and end, and i\`m more lost than i was before in terms of chosing a career. The thought of tooking another year off (im 20 already) and working another year this dead end job is making me sick. The thing is i had mentally hard times in my past, but i\`ve always managed to see past them and somehow find a way to get out of them, but now, i have no more hope in future so im contemplating to end it all and save myself from the more misery that\`s coming.

Long story short, I have confirmed that the apartment lobby security my friend lives in is reporting to non police whenever she leaves or enters her apartment for financial gain.

She just wants to live without the feeling of being watched and betrayed by the security. I know people will ask ""what evidence""? It's best to not say on here as it took months to gather, and she has proven this to me to be correct.

I know some who read this will feel skeptical and assume she is paranoid. I was skeptical in the beginning as well, but there are a few ways to prove this and in fact, she was correct.

When I say stupid I don't mean dumb, I'm booksmart, but not capable (I think). I'm mentally ill, on meds that don't work &amp; relapsed into self harm lately (because of my family arguments). I've never had a job before, I'm introverted and can barely even make friends. I have a puppy whom I love so much but would probably have to leave with my family, who don't love him as much as I do. I hate myself &amp; feel I would probably end up as a hermit in my room because I am cursed with both introversion and shyness. 

Even so, where do I get enough money just to live on? For my phone? Rent? Food? Bills? Staying at home is hurting me but I don't even know if I can get the courage to actually leave. I'm not a mentally strong person.",17Mar2020,1

I tried reaching out to her friends and family, but they don't want to get involved, so they aren't going to help. The police has been at their house in the past for the abuse, but nothing has come from it.

482,"Ok, so let me start from the beginning:

(Names changed, throwaway account)

My husband, Daniel &amp; I started dating when we were both 14 years old. Against all odds, we were together for 16 years (7 of those married) and even had two kids. Our family worked well together and Daniel &amp; I had an amazing relationship. We rarely fought and were truly happy together. If he hadn‚Äôt died, I am 100% certain we would still be together today. But unfortunately, I lost him &amp; our girls in a car accident back in 2010. I was in the passenger‚Äôs seat and I was the only survivor. 

Following this incident, I had two suicide attempts, and suffered from severe PTSD. Not to mention the grief. My life was in shambles for probably 7 or 8 years. Then I finally found that I was doing better, and was working to tackle the grief head-on. This lead me to my current Girlfriend, Carla. About 20 months ago she became my grief councillor, but we had to end the sessions because we started developing feelings for each other and it would have been inappropriate and unethical to continue the sessions. She directed me to a new grief councillor and we began dating about 18 months ago.

Our relationship has been nothing but good, and we are both happy. I love Carla a lot, but I also still love my husband. Carla knows about this, and I know it makes her uncomfortable, but for the most part she‚Äôs been accepting. Or so that‚Äôs what I thought.

Yesterday, my girlfriend came home from a bad day at work. (Rude patient, inexcusable bad behaviour even during the session), and I mentioned my husband, and she started crying and screaming that I shouldn‚Äôt be calling him my husband and that I shouldn‚Äôt be talking about him at all with her. She says that by implying I‚Äôm a married woman, our relationship is just an affair and that what we have is dirty. 

I love my husband and I feel very strongly about Carla too. I do feel more love for my husband, but that‚Äôs only because is 16 years vs. 1 and a half. That‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt love Carla, I really do. I really hope that one day we too can be married and cultivate an even stronger relationship. I feel like it‚Äôs possible for me to love my husband while also loving Carla, and I hope she can understand that.

So today, Carla apologized for freaking out, but stands by her statement that I should not refer to Daniel as my husband and to refrain from talking about him at all with her. I told her that I just can‚Äôt do that, because I love Daniel and I feel like it would be disrespectful of me to pretend that I don‚Äôt. (Also, for the record, I don‚Äôt usually talk about him. Maybe once or twice a week and usually in passing).

I also don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs JUST the ‚ÄúHusband‚Äù thing; I‚Äôm worried that Carla is now jealous of Daniel and I‚Äôm not sure how to reassure her that our relationship has nothing to do with Daniel &amp; I.

Overall, it‚Äôs just a sticky situation. Advice would be appreciated.",17Mar2020,1

Ten year anniversary, only married a few months.

Anyway, I bought him a very expensive suitcase because we were supposed to be going on a honeymoon in a few weeks and unrelated but also I have purchased tickets to Hawaii for the end of this year for a milestone birthday (he won‚Äôt find this out till his bday in oct) but obviously the suitcase was for these two holidays 


We never travel together we have never found the time so we were both very excited and he doesn‚Äôt have a suitcase or even an overnight bag.
I also got him a passport cover and a few travel-esk things to put in the suitcase.


Now, with covoid-19 our honey moon has been postponed indefinitely. I have no idea if we will go to Hawaii anymore and my present feel so stupid. 


I know he has put so much thought into whatever he has gotten me and I feel awful that he will probably be disappointed with my gift - I knew it was more on the practical side But the intention was to put most of our money on the honeymoon and I was putting more effort into his birthday/Hawaii surprise that might not even happen now.


I‚Äôm so torn. I can‚Äôt return the suitcase, I don‚Äôt want to be impulsive and buy something else because the only thing he‚Äôs hinted at is an IPad which I absolutely cannot afford right now. I feel like I let him down on a really big milestone in our relationship and I feel awful.

486,"Before the current corona situation here in Finland, I used to organize open hang-out events at my commune/apartment. These gatherings consisted of preparing a vegan meal and then doing some activity such as solving a puzzle, having a Klask (board game) tournament or meditating together.

Now that gatherings like this are not possible with the current corona regulations, I'd like to hold similar hang-out events online. However, I'm not sure what activities/games would work well to replace the event.

I'm looking for online games that:

1) Are free of charge

2) Are easy to use/get (browser based games would be the best)

3) Are easy to play for game amateurs as well

4) Might fit up to 10-20 people, but the exact number is not important. People should be able to drop in and out during the afternoon.

For a big group of people like this, I think it would be the best to have a game service where everybody could hang out in a chat lobby and then join different games with smaller groups of people. I know there used to be a game portal like this in Finland (Aapeli), but that one has been defunct for a while. That site had games like ""Draw and Guess"" that were very simple and easy to play in bigger groups.

488,"So i am F23 and my sister is F28. We have a brother (M20) and sister (F31). 

My sister has been depressed for as long as i can remember. Ever since childhood. She is almost in her thirties, still living with our parents, no job, but she has a degree which took her 8 years to get it. (Which normally take 4 years)

Parents dont understand her mental condition (we are asian and we dont talk about mental health cuz thats taboo). My parents know that she has been to the psychologist (they think its because of her shyness, but really its because of her depression, and they think that she only went a few times, but in reality she has gone there for years). I feel like im the only one that understands her. She does talk to me about it sometimes, and i think only me. She has seen a psychologist for years and stopped going like... 2 or 3 years ago i think? I think they dont know how to help her.

A few days ago she went to a doctor cuz she thought that she had a burnout but it was just her depression. She is now gonna see a psychologist again but i feel like it doenst help much. I have been to the psychologist with her once, cuz the psychologist told her to bring me with her so she could talk to me. It was really shocking to see my sister so shy... She kind of acted like a 10 y'o shy girl which really scared me even tho it wasnt the first time ive seen her behaving like that, it was really shocking.

Fast forward to 2 days ago. She had an argument with my dad (my mom was in the middle of the argument) (my mom explained that my dad was in the wrong and not my sister) i got so scared. My sister went upstairs and went to her room. I thought ok she is just mad and wants to calm down. Instead, she shouted and screamed and i think she hit something (i hope a pillow and not the wall).

This really scared me even though i know she has anger issues. This also effects me in my daily life. I have been traumatized by her (ever since childhood) and i am so incredibly scared of her. Her hurting herself, me or just her reaction. I am always so scared to say/do the wrong thing. She has been suicidal before... (Not actually attempting but has told me about her thoughts) I am also way too scared to talk to her and always waits until she talks to me first. Im really terrified and my heart keeps bouncing and i somehow feel guilty. I really dont know how to cope with this cuz this also effects my mental health and peace.

I've always enjoyed maths, but lately since entering the 11th grade I've found myself falling behind on even the simplest things like factoring. Pre-calculus is a nightmare for me too. Limits? Hopeless. I'm terrified for when I take finance in college.

When doing exercises provided by the coursework I can never answer them by myself, but when presented with the solution I go, ""Ah! That's right!"" ie, I perfectly understand how we got to the answer but I never really can get to the answer by myself. 

I know practice makes perfect, so I wanted to ask if there's a website that would guide me through a course of sorts, to help me be better at maths in general. The only maths book I have access to right now is my grade 11 book and I guess I can borrow my 9th grade cousin's book.

494,"Hi, I‚Äôll probably need to write a bit more backstory for the questions for advice to make sense I guess, this might get long and I‚Äôll try to put my question below for clarity, so here we go:

First for this to make sense you need to know that my boyfriend and I still live with our parents (easier for school) and that I went to a bar Saturday evening evening even though my parents didn‚Äôt really want me to because they are somewhat scared of corona now. So I told my parents I was going over to my boyfriends (which would happen anyway, I‚Äôd drop of some stuff and go to bar and afterwords go back to my boyfriend to spend the rest of the week there anyway (schools closed). So in short, I lied to my parents and said I was going to my boyfriend and not to the bar anymore, but I did go to the bar. I did have fun that night but also still felt guilty about lying to my parents (I actually don‚Äôt lie to them often).

So on to the second part now: Yesterday both of my boyfriends parents had a busy day and would be home late, so my boyfriend and I offered to make some diner. So as it turned out I was the one to do the shopping some prep for the diner and make the actual diner (all his pants were in the wash, so he didn‚Äôt really have proper pants to go out, so I get that he didn‚Äôt come to the store with me). So around the time his parents come home we sort of decide to tell his parents he *did* help me with the diner stuff, simply because he doesn‚Äôt want to hear the nagging of his parents as to why he didn‚Äôt help me with the food. I also offered that he could help me with the last bits of diner (cut a few last things I saved for the end to be cut), but that didn‚Äôt happen. So anyway, his parents come home and I legitimately thought his mom asked him something about diner and that he answered that he did help (even though he didn‚Äôt), but turns out  that didn‚Äôt happen. And later his mom asked me if he came to the store with me, I was honest and said no. So he did get some nagging, from his parents. Later I figured out that he is now mad at me because I said he didn‚Äôt do anything. While I only said he didn‚Äôt go to the store with me and when his parents came home they smelled something of the prep work and I just said that they smelled some prep work (by boyfriend is convinced that I said that I specifically did the prepwork *alone*). So now he is mad at me and tells me the he is going to tell my parents about going to the bar now so that I get the nagging as well, so that we‚Äôre even again.

Now I think that‚Äôs all, I‚Äôll try and summarise my questions for advice:
1. Should I just confess to my parents now already, or is that not gonna do any good anyway?
2. Is he even in the right to be mad? I did offer him to actually help me with the last bit and I did legitimately think he already told his parents he had helped with the prep work.",17Mar2020,1

501,"Hi, I don‚Äôt really know how to go about this. 
But this issue was slapped in my face a few days ago with one of my close friends. And was after advice on how to handle it. 

So a few days ago a close friend of mine confided in me that they wanted to end it. 

Being raised the way I have. My automatic response to that is there‚Äôs always another way. It does get better. I‚Äôve been in the dark places before. Never so close to the edge but I‚Äôve been there. And come back from it. 

But this doesn‚Äôt always come across well with people in that mindset. And I try to think what they‚Äôre thinking. But always say the wrong thing. 

So I guess I‚Äôm asking is, if someone tells you they can‚Äôt do life anymore. That it‚Äôs too much. What do you say to them, without being so happy positive, to bring them back and talk them down from it. 

I feel like I panicked and said the wrong things. Therefore letting my friend down.

(USA) Using a throwaway and limiting language to protect myself and loved ones.

My former friend (ff) has been telling our mutual friends (mf) and theirs about a disagreement on a video game's take on social awareness for disadvantaged peoples. That in itself is fine, however, they (ff) tell their/our friends that I'm racist for disagreeing with them . I've asked them to stop twice and they continue to tell mf who have become quite upset with this situation and have also told ff to stop. They haven't.

They don't appear to have a coherent argument to me, and mf, beyond 'if you disagree with me you're racist/sexist'. These allegations can have serious consequences for me in the future as my job relies on having a good name.

I won't go into how I'm not racist as I feel it's pretty easy to prove for personal reasons and which may identify me. That's not the issue. The issue is what should I do next? Should I consult a local attorney/lawyer? Should I get a defined argument/statement from them? I appreciate your insight and advice, thanks.

504,"Lil' context. So theres this game which I shall refuse to name it, uses Facebook for progress saving and its mandatory to have it if you want to purchase something ( this is a mobile game, not RSL ). tbh with y'all i dont feel comfortable using my REAL account for games, and I distrust Facebook security ( dont ask why ) , so I created a fake account under the name Lewis **********, connect that account with the game and made some IAP. Now for some reason Facebook disabled that account because I was *impersonating* someone and its a *threat* to their community. This caused my game account in Game X to logged out and ofc i cant login back.

The next logical step is to contact Support, which I did and I state in the email that I made purchases in the game ( **with the reciept, but the billing address blacked out** ), progressed kinda far into the game. Since the Support wants to make sure it was MY account, they requested me to send my Full Reciept with the billing address.

A few days ago we spent most of the day together (for a work thing) and I attempted to flirt with her/drop subtle hints that I‚Äôd like to go out with her. Or, at least I think I did. I‚Äôm not the most self-aware person. 

I mentioned my own sexuality, how I‚Äôd like a girlfriend, etc. and I think she might like me, too (but it might just be my hopes and dreams morphing my perception of reality).

So my question is: how do I get a date with her? 

I‚Äôm not sure whether I should wait until she makes a move (if she even does) or I should just ask her out myself. 

If I ask her out and she says no it could; ruin our friendship, make working extremely awkward, and it could completely break my heart. 

If I wait and don‚Äôt ask her out it could; cause her to think that I‚Äôm not interested in her, never happen because she‚Äôs also an anxious person, and it could make things awkward between us because I could potentially start acting weirdly around her due to my crush.

I'm currently 16 and attending a grammar school in Switzerland. In Switzerland, me especially, we really focus on our academic future and with that on our grades. Personally, I work hard for my grades (They aren't perfect but still good). Now I haven't been very physically active in the last years, I decided to go to a gym about 5 months ago and now want to play a teamsport. So I decided to play rugby since I found myself really enjoy watching it. There are people in my class who play teamsports who are pretty intelligent but the thing is they don't play rugby. They play sports like streethockey or soccer(actually the smartest kid in the class plays soccer). My sister is a medical student at a university and so I asked her about that and she said that little blows to the brain accumulate over time (but she knows other medical students who play rugby). Anyway,  I don't know now whether I should play something like soccer or streethockey or any sport which doesn't involve contact (but then I'm probably not so interested in it) just to avoid any impact on my academic skill/future.

531,"I broke up with my most recent girlfriend, who we will call A, about two months ago. It was really easy for me to do. Not because i was walking away from something that wasn‚Äôt fair to me. In fact, as I‚Äôve learned recently, it wasn‚Äôt fair to her. I had it made. That break up should have hurt. Break ups with girls who I had less connection with in the last have hurt more than this one.

Last night I got a pretty scathing text message from A after a long time without contact calling me selfish and immature. I agree with both of those and I‚Äôll explain why in a moment.

A few days ago, I was cleaning my room and I found some hand written notes I made when I was in college and in this extremely toxic relationship with this girl, we‚Äôll call her B. B cheated on me early in the relationship. But I really loved B and I was young, so I forgave her after taking no time at all to think about it. I was desperate for someone to love. That relationship turned toxic quickly. I had a lot of missed opportunities because I was still involved with her when I should have been concentrating on other relationships. At one point, I thought I wanted to kill myself. I went to a school counselor who calmed me down and asked I come to see her the next day. I did and we talked about a lot of stuff ranging from anger issues to love. I felt better after seeing her, but this relationship with B continued and eventually I stopped going to my counselor when she was convinced I wouldn‚Äôt hurt myself. We were on and off for years until I graduated. She‚Äôs married now and I don‚Äôt think about her anymore.

So back to the notes: I wrote these at a very emotional time in my life. If you looked at them, you would think they were scrawled out by someone in solitary confinement or someone with schizophrenia. They are dark. I think I had some bits of an incel mentality, even though sex was part of the relationship. I was emotionally abusive to her and (I‚Äôm trying to think about this objectively) I think she was emotionally abusive to me. I was also emotionally abusive to myself.

I don‚Äôt think about this relationship anymore and typing that out didn‚Äôt rekindle any past feelings. At all.

Back to A. In the time since we broke up I‚Äôve been very afraid that I can‚Äôt love. I don‚Äôt know how. I might need to see an example of two people in love, but I‚Äôd be afraid I would just try to mimic them instead growing my own ‚Äúorganic love.‚Äù It sounds stupid, but I need help. I know I‚Äôm empty, but I can‚Äôt even feel empty. I can‚Äôt feel anything. That text last night should dig up old feeling and it should have hurt. I‚Äôm fine. I don‚Äôt feel anything.

I like being alone, but I want to be in a relationship with someone. I just don‚Äôt think anyone would be happy with me because I don‚Äôt know the basics of being in a relationship. My dad and I never talked about it really. I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about it to.

I live a comfortable life with my parents. I‚Äôm just on the border of being too old to live with them, but I‚Äôm apartment hunting with a friend. I don‚Äôt often need and I‚Äôm thankful for that. I want to be more involved in my religion maybe that will help.

534,"I wanted to say first that I know being depressed and manipulative are two very different things, but I‚Äôm not sure if they overlap in my brother, and what my parents and I can do about it. I know that even the smallest things can cause depression, and that it affects different people differently. I hope my parents and I won‚Äôt come across as callous or not understanding in this, but I would really appreciate some insight. 


Here is a bit of background on our family: 


I‚Äôm 19, and my brother is 18. Our two parents currently live in an African country, and we are in Canada, attending school as international students. 


My brother and I are two very different people - he is very social, outgoing, and loves to have people around him. I on the other hand are perfectly fine spending time by myself, doing my own thing, etc. 


Ever since we came to Canada my brother made it clear that he doesn‚Äôt like it here. Most of his friends are in Africa, and he generally prefers it there to here. He‚Äôs said many times that he‚Äôs bored all the time because we live in a pretty boring city. 


My family has been through a lot this year. Last summer, I got an internship at a top FMCG company, think P and G, Nestle, etc. It was something I‚Äôd wanted for a long time and I was already very stressed about working there, but then during my internship he went skateboarding just outside out apartment, not at a skate park or anything (though my parents had warned him about it many times) and broke his knee. I spent days with him in the hospital, sleeping on the hospital floor because they wouldn‚Äôt give me a bed. I was able to work from home luckily. I got him a wheelchair and basically catered to his every need until my mum came to take him back home. During this time he never apologized to my parents about them having to spend thousands of dollars on his surgery (though we eventually got some of that money back through insurance)of course we were going to help his as his family, but he didn‚Äôt seem very grateful for it. The day I got his wheelchair I left it in the car and needed to go run an errand and then was going to bring it up after, and he practically yelled at me/snapped at me to go get it. He was probably frustrated at having to use crutches and barely being able to move anywhere, but still. 


During this time I noticed he would do things like - when we were in the hospital, he would be pretty okay not that tired, not that much in pain. But if we FaceTimed our parents or his girlfriend he would kind of play up being down, close his eyes a little, sigh a lot, talk slowly, etc. I just ignored it. 


He‚Äôs also asthmatic and has had a few issues with that. However, when he was 15 my mum found texts on his phone to girls, saying things like ‚ÄòI just had an asthma attack, my chest hurts so much, I‚Äôm in so much pain‚Äô basically lying about his condition and exaggerating it for pity. He‚Äôs only had one or two asthma attacks in his life, his condition is nowhere near as bad as he was telling those girls. 


Last time we were home, he and I, my parents, and a few of our family members were going for a concert. We had an extra ticket and my mum told him he could offer it to his girlfriend and tell her to meet us there. Apparently when he spoke to her, she asked if he could pick her up, and he said yes. He then told the rest of us, he wanted to pick her up, and we said we couldn‚Äôt do that, because it was a busy night and where she lives was out of the way, and we would end up possibly being an hour or so late for the concert if we picked her up. He got upset and kind of stormed off. I asked him why he was upset and he said no one was considering that he had already told his girlfriend he would pick her up, and that he couldn‚Äôt cancel on her because it would be hard for her to get a ride to the concert. Meanwhile, he wasn‚Äôt considering that the rest of us had been looking forward to this concert for a long time and didn‚Äôt want to be late for it. In the end we picked her up, we were late, and there was no reserved seating so it was an uncomfortable experience. 


Basically all his life, unconsciously or not, he‚Äôs used pity and playing on people‚Äôs emotions to get what he wants. I know everyone does this to some extent but I think he does this more than the average person. He also cannot take no for answer from my parents, not if he really really really wants something. He‚Äôll ask again and again and again, or not do what they said and not talk about it, then ask again a few months later when he thinks they‚Äôll have forgotten that we already had this discussion. 


He used to drive in Africa, and when he got here he found out that he could have his license transferred over. My parents decided that because he is young, they want him to go through the regular route of Canadian driving school, which I did. For over a year, he‚Äôs been trying to get them to change their minds. If he had just done what they said when the issue was first brought up he would be driving by now, but it seems he would rather not drive at all than do it the longer way that they told him to. 


I gave all those examples just so maybe you can try to understand his character and what kind of person he is. 


This is the most recent issue we are having. 


With the coronavirus, schools have shut down, and many people have gone back home to Africa. The few friends he has here have also gone, and so he has no one around. With social distancing advised, everyone is staying home, including me. He asked to go back home with his friends, and my parents gave him a multitude of reasons why they don‚Äôt want him to including; his study permit is about to expire, and it will take much longer to renew outside the country that inside. He already started college a semester late because of how long it took him to get it initially. If the coronavirus situation reaches our country in Africa, people from our country may not be allowed back in, for who knows how long, and he could end up missing school. It‚Äôs a risk to him with his asthma to travel and expose himself to the virus in transit when he would be travelling for unnecessary reasons. 


His reason for wanting to go back home is that he‚Äôs a very social person, and he finds it too difficult to be in the house all day, especially when he doesn‚Äôt have any friends here that we can go and visit and all, and so that‚Äôs why he feels he needs to fly back home. I tried to point out that it is the same situation like half the world is in right now, but he said but the people around him (his friends, so not physically around him, cause they‚Äôre back home in Africa and doing whatever they want) aren‚Äôt in that situation so I guess that doesn‚Äôt really apply to him that everyone here and most other places are in the same situation.


Yesterday, he told my mum that he feels my parents are not considering how he feels as an invidiual, and that he may not tell her everything that‚Äôs going on with him but that for him being social and being around his friends is his way to cope. I guess she must have reacted a bit harshly, though she did apologize but reiterated the reasons why he can‚Äôt go home. 


This morning, at 5am her time, he sent her two articles about what you shouldn‚Äôt say to a depressed person, without saying anything else. She called him immediately and he didn‚Äôt pick up at first, but then eventually he did. She called me with my dad and then we all had a family discussion, with them on the phone and then me and him.


This is the way my parents and I see it; to him, the need to be social and be around his friends trumps the importance of staying here to he can continue his education, and avoid possibly catching the virus and then taking it to our less developed country that is less able to fight it. 


We asked him to explain why he is depressed to us or what he thinks the reasons are, and he said he can‚Äôt deal with not being able to be social, and being around his friends, go out, and that that is how he thrives as a person. 


My parents have also been through a lot recently, my dad lost his sister a few years ago, my mum lost her brother, and last week our house almost burnt down while my mum was inside (she tried to put out the fire and is traumatized from the experience, like I said our country is less developed so there was no fire department to call or anything, but our neighbours helped her out it out) and they‚Äôre spending millions in our currency to repair it. 


They told him that this experience has shown them that he may not have be able to handle attending school abroad, if he is struggling so much with having to stay at home and not be social, because these are the kind of things that come with living in an international country for your education, especially when most of the world expect his friends are doing the same thing. Again, for me I understand if the circumstances make him depressed, but if it is as bad as he says then I don‚Äôt think he should be here too. They said they think it would be best for him to return home permanently and finish his education there. To clarify, what he wanted was to fly home so he could be social, go out and hang out with his friends, d what my parents are saying is that he should come home permanently, so transfer to a university in Africa near them, because this isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs had this kind of issue while abroad. 


I will admit the way they put it was harsh - they don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with mental health issues themselves and they‚Äôre also going through a lot right now. Eventually he ran into his room crying and slammed the door, sitting against it for a while till I got him to open it and my parents talked to him. They told him to think about what they said, and that they‚Äôll call us later. 


I tried to talk to him to explain why they reacted like that, and that he needs to think about what is truly best for him, and if that is staying in Canada. I also feel that he should go back home. I think he is genuinely depressed, and I feel that if not being able to be around his friends and be social is what is causing him to be depressed, then he can‚Äôt handle living abroad where it‚Äôs only me (someone who‚Äôs also going through their own issues - I was forced to drop out of school this year due to immigration issues, and this has been by far my most hardworking year, I had stellar grades that now won‚Äôt count anymore and the year has basically been wasted) to look after him, it‚Äôs not safe for him to be here. 


The reason I say it‚Äôs not safe is because a few years ago, one of his friends called me and said he had posed a picture on his finsta account of some pills saying he was tired of it all. This was when he was still in school back home, and I was already in Canada. Of course I panicked and called my parents, who were at work, they called our little brother‚Äôs nanny who was at home to go check on him. I‚Äôm not completely sure but I think he had swallowed the pills (they were regular paracetamol tablets) but he was fine. They still asked our neighbour to take him to the hospital where they did a check up, but he was okay. My parents and I tried to talk to him about it but he wouldn‚Äôt really tell us much. 


If he was back home, my parents could look after him, they could pay for a good psychiatrist, and he could work on bettering his mental state in a place where he thrives. 


Also, he told us this morning that apparently he‚Äôs been seeing a psychiatrist at school, he started seeing her when he felt he was always bored and had nothing to do apart from school, and that she had been helping him but now that his friends aren‚Äôt around he can‚Äôt cope. 


I tried to get him to go to Walmart with me yesterday to get him out of the house, but he said no thanks. 


I think he is truly depressed, but I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs doing all this to manipulate us. Apart from when he was lying to girls, he‚Äôs been manipulative all his life. He‚Äôs often blackmailed us emotionally to get what he wants, and I think part of the issue is that my parents have often caved. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs trying to do that again now so he can go home to be with his friends and his girlfriend, even though my parents have explained again and again why they don‚Äôt want him to come yet until everything settles down.

543,"I (18F) legit dont get jealous of anyone and i practically dont even know this girl (18 also)

For some context when we were 16 we both did this musical which comprised of a mainly 10-16 y.o cast. Most of the people my age had grown up doing theatre with thespian knowledge and were lead roles, meanwhile, although I've got my fair share of music knowledge and such, it was my first community theatre role, so I was possibly the only ensemble role with lines.

My role didnt bother me, i had a fun time with the friends i made but i learned theatre rehearsals had this social heirarchy in which leads just dont talk to ensemble and vice versa unless you've already been friends which is also a thing that doesnt bother me. This girl was the leading lady of the show and got attention off stage from the cast, their mums, director etc.

I'm not jealous of her talent, I've not done a musical since and what I lack in theatrical performance, she lacks in musicianship, which doesn't bother me and highly doubt it bothers her. But i do find myself reading every local cast list to see if she's in a show, and if she is i wait for promo pics (i dont go watch the show), maybe click her fb a couple times. I occaisionally think although my life is doing well, hers is just going better and i know better than to think that about anyone who isn't a billionaire.

Just a quick question about self-isolating and working in retail. I work for a global company in the UK which requires me to work in-store, where 100s of people walk in and out everyday, touching the clothes, products, in close proximity to one another etc.

I live with my mother who works with vulnerable elderly people and goes to visit my Grandma who is 85 with dementia, every day. I have recently acquired a sniffle and a cough, feels more like mild hay fever than a common cold, but I don't want to risk getting even more ill nor anyone else ill.

I don't want to pass whatever this is onto my mother, that could get her or her clients ill, nor do I want to go to work where there are 100s of people coming and going, who could either make this mild illness worse or I could give it to someone who is older, or whether they get ill or pass it onto someone else who might be more vulnerable. (if that made any sense).

We have not been told to stay off work and it's just 'business as usual' but I've also been told time and time again that 'non-essential' contact is very important to not spread germs etc.

I hope this made sense. I am just very worried.",17Mar2020,1

556,"Hi, I‚Äôll probably need to write a bit more backstory for the questions for advice to make sense I guess, this might get long and I‚Äôll try to put my question below for clarity, so here we go:

First for this to make sense you need to know that my boyfriend and I still live with our parents (easier for school) and that I went to a bar Saturday evening evening even though my parents didn‚Äôt really want me to because they are somewhat scared of corona now. So I told my parents I was going over to my boyfriends (which would happen anyway, I‚Äôd drop of some stuff and go to bar and afterwards go back to my boyfriend to spend the rest of the week there anyway (schools closed). So in short, I lied to my parents and said I was going to my boyfriend and not to the bar anymore, but I did go to the bar. I did have fun that night but also still felt guilty about lying to my parents (I actually don‚Äôt lie to them often).

So on to the second part now: Yesterday both of my boyfriends parents had a busy day and would be home late, so my boyfriend and I offered to make some diner. So as it turned out I was the one to do the shopping some prep for the diner and make the actual diner (all his pants were in the wash, so he didn‚Äôt really have proper pants to go out, so I get that he didn‚Äôt come to the store with me). So around the time his parents come home we sort of decide to tell his parents he *did* help me with the diner stuff, simply because he doesn‚Äôt want to hear the nagging of his parents as to why he didn‚Äôt help me with the food. I also offered that he could help me with the last bits of diner (cut a few last things I saved for the end to be cut), but that didn‚Äôt happen. So anyway, his parents come home and I legitimately thought his mom asked him something about diner and that he answered that he did help (even though he didn‚Äôt), but turns out  that didn‚Äôt happen. And later his mom asked me if he came to the store with me, I was honest and said no. So he did get some nagging, from his parents. Later I figured out that he is now mad at me because I said he didn‚Äôt do anything. While I only said he didn‚Äôt go to the store with me and when his parents came home they smelled something of the prep work and I just said that they smelled some prep work (by boyfriend is convinced that I said that I specifically did the prepwork *alone*). So now he is mad at me and tells me the he is going to tell my parents about going to the bar now so that I get the nagging as well, so that we‚Äôre even again.

Now I think that‚Äôs all, I‚Äôll try and summarise my questions for advice:
1. Should I just confess to my parents now already, or is that not gonna do any good anyway?
2. Is he even in the right to be mad? I did offer him to actually help me with the last bit and I did legitimately think he already told his parents he had helped with the prep work.

Hey y‚Äôall! 

TL;DR at the bottom! 


Alright, so to give some back story in my situation since it is somewhat complicated, or I think it is... 

My GF and I, we will call her Debby for this situation. Debby and I have been dating for 5+ years, since junior year in high school. I am now about to graduate college with her right next to me. However she didn‚Äôt end up going through college (yet) because her parents don‚Äôt have the financial stability that my parents have. Anyways, we both currently live about 6 hours away from home and about start the next chapter in our journey. We have talked about getting an apartment with her sister and her bf back home to split cost of living, because... ain‚Äôt nobody tryna pay 1,400+ a month for a roof. 

I still have one semester left of college in my hometown for practicum ( for those that don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs student teaching for a full semester before you can graduate). And so for now, the plan was for me to live at home with my parents and work hella over the summer while Debby to move in with her sister and work ( she has 2 jobs). We were going to move in together once I‚Äôm done with practicum and begin our journey! Also to mention, while doing practicum I‚Äôm legally not allowed to work more than 8hrs a week. YUP. 8 fucking hours.

However, a wrench got thrown into our plan when my sister and her fianc√© decided to sell their house and is now planning to live at home with my parents. Not a big deal right? WRONG. We live in a 4 bedroom, 2 story house. But there will be 11 people living there when my sister moves in. So that‚Äôs when the situation begins. 

Okay, back story.. over! 

My parents are both immigrants. They‚Äôve worked their ass off to get where they are, and I‚Äôm very proud and grateful for the life they‚Äôve given me. They‚Äôre very hard working. BUT, they hate the thought of any of us living in an apartment. Enough to the point that my 2nd oldest sister refuses to move out until she can buy a house. And they‚Äôre okay with it! 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking, is how do I come up with a way to tell my parents that I‚Äôm planning on moving out within 6 months. My parents have always been very strict, and not very open to ideas that don‚Äôt align with theirs. Also, we‚Äôre not moving very far. Probably within the same city. Debby on the other hand, has lived in quite a few apartments while I‚Äôve been in college. While I‚Äôve steadily lived in a fraternity. She‚Äôs used to this whole thing and is very comfortable with the process. BUT IM FREAKING THE FUCK OUT. We have lived a whole summer together and it was amazing. That‚Äôs not what scares me, I know her and she knows me. What scares me is what my parents will or won‚Äôt do. And I just don‚Äôt know how to tell them! It‚Äôs seriously stressing me out. Any advice? And if something‚Äôs don‚Äôt make sense, please leave a comment. 

Thanks for reading!

578,"She works as a dental assistant, currently studying to get her hygienist license (this test got delayed too because of the virus). I thankfully am still with a job and working full hours (we have 100% ability to work remotely) but I cannot foresee being able to support us both (we live separately currently)  


What can I do to help her? What are some jobs she can try to get in the meantime?",17Mar2020,1
579,"The root of this issue goes back about a year. Me and my friends play a lot of games pretty frequently. There are 3 of us and sometimes 4, but the 3 are almost always there. If any of us want to play we'll send a text to our groupchat and ask if anyone's down to play, me and my one friend (Fred) are always responsive, we communicate if we want to or not, or if we're busy.

Our other friend however (Mark), for months, opens a text. Saves it in chat. And sleeps on it for up to an hour, or longer if he even responds at all. If he wants too he'll respond almost immediately, but if hes busy or doesn't want to he just won't respond to is 75% of the time. This has been going on for like a year now and me and Fred, the ones that communicates consistently are really tired of it because he's honestly really immature for his age and is terrible at taking responsibility. 

So two nights ago I wanted to play with the boys, so I sent a text, It was opened by both, and unanswered for about 45 minutes, so I sent something like ""alright then"" which Fred said his internet had been spotty all day but he was down to try and he didn't respond because he was watching a show, Mark hit us with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9r_pZL4boE). Fred asked why Mark didn't respond, Fred sent the same video. Mark commented on how he sent the same meme twice instead of actually communicating. Same video was sent. 

So me and Fred got on and started talking about the whole situation, kind of venting to each other when Mark joins out of nowhere spouting this bullshit excuse that someone hacked his pone and that's the only thing he can send to anyone. we played for a little and it was pretty awkward because no one was really talking that much. Mark got off and me and Fred played a little longer until I got off myself.

Then things got rough yesterday. I asked if anyone wanted to play at around 1pm. I didn't expect anyone to be able to but i was just seeing. I sent it and 15 minutes went by (which I realize might not sound like a lot but this is the straw that broke the camel's back, it didn't take much) after Mark opened it, saved it, and slept on it. So I said that no was a perfectly acceptable answer and one I won't take offence to, but opening my text, saving it in chat, and leaving it unanswered is kinda cringe, I was trying to get my point across without letting my annoyance cloud it by giving it a sense of humor to do so. He responded with a picture with the caption ""\[REDACTED\] and Fred are too busy to respond. \[REDACTED\]: *whip whip* ni\*\*er reply immediately"" I'm \[REDACTED\] if you couldn't guess. So that made me pretty pissed off, for obvious reasons, so I basically layed out his whole situation, unfiltered and asunbiased as I could be, only presenting facts. 

It's been 18 hours since I did so and he's been active in other groupchats we're in together but I've heard nothing from him since then. This whole thing has been weighing on me since it happened, I've had multiple dreams about it and I realize while the things I told him are annoying but they're not big enough that I want the friendship to end, but part of me knows he caused this and should have to solve it himself. I've thought about apologizing for what I said and that I want the friendship to continue but part of me thinks that it's too late. 

Fred thinks I don't need to because I only spoke the truth and if Mark can't take any form or criticism and takes it so badly that the friendship ends that it's entirely on him. I agree but don't want to lose a friend, but I also kind of feel it could be for the best. 

Honestly this is really confusing and my mind is having a million thoughts a second and I don't know what I should do. Should I apologize and try to save the friendship? Or just leave it and let him do what he will with the situation he's ultimately created?",17Mar2020,1

585,"So I never really post anything, but please, someone who is also in the military I need some advice. I'm active duty I'm the navy, and yesturday I had the most disheartening comment from a Command Master Chief said to me. I am a biracial female, I am Caribbean, and European. My mom is Scottish, polish, German, and Irish. My father is from Jamaica. He has been a legal citizen in the US for his whole adult life. My hair is a mixed of different wavy/curly textures and when I was born i had brown hair with red highlights in my hair that even looked odd. My skin color is a almost toffee/mocha complexion or what people call biracial people ""light skinned"". Basicaly, my skin is light brown. In the military you have rules and obvious hair color regulations. In the navy you are free to have a balayage/ombre hair color as long as it is a natural color and flows well. Natural colors in the instruction are blonde, red, brown, and black. A year ago I got a balayge blonde hair color in my hair that flowed and looks natural. My roots are brown and it flows all the way to the tips of my hair as a light ashy blonde. I love my hair. Yesturday I got stopped by one of my Master Chiefs and she asked me ""um, has your hair always been blonde??"" I respectfully answered saying ""yes master chief it has been this color for a year."" She questioned me as if I was lying. And then she began to say to me ""it's not natural."" And I replied again respectfully ""well.. masterchief i looked at the instruction and it is a natural hair color."" And she said ""not for your skin color."" ....
You can imagine that this comment not only infuriated me, but mostly broke my heart. She then told my legalman to follow up with me and I explained my issue with the comment she made and my legalman tried to kind of justify what she said as ""well with certain African American ethnic groups there are natural hair colors blah blah blah""..
Well, news flash lady, I am not african american. I seperate from the military In 5 months and im not sure what to do with this issue. But what I know is I feel very disappointed at the racial discrimination that has been thrown towards me in the Navy. Please, anybody tell me what they think I should do in this situation.

We‚Äôre both 20, have no underlying health conditions (except for my autism), and are currently under quarantine from work due to the virus panic.

588,"With the COVID-19 all schools are going to close for a couple weeks. That being said daycares would be still open. I now got a email telling me that the daycare is choosing to close on their own, government didn‚Äôt tell them to close.
I talked with the daycare the other day and asked if parents would still have to pay if they did close and was told no. 
But now they have changed their mind and parents have to still pay even with people not being able to work. 

In the email it said that they understand parents are not working and understand the financial problems but it‚Äôs okay because they are willing to help us with a payment plan. They also added that the government will help pay for daycare and they will keep parents posted. 
So my question is do they have the right to still charge people, even though they choose to close down? 

I‚Äôll just add that i understand why they closed. I‚Äôm not upset at all about that. I‚Äôm willing to pay for the days my boys went to daycare, but to charge me around $1000 for the  days they choose not open is ridiculous.

Maybe the occasional depression and panic as I am far away from everything dear. In one day, my uni shut down and my country closed the borders. My parents were aware of my symptoms, which resulted in my mum crying to me over the phone, so I lied and told her I was much much better. Me and my mum decided that it will be best if I stay here for a while more. Last night my dad called me, and he started pressuring for me to come back. I told him that nothing is sure yet, and I‚Äôm still feeling a bit sicklish, but I do of course want to be with them during this period. Who doesn‚Äôt?

601,"TL;DR at bottom. 

So this might get long, and ranty. There's a lot of backstory, and I'm really struggling to cope right now. I'll start this with the fact that I have a lot of hatred, and uncontrollable anger towards my Father, (Dad, 42) and his Mother. (GC, 60s/70s I don't remember.) For context, I live in the westernmost region of a chillier country. Right smack dab in the middle. Some call it the ""South of the North."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Background for this: 

My dad had a troubled childhood growing, up, and from what I gather, GC and her attitude had a lot to do with it. She sent him away to his dad's (Let's call him DD. I've only met him three times, and I don't know anything about him.) as punishment after their separation, and after discovering he loved it there, she pulled him back down away from his girlfriend, as well as everything else in his life. 

Queue more trouble. GC remarries, (I don't know exact timelines so I'm throwing things together as I know them to be. GC never spoke to me about it, so everything I learned comes from other sources) brings Dad back to the town we're from, and life goes on. The new husband is a typical country guy, growing up in the ""Prairies,"" Dad and him fight a lot, and things escalate. Dad never gets his license, never graduates school. Downhill spiral. 

I don't know much about my mom's life, but her and my dad met when she was 15-16ish (After he got her friend pregnant with my half sister) and gave birth to me at 17. My dad was 21, and at this point already an alcoholic, and getting into the hard drugs. My mom was an unfit parent for other reasons. I love her, and I'm currently staying with her now, but mental illness runs deeply in my family. At the time, my grandparents (Mom's parents. M60-F58) stepped in to raise me. They're amazing, and I couldn't be happier to be raised by them. I never lacked the support I needed growing up with them. But, my grandfather made an agreement when dad signed away his parental rights, that he would never lie to me or bar me from seeing him. Here comes GC.  

Every second weekend, as well as most holidays, I go to GC's and her ""new"" husband's. (Who I call Papa, and will refer to from here) Dad is in and out of the scene from here, visiting some of those weekends, and gone others. Drugs, alcoholism, and chasing underage girls were his vice, but I enjoy GC and Papa's house. It's a fun getaway from my grandparents, and she trained dogs as a hobby, so lots of puppy time. This happened for about seventeen years, I guess. until the end of highschool. My dad was in and out of my life for most of it, causing all kinds of abandonment issues I still struggle with to this day. Mom was always there, she raised my younger half brother herself the last fifteen years and I'm quite proud of her. She makes mistakes, and does silly things, but she really got her life together when she got pregnant the second time. 

Did I mention, GC decided, because they were better off than my Logger grandfather, and retail manager grandmother, that she started a University/College fund for me in her name? Over those seventeen-eighteen years of my life, my family on Dad's side gave me a lot of money to put into that account. Aunt's, Uncles, my Great Grandparents. I knew them all well, and spent lots of holidays with them all. Even lived with one Aunt for a bit while struggling with depression after highschool. 

  
 

Now for the part I need help with. I'm really struggling: 

So the first eighteen years of my life were good, I think. A little rocky, and problematic sometimes. I had my issues, I couldn't commit, I was always paranoid people were going to leave, but I was happy. Then around 2015 I had reconnected with and forgiven my father for the past. He had rekindled his love life with the Girlfriend I mentioned earlier, Let's call her Stepmom from here, who had a kid of her own already. I was the other woman's child in her eyes, but that's irrelevant, as she was nice enough. Let's fast forward to 2017, and I'm living with Stepmom's parents, working at my dad's old job while he's raising their new child (My second half brother). And I get this opportunity to go down south to a major city to get some advanced training for work. (Great, it was a load of BS, and I quit the week I got back) Queue stepmom's family saying I owe them money (I don't, I kept very good track of rent, as it was my ONLY bill.) and fast forward a bit more to my life being threatened. I left the town, and went home. 

When I got home I had mail from one of the instructors at this course. It was a scholarship to a very renowned tech/trade school. I'll skip the details, as this is longer than I expected already, but I'm sure you all see where this is going. Seeing as it was nearly a fully paid program, and all I needed was rent money, and a new vehicle to get to it for the first few weeks I thought I'd message GC for it. That's what my school fund was for, right? Smart, right? Wrong. Very wrong. I was misinterpreted, and since I wasn't paying a school, she refused. Screaming over text that it wasn't accredited. I spent weeks trying to explain it to her. In the end, I had twenty dollars to my name, and it was too late to apply for loans or anything, so I gave up my dream and worked pizza delivery. I was stupid, I probably had more options, as the opportunity only comes along once in a lifetime. 

Fast forward not even three months, I apply to a local school to get my Trucking license (Haul/Logging trucks) Hard no from GC. More fighting, me giving up again. GC never wanted me to be a logger, but it's what my grandfather is, and I idolize him, so I go work with him. It's good money when you're in season, and compensation when you're laid off in spring. Except, his boss paid me less than half the regular industry wage, and ten dollars under starting wage while refusing to give me a raise, for almost a year until I quit for my own mental health sake. Life was extremely bleak at this point. 

I met a girl during this time, and she saved me, but that's a different story. (I'm still with her, and she's supporting me as best she can through this all!) 

So I moved to a different city to live with this girl only after three months of dating. Things got better, a lot better. I cut contact with Dad again, due to him no showing on Christmas, as well as Stepmom threatening me for money I don't have or owe. I haven't spoken to GC or Papa since GC denied me my dream. Queue another life disaster. I got laid off my job two days after I got into a huge car accident. (I was okay, somehow) And Girlfriend and I were both forced to move back in with our parents around Christmas 2019. 

I don't think I've conveyed how truly angry I was with GC through all of this, but I don't think I could've been in the same room with her without breaking down. Well, it's December 14th, and I'm at my grandparents house waiting to settle in at my mom's, and they get home from Christmas shopping. They had run in to GC's coworker, who happens to be grandpa's boss' daughter (Small town). Papa passed away that morning, and no one had called me to tell me yet. My grandma, having absolutely no tact in the slightest asked me what I knew when she got home, without even giving me time to process. Phone rings and hour later, and I never got to say my goodbyes. I still haven't even gotten to cope yet. I don't know how. I loved that man. Those weekends were mostly spent with him. He bought an Xbox to be ""Cool"" and gamed whenever I was there, because it was the only time GC let him. 

It was after his passing, in January, that I got accepted into University. I reached out, through Dad to GC to try to get help paying for the first year. (I only needed 500 dollars for a tuition deposit) Nope, GC spent that money. She took it, and spent it. And she claimed it was because times were hard after Papa passed, but I learned through more digging she spent it a year ago. After I asked for it the first time. And she's been lying to everyone in the family about what I asked for since. Saying I wanted it for a car and even drugs. (Creative, as I've never done anything harder than pot, which is legal) This lead to absolute fury. I got a lawyer involved, but decided it wasn't worth it. Was tempted to try to press criminal charges, but again, not worth it. 

It's been three months since Papa passed, and I just got AN XBOX LIVE MESSAGE from dad, 15 hours after (Because I wasn't online) that my Great Grandfather, GC's father, a man I really loved as well, had passed away in the morning. I haven't slept, I haven't had time to cope, I haven't stopped crying. It's been almost two years exactly since I've spoken to either of these men. I never got to say goodbye, I don't know what's happening funeral wise.  

My hatred, and absolute disgust for GC has lead to this, and I still can't bring myself to say her name aloud, let alone call her, or even any of her family. Two years of no contact with anyone but brief phone calls with my dad since Papa died. I still haven't even begun to cope with that. I don't know how I'll cope with losing my Great Grandpa. What can I even do? What would you guys do? Any advice is appreciated on how to move forward with things. 

I'm sorry for how long this is, it was a lot to get off my chest. And it all needed to be partially explained. (It's a way longer story, but I don't have the willpower to devote to a novel.) 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Controlling Grandmother screwed up father's life, father screwed up mine, grandmother screwed up mine even more. Hatred and anger ensued. People passed away, leading to regret and heartbreak, but the anger is still there and overwhelming. Need advice on how to move on.",17Mar2020,1
603,"I live with these two girls, we all get along really well and we even signed a lease together to live off campus for next year. Every time I do something that I feel like might annoy them (being on my phone after they turn the lights out, forgetting to empty the trash, etc) I say that I‚Äôm sorry and I ask them if it‚Äôs okay, since we all share a room. I‚Äôve always been assured that it‚Äôs fine and that they don‚Äôt care at all. 

Seems great, right? NO. Just found out the other day from a mutual friend that they actually hate me and constantly talk behind my back about all the things that annoy them about me. I thought it was an exaggeration until he told me that they were trying to get me off the lease so that our friend could live with them instead of me, and all the things they told me were fine were actually not fine and they were just lying to my face to avoid confrontation.

612,"

In November 2019 my younger brother quit his part time job. Then Dad and he made the journey back to live with Mom and I before Dad finds another job. I'm still trying to get read to be independent and dependable. As of now Dad is trying to find another job. Younger brother has no interest whatsoever especially because of the pandemic. Before the pandemic announcement, I wanted to know why parents hadn't asked younger brother to get a job. Their reason (and still is) that on the chance younger brother gets a job and will have suddenly move away after being hired.


My older brother informed me he has dealt with this family nonsense before. He has not forgiven my younger brother and had to have therapy, because he thought he was going crazy about how everyone was acting. He doesn't live with us anymore and infact lives in another country. He knows what I'm going through.


When I asked Mom about my fear of living with my younger brother and him doing nothing while I do all the hard work, she seemed to be OK with it. Taking care of a house is a full time job in her opinion. Older brother was disgusted by this.

My uncle looks like his time to be living alone might be too much for him. I don't know what to call it but crashing. He had been taking care of his Mom, but idk if he can do that anymore. Dad informed us it might be his time for someone to help take care of him. ¬†

Right now it is four of us living underneath one roof. I'm aware that at one point our parents will crash too. I wanted to see if my younger brother had changed for the better and tried bringing it up. I wanted to hold a conversation without involving the parents.


I waited until the parents went out and it was just us two.
I brought up about Uncle, our parents, and my fear of my younger brother living with me and him doing barely anything. I don't remember how I worded it, but I was trying to be decent as possible and not sound fearful or angry.
To my response about my fear, my younger brother informed me that he couldn't handle this right now and left me to go upstairs.
It upset me greatly. It told me that he might be OK putting me in the situation I'm afraid of.
I talked to my older brother afterwards and agreed that what younger brother pulled an asshole move.
Meanwhile my Younger brother texted our parents before they got home.


This morning we had a bit more of a talk without younger brother.

Dad informs me that because we are living all together for an unreasonable amount of time he wants my mom and him on the conversation.
I said I just wanted to practice having a conversation with the two us, but after it was done I was OK ¬†(I think) with younger brother going to parents. Just not before. One day they will be gone and I wanted to practice now.

Younger brother and I are both adults.

Move out or stay? (self.movingout)
submitted a minute ago by rymelxoxo
So over the past few years, my parents have added a lot of unnecessary stress to my life. It began my second year in college when I began dating someone. My dad did not approve because he was of another race. He said a lot of horrible things to me and threatened to pull me out of my university and make me stay home. I lied and said I'll just be friends with the guy. We continued to be together and my dad tracked me and threatened private investigators. All the while, my mom battled with her alcoholism. My boyfriend had a rough upbringing and does not have any family financial support. My mom always stood up for me and had my back and supported us. Fast forward, we have been dating for over 3 years now. My dad recently just met my boyfriend over the holidays and it went fine.
For spring break, me and my mom went to florida, where my boyfriend now lives. We are currently long distance and have been for a year. My mom has been relapsing and I witnessed her order a drink on our 7am flight. I was so upset she would do this while I was watching her one row behind. Basically on spring break, one night mom left me and him at the dinner table and put her card down and said she was going back to the hotel cuz we weren‚Äôt talking and then she changed her mind and took the card and left... so he thought that was her taking a jab at me to hurt my feelings so he was upset by that.. then were back in the hotel room and moms trying to hangout with us but my boyfriend wanted to leave cuz of everything w her drinking at the beginning of the trip and now this.. she said we hurt her feelings because we wouldn‚Äôt go get ice cream with her after dinner.. and tj was said your too grown to be doing this shit and laughed (this was disrespectful but he meant it about arguing with us) and she thought he said ""your too old to be an addict"" (mind you she was drinking this day, and he talks pretty quit. she completely misheard him).. i 100% heard him and he did not say that.. so then mom called her friend and my boyfriend heard her say racist stuff so now he‚Äôs sick of the racism shit coming from our family.. and wants nothing to do with my parents. My parents want to control my life and make me move home from universty but i think i will be rather unhappy there. But, my parents still have a financial advantage over me because I do not pay majority of my own bills yet. I am a senior in college and my parents are paying my rent until july... its 1,000 a month. i only have 100 in my account currently because all of my money goes into a savings account controlled by my dad. No one in my family, including cousins who are all between 20-28 years of age still live at home and are ""perfect"" in there parents eyes. I cannot say the same for myself.
Does this sound toxic? What should I do? Any insight or advice is appreciated.",17Mar2020,1
615,"Hey guys, so this is causing a ton of stress and anxiety for me and I'm not sure what to do. I am deathly scared of STDs. Ive had sex 3 times in the past with 3 different ppl. One of those people I used condoms with and the other two were virgins. All of these were people I was casually dating. They were not one night stands. Trust was developed since we went on dates and got to know each other. I've always wanted to have a threesome and I hit up a redditor in my local area that made a r4r post. They are insanely attractive people that I would want to have a threesome with, but idk if I can. They want to meet at a coffee shop before and immediately head to the hotel for the rendezvous. They even said they will they will bring proof that they are clean. But idk if I can trust them! What if the proof they have is fake? Or what if the test is outdated and they have had various sexual encounters since then without getting tested after? They are also 10+ years older than me which makes me slightly nervous. My health is #1 and I don't want to end up getting some STD. If I do meet, I want to use condoms.. but not sure how that will work for oral sex. Do y'all use condoms/dental dams for oral sex as well? I feel like that would numb out all the sensation. Maybe im not cut out for extremely casual sex? üò™. I feel like im too busy to go on dates now as well.

618,"I‚Äôm best friend with this girl since we were 10/11 and now were 19/20. A lot of things changed and I feel like we grew apart. She send messages when she needs something or to talk about her. She would talk with me for hours about her ex boyfriend and when she was over she would ask about me and end the conversation. I feel like when I‚Äôm going to say things about me she doesn‚Äôt want to listen. When I don‚Äôt send messages to her for a long time she says that I‚Äôm weird or I‚Äôm going crazy. I feel tired cause I don‚Äôt think I want a friendship like this anymore. My mom says that my friend likes to manipulate. When we argue she always want to be on top and then after a time not talking with me she goes and talk to me like I was the one that caused the fight. When I try to talk about me she just cut things. I‚Äôm annoyed by her cause of this selfish behavior. She always want attention. When she fights with other people she always say that they are psychopaths or says bad things about them and I feel afraid of what she is talking about me. Maybe this is subjective, but this is what I notice on the other years. Do you guys know what can I do? Should I stop talking with her? Or should I try to maintain this friendship?",17Mar2020,1
619,"I'm not sure if my uncle tried to groom me as a child or not and I don't know if what he did was really that inappropriate. 

When I was a kid, age six and up, he would wait until my grandparents left (he lived with them and still does) and then would turn our conversations from talking about movies and animals into sexual topics. These topics varied from his sexual preferences and kinks, to just talking about his sexual activity in the past.  

He would talk about when he was a kid, my age at the time typically, and the sexual things he would do.  He would also tell me he only told me that stuff because ""you get me, nobody else ever wants to listen to me"" and ""it's not weird, I just don't have anyone to talk to this stuff about it, or guy friends to talk about it with."" The encounters he reminisced on, in a very odd way, was encounters between himself and girls he knew in first grade or so, or girls who he knew in middle school.  The weird thing was how he would still, at the ages of 30-40, refer to them sexually and as ""hot"" or ""feisty"" and it was almost as if he got some sick satisfaction out of thinking of their innocence in what they did with him sexually. 

He would also try to get me to come over so I could read some books he had, play games, or just talk and connect about ""stuff that I can't really talk about here."" He did this when we were alone, and rare times when my grandparents were home, seemingly to gauge their reactions.  They always told me not to go over there and that I wasn't allowed to if they heard him talking like that, which he would use in a weird way it seemed to reinforce in my head that I couldn't tell. That they just didn't understand. 

He would guilt trip me for not showing him enough affection, and talk about how I was his favorite out of my cousins.  He would ask for hugs, and if I didn't give him any he would whine about it and try to make me feel like he thought I just hated him and that he didn't know what he would do if I hated him.  He would try to bribe me with money, or with gifts, to get me to forgive him and love him again. 

I understand clearly that it's inappropriate for an uncle to speak to his underage niece about his sexual preferences, and that it's not normal to try an normalize some of the stuff he would. Such as, ""Men are naturally attracted to younger women and teens"" and, ""I'm not weird for being into this (highly questionable thing), you just don't understand because you're a girl and just a kid."" But I still don't want to think he would ever try to get to a sexual relationship with me. 

He also has a history of odd, manipulative, narcissistic behaviors. He is also abusive verbally and emotionally to my grandparents that he lives with, nearly physically so as they have had to call the cops on him, and tormented my mom and aunt when they were growing up.  He tries to gaslight, and make you feel like you're the one who is in the wrong for not putting up with his behavior.  He does this through suicide threats, throwing up secrets he gets from you when you trust him, aiming to get pity, and trying to backtrack. 

Still, I feel sick and like it's way too far to say he was anything like a pedophile or groomer.  I feel bad for telling anyone about these experiences, and like I'm overreacting and that I really am just misunderstanding him in some way. He's always been mental, and drugged up a lot, so what if he really didn't mean for it to come across that way?  We're close, or were, and that makes it so hard to think bad of him.  

But the fact I never found the things he did questionable, and just normal things to do, concerns the hell out of me. Because in situations of other people, and if I think about the situation outside of my own personal lens, I understand that he was weird and inappropriate.  I understand why other people would say he was likely pedophilic, and creepy, like my friend did when I opened up about some of the stuff he would do. 

Things like him talking about finding women who had their hair back sexy, when I'd have my hair back. Or talking about how he was super into cheerleaders and how they were sexy, to asking if I would ever consider doing cheerleading.  ""You'd be good at it, you used to like that stuff, right? You should try to be one, you'd probably enjoy it a lot."" 

I don't know. I may just be reaching, or stupid, or not know.  I just don't know how I should feel about all this, or if I should have ever told anyone at all. And it makes me sick that he has this weird rule in my head that I can't tell other people, because they don't understand him or how close we are, because other people would just make him out to be awful and I could ruin his life. 

I've called him weird and pointed out his inappropriate thought process a few times, actually. Like whenever he would defend men who would rape 13-16 year old girls, because ""the girls were asking for it"" and ""they should have known better"" or ""they knew what they were getting into.""

The most notorious incident was when he was talking about a man I was told to never go around by my grandparents.  A man who would exchange drugs to 13-15 year old girls for sex, and went to prison for it.  My uncle said this man was just ""misunderstood"" and that the girls were really just crack whores that deserved it.  When I disagreed, he told me I just didn't understand how manipulative women were, because I was still just eight and didn't understand ""men"" or their ""urges"" that women play against them to get what they want. 

I don't know. It's a sticky situation. I feel bad for even writing this out, and I just need something or someone to let me know their thoughts about this. It's driving me crazy, and I feel so guilty and I don't know why, and I feel sick and betrayed, but I feel like I don't deserve to feel this way.  It's seriously worrying me and if I don't get it out there to someone I seriously think I'm going to go insane.  I can't tell family, or friends, and I've only told my boyfriend who doesn't really know how to respond or go about giving me advice but he tries and I'm just really, really confused about this. 

I feel stupid, like I'm an idiot for not seeing something, and at the same time I feel like my idiocy is from me not being understanding of my uncle enough.  It's making me sick.  I'm just going to end this here because I'm having a bit of a panic right now, and I don't want to keep rambling.  If anyone could give me advice or their thoughts on this, thank you, I don't really know what to do or say anymore.",17Mar2020,1
621,"Let me just start with how much I love my parents. From day one, they‚Äôve always been there to help learn and always made sure I have everything I need, plus more. They‚Äôve just had a hard time seeing eye-to-eye with me on most things. Ever since I was 9 or 10, everything  juststarted going downhill. 

Including a lot of details for why I feel like I‚Äôm holding my family back. 

They wouldn‚Äôt beat me, but they would punish me nearly every day for something. Even for something as simple as not picking up some trash that I didn‚Äôt see, was too bad for them. I rarely could have fun, because they would take away my toys or video games pretty much every day. As I got older it began to get much worse. They would complain about how I am ‚Äúspoiled and ungrateful.‚Äù This was always like a punch in the stomach, because I always would feel bad for being dependent in the first place. I rarely asked for things either. I‚Äôve been trying to get a job since 14 because I wanted to pay for myself, but they wouldn‚Äôt let me (rightfully so). 

My dad has always been nice to me about everything. But- today, that‚Äôs subject to change if he‚Äôs in a bad more or if you make him mad. You can‚Äôt argue with him, because he HAS to be right every time. If you try to reason or explain yourself, you‚Äôll be punished for not ‚Äúshutting up when I told you to.‚Äù My mom would get pissed at me for not obeying him and ‚Äújust stop talking,‚Äù but why should I not have an opportunity to explain myself past a quarter of a sentence. I don‚Äôt know how many times I got slapped by him for that, but I don‚Äôt like being censored because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the child and I don‚Äôt pay bills,‚Äù ‚Äúyou shut up when I tell you to.‚Äù

My mom works because my dad has spinal issues that prevents him from doing so. She‚Äôs always been nice to me as well as my dad, but it‚Äôs the same issues. What I really don‚Äôt like how she can be hypocritical when it comes to me and my sister. She‚Äôll (lightly) argue with him from time to time about some of his narcissistic tendencies when they have a disagreement, but- she strangely picks up the same tendencies when they‚Äôre arguing with me about something. She‚Äôll even consider it disrespectful and berate me when him when I don‚Äôt roll over and just accept when he acts like that towards me, but she‚Äôs slamming doors when he acts like that towards her. 

The last straw was a few days ago when I asked for an upgrade on my phone because it was slowing down and dying too fast. I proposed to pay the financing and a portion of the bill so it‚Äôll be the same as what they‚Äôre paying now until I can get a job when the pandemic cools down. I had only spoke a sentence or two and my dad misinterpreted something I said which made him think I was asking for a flagship or something (it was a cheap pre owned phone). His dominance kicked in and started shouting ‚ÄúITS NOT GONNA HAPPEN‚Äù over and over. I tried to elaborate and I said ‚Äúwait you gotta hear me out.‚Äù He jumped up from his seat and said ‚ÄúKEEP TELLING ME WHAT I GOTTA DO,‚Äù and walking up like he was gonna hit me (probably was but changed his mind). He then snatched my phone and said ‚Äúshut the hell up talking to me, go to your room.‚Äù I started crying out loud and said ‚Äúyou always do this‚Äù and he said ‚Äúshut up‚Äù again. All while my mom is sitting there pretending it‚Äôs not happening. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs normal for kids to not have opportunities to explain themselves or if I‚Äôm just special. 

This is why I decided I‚Äôll never ask them for anything outside of what I need. I never ask them for things and tend to find the money to pay for it myself because they already have their hands tied. It‚Äôs not that they said no, it‚Äôs just how deeply negative the energy felt when he was screaming at me. My dad also disowned me for 2 days one time, but that‚Äôs a story on its own. 

What do I do so I can leave this situation? I‚Äôve tried literally everything to no avail. I can‚Äôt count how many times they‚Äôve said they‚Äôll listen to me more and was wrong every time. I think I‚Äôm holding them back by just being around all day, every day. I think they‚Äôd like it better if I weren‚Äôt around 24/7. I do believe that I‚Äôm too dependent despite my efforts to be independent. I‚Äôve done mounds of research and I understand how shitty life will be, but I think it‚Äôd help me feel better about myself and help them to save some money and a headache.",17Mar2020,1

638,"I‚Äôm 24, not a very materialistic person. When I was younger (15-21) I helped run a refinishing business with my old man and was banking pretty hard for my age. Didn‚Äôt really care about the money in the long run cause I was unhappy and didn‚Äôt have a lot of fun in my teen years. Instead bought a van and moved out west. Had roommates for a year, and then I ended up living out of my van for 7 months after. This whole time I didn‚Äôt care, and I was just partying and doing things I didn‚Äôt get to do back home. 

These days I work at a local bar / restaurant serving and bartending, probably make roughly 2k a month which I know isn‚Äôt shit, especially cause I was making 25/hr + back home. 

I am now incredibly insecure about the money I make. Especially because everyone in my current city is a rich kid and has their parents money, which has allowed them to go to expensive schools and make money of their own. My van got stolen and I can‚Äôt afford another car right now, especially with the corona virus scare. 

Maybe this is silly, but I feel like my income is going to prevent me from finding a partner. Like no matter who I date, they‚Äôll realize that I‚Äôm not shit and leave me for some kid who can drive his dads vintage muscle cars or some business dude. I can‚Äôt even do side jobs now because my van is gone along with all my equipment. 

Am I over thinking it? Or am I really just garbage now? I usually go out with a lot of girls but it ends up being a one night stand deal and 90% of them don‚Äôt want to see me again. But I‚Äôm kinda getting tired of endless hook ups and like the idea of having somebody around who actually gives a shit about me.

645,"This post is long and full of errors and I hope y'all forgive me for that - English is not my native language.

I am a medical doctor and I live and work outside US. I work in an almost municipal clinic located in a very beautiful spot in the city, this clinic is one of the oldest and is very well respected and it has horrific working conditions. On the surface it's all rainbows and unicorns - everyone is very friendly and we have a big room with extra computers, coffee machines and other pleasant stuff, head physician gives you extra money for your first three months here and really at first I tried to even invite people I knew to work here too. The working conditions are very different from what other clinics have and it's almost more simple to work here than anywhere else...

But yeah. It was a nice top of the iceberg. Everyone around here was talking how people didn't stay here for too long, they worked for a year or two and then left because the conditions are horrible and the head physician is as dumb as a tree. I didnt think much of it because I was determined just to do my job. No gossiping, befriending anybody (im a huge introvert so i dont need lots of people around), going to parties and again - gossiping.  I thought I could pull this off going to work, doing my job and then leaving home for my friends and family. At first I was stunned at the amount of unfairness going on and was quite depressed for the first month because of it. For example, if a patient complained to the head of the department that you laughed at them or was smiling the whole time of the examination, it was your fault entirely. No explanation like 'I was just friendly and just smiling at them' was acceptable. Here's a paper and a pen and I need your explanatory memorandum on my desk for the head physician in 15 minutes. Patient was always right even if was talking plain medical nonsense because they could possibly call the health hot line and complain there and the clinic would lose money. Okay, I quickly swallowed the idea that no one had my back at this job but me but was still pretty determined to just work and go home.

Then I realized I'm leaving more and more late every day when I worked morning hours and I'm forced to go in more and more early when I was working evening hours. All I was doing was filling in reports, writing reports, writing reports that your bosses lost, getting patients cards ready for the inspection, preparing medical examination cards and reports and so on and on and on. That was exhausting and then I first decided that I probably don't wanna work here at all but I didn't leave right away because here I have a scheduled one month long vacation in the summer and no one would give me that at my new workplace because of the 6 month work you have to perform beforehand. 

I'm gonna leave out lots of irrelevant and stupid and unfair stuff my bosses did and finally get to the point. In the end of January head physician said we work a lot and can ask him for a raise because we work more hours than our papers say we should. So we did. On February I asked the head of the department if I got a raise and can count on it because I'm in a lots of troubles and frankly just need the money - she said yes you have it. I relaxed and in the middle of the month I filled in a paper and went for a short vacation for a week (honestly speaking I wouldn't be alive if not for that vacation) and returned in the start of March. It was just the time head of the department said NONE of us got the raise we asked for because in the past year we didn't make enough money for the clinic and we're out of the budget. The exact words were not that the head physician did not sigh our papers but that he sighed them and then withdrew them. He just fucking changed his mind. 

At that time I kinda just went with it. The idea that I wasn't the only one without a raise clouded my judgement and I thought that it's okay, I'll get the next time I just need to work hard. So I asked for two extra shifts and in the end agreed on three. I'm a total idiot, I know.

On Thursday we received our payslips and it was the end of my wish to work here at all. Guess what: some of us got the raise and some of us didn't. You would think it depended on the amount of work we've done? No no no no no. The fun part is that people who ASKED for a raise and wrote a paper for it DID NOT get the raise but the people who DID NOT ask for it because getting a raise here doubles your responsibilities got it. 

We tried to talk to the HRs and heard that they did not receive any papers from us. Three of my colleagues tried to talk to the head physician and failed cuz he ignored them. I found myself a new clinic where my good friend works and where these nightmares don't happen and coincidentally enough I got sick on Monday and my next working day is the next Monday so I have a whole week to sort this out. 

My plan is that I go to work the next Monday, work for two more weeks, get another sick leave for a week, file my resignation paper and after that there's my birthday vacation for another week, so on 27th of April I'm free of this shithole. But I don't know how to work there anymore.

Where I live we have very little tests I guess because the doctors arnt using them. If you dont have every symptom then the doctor says you are good. (The doctors here has always been very careless and dismissive)

Issue here is, I just had a Horroble flu where I felt like o was dying for a week and a half. My manager thinks what I have now is the remnants of my old sickness and is dismissing it.

My coworker has been quarantined. They caught it at the right time because he was quarantined the moment she showed symptoms but came to work the day before so all is good right? Wrong. This is contagious, up to the first day of contraction and can take up to 4 days to get symptoms. 

There isnt enough people working here to cover if I go and quarantine,the company knows that. If I go on quarantine, then technically everyone should because in my job i come in direct contact with nearly everyone. I have to touch nasty stuff ( Washing CONSTANTLY).

I honestly dont know what to do here. I dont think I should be at work, this is dangerous. Although I know if the doctor checks me out. he will look into my throat, tell me to say Ahh, and say I'm good. This is what hes done with people so far while testing them.

651,"Move out or stay? (self.movingout) submitted a minute ago by rymelxoxo So over the past few years, my parents have added a lot of unnecessary stress to my life. It began my second year in college when I began dating someone. My dad did not approve because he was of another race. He said a lot of horrible things to me and threatened to pull me out of my university and make me stay home. I lied and said I'll just be friends with the guy. We continued to be together and my dad tracked me and threatened private investigators. All the while, my mom battled with her alcoholism. My boyfriend had a rough upbringing and does not have any family financial support. My mom always stood up for me and had my back and supported us. Fast forward, we have been dating for over 3 years now. My dad recently just met my boyfriend over the holidays and it went fine.
For spring break, me and my mom went to florida, where my boyfriend now lives. We are currently long distance and have been for a year. My mom has been relapsing and I witnessed her order a drink on our 7am flight. I was so upset she would do this while I was watching her one row behind. Basically on spring break, one night mom left me and him at the dinner table and put her card down and said she was going back to the hotel cuz we weren‚Äôt talking and then she changed her mind and took the card and left... so he thought that was her taking a jab at me to hurt my feelings so he was upset by that.. then were back in the hotel room and moms trying to hangout with us but my boyfriend wanted to leave cuz of everything w her drinking at the beginning of the trip and now this.. she said we hurt her feelings because we wouldn‚Äôt go get ice cream with her after dinner.. and all my bf said your too grown to be doing this shit and laughed (this was disrespectful but he meant it about arguing with us) and she thought he said ""your too old to be an addict"" (mind you she was drinking this day, and he talks pretty quit. she completely misheard him).. i 100% heard him and he did not say that.. so then mom called her friend and my boyfriend heard her say racist stuff so now he‚Äôs sick of the racism shit coming from our family.. and wants nothing to do with my parents.
My parents want to control my life and make me move home from universty but i think i will be rather unhappy there. But, my parents still have a financial advantage over me because I do not pay majority of my own bills yet. I am a senior in college and my parents are paying my rent until july... its 1,000 a month. i only have 100 in my account currently because all of my money goes into a savings account controlled by my dad. No one in my family, including cousins who are all between 20-28 years of age still live at home and are ""perfect"" in there parents eyes. I cannot say the same for myself.
Does this sound toxic or am I in the wrong? What should I do? Any insight or advice is appreciated.

652,"My university handled COVID-19 the worst way possible. Originally, if you applied to a form, you could stay on campus which is what I originally did. However, as of yesterday, since the first confirmed case was discovered in our large city, absolutely everyone (including international students and immuno-compromised students!) is being forced out of their dorms. There are a lot of people going homeless right now. I'm lucky enough that I do have a home to go even if it is cross country, and my dad is helping me move out because I have CFS and several muscle issues.

My dad is wonderful and I wish I lived with him but he has no space in his house and my grandparents and great aunt live with him (so he can take care of them) and I don't want to further compromise them. I live with my mom who, growing up, was infamously abusive.

For an entire day my six year old sister was forced to call up relatives and pack all her stuff just to have my mom tell her that it was a test and that if she ever forgot again, she would really be disowned. She forced me to drink rotten milk because she didn't want me to waste food (we were well off pre-2008 and this was not necessary at all) and when I tried to dump it into the sink, she yelled at me and pulled my hair. 

The worst part is that during this time I was being sexually groomed. I was groomed by a family friend who moved in with us after the financial crash and I was so susceptible to it because my mother was so awful, my father was always at work (and was being gaslit and abused by my mother about what was going on as well), and my abuser was the only adult present in my life who was relatively kind to me and gave me a lot of presents. After he had moved out and after I grew up and realized the things he did to me were not okay by any means, I tried to tell my mom when he visited for a friendly dinner, but she refused to listen to me. I was fourteen at the time and she refused to listen to me because I was being dramatic and she didn't want to ruin dinner. I never brought it up again. 

She says that she's sorry about everything since I've gone off to college? Though she never brought up the sexual abuse stuff. I actually think she doesn't remember. However, she refuses to allow there to be a lock on my door and she doesn't knock no matter how many times I ask her to. My sister (who honestly got it worse than I did) said that she thinks that our mom is trying and that I should extend that sympathy. But I had issues with CFS during a family trip and she got mad at me for being dramatic and ruining it for everyone when it was legitimately difficult for me to walk and do touristy stuff and she told me all she wanted was her daughter to ""smile and be happy"".

So I just have no idea what to do. She smothers me and gets sad or angry every time I want to be by myself and doesn't respect privacy. And while she has improved since I was a kid, I always feel on edge when I'm at home and every time she says my name I panic and every time she tries to hug me I think she's going to hit me again. During the summer, I could occasionally walk to the park or go to the library or spend time at a friend's house but I can't do that. I'm trying my best to get an internship every summer so I don't have to spend time in that house, but in this case I can't. What do I do?",17Mar2020,1

654,"My granny is 76 ,one of her lungs isnt working. With this whole coronavirus im scared/worried for her. My sister whos 26 has a 2 year old and shes been living with my granny for 2 years now. Doesnt pay rent, doesnt clean house. The child never went to daycare. She makes my granny take care of her since she was born. 

My family doesnt have my grannys back. My uncle told my sister good for you, dont pay rent, she can afford it. My dad has my sisters back, says she shouldnt leave my granny house and its normal for child to be taken care by her great grandmother. 

Im shacken. I tried calling support for my granny but she wont take it. She told my sister to leave but told me shes scared of my sister. She yells back at my granny. And my granny then feels bad. She like i dont want any more problems and i know if i kick her out your dad will hate me and so will my sons/my uncles. My mom is the only one who finds it disgusting. So she doesnt want family to go against her. Because literally no one has my grannys back and she thinks its normal for her to do this. 

She told me that my sister doesnt even buy food for her child. Shell tell my sister "" oh your daughter finished the cereal and milk and thats what she eats in morning. U should buy more""... she doesnt and my granny feel bad for child and buys it instead. She also doesnt cook. Shell come home late with child and expect food to be there. My granny says sometimes she comes home @10pm and poor child hasnt slept and theres no food she brings that i have to cook for her because i cant just let her not eat. 

And since the whole coronavirus my sister brings the child outside and then expects my granny to take care of her child. The child going out can catch virus and give to my grand mother. And my suster could work at home, but decides not to so shes out all day working with a boss who just travelled to USA and didnt quarantine himself and my sister talks with him in person. Then comes home to my granny. Doesnt clean anything. Touches same things my granny does. 

My granny has a huge basement thats empty. My mom and me told her to atleast live there and to work from home. My sister refuses. My sister is very selfish and doesnt care about my granny. Shes only been taking advantage of my granny. 

Im stuck. I dont know what to do. I want to contact child services and let them know my poor neice isnt getting treated right; mom no buy food for child or ever make food for child. And i wanna call elderly abuse place so my granny can stay at home alone to not be susceptible to catch it. 

I spoke to my sister, she blocked me and got mad at me when i told her to stay in basement till she find place and to also work from home. She told me its none of my business. And i told her my granny health is my business. 

My mom told me to not say this to anyone because shes my sister and i shouldnt go against her and i should pray for her. Im literally feeling so stuck as what i should do. I feel like an accomplish to all this. Elder abuse especially and i must do something. I just dont know what. Please help!!!",17Mar2020,1
655," First and foremost, I know I myself am not some perfect being, and have suffered a lot of mental health problems in my life, so I know I did some things I wasn't proud of during this time I'm about to get into. 

 I moved in with my best friend and her partners, thinking I'd be with people who understood mental health and would support me like they support each other. Her boyfriend is a behavior therapist and runs an anxiety group but never seemed to turn off his ""therapist"" persona when home. He is also a narcissist and manipulative and thinks everyone is below him, something I didn't know about him until I moved in. 

Everything had to go his way, and if it didn't it was your fault and you needed to fix it. Anytime I went to talk to him, be it a positive or not, the conversation would always go with him belittling me and demeaning me. Going back to school? ""Well its not a standard college so if your diploma really going to be valid?"" Looking for part time job due to the strain of school and a full time job would be too much for my mental health? ""I managed to be full time student and full time employee, if I can do it so can you."" It got to the point I never even wanted to say hello to him less he find something to insult me with. 

 His favorite thing to do though was hold these ""meetings"" with the four of us. No one else could speak and he'd interrupt anyone who did, despite hating when we interrupted him. The ""meetings"" would always be ""I want things to go this way, and I'm going to twist everyone else here into giving it to me."" I never gave in though, and he would always end up insulting me yet saying ""I'm saying this as a friend/ it's not my fault you can't take criticism/ you need to learn how to deal with it!"" When I'm thinking ""if you where my friend you wouldn't keep insulting me"" I was spinning a downward spiral because I stopped feeling safe to go to anyone as it always went to him in the end, I couldn't confide in my best friend because her mind had been twisted by him so badly she thinks it's all okay and he's right. It all cane to a head a few weeks ago, I snapped mentally and felt so alone and inhuman and pathetic I came home that evening, went straight to my room, and self harmed. I was in full on crisis, my friend coming up to find me and haphazardly tried to console me, but in the end had to attend to his needs as ""it's my night with him"" I was still emotionally high a few days later when he demanded another dreaded meeting, this time he basically said ""because of your crisis I don't want you living here anymore"" and me, being emotionally charged, said some things I wasn't proud of and stormed off before I got too far and would most likely have physically harmed him. He saw my walking away as avoiding the situation, that I need to ""express my emotions as they come instead of hiding them"" I'm sorry, did you really want me to dissociate and harm you/ scare my friend? I walked away because I knew I was going too far mentally, and the last thing I ever want to do is let it take over. 

 He basically expedited my move out time as well, my friend said a week and I was to see my therapist for options for living situation (since I'm in school I can't leave town). He bombarded me the day before my meeting and twisted it so I had to leave the next day. I'm still reeling from this, the person I thought was my best friend just sat there and let it happen, didn't try to stand up for me, and half assed consoled me with ""enjoy the drive"" as I was to be heading to my parents who live 2 hours away. The whole time my head is spinning, how could she let this boy control everyone's lives like it's a game? How could she choose him over me, someone she's been friends with for over a decade while only knows him for a few years? I was disgusted, this boy had no remorse and was HAPPY to see me sobbing into my phone with my mom telling her to come get me. 

Overall my experience with this person has left me mentally drained and disgusted that he can call himself a mental health worker. If he treated me like that who's to say he isn't making his clients feel the same? He took every opportunity to belittle, degrade, invalidate, and twist my words to get his way, the thought that he's ""helping"" others makes me sick.

 So I ask, after that long-winded rant, if I obtain his work info, could I potentially get him fired or at least put under watch for this behavior? If not I'll understand and keep working on healing from this traumatic experience. I also will understand if this is more for r/legaladvice or another subreddit, I didn't consider this a r/relationshipadvice so I went for the more general subreddit.

*I understand that it was their home, and they had every right to say who lives there and who doesn't, but the manner in which it was addressed was not the right way to do it. I have talked with my family and other friends who agree this person is a monster. I have also come to the realization that the person who I called my best friend is no longer and I am fully prepared to sever the relationship for my own mental health, but I will still pray she ""wakes up""*",17Mar2020,1

I have a group of friends whom I really love.  It's fun to be with them and they help me in a lot of things. The only problem I have is that they tease me so much to the point that I sometimes feel like crying.

There were times when I was drunk and did stupid things, and since then I was always called as the drunkard and the messy one (since I kind of messed up that night) and since then, some people think that I really am a drunkard and that I am a mess. Sometimes, when I try to speak up, they do not take me seriously. I get the feeling that they feel like I am too talkative sometimes that's why I stay quiet now. Whenever I share opinions, I feel like they don't listen. I have also been labeled as the 'stupid' one. It used to be funny, but now it hurts. The more they tell me that I am stupid, the more I start thinking that maybe I really am.  I don't tell them about it because I feel like it will ruin the mood. But it really hurts.

How do I fix this? I feel like it‚Äôs a matter of anger management, but it‚Äôs also possible I just need a way to hide my negative emotions.",17Mar2020,1

686,"This is something I‚Äôve really been struggling with for 2 years now. 2 years ago, I was sexually assaulted by a friend of my ex girlfriend. My ex, and I were friends, and she was friends with my, now ex, best friend. 

The day after I was assaulted, my mom took me to the police station to report it, took me to the SVU to speak to a detective and what not. The detective told me to go to the ER and get a rape kit done. 

Prior to getting all this done, my ex came over the next day to see if I was okay, and she was there when I told my parents. My dad was enraged, and he screamed at my ex to ‚Äúget the fuck out of my house‚Äù and pretty much blamed her for what happened to me bc I met my rapist through her. My ex went to my best friend‚Äôs house after that, and they hung out all day. They were posting on Snapchat of them going to the mall, playing video games and whatnot while I was in the hospital getting the rape kit done and what not. 

While I was getting this all done, my ex kept texting me asking me why I didn‚Äôt defend her against my dad and why I let him yell at her, etc. She knew I was in the hospital going through all this, she knew my mom was next to me sobbing. I was texting my (ex) best friend asking for support and updating her about it all, but she was ignoring my texts. 

Her excuse was that she had fallen asleep, or she was at the mall, or playing video games and was not near her phone. I was hurt, devastated really because she was my best friend and I just needed her support but she wasn‚Äôt there. I felt so alone and I felt betrayed because she was comforting my ex girlfriend when I really needed the comfort. 

I felt like she cared more about my ex girlfriends feelings than mine. Later that day, I called my ex girlfriend flipping out bc she just kept harassing me asking me why I didn‚Äôt defend her against my father. I think I blacked out bc at one point, someone had taken my phone and I was in my moms arms sobbing.

I should mention that my cousin, who also eventually left as well, took my phone and flipped out on my (ex) best friend for not being there and hanging out with a ‚Äúcreatin‚Äù as she called my ex instead of being there for me.

Did I ruin this friendship? Do I have a right to feel upset about how the whole situation happened?

687,"First time posting so I apologize for any errors. So the titles pretty self explanatory but here‚Äôs some backstory. 

Me and my friend B met through tragic circumstances last year and it‚Äôs kinda a sad topic between us but long story short she was the girlfriend of my best friend (A)who died of a serious of unfortunate events that ultimately culminated with him dying of a head injury. I loved him like a brother and I still miss him every damn day. Me and B started of on the wrong foot admittedly by my fault, she and A had a rough relationship to say the least A and I were very close but he never talked about the fine details of his love life or introduced her to any of the friend group but it was general knowledge that it was troubled since she has had a rough life, she had been molested and  was even r**ped by her step father. 

Unfortunately when she was finally convinced to report it her family also got A arrested since he was 17 and she was 15 (16 is the age of consent)and they had had sex before it was an automatic statutory charge. A had spent some nights in jail which in our country is pretty horrific for a teenager and had to deal with being on probation and having a record for a year before the court‚Äôs decided to throw out the case due to her family not showing up to court but in the end he truly loved her and the last time we spoke he talked about how happy he was with her. So needless to say when I messaged her on Instagram to tell her the funeral times and make sure she was going to be there for him. I was a bit of an asshole in the way that I did it and she told me so. I didn‚Äôt do it for any other reason than because all of our friend group did gaf if she showed or not and his family hates her guts but I felt like I had to at least make an effort to make sure she was informed of the times of the wake and funeral. 

After we had all left the cemetery I saw her walking home with her friend and thanked her for showing up,she looked a bit confused but gave me a smile and I thought that was it and I‚Äôd never hear from her again. I ended in getting a message from her on apologizing for not recognizing me since she didn‚Äôt have her glasses on and didn‚Äôt really recognize me. She thanked me for keeping her informed and I told her it was no problem and that I was doing it for A. Well then me and B started just talking at first just about A and all the good memories we had of him and how much we missed him. Eventually we realized how much we had in common and after a while decided to hang out in person. Now B is a very attractive female and though I acknowledged that I also knew that she was off limits out of the respect and love I had for A. Honestly part of the reason I even kept talking to B is because I knew that A was a lot of her support in bad times and I knew how horrible it felt to lose the comfort that he could give, I would always tell him about my problems and he would never judge me and he‚Äôd always find a way to make the pain feel smaller than it was and find some way to get me laughing in a way nobody ever had before or since. God that‚Äôs what I miss the most about him, so I felt a sort of duty to make sure she was okay. We continued talking, he died in late January and and when Valentine‚Äôs Day came around she had wanted to hang out but I gave her an excuse because that just felt disrespectful to his memory to me. 

Nevertheless we kept hanging out and getting closer and on her birthday two months later it happened we had had a fun day that included me baking her a cake, us going for a ride, dancing to old music and hanging out at a very romantic location with tree swings and we had gone to my place. After smoking and a couple of shots we were both feeling pretty vulnerable and ended up hooking up. I didn‚Äôt last very long and was honestly very confusing since she was really into it until I heard that she had started crying which I immediately took as the sign to stop and give her some distance. Afterwards I asked if she was ok and she it wasn‚Äôt my fault and that she was just feeling a lot of different emotions and feelings. It wasn‚Äôt very awkward afterwards and we just continued on like normal but after a couple of months I just couldn‚Äôt deny that I had developed feelings for her, she is a very attractive girl who has a lot in common with me and makes me feel safe and comfortable which she say I also do for her. Well here‚Äôs where it gets complicated, when I finally decided to tell her how I felt and how I wanted to pursue something serious with her she told me how she had been talking with this other guy who she really liked and was going to start dating him. Of course I was disappointed and having been through the torture of trying to being friends with someone who I had romantic feelings for I decided it was best for me to just leave her alone and let her live her life. 

We didn‚Äôt talk for months after until one day she messaged me saying she knew I probably didn‚Äôt wanna hear from her but that she had a dream about me and just wanted to know if I was ok. At first I just sorta ignored her messages but after a while I responded to air out all the feelings and thoughts I had wanted to get out, she apologized for letting me walk away and she explained that the relationship didn‚Äôt last long and that she mainly went out with him because he reminded her of A but when she realized how immature and irresponsible he was they broke up. I was cautious to start talking to her again since I didn‚Äôt wanna get hurt but like I said we just vibe together really good. So we started hanging out and being friends but I just can‚Äôt get over my romantic feelings for her, I feel like such an asshole for not being able to just put my selfish feelings aside and be the friend she needs but it‚Äôs just eating at me. I try my hardest to ignore the jealousy and irritation I feel when she hangs out with other guys but I just can‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs the thing B is such a sweet person but due to her past traumas she has a lot of issues she has yet to work through one of them being that she finds it almost impossible to stand up for her self which has led to some messed up situations including her getting roofied and assaulted. One of my main irks is that she keeps hanging out with this guy (T) now she says that he‚Äôs her friend but the vibes he gives of honestly makes my skin crawl, they had dated for a short while but B decided it wasn‚Äôt working out so ended it. However T just sort of gives of the energy that everything he does for her is in effort to get into her pants. At one point she told me that they had been hanging out when he kissed her, she had just froze and didn‚Äôt say anything until he took her home. I asked her if she let him know that made her uncomfortable and that he had crossed a line but she just said that she doesn‚Äôt like confrontation and that he probably got the message. I told her no that if you don‚Äôt explicitly tell a guy that what he did was wrong he‚Äôs just gonna keep doing it over and over but she just brushed it off. I try to be a good friend but it‚Äôs just so painful when we‚Äôre cuddling in bed and there‚Äôs nothing more I want than to pull her in closer, kiss her and feel closer to her but I‚Äôm also extremely conscious about not making her feel uncomfortable. I truly love being her friend but my feelings are just tearing me apart inside, she has told me multiple times that she intends for her next relationship to be her last and I just know that I won‚Äôt be able to keep seeing her if she gets a boyfriend because it‚Äôll just be to painful for me.she truly means a lot to me and she says I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs always there for her but I want more than what we already have and I know that‚Äôs not her problem. so reddit should I just cut contact with her now to just rip the band aid off so to speak and begin to get over it?",17Mar2020,1
688,"This account is a potential throw away, since my partner is also on Reddit in general.

I apologize ahead of time if this gets a bit lengthy.

I have never considered myself to be a terribly ""anxious"" person, in general terms. Nor do I believe I'm depressed outside of the usual stress that crops up on occasion. However, I struggle with being secure and confident in a world that, while they claim understanding and consideration, the reality is not always the case. 

I'm preparing to head into a retail management position, which means running my own store location (managing finances, a sales floor and a crew of maybe 8 to 15+ people depending on the location). I have been in a training program and working up to it for a while, and have been in ""management"" positions in the past, so I really felt like I could do this and I really want this, except.. This will be my first time expected to go 100% solo. 

I am SO scared. I hate to admit it.

At the moment, I am the sole breadwinner for our household. My husband is so incredibly supportive and I love him so much, but we both are fully aware that if -ANYTHING- happens with my job-- as in, if I get fired for any reason or decide I can't handle it and quit, that's our income down the drain. He reminds me that I am a strong person, and could essentially ""fake it 'til you make it"" kind of thing until I get my footing, but that doesn't really help me feel any better about myself or the situation. I still get stressed thinking about it.

I've watched videos and read articles about gaining confidence, about how to handle people in the work place, and have had on the job training... But can I shake this fear? I don't know how to cope with it. What my husband doesn't know is that I get so worked up over this sometimes, I just break down and shut down. I cry and get worked up over the potential that... things don't go as planned. Then what do I do? How would I accept the fact that I essentially fucked up the one thing I really wanted to do in my career? Where would we go after that?

I love this company, and have been here for a total of four years... I don't want to mess that up. I don't want to have to start over somewhere else... Even though I know it's happened to people in the past, especially with recent economic events.

Complaining sucks, and feeling afraid or helpless sucks. I'm incredibly lucky to be where I am, I just hope I don't become my own worst enemy. I don't want to fail my family, and all the work I've put in to this. I don't know how to be strong right now. I don't have anyone else to talk to about this right now... Other people I've spoken with seem to think I'll do just great and I let things get to my head too much..

What should I do? How do I handle this?

TL;DR- Been in retail for years and have on the job training for a management position I'm about to get into, but I'm so afraid of not doing well. I feel insecure and don't want to fail despite wanting this career and needing this good job to support my family. How do I handle this?",17Mar2020,1

So let me give some context.
I'm living with my mom and my grandmother. My moms legs are really weak because of a life long disease that she has. She can't move around the house by herself and needs me or my grandma or both to help her get up. My dad died when i was a kid so he's not around to help anymore. I live in a 3rd world country with no basic human rights, terrible employment rates for graduates and an insane number of conservative or borderline religous extremists living in it. Ever since i was a kid i was attracted to western media and culture, so now that I'm a little older i don't fit in AT ALL.I rarely find people who share the same interests as me. I have a small group of friends who share some of the same interests but we're not that close,so I'm pretty lonely.  To put it simply, there is NO future for me here. I can't see myself living here after i reach 24 and if i can't get out by then i don't think i can keep living like this.  
 

I'm in my last year of HS and i've always wanted to travel to another country to study and live. I feel trapped in the current life i have. I can't do any of the stuff i love because of my mother and because of the country i live in. My english is good enough for most of the countriea that i'm interested in and my grades are pretty good so getting accepted is really not a problem.
 Leaving this place literaly the only thing i have ever wanted but the thought of leaving my mom here makes me sick. My mom has two brothers who are stronger than me, meaning if she were to move in with one of them they could easily help here move around the house and go to the bathroom, unlike me who is starting to have chronic back pain at age 18, from lifting her up. One of my uncles is actually trying to help me get the things i need for leaving and says that he could take care of her. Even my mom says that she would love to see me leave this shit-hole and succeed somewhere else.
In every single one of the fantasies and dreams that i have about my future and where i'll be in the future, non of them are here. I'm simply taking it day by day and just surviving until the day that i leave. But still i just can't imagine leaving doing that if it means leaving her behind. So my question is, do i waste the one chance i get at this life, or leave my family and pursue my dreams?

And he's not coming back to here until May.

However, every day when I come home, I'm so tired/uninspired that I don't want to do anything, yet I can't fall asleep. Sometimes I'll take a melatonin and fall asleep at 6 pm.

702,"Hi, I don't have anyone else to turn to for advice right now so I thought I would try this.

I'm 17 and for my whole life have been told something's wrong with me by my father. Since I was little, he stopped me from seeing friends and called me names. He wanted to control everything: from the way I dressed, to what sports I could play, the food I ate and whether or not certain family members came to visit. I am so grateful to my Mother, who is compassionate and accepts me unconditionally. However, she is worn down from being in a relationship for over 20 years where she is berated and insulted every time she tries to protect me. She has learned to accept that nothing she ever says will be listened to. My Father constantly barrages her with criticisms: she makes less money than him yet she should pay the bills, she doesn't respect him and if she did then he would respect her because she is kind to me she is ""spoiling me"" and I should be left alone to cry because ""that's how the real world works"". It's gotten so extreme that she can't make any gentle suggestion without him lashing out.

Over the years, I've struggled emotionally. From a young age, I was bullied and this only further brought on his comments of me being a ""loser"". Everything is about the surface: he has always advised me to force fake friendships so I could be ""normal"", which intuitively felt wrong. I might add that I have been formally diagnosed as a Highly Sensitive Person and Empath, so this treatment cuts my heart like a knife. I've prayed many times for God to take me away from this- I'm not suicidal (there are so many beautiful things in this world I want to live for), but as my parents aren't married and if we were to leave we would be bankrupt. My Father does not contribute to my basic needs and makes me feel guilty for food (i.e. I have a gut condition and can't digest any dairy, so I have to eat non-dairy yogurt which is more expensive) even though he will buy himself all manner of things (expensive gardening equipment, clothes). At age 13, I started to develop anxiety and low self-esteem. This created the perfect storm: evidence for him to accuse me of being ""crazy"" and needing to be admitted into a ""psych ward"". Except that every psychiatrist I've ever seen has said I'm traumatized. Not crazy. When he hears this, he never takes any responsibility: ""I'm sorry you think you're traumatized (not admitting an expert has stated this) but if you only respected me more/ gave me a chance (even though I have always forgiven him) then you wouldn't have mental issues.""

It's always twisted to become my fault. And every psychiatrist who's commented on his abusive behavior is dismissed as a charlatan (even those with degrees from respected universities). And on top of all that, any trauma treatment would have to be paid out of my own pocket (I'm 17 and chronically ill, which I will explain below. I can't get a job right now).

Things reached a breaking point when, at age 16, I developed a series of chronic health conditions. Knowing what I know now about the massive link between trauma and the manifestation of physical health conditions, I can now see in hindsight that this was likely in part due to extreme emotional turmoil throughout my life resulting in PTSD. Instead of this acting as an impetus for a change in his behavior to support my healing, I instead was treated as though I was a deranged hypochondriac, imagining symptoms and being oversensitive. Apparently, my ""negative attitude"" was all that was to blame. Feeling alienated, I turned to my Mother who immediately understood the reality of the situation and has been my only supporter in advocating for health. As bullying persisted at school, it got to the point where the stress was of such detriment to my symptoms we were forced to make the difficult decision to switch to home study in the middle of the school year, with my most important exams in only 6 months. Despite this, I worked hard and managed to score 100% in one of my papers. Still, this wasn't enough for him. He never once complimented my efforts or granted me the parental approval I so eagerly sought.

After one of my Mother's parents and my cherished grandparent died, he was cold and unsupportive, seemingly not registering the gaping hole of this loss. I just accepted it. There was nothing I could do. Then on Christmas day this year (2019), my Mother and I were in a car accident. By the grace of God, we were lucky to escape alive and uninjured, the only damage being to our car. At this time, nothing else mattered to me except family. In the ambulance, I felt a rush of emotions and called him, hoping that I could apologize for whatever it was that I had done to sabotage the relationship and promise to make things right. I was met with a cold, curt response showing little concern that I could have been killed. It was a sharp jolt back to reality. Instead of respecting our trauma, he deliberately drove past the location of the accident with us in the car when there were other routes he could have chosen. He guilt shamed my Mother (who was the driver), claiming that he would never be reckless enough to get into an accident. Knowing from experience that there was nothing I could do to alter his response, so I again accepted it.

The final nail in the coffin came with the alarming pandemic, Covid-19. It has reached the point where there is widespread concern, and we are all beginning to feel the imminence of spread, concerned for our family and friends. During this time, solidarity is needed more than ever. However, my Father does not seem to understand this. He wants to go to his pottery class (his justification is ""you have to keep living life, Social isolation is like a jail cell, I won't get it, stop trying to prevent my freedom of movement etc..."". The only advice to prevent infection is to flatten the curve. I am immunocompromised, and people younger than my Mother have died. All I want is to protect her, but his volatility and refusal to act unselfishly puts us at risk. I spent hours trying to convince him, begging him, to social isolate. My mother and I have made the same sacrifices, but he believes he is above the law and knows much better than a 17-year-old like myself. Again came the barrage of accusations: the usual ""crazy"", ""hermit"", ""over-anxious"". But he really crossed the line when comparing me to the ""Gestapo"" (Nazi police). This was highly disrespectful not only to those sufferers of WW2, but also to our family history as his Grandfather was actually interrogated by the Gestapo, and my Grandmother almost starved to death under their impositions. This has got to the point where I can't just accept it anymore. He has Covert narcissistic personality disorder, and the most dangerous thing about this is he is so charming to outsiders that nobody would believe me if I told them what he is really like. I have no other living family members who would be able to look after me if my Mother (who is the only person who knows about the abuse and who acknowledges my health conditions) sadly passed away from Covid-19. If I had to live with my Dad alone, I know I would physically and psychologically deteriorate. Because of my illnesses, I am unfit to work and would have no means of financial independence to get away from him. And yet, because my country is not making social isolation compulsory, he is free to do as he pleases, blowing up my whole world in his wake. He is in such denial that he dismisses expert's advice, insisting he knows better. One of the hallmarks of narcissism as an inability to express empathy, and no matter what I say or do there is nothing that I can do which will make him change.

703,"Hi, it's my first post here so don't really know how to make it, and I live in France, if that makes any difference  
So there are these new neighboors just in front of us that have  large trucks for transporting pebbles and stuff (probably masonry workers), the issue is they leave a lot of pebble on the road, and when they do their U-turn (just in front of our house, sometimes going in) their wheels press on the pebbles and eject them with high enough velocity to leave major impacts on our wind-shields.  
Happened to 2 cars before confronting him, and he totally denied. I bought a car few days ago, parked it home and today I see 3 impacts on the windshield...

Replacing it would cost more than the car itself so I'm probably gonna drive it until it breaks then send the car to scrap, but my father got his car out of the garage today and we really don't want to have damage on this one.

- one school has just closed down and our brand is aimed at that age range
-the person leading the conference is currently in self isolation after traveling to four places and getting very sick 


My work is having a managers conference on the 31st of March in Christchurch and they still haven‚Äôt said they are going to cancel it.

When the vought was gone I went back to work, but still had a stuffy nose. 2 weeks later I have a very slightly runny nose. Its hardly noticable. Last Friday I felt bad, and went to the e.r. to see if they could test me for caronavirus. The women on the phone said they would test me for a couple other viruses, and if I came up positive for one, then they wouldnt test me for coronavirus. When I talked to the dr int he e.r. and told him my symptoms he casually said ""oh you dont have coronavirus. Toud either recover in a couple weeks, or die. I didnt want to be rude, or question him so I just said okay. I ended up being diagnosed with recovery of a bacterial infection or something. I asked him if it's okay to go back to work, and he said yes. I asked the nurse after that, and she said that we reccomend you stay at home for a few days. Well, I stayed home for the weekend, and whent back to work. Yesterday I didnt have a runny nose at all, but today it feels very, very slightly runny. I tend to allergies, and my nose tends to get runny when it's cold out. I feel guilty being at work for the slightest of symptoms though. I'm certainly not broke. I have about 7k in saving, and 60k in a trust fund, but I was a really bad job hopper before this. I already took 7 days odd this month, and I feel my employers are close to letting me go.

709,"I was planning on moving out around October so I could save up some emergency funds, but I just can‚Äôt take it here at my house anymore.

I suffered abuse from both of my parents, my mom when I was 5 and she burned me and abandoned me, and my dad most of my life after he got custody of me, he mostly never cares about me outside of the basics and treats me like shit.

For example, just recently I just got a new job and I‚Äôm working hard to pay off the heavy amount of bills I got right now so I‚Äôm barely home throughout the day. Me and my brother usually rake leaves on the weekend, last weekend we didn‚Äôt do it because it was both of our birthdays, this weekend we didn‚Äôt because I was at work. But I told him before this weekend started ‚ÄúHey dad, I‚Äôm off for spring break this week and probably next week because of the Corona virus. I‚Äôm planing on doing the leaves and cleaning the whole house this week since I‚Äôm working‚Äù. But I guess he didn‚Äôt care to listen because I came home yesterday and he was yelling about the leaves not being done, saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear it‚Äù after telling him I told him I‚Äôd do them during spring break. He told me I shouldn‚Äôt put work above my home and I can‚Äôt do that as an adult, because he doesn‚Äôt. Keep in mind, I have a bunch of bills past due, -11k in my name because I have to manage myself, and I go to college where I accidentally scheduled for way to many classes, not once has he helped me with anything, he even laughed at my 2k medical bill, yet this man has two sports cars in the shop. When I told him all of that he just told me it‚Äôs all terrible excuses, and told me that he‚Äôs not getting groceries this week and will just use the grocery money to pay someone else to do it.

I‚Äôm 19 and don‚Äôt have any money, my brother is 15, he doesn‚Äôt have any money. Why was he saying that? I don‚Äôt know... he didn‚Äôt answer me when I asked why. And that‚Äôs just the thing, anything only affecting me, he laughs and doesn‚Äôt help, but once something affects him even in the slightest, he gets mad and starts yelling at me. Case in point, he was yelling at me more about the school calling him because I told them I was having S-thoughts once, than just talking to me about it... doesn‚Äôt stop there, I could fill a book full of every shitty thing he‚Äôs done

I can‚Äôt take it here anymore, he‚Äôs so far into his own head and doesn‚Äôt care about anyone else but him. I have like, nearly ten siblings on his side for a reason, I was about to be one of his many kids he has then leaves, but I had that incident with my mom forcing him to step up. 

If I have to wait a while, there‚Äôs someone who said they‚Äôll let me stay at their place for a while and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other friends that would too, but I‚Äôm really just gunning to move out next month.

At the job I‚Äôm at right now I earn around 11.20 an hour. I don‚Äôt have an exact monthly estimate yet, but it‚Äôll maybe be around 770-1000 a month and apartments go around here for 525/530-600 a month for a single bed. I have a friend wanting to be roommates, once he gets a job he‚Äôll come and split the bill so it‚Äôs only maybe a month or two I‚Äôll have to pay the full price. I also got hired to illustrate a children‚Äôs book so that‚Äôs a second income that I can use to pay down the debt I have.

710,"So I lost my job a few weeks ago. I live with my girlfriend, we have a shared income, all is fine (I've even found a new job already). 

Recently ,we were out with some friends and my bro pulls my girlfriend aside when I leave the room and tells her not to tell me he said anything but is willing to help out because I lost my job. 

She told me and I'm pretty pissed. For context, he's the type of dude that always has to be 'the guy' has a solution, even if they're unhelpful or unasked, and constantly talks about his money. He talks about buying a building, renting studio time for his band,(only talking, never doing), how everyone else at work is incompetent, he's always doing something grandiose but it just never happens. He likes to talk about his money or position, and flaunt it when he can. 
Anyways, given his history which I think is relevant to my response, I'm pretty offended and intend to call him out. I'm sick of it and this was a last straw kinda thing, but I don't want to be tactless, he's still my brother, and my SO does believe his intentions were sincere and not an attempt to humble brag.

My (online) friend is physically disabled and therefore does a lot of gaming and other internet stuff and a year ago she was playing something and met someone and only found out a few days later after going into voice chat that he was a 14 year old kid. I would‚Äôve stopped talking to him right there but I guess it‚Äôs not uncommon for gamers to play with teens (according to my friend anyway) so whatever. Anyway she stopped playing that game but adds everyone from her games onto Discord as well. She didn‚Äôt talk to him or any of her other gamer friends for months but she said every now and then the kid would message her asking if she‚Äôd play with him and he‚Äôd say things like how he didn‚Äôt have any friends. She then found out he‚Äôd never seen any anime before and now she talks to him almost daily so he‚Äôll watch old school anime with her on Discord, which she sees as a win/win because she gets to rewatch anime she loves and introduce someone to them. She also taught him how to draw.

Their relationship isn‚Äôt inappropriate in a gross way (I know she wouldn‚Äôt do that plus she‚Äôs asexual and a lesbian, I‚Äôm not worried about that) and according to her they hardly even talk other than about games and shows. But when she told me she showed him Spirited Away and shows I impulsively said ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù which to my surprise really upset her and she said she was already worried she was creepy and didn‚Äôt need a friend calling her that etc. I said ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs a little creepy you have to admit,‚Äù and she dramatically signed off. 

Our mutual friend said I should mind my own business. But I mean, like... isn‚Äôt it creepy??? AITA for thinking adults shouldn‚Äôt be so friendly with teenagers? Like I said I‚Äôm not worried she‚Äôs being gross but other people might think so? And isn‚Äôt it kinda inherently gross to chitchat with a kid as a childless adult?

I work as a contractor for a military department. Essentially under DOD. We have several veterans and military spouses alike in this office and for awhile we all got along. A couple of months ago, I noticed several spouses continually talking for extended amounts of time in Spanish, and a coworker translated for me and essentially they were complaining about me (Caucasian) and another supervisor (Caucasian). I really just brushed it off because I have been out performing these coworkers and took it as frustration on their part. A couple of weeks ago they complained about the same supervisor handing out work unfairly and used that as an explanation as to why their work had been sub-par. This supervisor tracks what work she assigns so I know it‚Äôs all bullshit. Then they made up new complaints about another white coworker getting to pump breast milk in a private office, even though they do not even pump. No matter what it seems they are targeting this supervisor over different things, none of which are true or even deserved. This supervisor is great to work for and would hate to see her fired or quit over this. We have a meeting on Thursday to address these issues (all stemming from these two employees) and I want to use policies to help dispute them. What can I bring?

So for some back ground, my boyfriend‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs step brother (so basically my boyfriend‚Äôs cousin) is 14. He legally can not be at his house when his younger sister is there, and we live within walking distance. So, even though he‚Äôs nothing but a trouble maker, we let him stay. He never gave us any reason to not trust him. My boyfriend is 21 and i‚Äôm 19. We live alone but his mom stays here pretty often since she still owns the property. Also the school in our town recently got shooting threats. 

LC : Little cousin
BF : my boyfriend
BM : my boyfriends mom
TF : our friend who thinks he‚Äôs sooo tough

So, I came home from work Friday, and my boyfriend says ‚Äúhey, LC confronted the guy who threatened to shoot up the school, and apparently he lives in the trailer park down the road and wants to kill me.‚Äù at first I was just like, okay this kid is just some weird psycho. Then TF asks to come stay the night like he also does every weekend. So I‚Äôm in a house full of some punk ass 14 year old, a 21 year old redneck man-child, and an 18 year old redneck who thinks he‚Äôs made of steel. 

Next thing I know, the school shooter wanna be, (Tristen) is in a group chat with all of us saying what cars are in our driveway, who he sees wearing what colors in the window, etc. This kid starts sending all of us pictures of the house, the cars, saying he undid bolts on TF‚Äôs truck, put water in my gas tank, everything. Our vehicles were never actually touched, it was just to scare us. This Tristen kid literally opened our locked door and left it wide open. He kept threatening all of us, and it was fucking scary. The second night was pretty much a party. My boyfriend‚Äôs cousin and my cousin came over. I didn‚Äôt want to be the only girl. Then the next morning it continued. We were being stalked by a psycho for 3 days. The third day, BM came home. We told her everything, of course. We had already written police reports, the cops searched our property numerous times, the whole shabang. None of us ever actually saw the guy except LC. He described what he was wearing, his gun, everything. This guy even shot at our house. 

So finally, Sunday night rolls around, were all still freaking out and waiting for this kid to show himself with a gun. (We also have guns, it‚Äôs rural Missouri) We has every right to shoot if he‚Äôs on our property with a weapon and the intent to harm. LC went home. BM left to go back to her boyfriend‚Äôs house. BF gets a call. 

LC WAS THIS TRISTEN KID THE ENTIRE TIME. THATS WHY WE NEVER SAW ANYONE. THAT‚ÄôS WHY LC WAS THE ONLY ONE TO SEE HIM. THATS WHY ALL OF OUR VEHICLES WERE UNTOUCHED. THATS HOW THE LOCKED DOOR GOT OPEN. EVERYTHING. LC is definitely NOT allowed back here. Ever. What can we say to press charges on this kid. We don‚Äôt want money, we just want him to learn a fucking lesson. His parents apparently shaved his head and smashed his phone but that is NOT enough for us. His mom (BM‚Äôs sister) won‚Äôt even talk to any of us now.

i know i cant stop them, if i at least know i want to try and help
when i DONT know i end up getting nervous and asking all the time if theyve done something
i really just want to be In The Know so i worry less

731,"So I‚Äôm an Australian student (age 20), currently studying abroad at UCSB in Santa Barbara, California. The Australian government has said that all people entering the country must self-isolate for 14 days. They have additionally recommended that all those planning on coming home should return. I‚Äôm not sure whether I should go home or wait this out here. Here are my thoughts:


Cons of going back to Sydney, Australia:

-I will be in self-isolation.

-I risk infection on the journey home.

-My parents are 60+ and although I live with them at home I would probably need to rent a one bedroom apartment and live by myself until the virus is over. 

-However, it is very likely a lockdown will be in place in Sydney, meaning that I‚Äôll be stuck alone in a random apartment for an indefinite amount of time.

-I get severe Autumn/winter allergies in Sydney, and Sydney is approaching these seasons. Combined with the fact that I won‚Äôt be able to go to the gym or do much physical activity, I will probably be very sick cooped up at home. (I am allergic to dust in particular).

-Live online classes will be from 2-8am Sydney time, making it very hard for me to complete university here. If I drop out, it will delay my graduation by at least a year.




Pros of staying here:

-I have people I am currently living with and friends that  I know are staying here.

-I am living amongst predominately young people and therefore am much less of a risk to others in terms of spreading a lethal disease. 

-It will be summer here, and warmer weather will make it easier for me to live here.

-I do not have to leave the country until July 12, and even if I am unable to leave then, I will be easily able to find secure housing here.

-Class times will be easier to manage. 

-I am paying rent anyways and cannot get out of it.

-I have been assured by a friend of mine whose father is high up in a commercial Australian airline that while flights have been reduced, they are unlikely to cease fully. 

-The way my degree has been structured, I can never study abroad again. 




Pros of going back/cons of staying here:

-Could be stuck here longer than I want to be (although I currently want to stay)

-If I get sick, the American healthcare system is  inferior to that of the Australian one.

-I don‚Äôt want to risk a potential border closure leaving me stranded.

I had a group of ""friends"" with whom i liked to play games and all that. We would very frequently play for hours. I was quite bonded to them (but they weren't to me that much).

A few days later, i decided to go into their game and troll (basically ruin their game because of what they did to me). One of those guys said that for me even garbage is a compliment. I feel so bad now about myself and i am starting to fear it might be true.

I'm looking for advice to help her improve as a person, not advice for breaking up with her. I'm aware that I'll recieve a lot of shit for this but I'm desperate. 

I'll give a few examples of the things she's done. Five years ago, she cheated on me with a guy for a six month time period. I caught her and she apologized profusely, but later came back and blamed me for damaging our relationship by entering a depressed phase after she cheated. Her phrasing was something along the lines of, ""I can't be responsible for how you react to things. I didn't make you upset, you chose to react that way instead of being forgiving."" *Obviously* that's fucked up, but I believed her at the time and just accepted it. Later on she broke up with me for a short one month period before we got back together. During that month she was sexting an ACTUAL, LEGITIMATE PEDOPHILE and she was fully aware that he was one. She blamed it on me for introducing them (before i knew about his actions) in the first place and that I shouldn't let her meet ""tempting"" people if I didn't want to feel bad about myself. I assume you guys are catching onto the pattern. She keeps falling for every guy who says hi to her, ends up cheating or doing something similar, then blames me for feeling like shit. TW, her inconsiderateness caused me to attempt suicide multiple times in the past. All of them failed obviously but I'm telling you this to let you fully grasp both how much she means to me and how badly I've been hurting because of this.

742,"**long boi**

&amp;#x200B;

So we met through a famous dating app. Not a good idea, but it did happen, and it was fun at the start.  
He was super sweet, super nice, a very wholesome boyfriend material type-of-guy, who had just come out of a (years) long relationship.   


(So for some backstory, my country is currently being hit with the coronavirus pandemic. We don't have curfews, but shops and businesses are shut down until further notice, and if you go out for a walk, there's high chance that you'll be by yourself, as every one has self-quarantined. My dad is type-2 diabetic, and aunt is in the ICU as we speak, so I've tried to lessen my outings, just in case I get sick.)  


He would constantly press me that he wanted to meet, and I had repeatedly told him that my outings were very limited, as I had family that was high-risk, and I wanted to be a little bit more cautious. He said ok, and dropped the outing subject for that day. The next day he texts and says ""Hey I'll be by your neighbourhood today evening, want me to come and take you to pick up a beer?"" and my hands were tied because I didn't want him to think I didn't want to go out with him (I really did want to meet him at that time), so I said yes.   


We meet, we grab a beer, we talk and the evening goes on perfectly. He is as sweet in person as he is through texts, so I'm feeling more warmed up to him. We kiss and hangout a little longer, and I ask him if he can take me home because it was late. He does, we kiss goodnight and we part ways.  


Mind you, I'm not really the relationship-type of girl. Especially at this time in my life I try to distance myself from emotional ties because I have my family to tend to at the moment. I had made that clear through my messaging multiple times. Anyway...

He starts texting full on. Like *full on.*  


He'd double text for pretty much everything, and when I wouldn't reply he'd text both my Instagram and my Messenger asking if I'm alive, hah. I paid no mind to it at the beginning, but it started getting a little more ridiculous.   


He started sending all these lovey-dovey texts (mind you, we had known eachother for a week before that), saying how he really appreciated having me in his life, how I've changed his whole mindset and mentality, and how I'm making him happier than he has ever been in his life. At that point we had gone out twice, and had known each other for a little more than a week (think 10 days or so). He'd tell me about how he saw the fling we had extending, like a full on relationship type of thing, and how he adored every single thing about me. I started feeling super uncomfortable with the whole interaction, and would reply something in the lines of ""that's really nice, but you don't even know me"" and he'd sent back something like ""I've known you enough to understand that you are the greatest person in the world"". 

All these, along with the fact that he insisted on holding my hand every time we were out (I'd have my hands in my pockets and he'd pull them out so he could hold them), were enough for me to be like ""ok, yeah, this is kind of weird for a week-long interaction"" and I decided to text him and let him know that hey, I really appreciate your companion, but I'd rather keep this as friendly as possible because I don't see as a couple any time soon. 

His response was calm and collected, with a couple of red flags in the lines of ""I don't want you to abandon me"" and ""I don't want to be alone again"" to which I replied that we all have to be alone at sometime in our lives, and I'm not abandoning him, I'm just asking for space and some emotional distancing because this is too much for me.   


He agreed, and we called off our chat. I woke up this morning to fifteen text messages saying that he desperately wants to talk to me in person, and I thought of just letting the texts be, but now my phone has been blowing up with his calls, and I have no idea what to do.",17Mar2020,1
743,"There is a lot that goes into this, so stay with me.

My gf and I are from Mexico, and she left for Spain back in January as part of her University's foreign exchange program. She's been in Seville, Spain since then. Back then, the coronavirus epidemic in China seemed far away and not likely to become an issue. Boy, were we wrong. She is now stuck over there, and there are a bunch of things that complicate the issue a lot, and it has me quite worried.

Firstly, my gf comes from a low-income, trashy family. I'm not going to lie, her parents suck and they've been anything from less-than-supportive to flat out abusive towards my gf. Step-dad doesn't even live with them and struggles to financially support them. Last year, my gf got herself a job that paid great, and even got her mom a spot, albeit a lower-paying spot (hard to explain, not up to her). This gave my gf the chance to buy her own brand-new car, which I advised against as it would be a huge debt that she would have to pay over 5 years. This made her very happy so I didn't mind.

Fast forward a couple of months, her job made it possible for her to save up a lot of money, no help from her parents, and now she's over in Spain in a student exchange. She has an arrangement with her mother of her mother paying half the monthly for the car and my gf paying the other half from her savings. This has made her mother upset, and she has a history of failing to keep her end of deals. So it's not exactly safe to assume she's going to help pay for the car any more than she wants to.

My gf has been living in Spain this time with her savings alone. She has no income, and cannot work in Spain as she doesn't have the appropriate Visa or permit. She is staying at a place that charges her about 210 euro per month.

And now there is a pandemic. My gf has all of her savings in a bank account here in Mexico, and has been paying with her debit card pretty much everything over there, occasionally taking out money from an ATM (which is expensive). Our mexican currency is getting hit pretty hard by the economic collapse, meaning that her money is now worth a lot less over in Europe.

It looks like this collapse will continue to occur over the coming weeks/months. I fear that she is going to run out of money before she ever gets the chance to come back home.

I've told her to take out as much money as an ATM will let her so she can have Euro cash at hand. I've also told her to try to find some kind of arrangement with her landlady so she has more breathing room with the rent. Gf tells me that her mom is holding up her end of the car payment, but I'm not sure if we should count on it 100%. She is now applying for an online work-from-home job but I honestly don't think that's going to pan out. I even thought about suggesting she starts selling nudes (which she has done in the past).

To sumarize:

* Gf is an exchange student in Spain, is stuck there due to the pandemic.
* She has some savings in her mexican bank account, but mexican currency is tanking so her money is worth less in Europe.
* She has a car debt that her mom is helping her pay, but mom is unreliable, dad is broke.
* She has no income, can't get a job due to her Visa status, not that it matters anyway with the lockdown in place.
* She has to pay rent of 210 euro/month.

I would like some advice on how to handle things from now on, and if there is anything else she should be doing to keep from running out of money or tanking her car debt.",17Mar2020,1
746,"So the topic of my teeth came up when I was talking with my parents. My teeth were rotten and full of cavities by the time I was 3 because I didn't brush and they stayed that way for years until I finally got my mouth sorted out in my 20s after a ton of dental work. They say my poor dental hygiene as a child (3-5 years old) was my fault and not their's, whereas I think it was just gross negligence on their part.

They told me to post this to Reddit because they believe people will agree with them. I guess I could use a second opinion too. **They'll be reading the responses so please be as honest as possible.**

They told me that when I was young (3-5 years old), they would try to brush my teeth but I would put up a fight and say I didn't want to. So their solution was to not brush my teeth at all. My baby teeth were black and rotten away by the time I was 4.

Here's my point of view: I was way too young to understand the importance of dental hygiene so of course I didn't want to brush my teeth. Even then, it was their responsibility to make me do it anyways because they're adults and I was a child.

Here's their point of view: Children are like trees - you can give them the same amount of water, but some will grow taller and stronger than others. It was my fault that I put up a fight when they tried to brush my teeth so my messed up mouth was really my fault and not their's. They tried just as hard as other parents to brush my teeth but I didn't come around to it so I need to take responsibility. Other children would happily stay still while their parents brushed their teeth and I wasn't like that, so it was my fault for not taking it into my own hands and brushing myself.

This is just one example of what I think was negligent parenting on their part, but I won't get into the other stories. Please help, I feel like I'm a loser and they're driving me crazy. I don't know what to do or how to feel.",17Mar2020,1

749,"The question is in the title. This story is a bit complex but I‚Äôll try to explain it as best I can. I have a few friends in school, who I love dearly. I‚Äôve been friends with them since 7th grade, I really do care about them. We all started Highschool and I‚Äôm a bit of a theater nerd so I convinced my friends to all go out for speech, which is like competitive acting. I also wanted to do speech, because my older sister (a senior currently) is apart of it and she told me how fun it was. I‚Äôve looked up to my sister for awhile and last year we began to get closer as she was doing a musical and I was really into said musical so we began bonding over it. My sister is like my polar opposite. She‚Äôs smart, pretty, trendy, cool, social and very likable. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm not as attractive as her, I‚Äôm a major dumb blonde type of girl, I‚Äôm anti social, I can be obnoxious sometimes, and I don‚Äôt have many friends. Later on, my friends go out for our school musical and they get in, and my sister does as well. They all got ensemble, and my friends and my sister spoke a bit. Soon enough, my friends begin to talk to me about how cool my sister is and that she‚Äôs ‚Äúan icon.‚Äù My friend group has icons, who are upperclassmen we look up to. They‚Äôre generally people who are good at signing or acting and people we‚Äôd want to be friends with. And, pretty much my sister is friends with all of our ‚Äòicons.‚Äô After awhile, I began to notice that my friends have been a bit distance with me. They seemed more annoyed with me and seemed to lash out at me a bit when I did something wrong. I suffer from major ADHD which makes me hyper when my medicine wares off, and when it does I act different. When I get hyper I notice that my friends kind of were annoyed with me a lot. Like they‚Äôd say to knock it off or to stop doing it. I felt more distant with them, but they still hung out with me. I know this might seem like a really weird conclusion, but lately I‚Äôve been sort of stuck in the mindset that my friends have only been using me to be close with my sister. They talk a lot about her, and they also joke around about how she‚Äôs better then we. I try to laugh it off whenever they say stuff like ‚ÄúI think your sister could‚Äôve pulled that joke off better then you can.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúYour acting isn‚Äôt as good as your sisters.‚Äù But deep down, it hurts. A lot. I‚Äôve always been in my sisters shadow and now it feels like she‚Äôs taking away the only friends I have left. Another thing to mention is that at my school, everyone knows me for being my sister‚Äôs, well sister. Like, I‚Äôm in tech crew and my sisters head tech, and literally EVERY SINGLE PERSON calls me ‚ÄúMini [Insert my last name here]‚Äù which drives me nuts and I‚Äôve told them that it annoys me but they just say that I should be use to it, and even all of her friends don‚Äôt call me by my first name, they call me by my last name because my sister and I share the same last name. I apologize for this post for being so jumbled, but it‚Äôs a very complex situation that I don‚Äôt know how to put into words. I feel like if people just saw and felt what I felt, they‚Äôd understand better. But alas, I can‚Äôt do that. I know this post mainly talks about my sister, but my main concern is my friends. I don‚Äôt know why I feel like I‚Äôm being used by them for my sisters affection, but I can‚Äôt shake off the feeling, so I don‚Äôt know if I just have some sort of trust issue due to my sister and how being my sister‚Äôs sister is pretty much my main trait to everyone at my school, but I want to figure out if I am just being stubborn or if I have trust issues, or whatever. I want to stop being in this mindset and try to get out of it. I hope that you all can understand what I‚Äôve told you and you can tell me what I should do. Thank you.",17Mar2020,1

Context: My partner and I moved into our home with our dog and our indoor cat about a year ago, and shortly afterward we started to see a gray cat in our yard every now and then. Sometimes it would even come up to our back porch and sit on the dining room window looking in at us, taunting our own cat. Around Christmas of this past year, the cat showed up again and we discovered that he was incredibly social and friendly, and I began to leave fresh water out for him sometimes when I saw that he was around because I know that most cats are chronically dehydrated. All throughout this period of time, I assumed that this cat was essentially a neighborhood stray based on his behavior. I asked around about him to our immediate neighbors a few times, and when the cat suddenly camped out in just our yard for 2 consecutive weeks during bad winter weather, I reached out on Nextdoor to see if anyone knew anything about him. I was told by others in my neighborhood that he was believed to be a community stray who had been wandering from house to house for at least two years.

At this point, I decided to take the cat to our local shelter, because it was breaking my heart that such a friendly and loving cat was stuck outside in winter weather when it seemed to just want a home and a family. I dropped him off at the shelter and they told me he would be up for adoption 3-5 days after intake. The day that his adoption profile went live, it was taken down again with hours. I thought to myself then that he was probably so friendly that someone came into the shelter the day he went up for adoption and immediately fell in love with him and took him home.

It turns out that he was microchipped, and he actually belongs to one of our neighbors who doesn't associate much with the neighborhood.

The neighbors in question also have two dogs which they leave outside confined to their back porch (not even their whole backyard) what appears to be 24/7 regardless of weather, so it tracks that as soon as they picked their cat up from the shelter, they turned him right back out onto the streets. You can imagine my surprise when, just a few days after I dropped him off at the shelter thinking I'd never see him again, this cat came running through my yard to greet me when I was outside with my dog a few weeks ago.

Now that all of that context is established, here's where the problem comes in.

Before I took him to the shelter, this cat had previously gotten along fine with our dog (a lab/boxer mix). They were somewhat hesitant/scared around each other at first but were never aggressive toward one another. Since the cat has reappeared in our yard, he seems to have become either very protective of me or very jealous of my dog being able to enter our house when he can't; I can't tell which it is, or if I'm ultimately just projecting human emotion onto a cat's totally random behavior. If he is in our yard when I take the dog out, he demands my attention while I'm outside and then runs to the stoop in an attempt to attack my dog whenever he tries to go back in the back door. The cat got close enough to swipe his claws at my dog 2-3 times (luckily I was able to stop him from making contact each time) before I realized this was becoming a pattern, and now whenever I take my dog out and the cat is in the yard, I have to pick the cat up to keep him away from my dog and then lightly toss him off the stoop before quickly opening the door to let the dog back inside.

Earlier today when I took the dog out, the cat ran after him as he walked by just in the yard itself and I had to knock the cat over and shoo my dog away to keep it from attacking him again. My question is this: what do I do now? Do I have any clear course of action? I don't /want/ to get my neighbors in trouble or have their cat taken away, but I also don't want to fear for my or my dog's safety every time I go into my own backyard because of this cat. I thought I was doing right by the cat when I brought him to the shelter, and I'm quite upset that our neighbor would claim him from the shelter only to immediately release him back onto the streets to continue attacking local wildlife and now harassing local pets. I am just at a loss here, and I'd appreciate any advice you all might have on how to approach this situation.

TL:DR: What I thought was a friendly neighborhood stray turned out to be my neighbor's outdoor cat that they don't take care of, and I didn't mind it hanging out in our yard until it began to act aggressively toward my dog. Now I'm not sure whether I should call animal services, try to confront my neighbor, or what else to try to get this cat to stop attacking my dog when it tries to enter my house.",17Mar2020,1

760,"Yep. Pretty much it. I'm an adult. I can not have a deep relationship with my mother as she is incredible insensitive about my abuse as a teenager and has put me in harm's way more times than I can count. She tells me she should have been harder on me because??? Some how that would fix my PTSD and Psychotic Depression and suicide attempts. I plan to start college in the fall at the local university and live at home as its cheaper and she will help pay for books tution etc. I can keep a civil conversation but we are completely different people. I would not want to be friends with her especially if I knew what she had done to me from an outsider's perspective. Every single person I've gone into detail about this with says are you okay?? Being forced to live with a previous assulter before I stood up for myself and said no it cant be like this and she gave me hell for it. Still gives me hell because she loves him. It makes me sick. Anyway. I always try to side with her as I'm very use to subserverting my needs growing up but when it comes to my safety I will always stand up for myself. However Im tired of trying to explain my feelings to her. I'm just tired. I want to treat her like an equal and be open and have a real relationship, but she just ruined it again. I have forgiven her and let it go but then she says these ugly things to me when its brought up and then I'm reminded of how horrible she is although shes ignorant about her behavior.

I was supposed to be moving this week, I was so excited to have my own place and I was like... just so mentally prepared for it. That‚Äôs now out of the question. In fact, my job is gone completely for good it seems. There‚Äôs no way the business could survive this and might be shutting its doors forever. My job relied on tourism and the tours have cancelled for the entire year. We book a year in advance for many groups and they‚Äôve nearly *all* canceled all the way through October which is the height of tourist season. This is GREAT for the health and safety of people. But on the other hand it‚Äôs scary because my entire livelihood is gone now. 

I‚Äôm scared about having no place to live, no job, I‚Äôm scared to find another job because of the virus and I don‚Äôt even know if other places are hiring (I live in a very small town which completely thrives on tourism). My town is basically shut down. Its not going to last forever but I feel like the impact of this shut down is going to be huge in the long run of things.

I have enough savings to keep me going for a while. But... I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm mentally crushed, spiraling into extreme sadness and I‚Äôm terrified. I don‚Äôt know how to process this right now. The worst part is that everyone around me has the same exact mindset so it feels very suffocating.

I also want to say to everyone I hope you stay safe and healthy, above all that‚Äôs more important than anything right now. I‚Äôm sorry if this post comes off as insensitive or selfish, I‚Äôm just scared. I don‚Äôt know. Feeling very overwhelmed right now.",17Mar2020,2

764,"I'm 32 year old male I'm pretty much a introvert. I think. I lost my virginity when I was 16 (but I didn't finish)she just kinda road me for a bit and gave me a blowjob. At 19 I banged a chick that was 34. Kinda got infatuated with her. At 21 I banged a chick that was 32. Got infatuated with her too. Like obsessive. Then it happened, heres where I get confused. I met a ""girl"" online and we talked for a few years. She was having a living situation problem and I offered to let her move in. When I picked her up from the airport I immediately confirmed my previous thoughts. She was trans. she had surgery on her cheekbones... Taking hormone pills. Got a boob job the whole shabang except for the penis. At first I was pissed , but we had been talking for years and I knew her on a cozy level. I didn't want to kick her out so I let her stay for a few weeks. She had episodes a lot she was bipolar. Now I wouldn't call myself gay but she did blow me a few times... It was a weird experience but I finished I ended up just flying her back to her mother's because I started to get agitated. It's weird I wasent really wanting sex but I loved her for her personality and as a person. But I wasent attracted to her sexually..

Now it's been 10 years later and I still haven't been with anyone. Maybe it's cuz my best friend shot and killed himself 6 years ago and maybe I'm just too afraid to make new friends and partners.... The fear of losing someone again... So I've become an extreme introvert I'm a recluse. I don't like leaving the house.. Like I mentioned earlier i am attracted to women. But I find the vajayjay repulsive...

am I A-sexual?? I'm confused. I just want to be happy. I don't mind being alone but I want to feel happiness with another person too because I've never felt that and I feel like it's never going to happen... Because I'm such an introvert. what's wrong with me? I'm scared of building relationships because I don't want what happened to my best friend to happen again to me. That really broke me. But I want to feel love and be happy. I feel stuck.. 

TL:DR I'm 32 and an introvert but I want someone in my life I don't know if I'm A-sexual or not? I'm attracted to women, but not the vajayjay. Someone help me understand what is wrong with me.",17Mar2020,1
765,"I'll keep a long story fairly short.

Last year I was into a guy who continuously gave me mixed signals. Even after bringing it up to him, he continued to flirt and everyone around us could see it. So, I brought it up again - trying to have a real conversation about it all only for him to completely shut down and attempt to gaslight me. Thankfully for this, I didn't end up in a serious relationship with a manipulative man and was able to realize that he was too far set in his ways to even care about another person. Only appear as if he cared for his own benefit.

One of my good friends was there for me while this was happening and even at one point tried to get him to see where I was coming from. Naturally, he refused. 

I ended the ""friendship"" between me and this man. However - my friend who tried talking to him about it continued to interact. At first, I didn't really mind. They worked with one another, so it was just natural. Though, now this man has another job and I've recently found out that they have been hanging out/still communicating. 

It doesn't help that every time I'm with my friend and if this man is brought up, she's immediately to my defense calling him a ""dick"" and an ""asshole"".

I was paranoid I hadn‚Äôt studied enough for this exam because for months my parents have been fighting all day and night because of money and stuff like that.

So today during the final , I asked and tried to cheat one question from another guy. I know I‚Äôm so wrong and I‚Äôm sorry about it . The invigilator saw us and took us to the authorities , no action was taken against us and we were let off without anything. But my class teacher got nervous and called me up to know what we did , I told her and thought it‚Äôs not a big deal because we were let off and didn‚Äôt tell mom. Later mom got to know and now she feels i have destroyed her respect in front of all the teachers. She feels I don‚Äôt trust her enough to tell her. She feels I‚Äôm selfish and how I don‚Äôt trust her now and then I won‚Äôt trust her when I get older too. She has sacrificed a lot of me, I know but I just don‚Äôt understand that even though I was let off why would she get mad at me? 

Not only this, I am supposed to start college on US this year in fall, I‚Äôm in India right now. But even after the scholarships I have from college, my mom would still have to pay. It‚Äôs her savings and she‚Äôs going to use that for my education and now she feels that I don‚Äôt trust her then why should she use her savings for me . She said she won‚Äôt send me now to the US.

772,"My manager at my new job (been working there since February 29, 2020 so not too long) called me today to ask me to come into the store to help clean and organize the back room. Thing is, corporate told us to shut the store down this morning so I didn‚Äôt even come in to open at all today, and it was only yesterday that they told us they were cutting down operation hours for the store and the mall was opening later and closing earlier as well. 80% of the stores at the mall were already closed completely yesterday. 

Anyway, my manager texted me this morning saying she was feeling sick, not sure if she was just saying it or if it was just a spur of the moment morning sickness or what but I‚Äôm actually so very worried now. The virus has just recently had confirmed cases in my city and businesses are on the decline, my other job cut down hours and I‚Äôm not even working there at all anymore until April because of my limited availability for this month because I started a new full time job so I‚Äôm shit out of work until further notice. I don‚Äôt know how to ask her if we‚Äôre getting any extra pay for coming in or if we‚Äôre getting paid at all for the extra hours we‚Äôd be putting in because corporate said we‚Äôre getting paid for the hours that we‚Äôre scheduled on the physical schedule and my shift tomorrow was supposed to be 3pm to 6pm and she wants me to come in at 10-3 tomorrow to organize. I also don‚Äôt know how to bring it up to her that I genuinely fear for mine and my loved ones health and safety and that if she‚Äôs sick she shouldn‚Äôt come in and I won‚Äôt either at all. I‚Äôm quarantining at my boyfriends house with his family, my family is quarantined at their house, my one roommate is quarantining at her boyfriends house with their family and my other roommate has our apartment by himself to quarantine for 2 weeks. I‚Äôm fully embracing the next few weeks of no work or real obligations because I am exhausted and I‚Äôm sure we all needed this break, not that I‚Äôm not worried about my finances because I really am, but it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs much I can do about it. No shifts at my jobs and not like anywhere else will be hiring any time soon with how slow business has been. 


BASICALLY, how do I ask my manager and/or my DM to pay me for the extra hours I might be putting in if I come in tomorrow and how do I communicate to my manager that I don‚Äôt want to come in if she truly is sick and if I won‚Äôt be getting paid to clean. The reason I‚Äôm so adamant on getting paid if I come is because the DM for my store is notorious for cutting hours on paper but making employees work back to back with no break. I‚Äôve worked 9 hour shifts at the store by myself without getting a break and only getting paid for 7 hours of the whole shift to make it look like we‚Äôre using up the correct amount of hours and not going over budget. 

Additional info: I‚Äôm from Saskatchewan, Canada. 




I want to emphasize that I know other people‚Äôs situations are far worse than mine, I don‚Äôt want to come off as stuck up or anything like that. This whole situation breaks my heart for the people who truly cannot afford to get sick or take time off to be safe. I wish I could do more for others but I am only just scraping by myself. To me, the most I can do is stay home and ensure that I am not spreading the virus or getting infected because I don‚Äôt want to be the reason someone else suffers because I wasn‚Äôt doing the smart thing and staying home.",17Mar2020,1

My (24) fiance (25) will celebrate his birthday in a week. We don't live in our homecountry, but as soon as we heard that the borders might close in Europe we rushed back to our families and since then we are in self-quarantine to be sure we are not infected, because we don't want to infect anybody. 

We are in a very very small city where his parents live. There are only food shops and pharmacies open all day, but other shops can be open till 3 pm, but most of them are closed now. 

My problem is that I don't have any gifts for him. Usually we buy them in the last week, and I did not have the time to go because our leaving the country was very sudden. I have a cute card for him and cute candles for his birthday cake. I think I will make a cupcake cake for him, I can ask his family to drop off groceries.

DDC has said they it is not up to them as to whether or not I can stay home, it is up to the consulting office. What they failed to mention was they had told the consulting companies that if they have their employees work from home, then they will not pay them.

Needless to say, no consulting office is willing to let anyone stay home..even if their job could be easily done from home.

I compete in a few different sports to a decent level including athletics / track, but all training and competitions have been cancelled for the foreseeable future due to the covid-19 situation.

My question is - should I go see the doctor about this or is it a bad idea due to the coronavirus and risks of spreading/catching the virus?

(Exploratory: gym, health, or Win). 4 after school activities:basketball, track, robotics club, and pretty brown girls club. The teachers aren't that good and the kids are bad. There is no diversity. There are only black people and a few Hispanics. Nothing else, which exposes me to pretty much nothing. I would go more into detail about the school, but I'm trying not to make this too long. There are literally no good schools near me, and when I get to high school the school is even worse. To add, switching schools within district wouldn't help because even though there are 3 middle schools, they're all in the same  building and they are pretty much the same academically, we all share after school activities, all exploratory classes, and the lunch room. They're just used at different times. We also share the same assistant principal. All 3 schools combined are small because each school has about 200 students, which are 100 7th graders and 100 8th graders making the total 600 students. 

That's enough about my current school. I have about 4 schools that I want to go to. They're all in the same district But they're 45 minutes to an hour away. These are much better schools and would challenge me as I've gotten straight As all of my life. They have more classes  and even more after school activities. I would love to go here, but my parents can't move right now since my brother is a senior in high school, so they have to pay for his prom and his graduation and everything. We aren't too financially set either. I've realized this isn't the richest neighborhood either. How do I go to that school without having to move? Any legal ways? I've seen some ways but some are illegal if you get caught.

Tl;dr My school district is terrible and I want to go to another school in another district but my parents probably want move any time soon",17Mar2020,1
794,"Hi, clueless and sheltered 20 year old here trying to figure out what will be right for my first job.

I've been reading the differences between checking and savings accounts online and I'm still not sure what will be right for me. I'm gonna start out working part time so I realize I'm not gonna have a ton of money, but I'm honestly not a big spender. I'm fortunate enough to have any real expenses right now so I want to save the majority of whatever I'll make towards a car/car related expenses. At the same time, I want to take over buying my cat's food and litter (which I estimated to be about $20 a month) and would like to freely access the money if/when I do want to spend it. I read that the savings account access is limited to avoid temptation of spending, but I honestly don't see the need for that and don't *want* to be limited with my own money if I decide to splurge once or twice a year, which is about all I'll ever do. (Seriously, I saved $60, the only money I had, for a year.)

So, what else can I take into consideration to figure this out??? What do you do or what did you do with your first job?",17Mar2020,1
795,"I am a Physical Therapist Assistant at a pediatric clinic in Texas.  I am 1-year out of school, and have been working for this company the entire year.

With COVID-19 shutting everything down, if my clinic shuts down, i will have no source of income.      I know right now it probably won't happen, but i want to be protected from these sort of things happening  again.  as well as, having a consistent rate of pay.

To get home we would have to fly from Belize City to LA then LA - Sydney.
Alternatively  Chetumal (Mexico) - Mexico city -LA-Sydney.

Pros of staying:
We are on a beautiful island with all that comes with it. 
There are only about 2000 people on the island so lower chance of infection.
We are both in a relatively safe age bracket. 

Cons of staying:
We may not be able to get home ( although I haven't heard of any countries not letting people out). Also we dont want to go home for a few weeks.

All of last week, she didnt come to classes. I asked her what was wrong and she texted me saying she feels very overwhelmed so she decided to take a break from going to classes.

We talked briefly about classes and all but ever since that day she has not contacted me at all and it's been a week now.

799,"Tldr at the bottom

So this is about my future MIL. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 and a half years, planning on getting engaged in a couple months after he asks my dad when my family visits the state to attend my graduation. I have stayed with this family during my time at college, and boyfriend's mom owns a second property, where I have been living for the last year.

From my time with them, I have caught on to some of her behaviors. We used to have a great relationship, but she has steadily been showing more and more of her true colors. She  drinks anytime she is not at work, I am talking multiple wine bottles a night. Anytime someone confronts her about her actions, she plays it to where she is the victim. She can be incredibly manipulative. All of this has made me develop opinions about her, and shes made it clear I am not a part of the family until I have a ring on my finger. My bf wants us to get along, so I bite my tongue.

Anyways, my family would not keep my dogs after my parents' divorce finalized, so my sophomore year I brought them with me and they have been staying with his family for the last year and a half. Though they have been housing them, I have taken my two to all their vet appointments , paid for their surgeries and medications, got them groomed, kept them fed etc. (His mom claims she feeds them more than I do, but the one time bf and I were gone for a few days the food was never replenished. She only gave them cheerios. Another thing I bit my tongue on.) Last week, one of them got out and died. I buried her on Thursday, and it has been an incredibly painful time. Over the weekend, I told my boyfriend getting a new dog any time soon would not be ok with me. I'm just not in a place where I want to get a new one so soon after saying goodbye to my childhood dog. Besides, between the 2 of us we have 5 other pets to love.

My boyfriend and his mom work at a funeral home. He has been making a marker for the grave and today I stopped by to see it. Not one minute was I there did his mom begin to talk about how she was looking at breeders and wanting to get a new puppy. I hid myself and started crying, and my bf started to say now may not be a good time, puppies are a lot of work etc. She rebuttaled saying shes an adult and can get a dog if she wants, even though there are 3 dogs at the house right now.

She never mentioned getting a new dog until today, and she even said it was to replace my dog. She's once again turned it all around to make it seem like she is the victim. She wasn't the one searching till 3 am trying to find Minnie. She wasn't the one who buried her. My boyfriend has asked me not to be passive aggressive about this and just talk to her, but I am not sure there is much that I can say that will change her mind. Even then, it can easily turn into a fight and I am living on her property. I have half a mind to take this covid quarantine school lockdown advantage and pack up my stuff and move me and my animals back home for the remainder of the semester. Boyfriend and I were planning on moving there anyways after I graduate, and it would be to my brother's house, who is hoping I will move there sooner anyways. 

I am just way too emotional to deal with this. Any advice?

Tldr: *my* dog died 5 days ago and future MIL is all of a sudden looking to replace her. We do not have the relationship for me to be open and I am extremely hurt and pissed off by her actions.",17Mar2020,1
800,"Okey, so one of my closest friends for the last couple of years now has in the past months broken the same promise to me several times. He offered to help me with a college essay by sending me an essay of a friend who got into a good school. I waited for a couple of weeks, then I reminded him he was like yeah aight, then another couple of weeks went by and I reminded him again, and he was like ‚Äúshit sorry I‚Äôm on it‚Äù another week or so go by and I call him (at this point he had moved to study abroad) and I kinda confront him on the importance of keeping his promises etc, he agrees and ensures me that he will send it promptly.

801,"Everyone in my office is permitted to work from home, this is an issue that I have talked with them about from the beginning.

803,"When something terrible happens, we all have that one friend who says, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not seeing it right now, but one day, you‚Äôll be grateful for this.‚Äù

Despite being that friend, I‚Äôve always been frustrated by the slowness of the process. It‚Äôs only after a while that we realize that what we once considered a stumbling block often led to a positive outcome. You get fired only to find a better job eventually, or you get dumped and end up taking a serious shot at a personal project or exploring your well-being.

Even if we all know too well that our current setback may trigger a beautiful twist of events, we often get stuck in frustration and endless cycles of negative emotions.

Fortunately, neuroscience and psychology have studied the subject, and scientists believe they‚Äôve found ways to accelerate our hindsight. The trick is to combine a simple breathing technique with a touch of imagination.

In 2016, my favorite public speaker Eric Edmeades shared his bounce-back-technique in a talk he called The Hindsight Window.

The Hindsight Window is the window of time between the moment an event that you perceived as terrible occurs, and the time you start picturing that same event as a gift. Eric‚Äôs idea is to shorten this time-lapse.

First, you pause for a moment and take deep breaths.

Then, you picture future blessings originating from the incident that just happened.

Breathing and why it works

Technically speaking, slow breathing affects the neurochemicals released in your brain. It deactivates your ‚Äúfear response center‚Äù ‚Äî the amygdala and reactivates your ‚Äúthinking center‚Äù ‚Äî the prefrontal cortex, instead.

In essence, you trade arousal, anxiety, anger, and confusion, with comfort, relaxation, vigor, and alertness. These feel-good effects spread across your body through your nervous system, slowing your heart rate, and limiting other stress-driven responses such as ticks.

When it comes to breathing techniques, the choices are almost endless. For instance, John Assaraf, the author of Innercise, suggests the following mantra while breathing. 

‚ÄúI breathe in calm and serenity.

I breathe out stress and anxiety.‚Äù

According to Assaraf, it enhances the sync between mind and body. Another widely-spread approach is Wim Hof‚Äôs. He earned the title of ‚ÄúThe Iceman‚Äù for his amazing ability to withstand freezing temperatures. Hof suggests relaxing methods based on breath-holding and explains that it‚Äôs useful in getting him out of fight-or-flight, and into the rest-and-relaxation mode.

There‚Äôs not a one-size-fits-all approach, and you don‚Äôt have to stick to a specific guide. The idea is to relax your body and move to a calmer state of mind. The latter sets you up for the second part.

## Visualization and why it works

In general, visualizing positive outcomes stimulates the release of dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin ‚Äî all things that you want to be promoting within yourself. These are the neurochemicals responsible for motivation, awareness, and engagement.

This part of The Hindsight Window is like playing a mental movie. In it, you make your present setback trigger beneficial and even rewarding outcomes. By doing so, you stop dwelling on the downside, which gets you stuck. Instead, you push your neurons to focus on problem-solving. Incidentally, you take yourself from whining about the luck of the draw to thinking about your next move. You accept the lousy card that life just dealt you and keep playing the game.

Doctor Jordan Peterson, who‚Äôs a clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, wrote in his book ‚Äú12 Rules For Life‚Äù that facing challenges voluntarily stimulates the brain circuits related to positive emotions. He added that we, humans, are ‚Äúaiming creatures.‚Äù We draw our motivation and happiness from moving forward while undertaking challenges and responsibilities.

Put differently; the visualization part allows you to identify a new objective out of your current situation. Thus, you turn your setback into a source of motivation.

The Hindsight Window isn‚Äôt a magic trick that‚Äôll make all your problems disappear. It‚Äôs a tool that can help you handle them better.

In September 2019, my application to speak at a TEDx event was denied during the very last stage. I‚Äôd worked like crazy to get there and had even stopped writing to focus entirely on the speech. Naturally, I was very frustrated and extremely sad when I received the ‚Äúsorry you have been rejected‚Äù phone call.

Then, The Hindsight Window kicked in. I took six deep breaths and thought to myself:

 ‚ÄúHold on. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if I used the time initially intended for my speech preparation to write more articles? That way, I‚Äôd have more content for the next time I attempt public speaking.‚Äù 

 I visualized myself working on inspiring articles and giving speeches on fancy wooden stages. Three days later, I got back into writing after a five-month break. I‚Äôve been writing every week ever since. 

&amp;#x200B;

There‚Äôll still be hardships that will be close to impossible to reframe like losing a loved one.

Nevertheless, most of your daily struggles aren‚Äôt worth risking your mental health and future opportunities over.

In any case, you can‚Äôt change what happens around you. However, you can choose how to react. So instead of bowing to setbacks why not use them to your advantage and bet on the future. Steve Jobs might have said it best:

 ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.‚Äù

805,"To catch you up briefly - this was someone that I had gone on a few dates with. It wasn't violent, but I had said no several times, in many different ways, and I had nowhere else to go (it was the middle of the night and he didn't live in the city.) So when he did what he did, I just kind of laid there, and kept quiet, to make sure that it wouldn't become violent. (There were also other things he did that weren't as bad but made me kind of uncomfortable, like when he called be sexy even though I let him know I didn't like that word.) This took place in December, and I was 19, he was 21. I'm now newly 20. After this happened, I went to the hospital, talked to my therapist, and all that. Still kind of in the process I suppose. Want to talk to someone about ptsd 'cause I can't sleep and all that, but atm I'm in the process of switching clinics, so I haven't yet. 

Anyway, me and this guy got along decently well prior to this (I'm a female. He was never someone I saw myself with in the future, and I tend to mix English a lot with my country's language without thinking about it, and he doesn't speak English, and he's only been in this country since 16 - taking that into account, his vocabulary is great, but there were a few minor misunderstandings. All that to say - over all, things were fine.) 

I messaged him about a month or two ago, saying 'this is what you did to me, this is how it made me feel, i'm not asking for an apology, just please don't do it to anyone else.' a lot more eloquent, and in depth, but that was the gist. He said he took responsibility for it. (I don't know if he unsent it or if I can't see it anymore 'cause I re-blocked him. Either way I didn't screenshot and I'm an idiot.) 

Now essentially, I'm bored, and he seems like a decent person. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it - I don't know a lot of people nearby that are worthy of the term 'decent' so I kind of feel like messaging him being like 'Look, I've processed it a bit more. What you did was wrong, but maybe it was more of a misunderstanding than I realized. Maybe I didn't know what I wanted back then, and now I do. You wanna meet up? Bring condoms.' I wouldn't put it like that, but you get the idea. 

And yeah, maybe I just wanna get laid - but I'm a chick - how do I know I won't get murdered? Call someone I know won't murder me - yeah, he raped me, but I didn't want to sleep with him back then, now I wanna get laid. (God damn this needs to be written into my stand up routine.) 

Someone talk to me 'cause anyone I know has seen me gone through what I did afterwards and they're biased. Maybe I was being dramatic. He seemed nice enough.",17Mar2020,1
806,"Hi everyone. I'm really overwhelmed at the moment and I hope this comes across clearly and I can get some advice.

My girlfriend recently told me that a few months ago (when we were together), on a field trip, she had gone to see her friend to smoke with him. She only told me that she'd gone to see a friend and then had no more contact for the rest of the night when it happened, and naturally I was worried because it was a new relationship and she was meeting a guy, alone.   
Yesterday she told me that while she was there, the guy raped her while she was high and she told him to stop. She then fell asleep there and left once she woke up about an hour later.  
Why did she wait so long to tell me? She remembers everything but why would she then stay there and fall asleep after something so terrible? I'm confused, upset and worried, both for her sake and mine. I'm upset that she would choose to go meet a guy alone, even her friend, and stay at his house overnight, but I'm more bothered by the fact that I had no idea about this until so recently. It's really messing with me. After she told me, I talked and tried to comfort her for a bit but it was like I'd just had a rock thrown at my chest. I couldn't think of anything to say, couldn't move much and had trouble speaking when I did want to. I trust her, but she recently also told me that she'd stayed with her ex, talked about her personal issues with him(and smoked with him) and fallen asleep at his house while we were still in the 'talking' phase. This is the ex that she told me broke her heart and cheated on her.

We flew there, but decided to rent a car and drive back early because we got nervous about coronavirus and didn‚Äôt see how it was a good idea to stay anymore. While we were there, we were so careful that we almost didn‚Äôt have any fun. We constantly washed our hands, used hand sanitizer, sanitized our phones, avoided touching our faces. and scrubbed ourselves down in the hotel room as soon as we got back from the parks everyday. 
       I‚Äôve been staying home ever since we got back because I‚Äôm super paranoid that I have coronavirus. My mom is completely fine and has no symptoms, and keeps telling me not to be worried about it, because she would be the one to develop symptoms if we had been exposed and she‚Äôs fine, but I have had a bit of a cough and some congestion for the past few days and it‚Äôs really freaking me out. My dad made me come over to his house yesterday because he missed me but i‚Äôve been holed up in my room because i‚Äôm so nervous. No one in my family thinks I should be avoiding them, they all think I just have allergies, but I feel like I should be doing more. I feel bad about even going to Disney in the first place, but it‚Äôs irreversible. 
       I decided I would stay home and continuously wash my hands for the next two weeks to be careful, but now i‚Äôm worried that I could be giving it to my family. I don‚Äôt really know how to avoid that. Should I be hiding in my room and only coming downstairs for food? Is it ok to switch between my moms house and dad‚Äôs like usual? or should I be self isolating? or am i probably ok? I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do.",17Mar2020,1
819,"I'm a 20 yr old college student, and my family has been very stressed out. We got a new, bigger house and moved in both of my grandmas and my uncle. My grandma (dad's mom) moved in because she was recently diagnosed with dementia and can't pay her bills, shower on her own, etc. She raised my cousin (who's 22 and another college student) because my aunt has schizophrenia. Basically, my cousin has lived with my grandma since she was 6 months old. My dad has been taking our family to visit my grandma and cousin since I was very small, but my grandma never really went out of her way to get to know me or develop close relationships with us. Sometimes it feels like she only cares about my cousin. Over Christmas break, my cousin took a long bus trip from (11pm-5am) here. My dad picked her up and he told me she was really snappy. My grandma, dad, cousin and I took a walk later that day and my cousin stormed off for no reason. My dad asked her, ""Why did you poo on our walk? If you do that, we won't take you anymore."" My cousin said, ""Fine. Whatever.""

824,"Hello everyone,

I have a situation and I need advice. On November 20, 2019, I purchased roundtrip tickets from Jacksonville, Florida to Amsterdam, Netherlands for travel 03/04/2020-03/18/2020 from skybooker.com. I did purchase travel insurance through CSA Travel Protection. While in Europe, on 3/11/2020, the travel ban was announced in the U.S. and the international leg of my return flight (AMS-PHL) was cancelled by American Airlines shortly after. Upon contacting AA, they told me to contact the 3rd party through which I booked. I called skybooker.com (no response) and sent them an email on 3/11/2020. On 3/14/2020, I was in Denmark and the country announced the closing of their borders. At this time I realized it was necessary to get out of Europe ASAP. I booked a flight to London on the same day, and a flight from LHR-JFK and JFK-JAX for the next day, 3/15/2020. I arrived back in the US on 3/15/2020. On 3/16/2020, I messaged [skybooker.com](https://skybooker.com/) again about my cancelled return the flight. Here is their response later in the day:

""Hi ---

Please be informed that partially used tickets are non refundable.

The Airline is providing you the rebooking option wherein you can use your ticket before 31 Dec 2020 by paying fare and tax difference.

Request you to decide and let us know the dates.

Note: If reservation is not cancelled 24 hours prior to departure time then ticket will not have any value.

**We are servicing customers via phones &amp; emails that are scheduled to travel within the next 72 hours.**  
**Please note -¬† As Airlines are not giving full refunds on their disrupted¬†flights, all refunds are subject to airline penalties with an option of future credit.""**

I then immediately responded to their email with:

""Please cancel my reservation and provide me with a credit as it must be 24 hours before departure. The part of my ticket that was not used was from AMS-JAX, does this mean that I can get a credit for the value, or do I have to use the same flight details/location?""

As of 3/17/2020, I haven't gotten a response from [skybooker.com](https://skybooker.com/). However, I called AA and they were able to see that my flight was cancelled. I asked them about cancelling my reservation to retain the ticket value and the rebooking details. The agent told me again to contact the 3rd party but that she would cancel my ticket. After she spoke to the tariff desk to get more details about rebooking, she told me that my ticket had NO VALUE. How can my ticket have no value if I had not gotten on the plane? Then, this reminded me that in January 2020, my original flight on 3/18/2020 from PHL-JAX scheduled for 9:00 PM had been cancelled by the airline and I had been rebooked on a flight that gave me a 15 minute layover in PHL (I arrived in PHL at 3:35 PM and departed at 3:50 PM.) I contacted [skybooker.com](https://skybooker.com/) on 1/5/2020 about this involuntary schedule change and they gave me a rebooking option, which I accepted on the same day. However, I was not actually ticketed on this new option until 3/2/2020. On AA's website, they are saying that tickets purchased before March 1, 2020 are able to rebooked at a later date, and I am thinking that since my return flight wasn't changed until March 2, this is why it has no value. But that is either [skybooker.com](https://skybooker.com/)'s fault or AA's fault.

SO BASICALLY,

I would be still stuck in Europe right now with a cancelled flight tomorrow if I had not purchased a new ticket back to the U.S. out of pocket. My travel insurance says they only cover flight cancellations due to weather or mechanics.

Does this count as negligence on behalf of [skybooker.com](https://skybooker.com/)? They ignored my multiple attempts to reach out regarding rebooking and essentially left me stranded in a foreign country, causing me to pay out of pocket for a new ticket back to the U.S. Also, because they took TWO MONTHS for a schedule change which was not my fault, I may have lost the value of my ticket due to the date it was ticketed. Is it possible to take them to small claims court? I want to know what options and rights I have. I lost about $1200 out of pocket and a lot more brain cells and years off of my life due to the stress of this whole situation. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",17Mar2020,1
825,"As the title indicates, I could use a little help. 

In my almost 30 years of life, I have never found any sort of work that inspired anything other than mild apathy in me. I don't hate my current job, it's easy and pays relatively well. But it's a dead-end gig with no benefits. I do, however, wake up in the morning without dreading going to work (which had occurred in all of my previous jobs- so that's a plus). 

However, I know this can't last forever, and the pay isn't THAT good that I could stay here for the next decade or so. The problem with leaving, however, is that I have absolutely no direction to head in. Never have. In my 30 years of life, I have never discovered anything that I was explicitly passionate about enough to consider making it a career. Hell, I have never had a ""dream job"" (except when I wanted to be a Warrior Princess AND a Jedi at around five years old). 

I went to uni for 4 years, have a BAA degree in something that doesn't matter and I have no real desire to pursue (not to mention the jobs it would produce pay poorly and have obscene hours). The only thing I DO care about is one thing: My freetime.

I have hobbies, I enjoy the outdoors, I like moderate socializing, and having the space/time to enjoy those things is the only thing I've ever been passionate about.

We have a lot of issues but that isn't what this post is about.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't had any work since the last time he kicked me out of the house in November. We are both very broke and in debt, so we have been struggling. I went to Vancouver recently (March 8th-12th I believe) and slept in my car for the duration of my visit. This means I was very exposed; visiting coffee shops 3 times a day, using public washrooms and showers, etc. I was mainly in the North Vancouver area as I found a safe, quiet part to park my car. Note that this is right around the time that the first death caused by coronavirus happened in Canada in a North Vancouver nursing home.

I really need a doctor or other professional to tell us that I SHOULD NOT be out in the world while having these symptoms. He keeps telling me I'm overreacting and that it's just a cold. But honestly, even if it is a cold, I'm audibly sick and nobody is going to hire a sick person during a global pandemic.

I HAVE been applying for jobs online. In fact, my indeed profile tells me I have applied for 48 in the past few weeks.

He keeps telling me that I'm not trying hard enough, even though I actually did print out 20+ resumes and handed them out before this pandemic thing, and was told by every place I gave one to that they won't be hiring until May at the very earliest. I've exhausted all of my options but it still isn't enough for him. I'm so stressed out and scrambling, even though I'm sick, getting sicker by the day, and just need to focus on getting better and not spreading it around.

I wouldn‚Äôt care so much if it wasn‚Äôt for my ill brother being a high risk individual. I told her this and she laughed and preceded to cough etc. I told her she was a disgusting human being and that if we were in Italy she would be done for man slaughter because she knows my brother could even die and yet she laughs about it and targets me.

I have been asked by the school to self isolate with my family but I know it‚Äôs too late, the fact that schools haven‚Äôt been shut down means many more people like me are threats to their loved ones. I know she has infected lots more.

838,"*I am posting on a throwaway account as one person depicted in the story is aware of my main reddit account.*

I have two friends, a male and female, who have recently started to date each other. 

I didn't think much of it at first. I welcomed the change with open arms (granted I did have to explain to the female my true feelings towards the whole change. I had feelings for her yet I never took the step to be her gf for traditional reasons), and allowed the two to do their thing.

It started off small with the odd hugs here and there and sitting next to each other in class which was not a large issue. They are aware of my idea of not dating until it is time for marriage (if you know you're going to break up eventually there is no point, that's my thinking) and so they still try to include me here and there so that I don't feel left out.

That is until now.

As of a few days ago it seemed that they were aiming to keep secrets from me. I do not have any other friends whom I can easily hang around with much and so I stick with them two - they are the only two who I can easily talk about any topic with. Unfortunately for me it appears as though they'd prefer that I didn't do this whilst trying to act kind.

By saying stuff like ""you don't have to stay with us"" or ""you can go ahead don't wait for us"" I know they mean well and are trying not to make me feel isolated, but the thing is only now it seems like they were in fact desperate to get rid of me, as though I shouldn't be with them majority of the time.

I don't know if I am taking this the correct way or not, but it seems that my two good friends, one whom i've known for the past 5 years, are starting to disagree with my existence just so they can be all lovey-dovey.

848,"So I (17F) have been friends with this guy (recently turned 18) for about a year. We were together romantically at one point. Long story short, it was really intense, but looking back on it, he always shoved me on the back burner. I was always an afterthought. I was really just there to get him through the crap he was going through. That‚Äôs well over and we‚Äôre just friends now, but he still never hesitates to use me only when he needs me. He‚Äôs never once asked me how I‚Äôm doing. He knows (because he‚Äôs seen it) that I will always be there. Because even when things got really bad between us, I wanted to be close to him. He was all I had for a while and he knew it. It was obviously a very unhealthy relationship for a while and I‚Äôve grown a lot from it. He validated me sometimes and respected me physically and I thought that was what love was supposed to be like. I thought that was what I deserved, even though he never considered my emotional needs, even when I directly advocated for them. But I had this very idolized view of him. I fell hard and even though I‚Äôm completely through with any romantic feelings I once had for him, I still do put him up on a pedestal. I considered him my best friend in the whole world and even though, in the back of my mind, I knew a lot of the things he did were completely unfair to me, I refused to confront it.

But recently, I‚Äôve been talking to my current girlfriend about him because I wanted to know if she likes him, since I still considered him to be my best friend. She‚Äôs a very reasonable and honest person, so I trusted her to tell me the truth. She said she really wanted to like him but she can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs just so obvious how he walks all over me and is so rude to me apparently and I guess I didn‚Äôt even see it to the fullest extent that it happens. And her saying that really resonated with me because she barely knows him in any context other than the few times she‚Äôs met him/what I‚Äôve told her about him (and I have told her the full story, and I know when she says she doesn‚Äôt like him it‚Äôs not coming from a place of jealousy but from a place of care for my wellbeing). She and I have just been talking about it a lot lately and it‚Äôs really made me realize that he really is bad for me. Again, I think I‚Äôve know it this whole time, I just haven‚Äôt wanted to come to terms with it. And the thing is‚Äînot that it was ever excusable in the first place‚Äîhe STILL walks all over me. She said it‚Äôs so obvious, and I see what she means, I just guess I got used to it. I don‚Äôt think he is purposefully being manipulative, but he is and has been for so long, and now that I am in a mental space where I can better recognize my self-worth, I can say that that is not okay. I deserve better than that.

So I want to end it. I don‚Äôt want to give him an explanation. I don‚Äôt owe him that, or anything. It would just cause drama and not really accomplish anything. He never texts me anymore anyways. I know for a fact he wouldn‚Äôt notice if I stopped putting effort in, since he never has. Here‚Äôs the problem: he and I had been planning to go to prom for a long time. It‚Äôs our senior year, and at the time when we planned for this, I thought we‚Äôd be good friends forever, or at least through high school. But I don‚Äôt want to go with him anymore now that I realize all the awful things he‚Äôs done and continues to do to me. I want to bring my current girlfriend to prom anyways. Also, he and I are planning on going to a concert of a band we both really like in late May. Don‚Äôt want to do that with him either anymore, but I‚Äôd already offered to take him, before I had these conversations with my girlfriend.

So I‚Äôm wondering what the best way to approach these situations is. Should I just not mention prom or the concert and just go with other people and not tell him? I don‚Äôt really want to explain the whole reason why I want to cut him out to him. I know he‚Äôll be super surprised and mad if I do, because this whole time he‚Äôs been accustomed to me being there no matter how much he hurts me.

How do I cut him out without causing too much additional conflict? I might add that most of my friends are his friends too, and I‚Äôm really not looking for drama.

TL;DR: I‚Äôm wondering the easiest route to cut out a toxic friend that was once super close to me but I now realize is and has been taking advantage of me.",17Mar2020,1

852,"Hi.. 24(F) just completed MBBS.. Having a techie boyfriend(26). Started as a long distance relationship since 6 months.. The first 3 months wer really nice, the honeymoon phase of our relationship.. 

But since 3 months my boyfriend ( who has been blessed with immense knowledge and a topper at everything he does) started complaining to me literally for everything.. He Googles everything.. Literally everything.. He never complaints about the symptoms he has,rather he would say the he thinks he s suffering from a disease XYZ.. First he said he was having RA, took all sort of investigations, everything normal. Then he had several episodes of headache.. (his cousin died of brain cancer) after which he never mentioned about his knee pain.. Then he had UTI, but culture negative, for which he was afraid that he was having kidney stones and did all investigations for it. After which the headache disappeared.. Fr the UTI his doctor suggested him circumcision, fr which he Googled every single thing about if.. The typ f anesthesia he should get, the needle used for it etc etc.. Everytime he googles, before and after it, he comes to me with 1000s f quest which I have to answer very patiently.. Nt even a single time I should lose my patience, if I do he ll get all paranoid that I dnt care fr him or treat him well etc etc.. 

Now he thinks he has piles, cos he feels irritation in his anal canal and feels like his anal canal has been blocked.. His brother and his close friend who introduced him to me are also doctors.. Tday I was really n a bad mood and hence told him to ask them fr advice.. Our relationship has been worse fr these 3 months, about to break up but we agreed to work on it.. But I could no longer take this.. I doubt he has Munchausen syndrome.. Its like a having a patient 24*7 complaint to you.. I no longer feel love, being long distant has its own issues already, we no longer share cute texts or sexts.. All I did was to turn down him once and now he says he no longer wants to b with me as i dnt care for him enough...

P. S. I'm a NEET dropout right now and it depresses me enough already, all I want from him is some amount of love right now, but I only end up getting stressed answering him over n over again..

859,"My (18M) girlfriend (19F) and I are both doing the first year of our undergraduate study at University. I'm quite busy doing a double major in physics and mathematics whilst she is doing a double major in English and Creative Writing at the University next door to mine (I think, I keep forgetting the exact name of her course).

She got first in her country for a dance scholarship last year, she gets $2000 each year for it as long as she maintains a B average grade.

Her current assignment contributes a large proportion to her grade this semester. She has to make a short film/short story/fanfiction etc. inspired by another couple short films/short stories/fanfictions etc.

She asked me a few weeks back if I would help her film a short dance film and I said yes. Turns out part of the reason she decided to do that was because I said yes. I may have accidentally made her believe me proficiency in film is greater than it actually is because I won a film media competition a couple years back and had a film group. The problem is I never clarified my skills are in video editing, a task she says she has to do herself for the assignment. I'm not a good cameramen and I have very little experience directing (also side note, recent turmoil in my life has caused me to be ever more indecisive and held back, something that doesn't make for a very great cameraman for a dance video). When it came to filming extra footage (more stationary scenes) I did ok, I wasn't great and she wants to reshoot everything with me as the subject so that she can film. The dance part is where the problems started, she's doing this short film to a five minute music track and after spending about 4 hours in a gym I managed to film what I can but it wasn't great. I was trying my hardest but my hardest was just not enough, sure the footage might be salvaged in post but she already has dealt with depression and severe anxiety before so this has made her become incredibly worried, she spent at least 30 minutes last night crying, and now she looks really shaken this morning. If she fails, or even just underperforms this assignment she could very realistically loose $4000 of scholarship money over the next two years. Both of us have terrible financial situations because her family doesn't help and mine stole my money and kicked me out so this money is incredibly important.

I don't know how to reassure her, I've tried and I'll help discuss the issue with any of her lecturers if she needs me to. I also don't know how I can ensure this assignment isn't a collosal flop as she either has a few days to fix everything or change the entire assignment to a fanfiction.

On a slightly personal and a bit selfish note I feel slightly better this morning but the fact that she put trust in me and I failed her really broke me down last night and it's brought back some of the suicidal ideations I had a while back. I'll probably be fine but it feels so terrible to fail her so hard. Also I smashed my head against my desk in a panic attack last night and might have given myself a light concussion because it still hurts after taking Panadol.",17Mar2020,1

861,"Oof I'm not sure where to start, or how to ask this. But I'd be grateful if someone could give me some clarity. So here it is goes, I guess...

I had to discontinue University because of my mental health, plainly put, I completely broke down. I have to admit that I did it to myself, it was inevitable. I had ignored my own health for years prior, I put it all aside to focus on getting into a good university so that I could study. Very clich√© but I wanted to be more than I am - to be someone completely different. To be the kind of person that is sociable, happy and can achieve their dreams. I thought this was my only chance to start fresh, in a place where no one knew my name. What a joke, right? 

University wasn't what I had expected, I thought that I could be so much more. But in the end I broke down, a semester in and I was already at the advice centre begging to be allowed to drop out. 

For you to understand how it came to this point, I'll have to take you back to the beginning of the first semester. I was doing well, or least I thought I was. Everything was new, but my brother drilled it into me - ""You have to talk to people, you have to approach new people."" - and so I did. I would exert myself, I had to. People would be hesitant to sit by me because, they weren't used to someone like me I suppose. A girl wearing a hijab (headscarf) can be uncomfortable for some, but nonetheless I started to make friends. 

I kept up with work, I was at the library until the A.M. studying for seminars. They recommended that we study 12 hours for each seminar, if you're a 30 credit student and 10 hours if you were a 20 credit student like me. But I studied 12 hours for each and every seminar. Trying to complete readings and further readings. The issues I had ignored for as long as I could all came back to me, my plans of fixing myself the summer prior to university didn't work. 

I started being too anxious to go into the lecture hall without a friend, I felt an overwhelming sense of anxiety and pressure when I would go to the library - it made me feel sick. I ended up not going to the library at all. I couldn't step inside. Not even for a minute. 

As for lectures, I would be there really early, waiting for a friend to arrive so that I could go inside with them. Then I started to panic right before seminars, I couldn't breathe. Still, I continued going to those, but I wouldn't be able to speak, I was paralysed. 

This all escalated, I discontinued going to lectures and seminars but did my work at home. Until I stopped doing work. Then I would lie to my mother about having gone to lectures, all the while I was just at home. In bed, staring at the ceiling. Not eating, not doing much of anything. 

During all of this I did go to my mentor, he advised that I move into smaller seminar groups and I did do that. I went to the mental health councillor, told her that I was walking out onto the roads when cars where coming, but I didn't get the advice or the help I needed. 60 minutes of talking and I was sent home. I couldn't speak to my mother about it, I felt I had caused her enough pain already. I didn't want to cause that same strain again. I am adult enough to deal with all of it myself, I thought. I was ashamed to have let myself get to this stage. The university staff were aware of my difficulties but not the full extent of them. 

I spoke to several members of staff in different positions/departments. I told the person in the advice centre that I cannot sit my exams - I had at this stage, lost all of myself in a whirlpool of depression and anxiety - but I was told that I was one week too late. I couldn't drop out. I was stuck. 

So I was forced to complete the year, the first round of exams started in the winter break. Two weeks before my first exam, a friend had texted me. Saying that she would be happier if I were dead and it escalated from there. Two days was all it took, after those texts, to shut myself off completely. I wasn't there mentally nor physically at this point, I had no concept of time or where I was and what I was doing. It got progressively worse, I didn't sit the rest of my exams. 

I have not felt an ounce of anger toward this friend and have since spoken to this friend, not on this matter but ... I think I deserved to be told that, I mean what the fuck am I doing with my life? I've been stuck in the same place for years. Time has stopped for me, or rather time has won the race against myself. 

I then decided I needed to take a year out before going back to university. But reality is much different from what I had planned. I wanted to do so much, but I spent the first half of my gap year stressing and worrying about getting a job. I kept getting rejected. My siblings were pressuring me, they said that I was wasting my life. I was actively looking for jobs, but they said I wasn't doing enough. Yet, I can't say I disagree. I'm not exactly living it, my life. So I must be wasting it. 

I eventually got a job, I am still working. I am good at my job, though the pay isn't near enough. The stress is exceedingly high. It's a difficult Job. At least the circumstances the staff are under, the lack of recourses and the challenging ...well, I'd prefer not to say what it is I do. But I can't bring myself to quit the job, I'm not doing it for the money either. I'm doing it to help. I can't help myself, but I'm good at helping others. It seems I have the right answers for everyone besides myself, I can't console myself. 

I have this overwhelming sense of never doing enough, never being enough and running out of time. Which I feel I have already. I can't fuck up again. I feel like a child, still living at home because I can't afford to move out. I pay rent (not as much as I would like to, but my mom won't accept more than what I'm giving her already), I clean of course, I cook and help out where I can. But I feel like a complete idiot, I'm not going anywhere. 

I tried my hand at publishing my poetry but nothing has come of it thus far. I spent a great deal of time painting, sketching ... going on walks in the park. Reading. But I feel I am losing myself again, not that I've found myself. But I feel the same onslaught of emotions overwhelming me. I feel that when I go back I will fail again. 

I haven't been able to achieve the goals I've set myself during this gap year. So, maybe it is true, I am wasting my life. When I go back to university in September I will be turning 21. I've also transferred onto a different course, which I got accepted into, thankfully. 

I'm not sure if this was the right choice, I thought I was studying what I dreamed about for so long. I worked so hard to get into law and politics because becoming a barrister was my life. I had it all mapped out. But I'm not sure whether I fell out of love with law because It isn't for me or because of my mental state. I'm uncertain about everything.  

I've tried medication, each time the dosage was increased nothing changed. I found myself wanting the dosage increased so that I could feel the high, so I could be somewhere else for a little while. But I no longer felt any different, no matter how high the dosage. I tried therapy for which I was on the waiting list for about 6-7 months, I received the maximum of 6 sessions - but I wasn't about to get out of it what I wanted. I tried meditation as well, sleep meditation especially because I struggle with my sleep. 

I know I have a lot of deep rooted issues that I can't even admit to myself nor begin to explain. I just need some advice on going back to university in September. 

My financial situation is not great, hence I was so persistent on finding a job. Since I've done a year already, I cannot fail again - due to finances, they won't fund more than 4 years (they don't take over all costs though anyway.) I've already done a year and the course I'm transferring onto in September last a duration of 3 years. Making it a total of 4 years. So if I fail again, I'm done for. I can't afford to pay for all of it myself, I'll be left with enough debt as it is, I can't add onto it. 

But I'm afraid that I'm unwell now and that it would cause an inevitable breakdown, yet again. But I have to go back to university ...

I don't know what to do ...or even, what not to do. 

At this point my family is aware of my mental health situation, but they don't know how to support me. My mother is rather fed up. Whenever something comes up she tells me not to add yet more problems onto her plate. 

I don't think she has any ill intent, but sometimes words ...hurt. I struggle to eat and sometimes it's worse than other times, when it gets bad she will say things like ""don't you dare get an eating disorder, this is enough already."" or ""my kids should be looking after me, yet here I am, providing for everyone."" As I've said, I don't think she means any harm. She's loving and as supportive as she can be, she has her own share of stress. I mean, she works so much, I can understand where she's coming from. 

I can't speak for my siblings, only for myself. So with that said, I know I am a complete disappointment. I mean ... I couldn't get out of my own bed for months. It isn't easy for a parent to see their child become a complete failure I suppose.

This is where I'm at, there's more but I think this post is long enough.",17Mar2020,1
862,"Hello, 

I developed feelings for a guy at my school and because of the coronavirus scare, I feel my feelings intensified because I felt I would never experience this again, so I eventually told him after he brought it up. However, once I announced I liked him, he wanted to ""cuddle"" and get close and I immediately felt uncomfortable and felt trapped, as if I now had to commit to what I had said. 

The next day, I figured it was nothing and told him I still liked him. Then he got very close and soon a back massage by him turned into touching my body. I felt so trapped and didn't know what to say.  He pushing me into going further and I even told him we shouldn't because of the coronovirus. So he made me feel as if I was ""playing him"" and I just said I wanted to be friends. 

Skip forward the next day I get messages from him saying he couldn't imagine sleeping without me or something like that and he wanted to ""make love to me day and night"".  He only wanted my body and I felt even more violated. So I told him I felt violated and that to leave me alone. I blocked him and now I have to return to my college to pick up my stuff.  What do I do know? I don't imagine I'll run into him, but this could get aggressive and he even said he'll purposely sleep with an older guy to get at me which is dangerous because if he has the virus, he's risking someones life.

867,"To begin: I am 18, my best friend (JC) is 18, and his girlfriend (IF) is 18.



JC and IF have been in a relationship for around 2 months. I‚Äôve been in a relationship 20 months (with HK). Prior to this relationship, myself and IF had some history and I had feelings for her just prior to my current relationship, which were unreciprocated, but we are still very close friends.

Skip forward to last week on a night out, and IF confessed to me (semi-drunkenly) that she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt love‚Äù JC. Whilst another friend advised her to tell him straight away, I went more along the lines of suggesting she stay with him for another 4/5 weeks, and then reassess, as she may grow to love him the more time they spend together.

She then responded to my advice with ‚ÄúI know that I‚Äôll never be in love with him‚Äù. When I asked why this was, she responded with ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm in love with someone else‚Äù. When I then asked who she meant, she looked me in the eye, began to cry and said ‚ÄúI really can‚Äôt tell you that‚Äù. She then continued crying, saying that she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want [me] to die‚Äù (due to my occasional recreational drug use).

This isn‚Äôt the only instance in which she has seemingly admitted feelings for me. Around 8 months ago on a school trip, prior to her relationship with JC (yet still 1 year into my own relationship), she asked me how I would ‚Äúdescribe our relationship‚Äù, to which I responded ‚Äúamazing friends but nothing more‚Äù. On this occasion, she also said she feels like she‚Äôs ‚Äúdrifting closer towards me‚Äù, and reckons that our relationship is ‚Äúone in a million‚Äù. I also found out a couple of months after this that, on the day of said school trip, she‚Äôd been asking a friend their opinions regarding my current relationship with HK, and a hypothetical relationship between IF and myself.



I just thought I‚Äôd ask what advice you‚Äôd give for this situation. I‚Äôm considering asking IF in 3 weeks or so whether her feelings towards her boyfriend have improved, and then deciding what appropriate actions to take following her response. Ideally, in the event that she finds her relationship untenable, I‚Äôd rather he found out from her, as it would be a difficult conversation for me to have to have with him. I am obviously more than open to different advice.

And, to clarify, follwing IF‚Äôs rejection of me 2 years ago, before my own relationship with HK, I don‚Äôt have any sexual or romantic feelings towards IF.

Thanks.

He's always made passing comments towards my gf, but she's told me not to worry about them.

883,"Sorry for the title, I wasn't sure how to word it.

So last semester, I met a guy in one of my classes. Thought he was really cute, and we didn't really talk until a few weeks in. When we did, I invited him to a study group with my friend and he agreed since he's not good at the subject. Anyhow, we became friends, and I guess that's when my crush kind of came to fruition. We went on an ""outing"" once and I invited him to my dorm to watch a horror movie another time. A few weeks into that, one day when my other friend wasn't there, I decided to tell him I liked him. He said he'd just gotten out of a relationship but that I was really cute and nice he was sure the next guy I'd ask would say yes. So I told him it was OK and thanks for being so nice about it and that was that. We were/are still good friends.

Now, I thought I'd gotten over him the second half of last semester because I was into someone else for a little while. However, this semester, we started meeting up again (with my other friend), and I realized I hadn't gotten over him. He's the kind of person that's really nice and complementary so sometimes he calls me pretty or bright and stuff and that clearly just did not help. So my crush has just grown exponentially and especially since we've been texting not only on our group chat but one-on-one about mundane stuff, teasing, joking, school etc. Anyhow, I decided a few weeks ago, I needed to start getting over this dude because it's not helping me (and I've had a crush on my best friend before so I know how that feels). I still want to be friends of course. My friend suggested I look for someone else.

Coincidentally, last week I met a guy during my spring break service trip, that I thought was cute and nice but that I assumed would just be a friend since he was a junior and older guys generally don't give me a second glance (I'm an average looking freshman who looks fairly young). I didn't realize he was into me until we started texting after the trip and he asked me out to a restaurant. So I said yes because he seems like a genuine guy and we had a lot of deep talks and such so I was like, maybe this is what I need. However, I've still been snapchatting my crush and it doesn't seem to be helping my situation because I still have that little tinge of hope in me. But at the same time, I want to move on... But I also don't want to lead this new guy on. So I'm not sure what to do? Right now, I'm for sure going out with this guy to see if anything comes of it, but it's still seeming pretty hard to get over my crush even though this new guy seems really good for me.

884,"Hi. I am in need of some outsiders advice. Something MENTAL is happening at my work place at the moment. 
Let me give you a bit of context to understand fully. 

We are a team of very close girls who look after injured wildlife. All of us are absolutely 100% dedicated to our jobs and have a passion for animals. I know this! 

But recently shit has got weird. Writing or graffiti as we are referring it as, has shown up in various locations on the centres walls, In pen, Some engraved into the walls. 

It started with the words 'fuck' 'cunt' and a weird drawing of a cat ???? These were found on walls and door frames. 
The swears continued for sometime along with peoples names. I'll use fake names for this if I need to later on.
So 'fuck jade' 'asshole megan' and similar was found for sometime. We all thought it was a new girl 'tegan' but we quickly realised it was not her when she was in a different country when it kept happening. Now the writing has progressed to FULL BLOWN DEATH THREATS like ''come at night I dare you' 'I'll cut you bitch"" ""hurt is coming to you both""

Now this is where it got scary as the remaining people I personally am very close with. 
To cut a story short, I have been shortlisted as a suspect along with 4 other people, hayley and lily my 2 closest friends and then Rachel and Emily who I am relatively close with.(who is also the girls being targeted ) Although I am convinced it is these 2 girls who are doing the graffiti. Plot twist I know but I have my reasons. We all got individual meetings with the police! Got read our rights etc! IM INNOCENT!!!!!!!(not too worried as I got the feeling the police man knew I was not invloved) People at my work are now making my life hell because they think I am this crazy psycho writing on walls, I am the youngest member of staff (19) and I am certain I know who is responsible for this and trying to make it look like it's me! My boss also is certain he knows who is responsible and he knows I am not involved ! We know who it is but cannot prove it. 

HOW DO I PROVE MY INNOCENCE THE POLICE ARENT DOING ANYTHING AND THIS IS GOING TO RUIN MY CAREER PROSPECTS. WHAT CAN I LEGALLY DO WITH CAMERAS ETC TO CATCH PEOPLE OR WHAT CAN AUTHORITIES DO.",17Mar2020,1
885,"Not sure where to turn with this one so advice would be appreciated!  
I use a certain social media site often, I post art, and have a few thousand followers. Not that many, but enough to where I've suddenly got someone messaging me daily. I don't mind chatting a bit with people, and I happily offer advice on my hobbies as people do ask from time to time. But it has turned into frequent DMs throughout the day. Things that would be better served being posted on their own by the person rather than sending them directly to someone. They also got very personal very quickly and have asked for emotional support.

I have trauma and I have issues with boundaries. It's something I'm working on but it's a long process. I can tell that I am uncomfortable right now, however, I feel extremely uncomfortable with the idea of telling them to back off. I also have a lot of sympathy for people who are lonely or awkward and I feel very obligated to try to help them out/be extra kind. I am always happy to offer support if people are having mental health issues. I don't think that's a bad thing but I can get in way over my head/give off signals that I want these people to continue texting me constantly when..

887,"Throw away account... sorry for the grammar, in a rush.

My current roommate has lived with me on and off for the last 2 years. (I'll call her Shelly.) She has helped me out with rent when I needed it and helped look after my house/pets as my work needs me to travel overnight a lot. When she moved in 2 years ago, it was just Shelly, my dog, and I in the house. Since then our house has grown. My fiancee lives with us, as well as her bf, and she got a dog. So that's 4 people, 2 dogs, and my reptiles in my house. My house is on the smaller side with smaller bedrooms. We mainly occupy the main floor while she stays downstairs and we have to share the kitchen. It's maybe 800 sq ft per level? She has a bathroom downstairs with a stand-up shower (important later) and I have a full bath upstairs with a tub. It's also a ""semi on suite."" Meaning the bathroom has 2 doors, one that leads directly into my bedroom, and one into the hallway.

&amp;#x200B;

Shelly has been driving me nuts for several different reasons. 

1. Her dog. I know everyone has a different perspective on how to raise a dog. I used to be a dog trainer. She's not training him bc she believes that ""she'll just take advice from me!"" Well, I don't have the time to train her dog! I work too long and hard at my job. I don't have time to dedicate to a puppy and that's one of the main reasons I don't have a puppy. Yes, I have a small old dog but he's trained the way I want him. Not perfect, but, he knows basic manners. Also, have I mentioned... I'm ALLERGIC to dogs? Half the reason why I changed careers. I suck it up with my guy because he's little but he's also 13 yrs old. Once he goes, I have zero intention of getting another dog unless it's a poodle and that won't be for YEARS down the road.
2. They don't really clean up after themselves. I've had guests that come over and they want to see my reptiles. Which are kept in the guest room downstairs. There are 3 bedrooms down there. One they use as a bedroom that has all of their things in it, one that's like their ""TV room"" which I still have things in, and another that's a guest room/reptile room. Every guest that has come over has said the basement smells AWEFUL. Some is dog smell, some from him making potty mistakes (he's a puppy) and others from who knows what else. They also don't put dishes in the dishwasher or really clean up pots and pans after they cook.
3. They have been making my utility costs go through the roof. Keeping windows open in the winter, running a space heater at all times, and just generally being extra people in the house.
4. She keeps demanding I do things around the house. Fix this, do that. For example, she demanded I fixed the doorknob on the door at the top of the stairs. Ok.... it wasn't really broke it just didn't latch all the way so their dog could just push on the door and it would pop open. The door has ALWAYS been like that. Well... we wouldn't have this problem if she didn't get the dog I told her I wasn't a fan of her getting in the first place! She also moves my things around that are downstairs all the time which is frustrating.
5. She keeps saying she's going to move out. Then go!! 
6. She keeps using my things. I bought new ice skates last year. I ran into her in front of the house when she was parking. She said she was coming home from skating. Oh? Where did you get skates? ""Oh, I just used yours you weren't using them, btw you need to get them sharpened."" Uhm what? I got them sharpened when I BOUGHT them. I haven't been able to use them because I got injured at work and haven't gotten the chance. She also went through the bags that I alloted to go to ""donation"" and she took what she wanted. I didn't tell her she could do that. My one side of the family is very poor... my plan was to give it to them. But, she helped herself to it first.

I guess I'm just at that age where I don't want roommates anymore (30/f) and would like to move on with my fiancee and I. She recently had to go out of town to have major surgery that she has been waiting for, for years. I'm happy she got her surgery BUT she JUST informed me as part of her ""recovery"" she has to take 3 baths and 1 shower a day. Meaning she's going to be using MY bathroom. I am the main breadwinner of the house and I need my sleep as I work shift work/on call.

I don't want to be a jerk and I'm more than willing to give her time to move out, but, how much time? How should I ask her? What if she asks me to take her dog? I just want my house and my space back.... The latest story is that she's moving out in June... I doubt that will happen as she has actually moved out before and moved back 2 or so months later.",17Mar2020,1
888,"So I have been talking to this girl for the past 3 months. It started with casual flirting and soon turned into late night phone calls and cute stuff and I liked her. I told her that and we started seeing each other. (we had met just once). However, in some time she turned out to be super clingy, dependent and an absolute trainwreck. And I could not deal with all that because my mental health is horrible as it is. 

So I tried to break up with her but she gave me suicidal threats. And so I couldn't do anything. We fought every day. It took a real toll on my health. And one day I had enough and broke up with her. She threatened me that she will come to my house and cause a scene. She turned out to be a psychotic. She is very trashy, all her friends are the same. And from what I found out, her dad went to prison for murder. And got out. So now I am back with her simply because I fear for my life. Oh, and I'm just 18 and live with my parents. What do I do?

893,"Hey guys!

So, a few years ago I attended a seminar, that dealt with 'the uncanny' and after reading stuff on sleep paralysis and consuming a lot of uncanny media content, in combination with having a bit of a mentally instable time, I got so scared of experiencing sleep paralysis (which I never had and have), that I had a lot of trouble falling asleep and eventually just stayed awake in the night and slept during the day for a while (was semester holidays anyway).

This was like 6 years ago and falling asleep is not a problem anymore right now, since I learned to handle the fear, especially with mindfullnes-exercises, so it mostly doesn't even come anymore, or just mildly and I'm in any case able to handle it well. I also sleep enough most of the time (&gt;8h) and do not wake up all the time or anything. Before this problematic episode I slept normally and had normal energy levels. But now I feel sleepy pretty much all the time. Only after naps in the day or after deep-relaxation-exercises I feel refreshed for up to 1,5 hours. Apart from that I'm always sleepy to various degrees and have trouble concentrating.

I went to doctors quite a few times, but my bloodwork is fine, taking vitamin D didn't do anything, and it's not the thyroid. sports, sleep-hygiene, meditation, good nutrition didn't do anything.

I suspected it to be more of a psychological thing, since doctors didn't know what to do, but psychiatrists and psychotherapists also said, that I don't fit any symptoms-catalogue for a diagnosis.

Also interesting and weird: for about 10 years now, I have a really weird perception-condition, which is pretty much a constant and unwavering brainfog, that never changes or goes away. It also seems to make my emotions less intense and makes it harder to concentrate. This appeared after I attended a festival where I drank a lot of beer and as far as I remeber had exactly 1 drag of a joint. Since then it's always there, it didn't skip a single minute.

I told all these things to different doctors and therapists repeatedly, but they could not help me. I guess after the coronavirus-thing I will try to get a slot in the sleep lab. I also will go to doctors again and also try alternative medicine approaches, maybe I will also ask a shaman and stuff like that. Because: why not :D

I mean I can handle this pretty well now, it's not like I'm suffering like crazy. It's just all really weird and really holding me back, 'cause it's so hard to concentrate.

Does anybody know people with similar symptoms? Does anybody have ideas what this could be or what else I could try?

899,"My (23F) boyfriend (25M) just got laid-off from his job due to coronavirus. He works in theatre, bringing theatre education and performances directly into schools, a relatively unique situation in this industry as this yearly gig lasts from August-May. We live in Upstate New York, and with all schools closing down for the foreseeable future, things have changed quickly. He‚Äôs been at this job for three years, loves it so much, and is devastated to have it cut short. They‚Äôve offered two more weeks of pay and then employees are out of luck. 

We have been together for over 5 years, have lived together for four (three of which out of college and entirely supporting ourselves financially.) We are very lucky that I work at a University and have a decent, stable income. Things will be sticky financially, perhaps for a bit, but we‚Äôll largely come out unscathed (I recognize that there‚Äôs lots of privilege in this, and we‚Äôre blessed to have family that would bend over backwards for us, although we always try to be entirely self sufficient.) 

However, he didn‚Äôt make much to begin with (that‚Äôs the arts industry for ya) and already feels guilty about not being able to contribute as much to our living expenses, so this will only deepen his negative personal financial feelings. Let me first state that I am happy to be the bread winner, any relationship has one and gender norms are gross and outdated, so this is in no way a concern or problem to me. Neither of us prescribe to that, so we‚Äôre both secure in it, despite his desire to always want to contribute as much as humanly possible. Our relationship is awesome, I love him to bits, and he‚Äôs an amazing, kind, loving man who supports me in a million ways, big and small.

More so, I am worried about his mental health. As someone who loves to stay busy and is extremely exuberant and outgoing, losing this outlet and passion will be a major blow. I am also working from home for the foreseeable future, so will be happy to be able to provide emotional support in-person as much as I can. However, I was wondering if anyone in similar situations (whether virus-related or otherwise) has tips on how they‚Äôve helped support a partner, emotionally and mentally, during a tough job loss. I know the importance of letting him feel his feelings‚Äîupset, uncertain, angry, confused‚Äîas much, and as long, as he needs. 

I want to help find things that will help keep him occupied and distracted, whether alone or together, to keep his morale up. Of course, job searching, and all of its relevant preparations, will be on the docket. But, I want to give him a bit of fun, relaxing time to unwind and get in good spirits before we push too hard on job listings and resumes. 

For specific reference, he loves video games, music and playing instruments, reading, and just generally keeping busy (obviously to the extent that social distancing allows.) We plan to go for walks and play tennis in our neighborhood, safely and when weather permits. All tips welcomed and appreciated, from specific activities to words of encouragement to emotional support tips. 

My heart goes out to any and all affected by this unprecedented situation. May we all love each other a bit harder, appreciate and take stock of what we do have, and stay the hell home to keep those around us safe ‚ù§Ô∏è

TLDR; My (23F) live-in boyfriend (25M) of 5 years was just laid off due to coronavirus. I want to help keep him busy, happy, and well-supported emotionally during this tough time until he lands back on his feet. Any and all advice welcomed!",17Mar2020,1

902,"Okay so I met him (mid 40's) at the bar I (f23) work at a while back. Ever since then we've been circling around each other, going back and forth both unclear  in or not really knowing what we want with each other. 
Overall I think he wants too much too fast and I am just an uncertain bitch who never knows what she wants. We keep going around in circles where we aggree on something like fwb, he overwhelms me with attention over texts (like; good morning, good night, wyd every day consistently). Giving me a vibe that secretly he is looking for a committed relationship, which I definitely am not looking for with him. Or one of us does something or the timing just isn't right. Then either he or me decides/asks to stop which is within a day or maybe two weeks turned around to a fwb deal again.
I tend to get so stressed out about the situations we keep getting in. I lose sleep over it and am distracted during our talking/break-up periods. I'm at a normal stress-level in the not talking period. One of those break-up talks was once right before a midterm, it had me distracted throughout the whole exam which was already more difficult than it was supposed to be.
So with all this, my gut keeps telling me to cut the ties with him in a way that it's really final. But I also kind of don't want to and I have no idea why. Sometimes I don't even think I'm actually that attracted to him, maybe more to the idea that he's clearly attracted to me.

903,"On mobile.  Can't find any relevant subreddit so if there's somewhere better I will take it there.

A childhood friend of my husband's suddenly and tragically passed away last week.  They hadn't spoken in over a year, but it was a big shock and they still have a lot of mutual friends.  The funeral (which we don't have an exact date for right now, but I'll assume it's some time in the next few weeks) is going to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland.  We live in the very south of England.  All of the deceased's other friends/family live in Edinburgh.  As some of you will know, here in the UK we have been asked to avoid any unnecessary travel and to practice social distancing.

I'll list my concerns.  I'll also add here that my husband is in the military, active service:

- Even without the pandemic, his travel would put a strain on us financially.  Neither of us have a license (I'm learning and we've just purchased our first car).  Trains/planes all cost quite a bit of money, which we don't have.  We may lose out on our honeymoon in June which will cause extra financial pressure on top of other things - rent, bills etc.  As the trailing spouse I'm really struggling to find a job.  He has suggested the cheaper option of coach travel but that's extremely close quarters and coaches are likely to stop soon.  Also a 12+ hour journey.
- He won't have anywhere to stay other than with his friends who are into drugs and heavy drinking.  My husband got as far away from there as possible for a reason.  
- I don't want him to get sick.  I don't want him to spread it to anyone else if he does.  He won't have any means of travelling home if he is sick and nowhere to stay for the appropriate time it'd take to recover.  He cannot risk passing COVID-19 to anyone in the military.  That much is obvious.
- There's a good chance that public transport will either be shut down or running on very low service.  If he cannot get home, he's in big trouble with work.

I know he's very shocked and devastated by the loss of his friend and I know he desperately wants to go.  I have asked him not to, stating my reasons.  For me, it's simply irresponsible and selfish to place himself and others at risk when the whole ass government has said NO UNNECESSARY TRAVEL.  Am I wrong for asking him to stay home?  I've told him we can do something special together for his friend if he would like to.  I just feel guilty and extremely worried.

TL;DR husband wants to travel long distance to his friends funeral and I feel guilty for asking him not to due to...you know what.",17Mar2020,1

906,"So, one of my parents texts news item after news item about the coronavirus to me and my adult siblings. 

But the thing is, this parent has some interesting ideas about household germs. Basically, they don't think that anything from the kitchen sink (dishrags, sponges, etc.) needs to be cleaned. Not only that, they'll do things like use a dirty dishrag to wipe down counters and so on, which is just not a great idea, even when there's no pandemic.

The issue seems to be that once upon a time, while I was working a restaurant job, I was at their house and sort of reflexively cleaned the kitchen sink, including replacing the dirty dishrags and sponges. The parent said something about how that sort of  might be necessary at a restaurant, but not at a home -- as if bacteria make that distinction or something. So I think it's basically a boundaries/""I know best"" sort of issue.

I'm not sure what to do. I can't stop the flood of texts (and I don't really care about them, tbh). But if I bring up the dishrags, the parent will lose their \*\*\*\* -- which is especially frustrating given that flood of texts. It's like, ""Thanks for the 20th update today.

910,"This requires back story. So, about 1 and a half, maybe 2 years ago I started playing bass, and I enjoyed it. I just played by myself and reading tabs and learning tabs, beginner stuff yknow. I wasn't necessarily good but I enjoyed it and I took it at my own pace, I was kind of behind relative to how long I was playing to be honest. Around September of last year I met a guy who had played guitar for 5 years and seriously for 2. I asked if we could jam and he said yeah, so we met up and we jammed. That's when I really found out that I wasn't that good and really needed to practice more. We jammed more and more, and he introduced more music to me(specifically classics, just to get me to listen to them), and I was improving fast. I felt as if I needed to live up to that standard and I needed to get better and better and better. 

So, fast forward to now, 6 months later. I feel this pressure to learn all these scales, learn all these techniques, and not just do the ""regular"" bass stuff. I still like playing music, but I don't love it the way I used to and I feel pressured to play it. Then I'm pressuring myself to listen to all these bands and get to know all these songs and I'm starting to get burnt out. Plus the vague idea in the back of my mind that being a musician is probably the only thing I'm gonna be happy doing after I finish school. I feel like I'm pushing myself too hard too soon, and I don't really know what to do. I thought about taking a break from playing music all together, or playing only the stuff I like to play, or just take a break from trying to know more music; I don't know.

I've even been trying to find more people to jam with but I can't find people who play my type of music and even if I do they don't get back to me. I want to feel the love for music again.

I've been checking their website and it looks like the wedding has not been cancelled. I've been planning how to navigate the airport. If I can find gloves and masks I will wear them and will take a shower as soon as we get to our hotel.

917,"Okay so this is something that has been going on for a good while now and I don't know what to do anymore.

Okay so some words to hide some info:

The country I live in - ""Shitland""

The city of my old highschool - ""Shitcity""

The city where the people who live there wanna kill me - ""Shittown""

The city where the new school I go to is located - ""Shittyplace""

So I've went to this highschool in Shitland for a semester now and just recently changed to a different one for reasons we'll get into later. Around the end of the first semester I tried marijuana with some of my closest friends at the school (who have all tried it multiple times) and we all became really good friends. We would all hang out almost everyday at school and for a good while, we would smoke some weed together at least once a week.

&amp;#x200B;

So this all went on for about 2 months until I got a call from my dad one day where he told me that he had been contacted by the highschool's counselor stating me and two others had been spotted smoking during school hours and coming back high. My dad told me to come home as fast as I could and I did realizing there was absolutely nothing I could do at that point as it was just one day after we did it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I came home, did the drug test and failed it. Me and my parents then had a long conversation together where I (to sum it up) just explained why I did it and how often I did it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it all started.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents asked me who the other two people were. I said I would never snitch like that on my friends but they swore that they would never tell anyone (not even the school) who they were, they just wanted to know who to not let the fuck near me anymore. So I tell them. Nothing more happens.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day me and my parents went to the school again to have a meeting with the counselor, where we would try to come up with a plan on how the teachers could help me not do it again. (retarded, I know.) We come up with the plan then me and my parents go home. With nothing said about who the other two people were.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER.

&amp;#x200B;

The day after we had that meeting with the counselor, the two other people who did it got busted. And this was the day that my entire reputation was completely destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

So this guy that has hated me for almost the entire semester sees the coincidence that occurred and completely just from said coincidence started claiming that I snitched on them and told the school exactly everything. And thanks to the people in my old class being the sheeple they are, they started believing him.

&amp;#x200B;

Now everyone from my old class except for my closest friends hate me completely and the romour has spread around and now I'm apparently known as a snitch in Shitcity, and one of my friends has for real told his very criminally active friends about it all.

&amp;#x200B;

These people have told him that if they ever see me, they will ""do something about it"". And these people all reside in Shittown, 20 minutes away from the new school I go to in Shittyplace. Now these people are definitely just some wannabe gangsters or something. These people are real. These people carry around weapons and knifes wherever they go and they aren't exactly new to dealing with ""snitches""

&amp;#x200B;

So here comes the part where I really need advice.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do to potentially stop the romour? Is there any precausions I should take as to not get fucking killed? Should I try to convince my family to move tf outta here? I'm really lost for solutions and I feel more anxious for my life everyday. Any help is appreciated.",17Mar2020,1

I've also recently found out that its bit just me who thinks the district and school is terrible, as I found it on a list of worst schools in the district. We're below state level. At my school, there's a lack of opportunity with so little classes and after school activities compared to most other schools. We have 5 class periods in a day: math, science, social studies, and exploratory. (Exploratory: gym, health, or Win). 4 after school activities:basketball, track, robotics club, and pretty brown girls club. The teachers aren't that good and the kids are bad. There is no diversity. There are only black people and a few Hispanics. Nothing else, which exposes me to pretty much nothing. I would go more into detail about the school, but I'm trying not to make this too long. There are literally no good schools near me, and when I get to high school the school is even worse. To add, switching schools within district wouldn't help because even though there are 3 middle schools, they're all in the same  building and they are pretty much the same academically, we all share after school activities, all exploratory classes, and the lunch room. They're just used at different times. We also share the same assistant principal. All 3 schools combined are small because each school has about 200 students, which are 100 7th graders and 100 8th graders making the total 600 students. 

That's enough about my current school. I have about 4 schools that I want to go to. They're all in the same district But they're 45 minutes to an hour away.

He was kicked out for two weeks in which he (supposedly) stayed sober and came back into our home to stay sober. He never experienced any of the symptoms that a recovering alcoholic would apart from constant anger and stress. I run outside and recently I‚Äôve noticed he always opens the door to his van when I‚Äôm gone (I can hear it) and hurriedly closes it when I come near. Today, as I was running past, I came across empty tins of beer. I‚Äôve always noticed he never changed. (Still angry, slurring words) but he only did it after my mother went to bed and when I confronted him (about the slurring words and such) he said he was ‚Äújust tired‚Äù. He only does this the odd time and doesn‚Äôt release his anger on me as much and never on my siblings or mother. She seems so much happier as well as my siblings. Idk what to do. Should I tell my mother I found the alcohol? Should I take a photo? Please help. He‚Äôs not as bad as he was and I don‚Äôt mind he now. He has nothing left if him and my mother divorce and will move back in with his mother. He‚Äôs been an alcohol for twenty plus years and he‚Äôs been suffering the long term effects (as well as the smoker ones) and I don‚Äôt want him hurt. What should I do?",17Mar2020,1

932,"The last few months have been quite challenging for not only me but I'm sure for many others out there as well, 2020 just looks all downhill.

At the start of the year, a mistake cost me a close friendship with a girl I knew at university. When I realized the error of my ways I couldn't help but break down about it, it was that special to me. Then in February, I went through a lot of personal problems ultimately leading me facing the unfamiliar head-on. At the start of March, I realized that the people I considered to be close friends with me at University were really quite immature and plain rude when it came to considering other people's feelings and opposing opinions. Case in point, they started messing with a guy's feelings on social media, when I spoke out about it to them, they turned a blind eye to what I was saying.

Some people I consider ""friends"" don't even text or call me to find out how I'm doing and when I do text them, they leave it on read or unopened for hours - days

Now here we are, a time of self-isolation and a virus pandemic around the world. Although everything is going bad around me, I feel as if¬†being in my own space has brought me closer to myself and has allowed me to really think about everything. 

A few weeks ago I decided to try and mend things with my friend again, I don't want to rush anything but hopefully, it's for the best. I also distanced myself from those toxic friends and I've decided to really appreciate what I have in life, such as my family and life itself

Maybe I've become more mature in a sense but it really scares me. I don't know if what I'm doing is even right, if my thoughts are justified and if the path I'm choosing is worth it?

Stay safe people",17Mar2020,1
933,"I‚Äôm 14 and my dad lives in wales and I love with my mum in England, my dad thinks coronavirus has a 46% death rate and he wears a hazmat suit indoors.

He‚Äôs never been like this before so I tried to reason with him and said that it‚Äôs not dangerous, he shouted at me saying ‚Äúwhat the fuck do you think you‚Äôre doing‚Äù which just made me feel uncomfortable and not want to save anything. Before I was in contact with my dad he had to have a restraining order from the house since he stalked my older sister and stayed out the house, I didn‚Äôt believe my family since my dad said he didn‚Äôt actually go there and just texted my sister saying he did to ‚Äúmess with them‚Äù he brought up that it‚Äôs a far drive and who could be bothered so I put it aside. He was really aggressive in the way he spoke when I tried to disagree and tried scaring me with statistics, I just agreed with him on everything so I wouldn‚Äôt have to argue and he‚Äôd leave me alone, now he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs going to check on me during school hours to make sure I‚Äôm not lying.

936,"He came over and pulled out like a gram and a half of crystal meth, I told him no I don't want to use because I used to be somewhat addicted to meth but quit on May 24 of last year (2019) yet he kept pleading with me to do some with him... I felt bad because our friendship ended a month ago (he ended it, saying some pretty cruel things to me when I did him no wrong) so I caved in and ended up doing probably 5 - 7 points of meth between yesterday and early this afternoon with him...

Here's my question - how can I cut this guy out of my life once and for all? Our friendship has ended many times and yet we always end up friends again, however I am 24 and I recently began college - I still have hope for a good future - while he is ten years older than me, broke and living on disability in a messy run down apartment who has grandiose dreams (he's diagnosed as schizoaffective) yet he is perpetually hoping for a future that should have already came at this point in his life...

I don't want to be friends with this guy, yes I care about him as he was and still sort of is my friend and I feel compassion for him and his painful life, but fuck - I am 24, I don't want to end up a goddamned thing like him in 10 years not to mention now I guess I have a source of meth and I just know if I don't manage to get him out of my life he will drag me down with him - he only started doing meth after our friendship ended, if I knew he was bringing meth I wouldn't have answered the phone or opened the door...It took me a lot to get clean last year (although I was only using for about a 5 month period) and I don't need this fucking loser (sorry but this pissed me off now that he left my apartment and I have time to reflect on this situation....) trying to drag me down to a pathetic existence so he can justify his own shitty situation because I am in the same boat - fuck that...

How can I permanently get this guy out of my life without our friendship coming back again? I feel bad for him that he got into meth but fuck, he knew I was an addict and yet he begged me to do the drug I fucking quit...",17Mar2020,1

I asked in what way mentally or physically and she said that if she texts me to ignore her cuz she feels like I‚Äôm the one chasing and she wants it to be mutual. She was saying this cuz I told her I never had a girlfriend and she‚Äôs teaching me to be dominant and a man. Hate the idea cuz if I were to ignore her I feel like she would move on.

938,"
So last year I was working at this convenience store, and I at first I was going to stay there for only a couple months and leave, but it was set up for me perfectly because it wasn‚Äôt far from my school and it wasn‚Äôt a hard job to do at all. When I started there were 4 girls there and 1 guy and for the first month or so I didn‚Äôt work with anyone except the girls that were scheduled with me, we used to smoke and chill and watch over the store. 

Everything was good, until I started to work with this guy. I personally don‚Äôt have anything against gay people at all, I let them do them and I just keep my distance. At first I can‚Äôt even lie i didn‚Äôt want to work with him alone but unfortunately as time went by my manager fired the 2 girls which put me in the position to work with him. I knew how mean I could be so started to be nice to him because he seemed cool, but he started using my kindness for weakness. First he started to ask if we could smoke together and I didn‚Äôt want to be a jerks so I smoked with him. Nothing seemed to be wrong i was even comfortable with him going in my car to smoke and when he was on break. But I did notice with that sense of trust shit started to get weird after that. He got way too comfortable around me and started to try me on that level and I was extremely uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt tell my manager because I wanted to be cool but thinking back on it know I wish I did.

Again nothing against gay people especially ones that can respect you, but for some reason he didn‚Äôt know what that was. Then to add the fire, another guy was hired and he was also gay and it just gave the whole working environment a weird atmosphere. I couldn‚Äôt handle the harassment that was coming from both of them, it became a bit overwhelming. Everytime i would go to the bathroom and come back he would spray perfume and answer to me sometimes in a girly voice. It would piss me off but I was play it cool to keep control, however I didn‚Äôt add any boundaries and didn‚Äôt want to seems like a scum if I told him how I really felt.

This lead to both of them harassing me, and trying to get in my head and I‚Äôm ashamed to say it work I couldn‚Äôt balance me wanting the job and them torturing my kindness for enjoyment. It was nerve wrecking because I know who I am but they just kept on pretending that they‚Äôll stop and then continue with the bullshit. Touching me, walking in the front of me on purpose and even saying borderline harassing things. 

One day I was cleaning my car, I looked underneath the passenger seat to find some weird ‚Äúwitchcraft‚Äù looking bag with a bloody pregnancy test, shrimp krill, and some sand. I didn‚Äôt know whether it was connected to witchcraft but the shit gave me the chills and after that I immediately told him that I would tell the district manager about the incident. Again wanting to spare him I didn‚Äôt, I just started to stop hanging with him and just stopped talking to him.

The words that I‚Äôm about to say next, is very shameful
but even though I stopped talking to them and even managed to get the new guy fired 

I started to mess around with prostitutes. I felt so bad and ashamed. I didn‚Äôt feel like myself at all and I hated every bit of the fact I felt like I didn‚Äôt have control over myself. It‚Äôs like I was co-hearsed into it and it had a crazy effect in my life. 

I eventually stopped because I knew that it was a spirit that was trying to destroy my life. With that being said I tried to find outlets and people that I know to talk about the situation for sense of comfort but I ended telling the wrong people. I even told my mom about it get some sympathy but it it added to was completed mockery and sneak dissing jokes that are made. I basically sold my self out of seeking validation. Everybody uses it to provoke me and painting me in this canvas I don‚Äôt belong in. I know who I am and I know the mistake I made wasn‚Äôt the best however it didn‚Äôt feel like me anytime it happened.

Fast forward now, I‚Äôm living with a family who keeps on thinking that I‚Äôm gay and every chance they get says something to get a reaction. I honestly feel like leaving and never seeing them again. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Peoples words keep getting to me and I don‚Äôt have control on how I react to them. I just want some advice that could work.",17Mar2020,1
939,"I got into an argument with the owner of the company I work for this afternoon. For the last month I have been asking for permission to buy laptops for my staff so they could work from home in case something like this happened. I always like to plan for the worst but hope for the best.  

Anyway today he told our office that we had to come in even if we were showing symptoms the other alternate option was he would cut our salary by 50% if we chose to stay at home and ‚Äúchill‚Äù. I asked him why my team couldn‚Äôt just work from home he said because we didn‚Äôt have laptops to do that and he got upset when I reminded him he denied my request.

947,"Note: this post is from a 21-year-old male. 

I have been wanting to move out for about a year or so. However, I felt it would be wise to wait until I got my driver's license for obvious reasons. I just got my license about two weeks ago and my desire to move out has only gotten stronger. My family has been great and I love them to death, but the adulting bug has started to hit me and I'd really like to be out on my own. 

However, I feel like the bug hit me (no pun intended) at the most inconvenient time. With everyone on lockdown, staying inside is the safest thing for everyone at the moment. I still want to move out but I'm just not sure how wise it would for me to at this point. At the same time, however, I don't want to bring in any sicknesses to my family. I'm really not too worried about getting the virus, I just don't want my parents or siblings getting it. I have a retail job and fortunately it looks like the stores are going to continue to stay open (at least for now), just with limited hours for customers. I wear gloves and sanitize at work, go home and shower after my shift to keep things safe.

Anyway, if I were to move out, I'd be looking for a small apartment with rent being around $500/mo. I'm not sure if I'd want a roommate or not... I mean, for financial reasons, yes. For company, I'm somewhat of a loner. Of course, I've never done this before so a roommate would be smart probably. I don't even know if realtors are willing to meet with anyone, so if that's the case then I'm stuck anyway. 

What do you guys think? I'm trying to make a wise decision here.",17Mar2020,2
948,"We‚Äôve been together for nearly two years. I‚Äôve been using weed to suppress my problems until I got medicated literally a week ago for BiPolar, and now that I‚Äôm starting to be able to think more clearly, I‚Äôve realized how much I resent my boyfriend and am jealous of him. 

Though his household was broken in its own ways, he got to do so much more than I have and It‚Äôs shit I‚Äôve always wanted to do. He has a stable family, while mine is addicted to meth. His mom gave him love and support and my household never showed affection. He was able to smoke dabs at a time and have fun just doing drugs and shit, which is something I desperately wanted to do to escape life for the longest and suffered with. He ran to Cali with his ex girlfriend and chose to be homeless, had what he describes as the best and worst adventure of his life. 

And me? I‚Äôve been isolated in a struggling, below poverty household. I was poor without the choice, homeless without a choice. I want to run and escape my problems through drugs and party and have fun but know I would get addicted. I want to have fun experiences and not an emotionally abusive and manipulative family that gave me no positive attention. School was my outlet , and guess why? Now he‚Äôs succeed better at school because he can‚Äôt work full time while i am AND going to school. My schoolwork was my outlet and I was amazing at it but my mental health has lead to its steady decline. 

I resent him so much and want to love him because I‚Äôm helping him succeed, but I want to be in his position.

I like her but she is pretty hard speaking with since she analysis just about everything I do during the conversations. Turns out she has high functioning autism which can lead to some misconceptions. This led to her staying pretty quiet during our converations which led to it cutting short.

I made some moves however by making us start chatting online instead of doing it irl. It started of as expected. I said a bunch of cheesy shit I regret so much right now. She responded to me like she didn't know that I was hitting on her. Even when I told her that I thought she had a cute profile pic of her she just responded with something off topic like it never happened. I eventually started getting a bit more sexual and acted very needy. Thats when she couldn't pretend anymore. She got very upset and told me that this was not the right way to speak to a lady and that I should stop pretending like she ever loved me. She also told me that she never was interested in me in a romantic way and that she already had a boyfriend to cut me off completely. But she also made the mistake of telling me that she never saw me as a friend either so which way is it? It was also pretty obvious that she was lying about having a boyfriend since she told me to not tell anyone about it. When I even came close to the subject she would be very clear about that her partner lived ""far away from us"" and that I didn't know him. I told her that she didn't need to name any names so she obviously didn't need to be so specific about what I knew and didn't. She blocked me shortly after.

She was terrified of me the next couple of days in school. She panicked the first time she saw me and quikly rushed to another direction when she was walking towards me. She eventually told a teacher about the whole thing and wanted her to speak with me. My teacher surprisingly accepted my reasoning. I have no idea what the teacher said to her afterwards but the she didn't come back to class till the next day. She seemed super embarrassed and was extremely quiet. All other people in our class probably already knew about the whole thing and I was seen as some brutal murder during the next couple of months. I didn't say a single word about her to anyone (except the teacher) and in some ways that changed the way she viewed me. I think she was thankfull for me for not bringing up her imaginary boyfriend thought im still not 100% sure if it.

Now after almost a year later the whole situation has changed and now she is the one that seems to be crushing on me instead of me chasing her.

961,"So a bit of background, I have just finished University and the job I have is very near my parents house so to save some money my parents very kindly offered that I move back home rent-free whilst I save for my own place. 

For the most part this is a great arrangement and I‚Äôm very appreciative of the free accommodation. However, it feels like my mum is often criticising me and I‚Äôm finding it tough to deal with. I often go to bed early and cry quietly because some of things said really hurt.

The main comments tend to be along the lines of:

1. That I am lazy and not at all hardworking. Recently when my sister came to stay she told her that she had to be ‚Äúthe work police‚Äù and make sure I got up for work and wasn‚Äôt lying in bed all day. I can‚Äôt understand why she thinks I would be lying in bed all day. I have a full time job that I‚Äôve never missed a day of and I get up at 6 every morning and am often the last one home. I do like to have a lie in on the weekend, but considering I work 50-60 hour weeks I feel like that‚Äôs not ridiculous.

2. She also often says that my achievements are just ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù because I don‚Äôt work hard. Without trying to toot my own horn, I got all A‚Äôs and A*‚Äôs in my GCSE‚Äôs and A-levels at school and graduated from a top 5 university in the world with a first class degree, I have been promoted at work and earlier this year won a National award for work in my field. I understand some of it was probably luck but I worked hard for what I have achieved and it is so frustrating when she says I just got lucky.

I feel like her mind is made up about me, I‚Äôve tried to understand where these opinion come from and let her know that it can be hurtful but she is clearly not convinced.

Sometimes they're naked sometimes they are not. I don't pay them tho. I just find them pretty chill and easy to talk to. Is that messed up? I always try to open up with girls but I can't control that, it's hard to open up with someone, the girl i opened up to recently was kissing a dude in from of me, on our date. I didn't really feel sad, I was just disappointed because she seemed smart and the guy is flirting with every girl he sees.

970,"16F. I just want to preface this with because of my dad's rules and my own rigorous course load I am unable to get my own job during the school year. Also I currently only live with dad and I don't have many female adults I can talk to about this and help convince my dad I'm not trying to be high maintenance on purpose. I'm also not looking for pity, I just have no idea how to budget and asking my dad to help me will just end up with a lecture and general anger. 

I'm looking for advice on how to balance my budget between wants and needs. For a few months now I've had to buy my own toiletries (hair products, menstrual supplies, etc.) and clothes and even some school stuff (like the ACT and AP testing). He gives me $140 for all of this a month and considering that I have really bad acne, textured hair, and sensitive skin and really sensitive teeth things can get a little more on the expensive side. And because my skin is so bad at times I have to buy makeup to cover it up. The clothes are always really inexpensive like from Walmart or Ross. I'm also really upset I lost my source for shoes (Payless). 

 I mean he'll buy the very basics like body wash and deodorant but anything beyond he says I don't need. He's very adamant that skin care and hair care are important and whenever I try to explain it to him he says I'm expensive and throws in my face the fact that he pays for aligners for me. And because my skin is so bad at times I have to buy makeup to cover it up.

I also have a big interest in makeup and art but those hobbies can also be pretty expensive. I know those are wants and mean nothing compared to basic hygiene and keeping up appearances but I also want to spend my money on things that make me happy. 

How can I balance my budget and what are some cost-effective things I can buy to sustain myself and have some to put aside for hobbies and personal wants, especially on really tight months like when I pay for AP testing?",17Mar2020,2

975,"Hey all

I'm looking for some advice or acknowledgement I'm not alone. I thinking I have a weird pastime that I honestly hate but love - daydreaming. 

Let me elaborate. I am a 22f and I spend a lot of my spare time lying on my bed, listening to music and imagining myself in a variety of daydreaming scenarios (adventure, horror, whatever). I think I have a very vivid imagination, so much so that I can feel like I am in the daydream. My heart rate can pick up, I see hear feel and smell things and I can spend hours just imagining things. I think I'm addicted to it honestly, I've been doing it since I was about 13.

The problem lies in that I dont think I get anything out of it than escapism. I have PTSD, and sometimes my mind moves so fast that this is the only thing that uses up that energy. I hate it though, because I spend so much time doing it that it eats away at my time, relationships and honestly my wellbeing. I love music, and I dont want to give it up. I dont know how to get rid of that restless feeling either, I get serious anxiety if I dont do this everyday.

Does anybody have the same thing? Or something similar? How do you get out of your own head? I hope I explained this well, I've never talked about it before.

TLDR - I'm addicted to daydreaming as a form of escapism, its eating up my time, any advice?",17Mar2020,1
976,"Long story short, I work at a Remington Arms ammunition factory and things have become absolutely insane lately. I'm working extra hours at the moment (12 hours per day, 7 days a week).

I don't have the time or energy after work now that my hours have been increased from 40 hours to 84 hours a week to do my homework, much less EXTRA work that they feel we all need. Fuck, were not all 18 year olds with no responsibility and all the time in the world.

982,"We met while I was on a student exchange in Germany and become best friends. We continued talking almost everyday once I went back to Canada and eventually officially became a couple. We had our honeymoon phase and everything seemed really awesome. She flew down to my place for Christmas and stayed almost 2 weeks before flying home. We had a blast, we were both all over each other and had so much fun. 

After this is when I feel like things went downhill. It happened slowly at first, but she gradually would spend less time with me, send me less random texts, be distracted with her phone and such while chatting. We used to sometimes just stare into each others eyes and over the camera but now she said that's weird. She'll occassionally tell me she loves me or throw in the odd compliment but it is nothing at all like the sort of things we were saying to each other before. I still express my love to her through surprise gifts and words but now she says to stop getting gifts.

 Yesterday, she even made this joke about not wanting to spend time with me. She apologized and said she was trying to be more teasing and it came out wrong, but I felt really hurt. I was supposed to go at Easter, but Covid cancelled my chances of that and since the cancellation, she's felt even more distant. She'll just not talk to me some days or take more than a day to respond to a text. We used to talk everyday and respond promptly. 

At the same time, she talks about how she wants to get through Covid and see me again and she still wears the bracelet that I got her for Valentine's Day. A couple days ago, she sent this post about penguins staying together for life ""Will you be my penguin?"" (This was before Covid cancelled our trip.) 

Overall, I'm just really confused. She'll do or say something once in a blue moon that will take me back to the honeymoon days, but I feel as if she doesn't want to spend time with me the way she used to and doesn't express her love the way she used to. We've gone from talking every moment in our spare time to two hours a day after the Christmas visit to some days not talking at all. She won't make commitments until the day of anymore either. I want to save it, she's smart, interesting, passionate, funny, and I feel like I can be myself around her in a way I can't be around anyone. She always felt comforting, and I still love her so much. I don't know what went wrong or if anything went wrong. What does everyone think before I do something stupid? I feel like her actions are no longer aligning with her words.


TL;DR: My LDR girlfriend wants to talk less and less, gets back to me promptly less and less, makes an effort to show her love less and less and is distracted more and more. This got especially worse after my trip to see her was cancelled by Covid but started declining after she visited me for Christmas (Despite being all over each other for Xmas visit). I feel like she doesn't care for me as much anymore, but at the same time says things about how she believes we will get through Covid and see each other again. I guess her actions don't align with her words.

986,"NSFW warning isn't for smut, but for graphic content/topics. I've posted in r/suicidewatch multiple times in the past but the sub is too inactive to get any help there (not a single person saw any of them to my knowledge) so I've deleted any posts to keep my profile less spammy and decided to post here instead. I've posted here before about a different topic and got very helpful replies so fingers crossed that happens again. This is really long so buckle up. Here we go.

I am a diagnosed schizophrenic. My experience with it is a bit more severe than others I've gotten to speak with. I have trouble verbally coordinating sentences, I have to pace around my house for at least an hour a day for my body to feel satisfied, I have frequent hallucinations (audible and visual, usually separate but sometimes together), it's difficult for me to mentally keep up with others my age, and I have difficulty expressing my emotions both visually (on my face) and verbally. Long story short, that ALONE fucks up my daily life already even with medication. It's damn near impossible for me to make casual friends when I'm stone-faced and barely speaking, let alone having a romantic relationship. But six years ago I found a girlfriend who became the basis of my entire life.

Keep in mind at that point I had no idea that I was schizophrenic. I didn't find that out until this year. At that time, we both thought that I was just a socially awkward girl with unfortunate fits of anxiety. I excused hallucinations as me being able to see ghosts or some shit along those lines.

Anyways, the only thing that could make me feel normal or happy was my girlfriend. We would hang out every single day, often spent the night at eachothers' houses, went to every single event imaginable together, and even wrote stories together even though they were definitely cringeworthy. We did all your normal relationship stuff too like cuddle and kiss and blah blah blah. I gave all of my attention to her for years and vice versa. I finally felt complete. Then things changed very suddenly. In May of 2017, my mom hung herself in my basement around 4:00am. Mental illness runs heavily in my family but I never expected her to go that far. After that time, my extended family slowly started pushing my immediate family away, I became even more kept to myself, and my girlfriend and I became... Distant. She was very quiet around me and hung out less and less with people in general. I thought it might've been that she was affected by the death too. Afterall, my mom was basically her second family. She bonded more with my mom than even her own. This behavior never changed but I got used to it after a while.

But out of the blue in August of 2019, she broke up with me over a roughly three minute long phone call. No warning whatsoever. My world was shattered and I was already dealing with so much at the time that something in me just snapped. I tried to commit suicide. *A lot*. It started off with trying to sleep in the tub but my methods became increasingly more grotesque the more desperate I got. I'll spare you all the gory details but it wasn't pretty. The final nail in the coffin was finding out that after she broke up with me, she was immediately sexting a pedophile. A confirmed, legitimate pedophile. She'd always complained to me how creepy and disgusting he was so never in a million years did I think she was sending him nudes and other graphic things behind my back. But guess who got dropped by him a month later when she refused to meet for sex? You guessed it. We ended up getting back together after a lot of begging on my end and a whole lot of apologizing on hers. We made it work all the way until present day but she's falling back into the quiet unaffectionate always-pissed-off habits again. And as a result I'm falling back into my attempts and self harm again. I haven't told her that but we have had conversations about every other concern.

I can't see my psychologist because everything is being shut down from the coronavirus fears. My most trustworthy psychologist was at my school but now those are closed for at least a month and most likely until summer where we're off anyways. I can't afford another psychologist outside of her and even if I could it would take months to set up an appointment where I'm from. I've tried online therapy but they're straight up scams and don't work. The chances of me surviving for more than a few months with no professional help and everything else piling up are slim to none. I don't know what to do so I've turned to you all in desperation.

I'm in high school. Since last year, I've been crushing really hard on this girl in my class. Turns out, everyone came to know about it (your usual word of mouth stuff) and she told my friends that she wasn't interested. It makes sense, I'm very awkward around her and I've barely talked to her.

I've tried texting her three times, but she didn't reply and I could tell that she didn't want to talk. Fair enough.

A week before my birthday, in class, I was talking with a group of friends and she was there. I mentioned that my birthday was next week and she was like ""Really?"" with a smile. I nodded and smiled back.

Well, the day of my birthday, first thing in the morning, she comes to me and gives me this gift: a pocket keychain notebook where she wrote inspirational quotes on almost every single page. I guess she would've invested quite some time to make this.

In the moment, I was really happy. I mean, my crush gifted me something! But then I asked myself, would you gift this to someone you haven't really talked to?

Well after this we had a decent texting conversation so I decided to ask her out. She declined.

So I decided I would drive back the following day to the house to let the homeowner know that it was me who hit their mailbox. However, when I drove back there during the day, I didn't recognize any of the houses as it was a neighborhood I wasn't familiar with to begin with and it looked different during the day. I drove around for a while and couldn't see any bent or damaged mail boxes to begin with. 

Needless to say, even if the mailbox is fine, I still feel bad though and want to at least let the individual know like I planned to, but I don't know the house!

1005,"A few months ago, a week after my birthday, my uncle had let a man inside my house, without asking me or my mom if it was okay. He was there from... Monday to very early Friday (which is when the incident happened) 

He cornered me twice, first time was to say how I looked like his nephew as I was on my way to school. The second, idk what he was doing. 

He‚Äôd occasionally peek inside my room when my mom came to talk to me, or walk in the bathroom when I was there. Luckly I‚Äôd finished my business, usually just washing my hands. 

It made me uncomfortable, but he was leaving soon, so I endured the awkwardness. 

But on Friday, precisely at 2am, I thought I heard my door open, but, again, 2am. So I ignored it. It wasn‚Äôt long after that when I realized he was in my room. On my bed. He‚Äôd Pushed my blankets off my body, and he started touching my thigh, way too close to my bits. thankfully, moving his hand around that area, to my stomach (I think i cant remember). I asked what he was doing once I realised what was happening. I asked him to not touch me. so.. He took his hands off me, and didn‚Äôt say a word. 

I asked for him to leave, but he said ‚ÄúOkay. Yeah‚Äù and just repeated the same thing I asked him to go. I remained calm, despite my heart racing, and my body shaking. Thankfully my uncle came upstairs, as he lives in my basement, and got him to leave. 

He was staying in my living room, which, there isn‚Äôt an upstairs or downstairs. Just. The floor, then basement. My room was down the hall. 

He came back, and I‚Äôd covered myself, explaining to a friend what just happened. I put my phone down and asked something when he returned. I cant remember what. Anyways, I think he came back with a knife. He had something in his hands, sitting back on my bed, telling me it was ok as he rubbed my arm, and occasionally my leg or my waist.

My uncle came again, said he was getting worried, made him leave which, he only came back a third time. 

He was a homeless man. A man who had drug problems, speech problems. So I couldn‚Äôt understand a lot, but the words I heard clearly was something about how he didn‚Äôt want to live on the streets. 

He said the word ‚ÄúKill‚Äù. I think he planned on threatening to kill me, or planning on killing me so he could have a roof over his head. Or maybe, he‚Äôd threaten to hurt my mom. Either way, my uncle came back again, and spoke to him down the hallway. He put something on my chair (I have a ps4 in my room; with a lil chair) Which i picked up, and knew it was a knife. So, I put on some pjs, walked down the hall and told my uncle, he had a knife. My uncle was talking to the man as if he was a child who was caught stealing cookies, or trying out smoking or something. 

I was still shaking, and I went into my moms room which was just across mine, woke her up and told her what happened. She went over to the strange man and slapped him. I felt bad. I don‚Äôt like violence, but then I remembered what he did. What he could‚Äôve done if I hadn‚Äôt woken up. Would he rape me? Kill me? My mom or my uncle? I don‚Äôt know. 

My uncle took him and drove somewhere else. My mom was comforting me, and by this point, it was like. 6am. I think. I was supposed to get ready for school. But never went. 

To this day, I don‚Äôt know what to call it. I felt violated, but i don‚Äôt know if it was just.. creepiness, or, sexual assault or something. He never touched my private area, never forced me to touch him, nothing like that. As far as I know, he lives in a different city about 3-4 hours away. He knows where I live, and I‚Äôve been scared about whether or not he‚Äôll come back and hurt my mom. My friends told me to call the police, or report it, and that it WAS sexual assault, but he never fondled me, or rubbed himself on me. 

It felt pointless to report it, since the police need evidence, right? There was no evidence. He was probably mentally disabled, which might‚Äôve given him a get outta jail free card. I never trusted the police. I‚Äôd rather not feel worse about the situation by having gone to the police, only to be turned away because the man was gone, and I‚Äôm not female. Not that they ever really do anything about people who actually do get raped or assaulted, because ‚ÄúLack of evidence‚Äù

He made a stock account and again, because of a simple mistake, all of his invested 3,000 dollars worth of money is gone. Today is St. Patrick's Day and he thought it would be a lucky day to invest in stocks. But then, everything just disappeared. All because of a simple mistake AGAIN.

He already lost tons with stocks. He finally got the courage to come back again. He made a new account. And of a simple mistake AGAIN.

1008,"hey, 
i know it's quite a silly problem, that people have more serious ones, but it has been troubling me for a while now and i don't know what to do. 

we can say i'm a lonely extrovert. i don't know have many friends and, well, i crave them so badly. it's not only about meeting people (but also, obviously), the true problem for me is getting close with someone. i feel like there are not many people that like me that much and even if they do, they are looking just for ""casual friendships"". 

it sounds kinda pathetic, and irl i keep on a mask that says that everything is fine (like i said, i'm an extrovert, which is weird given a current situation) but when i get home i just feel so lonely that i cry myself to sleep. it hasn't always been like this, but in the past year/half a year a few things have changed in my life and now i feel like i have nobody. i keep reaching out to people, but they rarely do the same for me. 

i really don't know how to be lonely and i am getting more and more miserable by this. i don't know if the problem lays in me (maybe i do sth wrong when it comes to relations or maybe it it's sth in my personalisty)or is it the circumstances. idk if it's temporary but i am slowly losing my mind and because of it getting more self concious. i know that i should learn to love myself again, but it is very hard for me with no deep relationships, when it feels like nobody cares about you and nobody truly knows you.

Some of Our TAs are great, some are terrible, but they‚Äôre all overwhelmed and now with classes and office hours going online I just know it will be all the more difficult for me. The class isn‚Äôt required for my major, it was one of many options I could‚Äôve done (other ones being neuro and bio classes, which I‚Äôm interested in), but I thought it would be helpful and maybe advantageous to have some python knowledge in our computer driven world.

I have an A right now but it‚Äôs so much work and struggle through every day that my other classwork is put on the back burner.

1028,"Ok so this is a very odd situation. My mother had me when she was young like high school young. So my grandparents stepped in and took care of me. Even adopted me so I could have insurance at birth and not be drown them in debt. So when I was like 4-5 years old my mother comes in at breakfast and says she is moving out to move in with my now step father. 

I was never factored into her plan. So I stayed with my grandparents I still saw my mother from time to time and she lived up the road it‚Äôs not like she moved to another town. Eventually she had my had my sister and when she was old enough she asked my mother why I (her brother) did not live in the same house as her. So my mother moved me in with them to avoid an awkward conversation. 

So I live with them but I always feel like the outsider like the black sheep like I don‚Äôt belong. My step dad is a good man and was always kind to me but he was not my father. Over many years I was prone to getting into mischief and was bored with school work so I got into trouble often. One night I had done something bad like made a bad grade or forged a signature or wrote a dirty note to my girlfriend. Any way that night my mother was so mad so screamed and yelled at me ( happened often because I got in trouble often). She said ‚Äú Your just a mistake and that is all you will ever be.‚Äù 

Not at this time I am around 11-12 I am smart enough to see that I don‚Äôt fit with my family. I still see and stay with my grandparents often. Around this time my grandmother became very sick and we all thought she was going to die. My grandfather took me outside and told me everything about me, my father (what little he knew), my mother all of it. Until this point I had never been told this but I always knew something was different about me. He even said I had shared an elevator with him that day. 

This made me very angry that my father and mother didn‚Äôt want me. I began to party and numb my pain any way I could. At 12 I always secretly wanted to meet my father I always could have forgiven him. I just wanted a Dad. So I grew up I went on to seminary school (don‚Äôt judge me that‚Äôs not my profession now). One day I decided if I was going to over come the pain and hurt I felt because of my trauma I needed to forgive them both. So I talked with my mom forgave her moved on with our lives (our relationship today is still strange but healthy). 

So then I began to seek out HIM. I found out that he had a family a wife, a son, and a daughter. At this time I am in my 20s so some what adjusted to the way things work. I get the number from a friend and I call it I hear a mans voice say ‚Äúhello‚Äù.  I speak my peace because of it is him I need to get this off my chest if it‚Äôs not just putting this out there will help. 

I basically asked him if I had the right number he said yes this is him I said I am (my mother‚Äôs name) son do you know who I am ? Long pause yes. So I did it I spoke my peace I was mad I was forgiving I was at peace. After I word vomited all over the place he says ‚Äúyou sound like a good guy who is making good decisions, but I already have a family, and I would never do anything to hurt them.‚Äù He hung up I was crushed. 

I am still not sure what I expected to happen but that was not it I was at peace some but it still gnawed at me that I never knew my father I got married and had kids all without him. There were times just like my entire life where I needed to just chat with my Dad but couldn‚Äôt. He changed his number the day after we first talked. 

So then my son is born I had put my Dad out of my mind then I held my boy for the first time I whispered to my son no matter what I will always  be there for you. It was like having kids had soften me to trying to meet my Dad again. After my daughter was born I really felt like I wanted to try again with him. So about a year ago I found his daughter (my half sister) on social I follow her silently for a while and one day I do it. I did protect her thought and told her, her dad (who use to be a cop) saves my life one night and I wanted to thank him gave her my name and stuff. A few days later. 

He texts me. He first asks me not to contact his daughter again. I explain all I want is to know him. He chats me up asking me questions so I ask him questions for about a week we text every day but only from 8-5 on weekdays. I find out a lot like he was adopted and never knew until he had an operation in his 30s and his foster family told him. (So I am the bastard of a bastard). 

Then one day a switch flips he stops texting and no longer wants to talk. Before when we were talking he was open to meeting me. Now we are to the point were I text every couple months and say I still want to meet. He texts back not ready yet or not a good time. At this point my half sister has a little girl but his whole family knows nothing about me. Help random internet people what do I do? I don‚Äôt want to push him away or hurt anyone.

1034,"I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb. Back when I was a teen, I kind of took pride in being 'different', but honestly it utterly sucks! I just want to feel accepted, to be able to be myself without worrying, even when I try to joke or do something nice 90% of the time it backfires and I end up feeling awkward and embarassed :(

I feel like I care, consider and value people be they family, acquintances, classmates, or strangers, but I prefer to reserve and restrain because it's like a curse.

I'm sick of telling myself that being different is okay, or that I can't please everyone (more like no one).

A fund was set up by an organization to help those of us going through a difficult time. You have to submit paperwork detailing your situation and, of course, your financial status.

Well, an outlier (certainly not a friend) texted me today to brag that he's getting about $800 from them. Apparently he lied to them about his situation and bragged in the text that he now has ""gambling money.""

I'm extremely irritated because I have so many friends that are waiting for their call to get help. They genuinely need it, living paycheck to paycheck. Some of them got his bragging text as well. 

I'm tempted to anonymously forward the text to the organization, not because I don't like him but because it's a selfish, awful thing to do right now. But, obviously, I also don't want to be a whistle-blower or get involved.

When I first heard about the opening, my friend described two positions and the setting. One being with ‚Äògrumpy mean people‚Äô (red flag one) and the other with her old favorite coworker. Obviously the later sounded better and it ultimately made me choose that position. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôll need to get some training briefly from the grumpy person and to watch myself with them, not let them boss me around or give me a hard time. (Red flag two) Today a worker came in and spoke to my direct supervisor/coworker with disrespect and attitude. (Red flag number three) Think of it like a manly drama queen, not very professional and not at all composed. He kind of berated him a little and was pushy, not giving my supervisor the opportunity to get the material in front of him to help him before starting the dramatics. Obviously if someone is having a dramatic out burst and firing off questions before you can get the material in front of you, it‚Äôs take you a second to get your bearings. On the other hand my direct supervisor was cool calm and collected. He got the problem figured out and that was that. We ignored the whole situation and continued to make small talk. I‚Äôm concerned about having to deal with the two of those people in the future and what they can and may be doing to employee morale. Should I bring this to HRs attention? What other options as a new employee can I employ to combat this?

1047,"On mobile, so formatting may be weird

I‚Äôm a senior in high school and for the past few years, I went to a summer camp that I really loved. I met some of my best friends there and still keep in contact with a lot of them. I have a lot of great memories from there and I really consider it a home-away-from-home.

In January, I was offered to interview with them (without even applying first because someone recommended me for the position) for an 8-week position (with two weeks off) where I would receive a scholarship at the end. Of course, as a soon to be college student, I need all the money I can get (especially since my parents aren‚Äôt helping me pay for anything). Plus, I already love it there, so it seemed obvious that I‚Äôd do it.

I brought it up with my s/o and they seemed a little upset by the idea that I‚Äôd be gone for that long (which is completely understandable). So I asked if they had an opinion on it and they said, ‚ÄúYou do what you think you should do.‚Äù And I asked over and over again and they said the same thing. I ended up interviewing with them and it went very well. I went over to my s/o‚Äôs house afterwards and told them and they seemed happy for me and I told them I was going to fully submit an application.

(For a bit more context, the position I was offered would mean I spent 4 weeks at a day camp and lived at home and another 4 weeks at overnight camp. They have another program that‚Äôs shorter, but means no scholarship. told my s/o this and how I was unsure about which to pick, and they proceeded to give the same answer about pick which ever program I wanted.)

Fast forward to now, I ended up finishing and submitted everything just fine with no issues. I got a call today and the woman who interviewed me (and is head of the program) let me know that they wanted to formally offer me a position. I was ecstatic, I called my Dad and told my Mom and then called my s/o.

I told them everything and they kind of just brushed it off and didn‚Äôt talk to me for the rest of the call (we were Facetiming and because school is out, we stayed on while they played a video game and I filled out a scholarship application).

I understand being upset because I‚Äôll be gone for a while, but I also would‚Äôve taken that into account when interviewing at all. I‚Äôm also a bit hurt because they didn‚Äôt even seem happy for me at all and they know I‚Äôm incredibly excited for this opportunity. I don‚Äôt wanna seem like a short-sighted teenager, but I thought that I‚Äôd done everything okay and communicated well on my part.

I can get into these really bad moods that last for days, sometimes weeks, and when I‚Äôm like this I try to interact with my family as little as possible but I can get quite snippy sometimes when they try to engage with me. The only way I cope is through writing my thoughts and feelings in a journal. These episodes are becoming more frequent now that the routine of going to uni has been disrupted.

After this argument I had with one of my sisters where she told me that I could act as depressed as I wanted to, I thought that I‚Äôve had enough and maybe I should tell my whole family that I haven‚Äôt felt happy in years now, that I get anxious and depressed. That I‚Äôm really struggling and I‚Äôm hiding everything with a stoic face and a cold front.

The couple was sitting at their table packing product and chatting when I asked the guy (his English is better) if one of them could finish while i helped out our coworker. He said yes and I left the room. 

About a half hour goes by when a machine operator asks me who is supposed to be offloading and when I tell him, he tells me that nobody has been to the machine and it's backed up. I went to go back to my room when the make coworker found me In the hallway.

The male coworker that I asked for help asked me if our boss told me to help my other coworker out and I told him no, she asked me for help. Since corona virus is hitting our city a lot of people are out and she needed help for about a half hour so I figured it wasn't a big deal. He informed me that he would not help offload anymore unless our boss told him to or he was assigned to the task.

I very rarely ask them for help unless I need to run to the restroom or if i go to lunch and I'm pretty upset about this.

My friend's text messaged (my friend isolated herself in her room, just in case) her roommate telling her that it's incredibly risky for my friend because of the factors and that isolation is really necessary. Her text was not responded to and there was no modification in behavior.

I'm at a loss at what she can do. I don't think it's legal to kick your roommate's guests out (in the US), nor is her selfish roommate is going to change her behavior, and I don't believe my friend has any place she can go to.

Until this Sunday when I saw she had silently removed me off of everything. I asked her why, though I'm sure I have a general understanding. She refuses to tell me, stating there's just been too much drama, and this is her solution. Though she won't inform me what the drama is.

I don't particularly care about her, as she's never been supportive of my boyfriend's and my relationship, but I'm curious as to what she believes the drama to be. I feel as though she should tell me as it involves me directly.

Need advice on whether to pursue talking to her further to get the information I want. Or leave it.

Also need advice on whether I should tell my boyfriend that her and I are no longer friends, and show the messages between her and I, or not. I'd also only be telling him if he asked. 

Added info: My boyfriend and I tell each other almost everything. Especially the things said about eachother behind the other's back, we do this to avoid unnecessary drama between us.

I meet my current boyfriend awhile ago on an App called whisper. If you do not know what whisper is it is just like instagram but everyone is anon. Kind of like reddit, but with text posts. We met two years ago, and started out as friends -- just when my life begun to crash and burn. 

I was 14 when my dad raped me the first time. (yes I have gone to authorities many times and they have done nothing, because my dad is high up in the church and sticking him with a charge like that would do more harm than good.) My mom begun to call me a liar. I got shipped off to a residential treatment facility, where life was rough. (I went cause my mom said I was 'lying'.) Since I got out my mom and dad have both been pretty abusive both in their own ways. 

Flash forward to this year :) Im 17... and my best friend is 22. He asks me out. (In Utah its completely legal y'all calm down.) He knew bits and pieces of my abuse but when he heard of the full extent of it we came up with a plan. In 12 months (if we are still together, which it looks like we are as we both agree we just want to settle and find our person, which again we agree is each other) -- seeing as that we are still together, right after my graduation ceremony, we are going to pack up his truck and drive down to his property in FL, (he has 4 properties, one in UT one in FL, one in NY, one in SC. I know you guys are all going to say that this is fake but again, I have known him for 2 years, we have faceted at ll of these places and he has shown me his tax returns, and property tax etc etc.)

I started to repeat in my head why I felt awful this started as smaller things like my friends but as it went on it changed to questions about myself such as ‚ÄúAm I ok? And if not how do I explain?‚Äù This question formed out of my frustration with myself for thinking these thoughts in the first place and that cycle continued.
In the end I had to many thoughts frantically bouncing around in my head so I put them in a notes page on my phone and afterward I lay there still covered in tears. 
Eventually I had to put this to the back my head when I heard my mum returning from work.

All of these thoughts sat on my phone and in my head for another two days.

By Friday it‚Äôs driving me insane.
I hardly got through school. When the day ended, I left and my plan was to straight home and just try to decompress. However I bumped into my two closest friends and they were headed to Costa (a coffee chain, I don‚Äôt know if it even exists in the US) and I reluctantly agreed to tag along I hopes that hanging with them might boost my mood. We started to walk and then found out that a load more people were coming which destroyed my hopes of venting to them about it but I was too far in at that point and felt like if I backed out that my friends would think I was acting strange.

We sat down at a large table and everyone started talking. Apart from me.
I felt so out of place and unwanted that I couldn‚Äôt pluck up the courage to talk to anyone.
I put my drink down and walked to the toilet and locked myself inside contemplating if I should tell my friends
I felt so shit.
I stayed there for a while and eventually I returned to my table but I opened my bag and put on headphones to listen a playlist 
This sit down, go to toilet, come back process repeated three times with each visit getting longer and worsening 
In desperation I text one of my friends at the table (I‚Äôll call her Jane) As I sit back down at another table with different friends

These are the messages

Me: I want to leave but at the same time I‚Äôm frozen to the spot

All I can do I sit here with my stupid playlist bobbing my knee up and down whilst I contemplate everything

I dont know what to do or what to think there are too
Many thoughts bouncing around in my head

Sorry I know you don‚Äôt want this rn 

Jane: no it‚Äôs fine (me) don‚Äôt worry don‚Äôt be sorry


This conversation went on for ten minutes and it was just me explaining my thoughts with out any specifics because I‚Äôd didn‚Äôt know if wanted to tell them despite them being my closest friend.

During all of this I was bouncing my leg up and down which my other close friend (I‚Äôll call him James) knows I do when I‚Äôm nervous. He sees this and comes to sit next to me I wasn‚Äôt prepared to actually talk to him.

I snapped 

All of my worries came bursting out of my mouth so fast I couldn‚Äôt keep up with myself and broke down completely in front of everyone I know in a public coffee shop. I picked up my bag after that and said coldly ‚ÄúI need to leave right now‚Äù and after telling Jane where me and James where going the two of us left.

I told him every detail except a few about all those thoughts on that notes page and we discussed our experiences together. It felt amazing finally getting this out. 

I though by telling someone I‚Äôd would feel much better in the long term but it‚Äôs only been four days I feel like I‚Äôve hit square one and as a result of this I get angry 
With my self for even thinking about those thoughts and if anyone pisses me off in the slightest I completely snap and feel like utter shit for the rest of the day.

In short, I want to know what might I be experiencing and what I can do stop /control the issue

I‚Äôve completely lost motivation and I‚Äôm driving myself insane without an answer
Thank for your time",17Mar2020,1

1071,"So my boyfriend cheated on me, I NEVER looked through his phone because I trusted him and everyone would tell me ‚Äú oh you can do better than him‚Äù and this and that so I guess it made me confident he‚Äôd never cheat. Him on the other hand would always be insecure checking my phone, it annoyed me but I got over it.

The first time he cheated on me was in high school, he went to a party, was drunk and he touched another girls ass (only). It hurt me and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs cheating to other people but it was to me, I only didn‚Äôt break up with him cause it was his birthday the day he told me and I don‚Äôt know.

Fast forward to now, we‚Äôre both in our first year of college and we live together and like I said I never checked his phone. I was up like at 2am and I saw his phone and decided to look through his pictures ( he takes nice pictures) I see a guy I don‚Äôt know and thinking maybe it‚Äôs a funny video I click one it.

It‚Äôs a man masturbating. They were face timing each other, it was an extreme shock because I didn‚Äôt even know he was bisexual, I started crying and woke him up. he told me and he apologized and said he only did it that once and it was just some guy he found on a website and how he‚Äôll change because now he can trust me but I said I couldn‚Äôt do it and I was leaving him, I decided to stay until he got his paycheck and paid me back (2 days from now)

So I‚Äôve been changing my mind since then about staying with him and he is crying, crawling on his knees saying he‚Äôll change... but I don‚Äôt know if he will. I don‚Äôt know if I should leave him, I left my home to live with him, my mom doesn‚Äôt talk to me now and I‚Äôd have to move into my grandmas crowded house. I love him so much and I would do anything to make this work but then again, I‚Äôm too young to be this hurt (I‚Äôm 18). I don‚Äôt know what to do

EDIT: I don‚Äôt know if this makes it better or worse but the time that he cheated on me was when I was going through a very difficult time in my life ( lost a baby) and it made me angry that he was thinking about himself than about how I was hurting.",17Mar2020,0

1073,From a young age I always identified as a lesbian. Until one day I began to question my sexuality again and I began to identify as pansexual. I dated a guy but the relationship didn't last more than 3 months and a few days. I started to question my sexuality again and I realized that I am in fact a lesbian and I always have been. Is it normal to identify as something other than your real sexuality and (in my case) date men before figuring your true sexuality?,17Mar2020,1
1074,"Ok so for background: I currently work two jobs-- one is as an intern at a company I really like which will potentially be ending in May, and the other is at a sbux in a grocery store which I work at on the weekends. I do like my sbux job, but only because I find it fun being a barista and I like a lot of my coworkers-- however, the store definitely doesn't treat us well. I have worked plenty of food service jobs before and this one is definitely on the lower end regarding how we are treated, given that it is a VERY busy location and we have little to no support-- we are the lowest level employees but we basically run the place. Given the current COVID-19 situation, I have been working from home for my internship, but sbux is still up and running with no end in sight. The store is always packed with people despite so many others practicing social distancing, and oftentimes I am the only one working a crazy busy shift. I have a tendency to be a bit of a germaphobe on most days - but now, due to the COVID-19 spread, I am actually scared. 

My next shift is this friday, and I have been crying at the idea of coming in. I am very lucky  that I really don't need this job - I graduated from college last year and have been living at home trying to save up money, so if I quit this job, it wouldn't impact me much. However, my internship is likely ending in May, and I was planning to continue working at sbux until I found a full-time job or started up school again, so if I quit, I'd need to find a new way to make money after my internship ends (I don't anticipate that finding another food service job will be hard, but it'd still suck to have to apply to a bunch of places). I also don't want to screw over my coworkers by quitting, but I am dreading going in. Other people have quit recently for reasons unrelated to COVID-19, and it puts extra pressure on the current workers. I am a very hard worker and am really good at my sbux job, so if I quit, they definitely wouldn't see it coming. I've also never really quit any job before, and I don't even know how I'd go about doing it.

Tldr: I want to quit a job I don't really need because I'm very scared of catching/spreading COVID-19, and it looks like nothing is going to change in the way of closing down, but I don't want to quit because I don't want to screw over my coworkers and be jobless come May (even though I will ultimately be fine if I am).",17Mar2020,1
1075,"So my bf and I were talking on the phone and playing tichu on the computer. He said that once we were done he would go play sth with his friend. My computer kept lagging so i closed it and he asked me if i was okay with him going in like 20 minutes. I was like well i dont want u to hang up but i do want u to do what u like. Then this turned into a huge deal about if im really fine with it, which i kept saying i was. After a while he said he didnt feel like going anymore and obviously i felt bad so I told him he should go anyway, cause I knew he was just frustrated with me. Fast forward like 40 minutes and his friend is still not done and he says he doesnt wanna play any more and just wants to sleep. He senses that i feel bad and tells me that if i wanna annoy him and then act hurt he doesnt know what to say. When i told him i want him to go one last time he told me to take my mood swings to someone else.

Was i really wrong for telling him part of me doesnt want him to go? I dont even understand what i did wrong in the situation and I really dont want to be the reason he's not doing what he wants. Im very sensitive when it comes to things like this so him acting this way hurt me a lot",17Mar2020,2
1076,"I'm 20 and I currently work at a hospital and I have to be the front line when people come into the emergency department. I have to ask them if they are having symptoms of coronavirus. I am the first person they see. 


I'm young and would probably be ok if I caught the coronavirus, but my parents are over 60 and my father has health conditions and would probably need to be hospitalized. There is a confirmed case in our town and a ton in the nearby counties. I still live with them too. I am currently per diem and my coworkers suck. I only have 9 days to work next month. I like the work that I'm doing, but hate my coworkers and it is a very hostile work environment. The hospital provides a surgical mask and sanitizer, I don't feel like I'm protected. 


I've been looking to leave and looking for a full time job. I got a part time job at a grocery store as a cashier on the side. I am still training for it, but I feel like I'll enjoy the job too. I feel like I might be able to advance further in the store. There is a possibility that the store would be willing to put me in the pharmacy so I can learn to be a pharmacy technician, which I really want to do. 


The store pays 11.80 (NY minimum wage) and the hospital pays 15. Less money means less taxes, but also less money for me. I've been trying to save up money to move out, but it seems impossible. I was thinking it would be possible to have two part time jobs, but I don't know if I want to make a career out of retail. I could always go to college, but I would have to go local and there isn't really anything I'm interested in. 


My original plan was to work at the store and emergency department at the same time and go with whichever gave me full time first, but the fact that there is a confirmed case so close to me, I'm thinking it would be best to leave. 


I feel like leaving the hospital job would be the best thing to do, but I just don't know. I can still catch the coronavirus from the store, but at least I wouldn't be like sitting at the desk at the emergency department. I feel like if I leave the hospital then nothing else will come along. I'm just not sure.

1080,"In mid 2015, I went on fluoxetine and Lamotrigine for unbearable anxiety due to adjusting to college. It helped, but I gained weight, my sex drive vanished, and I started to feel emotionally numb in the head.

I stayed on the medication for about four years and six months and the last five months consisted of a tapering process initiated from my physician assistant. I ended my final med fluoxetine in February of 2020 and it has been six weeks since I stopped and I have yet to see improvements from the anhedonia and sexual side effects.

My therapist (talk therapy) told me that this is temporary and things will eventually get better. But my primary care physician said that ""no medical professional should give promises or guarantees in patient outcomes"" and that ""you *should* go back to the way you were before treatment once you are off the medications for a few months"".

I feel conflicted since my therapist says one thing and the PCP says another. I am hoping I can get insight on this. Also, should I be worried about my sex life being ruined ""for good"" as in indefinitely? I saw some weird people claiming that the sexual side effects of SSRI antidepressants can be lifelong even after stopping the medication, and that most doctors are ignorant of this.
