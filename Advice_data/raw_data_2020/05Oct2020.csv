0,"Hey, basically I am a backup date for a formal (prom) which is also my ex’s formal but also my best mate’s formal. Basically it’s the alevel formal and i have a best mate and an ex in the same year. The ex is threatening to kill himself if I go. He is saying I’m heartless if I go and that i’m disrespectful and that he will kill himself if I attend. I can see in a sense where he is coming from although in my defence, ive known my best mate slightly longer and the ex was extremely toxic towards me for months in the relationship and this is in no way a way to get back at my ex or make him jealous. Basically my best mate wanted to take his ex as a way of getting her back as a plan but I was the backup date incase she couldn’t go or said no. She said she couldn’t so now i have to step up and see if i go or not but the ex has really got in the way. I am not wanting to go to the formal to make the ex jealous (formals cost a massive amount of money for girls here bc the dresses cost up to a thousand etc) and I am not paying that huge amount of money to make my ex jealous. I am simply wanting to go as first off I am the only back up date atm and as well as that it’s my best mate and it would be great craic. Although I do not know whether to still go to the formal or not bc of this mess. I feel like i am screwing my mate over bc i will basically be lying to him that I can’t go if i can’t go to formal over the whole mess although I do not want my ex to kill himself bc I attended a formal. I also cannot speak to my best mate about the situation as the relationship was a secret. So am i disrespectful for even thinking of attending or is my ex just in the wrong here and should i attend or not?",05Oct2020,1
1,"Today, I turned 13, and I have thought this for a while but Ive been thinking a lot lately about this. I feel like if I try my best in school, Ill just get stressed out, never have time with friends and none of it will pay off anyways. I feel like if I dont try in school I wont have good enough grades to get into college and just work at McDonalds or something like that. If I drop out it would be like the last one but worse. I also feel like I cant balance out having fun and spending time with friends and focusing on school, so I just dont know what I should do.",05Oct2020,1
3,"So I’m just 15 so i know I got my life ahead of me and chances are that any girl I end up with while not be with me when I’m older but let’s set the scene I liked this girl (let’s call her girl1) since may (I know not long but still to me it feels long) and as I started to stop liking her after she repeatedly through away my approached I found out she liked me. We started talking and it all started going well until a new girl (let’s call her girl2) that I used to like for like a year but never liked me back says she likes me, so now I like 2 girls and I have to choose one. Girl 1 is nicer friendlier more chill in bed watching Netflix type girl and the prettiest girl you’ll ever meet but it’s predictable and more boring, girl2 is pretty but nothing like girl1 but more fun and sporadic and I never really know what’s going to happen. And now in comes girl3 who is my best friend and I’m v v close with her and we’ve been ft as friends but I see her as more than that now but she likes someone else. How can I just choose 1 of them and completely block the my feelings for the other 2?",05Oct2020,1
4,"Basically, me and this girl have known each other since pre school. We’re both 20 now, and we still stay in touch. A lot of parents, friends, and shared acquaintances say that we were always meant to be together. Even people that just met us both. What do I do?",05Oct2020,1
5,"Whenever we buy something from a store we put it into isolation for a few days. You know why. 

A few days ago I bought a couple of protein cookies that I placed into isolation. Yesterday, I saw that my mother had placed the cookies on the stairs next to other products that she was going to take into the bathroom such as soap. 

I didn't like the fact that she placed the cookies on the stairs. I have anxiety and OCD. I kept on thinking that the cookies will kill or seriously hurt me if I eat them because she's put them on the stairs and people walk up and down those stairs and so anything on those stairs would be covered in germs. 

I told her about this and she took the cookies and washed them with soap. Obviously, it wasn't the actual cookies themselves. The cookies have a plastic packaging on then just like any other bar of chocolate which was what was actually cleaned. 

After a while I checked the packaging and some of it was covered in soap. I then thought I would be eating soap because there could be small opening in the package. I do have OCD and so that was another intrusive thought. 

I lost it and then I stormed upstairs. My mother started shooting at me and then I said ""You only care if it's your stuff"". 

Honestly, this is true. She will always take good care of her stuff, but anybody else's stuff she would mess up. She knocks over and drops electronics; she had damaged chargers and so on. 

Eventually, she started screaming at me and I went into my room. She basically said that I'm crazy and that my brain is messed up and all sorts of stuff like that. She even started throwing the cookies against the walls and floor.

I paid for the cookies, not her. 

She knows I've got mental health issues and that I'm in therapy. She knows exactly what affects me and how bad it can get. 

Today, I could tell that she was sorry because of her behaviour, but hasn't actually apologized. I haven't been speaking to her at all, except the bare minimum. 

**Am I being harsh**? **Should I speak to her**?",05Oct2020,1
6,"I'm currently in my second year of community college trying to get accepted into a program my parents are forcing onto me and I just can't take it anymore. I'm so friggin exhausted. I'm sick of the long lectures, I'm sick of the countless papers, and I'm sick of everything about it at this point. I've told my parents that I don't want to pursue something that I have no interest in doing but they won't listen. My parents tell me you aren't supposed to be interested in a job. You're supposed to do it and not complain. I just want to work with computers but they keep bringing up my math skills telling me I won't be any good at it. They are so adamant about me going into this radiology program. 

I understand that I could just switch my major without telling my parents but I hate to go behind their backs like that and I can't stomach another 2 years of this mind numbing crap. I don't think college is for me anymore. I can't see myself getting a college education and I don't see myself working any kind of job. With that being said, I have been looking into a career in the military, specifically the airforce. It has many benefits and it really seems like it would shape me up. But I feel like I'll regret it as soon as I sign those enlistment papers. Maybe it's because I feel like I'll fail in it or something but it honestly feels like my last resort right now...

I don't know really who to talk to about this with. My only friend thinks I shouldn't to do it but he hasn't really given me a reason why I shouldn't.  Can't really talk to my parents about it since they would flip. However, my sister, who is enlisting into the marines, said I should go for it. I don't really trust recruiters since I am there golden egg...

To summarize this entire post, I'm lost, I'm tired, and I feel like I'm running outta time. Can someone offer me some advice about a career in the military?",05Oct2020,1
7,"I grew up in a family that considered spending any money the same as sin, a moral flaw.

We had money when I was younger but the recession along with other stuff that happened in the family changed that. For years my family near starved at the end of every month, I've been homeless, all kinds of shit. My dad used to look for any hint of 'buying something'. A pack of oreos my friend gave me at lunch was bad because he assumed I bought it 'overpriced out of a vending machine'. He'd see a little plastic tag and go through my clothes and yell at me because 'I have enough and don't deserve any more'. 

The tag could be a month old, but he was insane.

It's left me absolutely petrified over spending money. Until 2016, I couldn't even buy food for myself. I'd buy 'what I needed'. And underate for years because of it

I'm a twenty fucking four year old woman, and I zapped my 7 year old, $1700 laptop's motherboard while trying to clean it. It was time for the thing to die. It was given to me as a gift at 17, and I just kept it to avoid buying anything that high value.

In the past months, I've driven myself crazy trying to replace it. I have the money, I'm relatively stable, but I can't just buy a new one for myself. I just can't. I found out I'm a compulsive returner too. I've bought two laptops already, and I can't sleep at night having them in my house, it's like an itch. I create something wrong with it in my mind- the real reason is always ""I don't  deserve it"" Before I know it I get in the car the next morning and drive it back to Best Buy for a return.

Fucking Help. I need this thing for a pretty big percentage of my work, but I'm terrified of just buying it. Just paying that much for it scares me. I think about it and damn near panic. I'm even more terrified of ordering it off Amazon for some reason. The waiting scares me.",05Oct2020,1
8,"I am a nurse at a very busy hospice. I was with 3 nurses. Nurse 1 said I look young with my hair like that. I said thank you! Then nurse 2 said “yeah but she has bags under her eyes “ the other 2 nurses were dead silent. I just said “yeah these are my designer bags” and laughed and made a joke but I was very hurt. Also the same nurse today refused to co sign my “didn’t take a full lunch today” form because she said I didn’t take a lunch yesterday, and that me chatting with my patient for 20 min counts as a lunch. She then later apologized for it and signed the paper. She does this to me a lot. Just random hurtful things. She always makes sure that I’m aware that I’m “crazy” and she knows my mother is a homeless schizophrenic so being called crazy kinda hurts me too. Am I just sensitive?

12,"ok so starting in like 6th grade I was pretty depressed due to bullying and problems within my friend group. my relationship with my dad kind of plummeted during that. nobody seemed to understand me during that time, especially my parents, and between them, my dad didn't ever seem to understand me. I felt and still feel like my dad could do whatever to me and he could still play the victim and i would get yelled at. My mom always says ""idk i wasn't in the room"" but if thats the card she plays why doesnt my dad get treated the same as i do? Here are some of the reasons why i can't stand being around my dad sometimes. For one, when i was younger he called me an asshole. I was 7 or 8. At the beach last year, he kept looking at waitresses and sometimes i catch him lookin at girls on his phone. He is homophobic, a nic addict, and an alcoholic, which is sO aMazIng for me since I'm apart of the lgbt community. He pushes his beliefs on me religiously and I hate it. He also uses words like 'this generation ... (insert sumn negative)"" . things like that. also, the other night, i put on black lipstick and he came in the room without knocking and i said omg wtf because i was so scared. He saw my lipstick and purposefully made a disgusted face and said ""just lipstick RIGHT?' and i said yeah. He goes down to my mom like a pissbaby and tells her that i cussed him out, leaving out the entire thing about how he hurt my feelings. I never got a sorry for that. or anything else. why would i? my opinion doesnt matter since im a child lmao.",05Oct2020,1

In order to do that, he needs to save money and so far im saving money to pay for school and for our own place. But everytime he gets money into his savings it vanishes within the week. I feel that he is a reckless spender but I don't want to hurt his feelings. He also has a habit of taking things too seriously when I tell him something. So how can I go about explaining to him that he needs to take saving money as seriously as he takes my confrontations?",05Oct2020,1
16,"I (16f, 16 at the time) am on a sport team at my school. Last year, at a competition, one of the co-captains (18nb,17 at the time) slapped my butt when they walked up behind me. I immediately felt terrible and for some reason I sat on the ground and started crying while all of my teammates were standing around talking and laughing (not at me). I did a pretty good job of hiding it, but I think they noticed. It was humiliating but I just ignored it and went on about my day. 

Also, I think it is worth mentioning that me and the co-captain aren't really friends, more like acquaintances, and definitely not that comfortable with each other. 

Now, I've realized that it might be considered sexual assault. 

Sometime after that, but still during last years season, they brushed up against my butt by accident. They apologized and I just said it was fine but they said that it wasn't and that they shouldn't have done that. I'm very conflicted about this because they seemed apologetic and I think they know they made a mistake, especially since they have mentioned being a victim of sexual assault before, but whenever I think about it I get uncomfortable.

 The thing is, it is our senior year and I feel like it would be so petty/malicious of me to report them to our coach, especially since it was just a singular butt slap. My school is also on the liberal side and they would take this seriously. 

But I also just want some sort of acknowledgement. To be honest, it bothered me when I would see them hang out with the rest of our teammates while I felt left out since I haven't gotten over what happened.

TLDR; My team co-captain slapped my butt nearly a year ago and I haven't gotten over it.

19,"(summary at the end) 

Two months ago my bestfriend, let's call her x, invited me to her sisters engagement party.

10 days before the party my friend texted me a sorry and that they had to uninvite some people and those included me, due to ""the corona second wave"".

I acted normal and I was fine really might not even go so i wouldnt get sick, and we texted normally.

She happened to miss telling me when the party was postponed to. I was okay with it but it was strange as we texted everydsy leading up to the event. Then while telling me, she on a voice note told me that her ""friend"" fixed her make up.

A photo pops up on my social media. Her. With some other best friends who were more recently close to her. Then the one that TRIGGGERED me. TRIGGERED. Her EX-best friend (lets call her y), who ended their friendship by telling x that x was too touchy and she must be a lesbian, and she feels so betrayed since they had so many sleepover's at x. 

I am FRUSTRATED. x has spent hours over 2 years crying on my shoulders because of y. Then pushed to be my friend at the time and I kind of felt X was trying to make Y jealous of me. Soon enough Y was texting x, commenting on every post, they were in common circles so they apparently are now best friends. 

The jealous part might sound made up but I do look a hell lot like Y (as in my face and body).

Now I dont know what to do. I feel so frustrated but it would be so pathetic to go tell her why she invited her and not me, especially that I was invited in the first place. It might seem small but im broken and have no one and just broke up with the best person i ever known. What can I do? Revenge? Make other friends even tho I am horrible at it? Please help I feel so dumb for holding a grudge but I wouldnt if she would be upfront and apologize 

ps: she keeps asking me if im upset at her and shes acting dumb

summary: my best friend invites me to party, univites me due to corona, then I find she invited some friends and her horrible exbestfriend who she conplained to me about for years, now im angry and my supposed best friend is acting stupid and asking me if im upset at her for any reason. what should I do?",05Oct2020,1
20,"I (F18) met someone (M18) through an app last year. We talked for a while, and things got pretty intense within the first two weeks. He was very flirty, and I was really into it. He, at the time, had a girlfriend of almost two years. I was aware of this after one week of talking to him, right as things started to get somewhat sexual. He would send clothes teases and flirt a lot with me. I, in return, would flirt back and send some small teases too. (This all usually only happened after 10:00pm almost every night) One night, he sent me a nude. I saw it coming, and didn’t mind it because I enjoyed the flirting. He asked for one in return, to which I said no. I was uncomfortable with sending nudes because he lived in the same area, and we went to the same school.. I was scared he would possibly leak them if I sent any. I told a friend what he sent me, and she just so happened to be friends with his girlfriend. My friend told the girlfriend (which she was right to do. I didn’t really want anything to happen between him and I because he was in a relationship, and what we were doing was wrong) GF confronted him, and he blocked me. They broke up a month later. I saw him almost every day for the rest of the year, as we walked past each other several times in the halls at school. In october, after splitting from GF, he got a new GF. She added me on snap, and made me miserable. She knew that him and I knew each other, but I’m sure he didn’t tell her the whole truth. She would always make sure I knew that she was with him by sending me ‘streaks’ and random pictures of him daily. I knew what she was doing, and so did my friends. I later confronted her a few months later, and she then deleted me after ‘apologizing’. They recently broke up after almost a year together. It’s been over a year since everything has happened, but I’m starting to feel ‘hung up’ on him. I can’t seem to get him out of my head, and I kind of want to reach out to him. Most of it feels purely physical, he is pretty attractive, but part of me wants a relationship with him. I don’t know what to do. I know he’s no good for me, but a small part of me wants to be with him. Any advice? I haven’t been in touch with him since last year, and I haven’t seen him since Covid-19 shut everything down, but since we live close, I feel a small ‘yearning’, if you will, to reach out and try to make something happen between us. What should I do? What do you guys think?",05Oct2020,1

22,"I’m just looking for advice, not hate. I found out I was pregnant right at the start of the whole COVID thing, and I vaped. I talked to my doctor about it and she said there really isn’t much research done, to try and cut back but it’s really not worth stressing myself and the baby out. I’ve tried to quit a few times cold turkey which resulted in very bad mood swings and anxiety, and I’ve gone to hitting it only a few times a day. I’m 37 weeks now btw and baby girl is perfectly healthy. My fiancé isn’t a fan of my vaping but he allows it. He also vapes and smokes weed. 
What I am upset about is he acts like he’s all high and mighty. And it’s very frustrating. It’s like he’s my handler, telling me yes or no when I can hit the vape. 
I’ve mentioned before that it’s not fair for him to be so judgmental of my vaping when he smokes two different types of products around me (not literally next to me but you get it) and if he truly wanted me to quit he would quit with me so then I would have no access to vaping at all. He makes excuses up like “well I never hit it in your face unless I’m about to give it to you so that logic is flawed”. Am I being selfish for wanting him to quit if he wants me to quit completely as well?

23,"Hi I \[18\] think I've been depressed for most of my life. I've been bullied, abused, and neglected for most of my childhood. My parents were too busy working to pay any attention to me, when I got bullied in school teachers called home and I got beat because of it, and I was compared and expected to study like my relatives to earn scholarships for college.

Now that I'm in community college nothing was as challenging as high school but without the expectations, I don't know what to do with my life. I've got no self-motivation, confidence, or identity. Furthermore now that quarantine has given me more time by myself I've realized that I'm not ok with the frequency of my suicidal thoughts.

I'm just stuck in a rut, I'm no longer doing or exploring hobbies that I found fun like drawing or gaming, just cycling through reddit waiting for something new to pop up, and repeating the same boring cycle.

They are frequently let out off leash but we own a large piece of property in Alaska. (8+acres, and another 18+ behind us). We have neighbors that aren’t that far away but far away enough that our dogs stay on our property.  In general, they know their boundaries and they respect them.

Today, I let the dogs out to play while I did some chores. Awhile later my neighbor shows up — very angry. My dogs apparently took off and went over to his property. He and his kids left their pet rabbit outside to graze and my dogs killed it. In Alaska, people often shoot dogs for things like this and my neighbor made clear if it happened again that would be my dogs’ fate.

Later I walked to his property after we both had time to digest what happened and apologized again. He had a cooler head and apologized for what he said. I feel like I left on better terms that but I still feel awful about what my pets did to his pet.

I  will keep my dogs fenced in (though I worry because they are escape artists) better —- but I’m wondering what else I can do as a gesture of good will? Should I write a note? Bake cookies?

29,"Alright so this one requires some backstory. I’m (21 F) currently living with my mother (56 F) because I attend college full time. I’m currently taking Honors classes to get the Honor’s degree added to my Computer science Game Design Degree. I want a total of three degrees, that one above which is an Associates, a Bachelors in Creative Writing (a minor in art), and a Degree (probably a Masters) in Machine Learning.

I’m WELL aware of the costs, and I’m not afraid of debt. Also that’s not what’s being called into question here.

But my mother and I have never got along. She’s extremely ‘all about her’ and sees kids as property to do whatever she wants. on top of classes from Monday through Friday, I work at my job both Saturday and Sunday. But since most of my classes are online, she sees it as “you’re home more so you can do everything”. So now I clean, wash, and do EVERYTHING around the house, including taking care of our six animals. An important thing is I only got TWO of these since she’s been known to get animals just so I get attached and then get rid of them while I’m away (like at school or work).

We have three dogs, and three cats. It began that I would take care of the cats and the dogs since I only bought 2 cats. The dogs were all her. But now I clean, take care of, feed, bathe, and am the ONLY one who buys food, litter, and toys for them. When I’m already only getting about 150 bucks every two weeks. She monitors my bank account like a hawk, and takes tabs of every little thing she gets me. She says I owe her money every time I need help buying groceries and adds it to me ‘tab’.

It doesn’t help that she seems to genuinely hate me. 

Also I don’t drive because she refuses to teach me, I don’t make enough money for lessons, my sister is like my mother and won’t help. And my father is supper manipulative and would use it against me. B I’m fine, the only issue is that it takes almost two hours to get to my college on Tuesdays by bus for my two in person classes, when she’s off but just refuses to help. So I do four hours total of transit on tuesdays and then she complains I was gone too long.

But anyways, I want to move to Japan. I want to study there possibly too, but I’m worried about the pets.

That, and I’m the only person that could take care of my old parents in a few years when they retire. 

What do I do? Do I just say fuck them and move with my pets (2 cats and I’d take the big border collie because I really love her). Or do I owe them for me to stick around and help?",05Oct2020,1

32,"So yea... a little more complicated than it may seem. I am at such a loss of what to do. I’ll begin by saying he was a data architect, top of his field less than a year ago. The dude is obsessed with his computer. Unfortunately the tumors grew fast, and he has lost a lot of functioning. 

We have so many bills to pay, and every time I turn around he is on some website buying thousands in bullshit. On the first he spent 3k on 3 Kennedy gold coins. He said he wants to buy a bunch more and make a treasure chest. The chest won’t even get that big at 1k per coin. Also what the hell are we going to do with all these coins when our electricity goes out.

I feel cruel taking his computer away. I limited popups and screen time. I made it so the only immediate available websites are youtube, netflix, and slingtv. Though, whenever he sees an ad he is immediately drawn to it, clicks the link and spends any amount of money.

I hid his credit card, though I think he memorized the numbers. We could get a new card but EVERY bill is attached to it, and I don’t know the password or how to change payment info/exactly what or how many bills are attached to the card. 

Also! He invested his retirement and he keeps eyeing that... and one risky move could lose his life savings. 

I’m so torn between just letting him piss all of his money away (the dude worked HIS life for it, why not let him have some fun), or making him preserve it. The father I knew a year ago would never waste his money, and part of me hopes he’ll come back to me and get to retire with it and buy his dream home.

I don’t want this money, but I don’t think this is what my dad would want. Before he got really sick he told me he really, really did not want to die, and I know he would never knowingly piss all of his money away on bullshit. 

I’m at such a moral crossroads. If I take his computer away he’ll feel like shit about himself, and have nothing to do. If I let him keep it as is, he may piss his retirement away and we could lose the house, and he MIGHT come back and be sad that he’s now poor, lol. I mean i’ll always have a room for him in my home when I get a job after school, but this situation is tricky for me.

I could try to childproof more, but his computer is so fucked because he downloaded so much bullshit that I think he’d just get around a lot of it. Although, i’ll keep trying.

Unsure what to do for this sick dude, my best friend turned coin collector.",05Oct2020,1

35,"Why do I seem to overreact about dumb shit when it concerns people who are close to me but I couldn’t care less when it’s everyone else?

I had a full on anxiety attack today over something that shouldn’t even matter to me. Without being specific, it’s one of those things that I wouldn’t do myself but I would never judge someone else for doing. Except for that the person doing it is close to me and when I found out I literally had an anxiety attack because I was so worried about them. 

Anyways I’ve always been like this and I don’t know what to do. I want to let everyone just live their own life but I always overreact and freak out about it. I don’t want to tell them that it gives me anxiety because I don’t want to be controlling by telling them to stop when it doesn’t even really involve me.

39,"Hi! This probably seems super petty, but I feel like I'm kind of losing my mind. I live in a small flat, maybe 10 units, and I live on the first floor (I think second floor for Americans - the one up the first flight of stairs). Was all fine for a while, because of the pandemic not many people still lived there (uni housing primarily) and overall it's a nice flat. However, my bedroom and the kitchen both overlook a small garden which belongs to the unit below ours. Initially, the students who lived there were loud, but they were only outside during the day, and it was summer so I had no issue. It was empty for a while, but then our new neighbours moved in.

With it being summer, I always have my window open. Houses here in the UK aren't designed with hot weather in mind, so during summer houses become ovens. The only way I was able to stay mildly cool was to have the window open all the time. Even now it's getting colder, I find by the evening my room is uncomfortably warm, so I crack the window. The issue arises because my neighbours seem to do nothing but sit in their garden and smoke. Usually they're quiet when they do it, but my room constantly stinks. The kitchen leads into the living room where I do my work, but I can close the door so it's usually no biggie during the day. But at night when I'm trying to sleep, the smell is so overwhelming. I have pretty bad, frequent migraines (at least 2-3 a week, which leave me unable to see, vomiting, etc) and strong scents are a big trigger for them.

I would go and politely ask them not to do it, but I've already had to ask them to quieten down once (party going on til 3am on a Thursday, with people who were smoking outside yelling inside to chat with the people inside over music) and they didn't take it very well. And I also totally understand that it's their garden, they can do what they like in it, so I don't want to be ""that neighbour"". Another solution is closing my windows, but my room gets overwhelmingly hot, and I just can't sleep. I do have a fan, but there's only so much it can do in a small room, and an AC unit isn't something I have the money or space for. I do burn scented candles or a wax melt while I'm awake, but that isn't overly safe while I sleep, and that smell gets overwhelming too. There's a communal garden at the front of the building which is much further away from any windows where people often smoke (cigarettes and other more... pungent things) and I've never smelled anything there, but again I don't think they would take kindly to me asking them to not use the garden they're paying for.

So I was wondering if there was anything else I could do to try and negate the smell? I'm here til next June, since I'm here for university, but with COVID I'm working and learning from home. My bedroom is my space to relax and sleep, but it's becoming really difficult when the constant smell is giving me headaches, and I've taken to sometimes sleeping in the living room on the sofa just to escape it.",05Oct2020,1

42,"some context: a friend of mine has been trying to get me to spend the night for the last couple of weeks, but i wasnt able to just cause i still had work to do for my online classes, ans he was understanding for the most part - school is really important to me. i was going to spend the night tonight but unexpected plans with family was brought up for tomorrow, and i genuinely felt it was better to spend the night tomorrow so i can take care of family matters first and foremost (its taking a pet to the veterinarian) and be able to hang out with my friend with no urgent issues pressing my attention.

i told him the situation and he said, ""You start making the plans to spend the night from now on. I'm done asking shits such a disaster but I know it's not your fault."" shortly after that, he backpedaled and changed ""disaster"" to ""disappoint"" in his next message.

he's justified to be frustrated, i havent been able to spend the night like he's wanted. i dont understand why reading what he sent upset me so much. i believe he's justified in letting me make the plans instead, and he tried recognizing it as not my fault. even after he changed the context in his next message, i was still upset.

i dont understand why his messages upset me because ive known him for a year now. the most hurtful thing he said in those messages was that, ""shits a disaster,"" and its not like he's wrong, but he even changed the phrasing, and he didnt blame me for it. am i too sensitive or unforgiving?",05Oct2020,1

My native name is not obvious to pronounce and the vowel actually does not exist in English so it's impossible for a native speaker of English to pronounce it correctly. It's been fifteen years (elementary through college) of explaining how to pronounce my name in the nicest sounding English way to everyone I meet, and I'm just tired of it now---the fact that people always hesitate before attempting my name seems like a small thing but it really does undermine my sense of public identity and even self, I think. 

I was baptized as a defenseless baby and received the 'Christian name' Leo. I don't really identify as a Christian but I'm thinking about going by Leo just because it's much much easier for everyone involved. The only thing is, I kind of feel like it's a pretentious name, so I'm just looking to gauge what other people think of it.

56,"Sorry for the long post, lol. I have a lot on my mind.

I just graduated in May with my Bachelor's in Legal Studies. My plan was always to go to law school, but while studying for the LSATs my junior year, I got really discouraged and gave up. I had a difficult time finding a job after graduation, probably partly due to covid, but now I work for a non-profit and I love it. 

I know that I want to go on to graduate school, both since I love to learn and to improve my job prospects. I'm really interested in trauma, domestic violence, and sexual assault. Because of these interests, I considered going into nursing, which requires little debt and pays really well. But I don't know how well I'd do since I come from a social science background. Plus the idea of starting all over (back at square one) is daunting.

 I've started the process of applying to law school, with intentions to take the LSAT for the first time in January (which is late in the application cycle and might make getting in even harder). I'm also considering getting my masters in social work instead, as social work was always my backup plan to law school.  

Working towards a MSW is much easier than law school, plus the programs I'm looking at do not require standardize testing. Social work doesn't pay well, but neither does the area of law I want to go into, so salary isn't really an issue here. 

I've just always flipped flopped between careers so I feel really disheartened and confused. I'd love to chat with someone to figure this out.

58," 

I am (F48) stay-at-home mom/substitute teacher. Long time reader, first post. (SSL)  
I just rec'd a NOV from a flight I took in 2017. We had moved that Spring, and I was coming back from emptying a storage unit and visiting a friend. I had with me my 10 yo son and my 18 yo daughter who has special needs. I only mention that my daughter has special needs b/c we ALWAYS get stopped and have to go through extra screening for all her equipment.  
Here is what happened: I had went through the storage units and made decisions on what I could bring. We travel SW, so they let you bring more than other carriers. As I was leaving the storage unit I noticed the backpack of our baseball gloves we had to taken to the parks, but we had used them last when we went camping. I grabbed this backpack, peeked to make sure it was the 'gloves' and it was, and threw it in the back with the rest of the stuff. As, my son was already signed up for baseball at our new place.

Now, fast forward to me, my son and my daughter in line at the TSA gate. Our bags are going through like always, and I get asked about the backpack by an officer. I say ""it has baseball gloves in it from camping last summer"". He opens the bag, and pulls out at least 6-8 baseball gloves.(which is all I know to be in this bag) he keeps going, and I am also looking over him a bit to see what in the world they could possibly have found... and at the bottom there is also....a pellet gun.

This pellet gun has been in there for so long, that one of my daughter hair bow has started to mold into that handle. I didn't know it was there. My son said, ""maybe dad put it there to scare away the bears"". I was so nervous, I was laughing...I didn't know what else to do expect to keep saying that we go camping...and my husband....and camping ...and bears....ugh...... The officer took the pellet gun and that was it. We almost missed our flight, but that's all.

So now I would like some advice, please!.... is the $250 fine after 30 days what i pay if i say I want a hearing. what all happens if I chose the $125 before 30 days ...BUT with that I give up a hearing and an Order Assessing Civil Penalty will be issued against me without further notice.....does this me jail time and I have no say? or what?

There is a option 5 to request a formal hearing. I say that! but is it just a farce to get the $250? ALSO, is there still criminal charges to come? Because it says ""Payment of civil does not affect any criminal charges against you.

IF anyone has had this or anything like this and would share their outcome or what they did I would greatly appreciate it!

\*The reason the backpack was carry on was because I had my daughter's special needs bike, which SW flies for free, like luggage. But also it's carryon size and the rest of my stuff to come back was in bigger boxes and containers.",05Oct2020,1

My roommate and I are both 22 F. We lived together last year. She has recently made a new friend, who has completely turned her into someone I don’t recognize. 
My boyfriend and I are in a 3 year relationship. She used to never mind how much he stayed over during the week. Just out of kindness, he paid our utility bill and paid an extra 200 towards rent. 
Now, my roommates friend makes comments, publicly when she comes over, saying “why are you here, you aren’t on the lease?” “You’re always here, that’s really annoying” and has asked my roommate “can I take off my tank top? I would normally just feel comfortable doing it but he’s here and that’s wierd”. 
I’ve told my roommate how rude it is, and how it makes him feel uncomfortable and unwelcome and she just takes her side every time. “It’s just a joke” and “maybe he should be on the lease”. (he’s only here 3-4 days a week). When I told her we could go ahead with that then, she said “well, I guess he doesn’t have to, it’s not like he’s here 24/7”, which sounds either like wierd backtracking, or like her friend is telling her this?

I was wearing a shirt with a rainbow on it. Lesbian isn’t an insult anyway. But idk the whole thing just stuck with me so badly and I keep replaying everything that happened; the arguments, how HE was in the wrong, how other people showed up and he told them me and the couple overreacted, how maybe I should have been calmer, how nothing can be done because it says you’re there at your own risk at the entrance, how I should have just left from the get go.

she just keeps getting worse and i’m scared she’s going to try to kill herself — again. it feels like it’s been a long time coming. like i’m on a freight train headed to the end and there’s nothing i can do to stop it no matter how hard i try. let me be clear that i am doing everything i possibly can to help her and i’m not looking for advice on how to help her through her depression.  

i want to know how to prepare myself for if she does commit suicide because at this point it’s beginning to feel inevitable. i feel like i’ve been pre-grieving for years now. 

she’s my best friend and i love her more than anyone else in the world. i can see myself marrying her. she’s my best friend and my rock and i don’t want anything else besides her and for her to be happy and okay.. but she might not be and no matter how much i fear it and cry about it and prepare for it i’m not ready. 

can anyone who has lost a loved one either to suicide or something else tell me how to prepare and what i should expect, or just tell me how to make this horrible waiting feeling easier? because it’s really really really hard and it’s feeling like it will never get better",05Oct2020,1

68,"So basically... there’s this guy that I met around two years ago.  He was the only person that was remotely kind to me at the time and we hit it off and became best friends.  However, he did make me uncomfortable a lot and thought it was cool and funny to talk about topics that I expressed made me uncomfortable.  He’s also the type of friend to send you a link to a video called “how to tie a noose” if you say you’re feeling suicidal— in other words, he takes life like it’s a joke.  

And in some ways, that’s refreshing and funny and it’s nice to have a friend that just doesn’t care sometimes.  But about a year ago, he asked me out.  I feel guilty about this, but I sort of dodged the question because I didn’t want him to feel bad but I didn’t reciprocate.  Anyway, another year passes of us barely speaking and we end up in the same virtual class together, so we reconnected a bit.

At first, everything was fine.  We texted every so often, joked with one another, all was well.  He’d actually found a girlfriend so I suppose he didn’t have the need to call me anymore, so he didn’t.  And then he and his girlfriend mutually parted ways, and here’s where the story starts to thicken a little.

Basically... he keeps calling me.  Every hour of the day, it feels like.  During classes, while I’m busy, while I’m grieving, while I’m telling him I don’t want to talk— he just tells me to please pick up.  I’ve ended up temporarily blocking him out of desperation sometimes.  I just get sick of talking with him and he makes me really uncomfortable.

For example— a few days ago, we were on FaceTime.  He knows I am a former self-harmer and I still have a lot of very visible scars from it.  So, being the amazing friend he is, grabs a knife, points his wrist at the camera and laughs as he slices at it.  I scream and beg him to stop, but he doesn’t, so I told him in a stern voice that it wasn’t funny and hung up on him.  I immediately broke down crying and had to talk to my other friends to stop myself from relapsing because I had wanted to really badly.

Yeah.  He’s a bit insensitive.

He can be really nice when he wants to be but honestly he doesn’t respect my boundaries and makes really sexual or suicidal jokes a lot even when I ask him not to.  And he calls me so much, it makes me feel rude not to pick up when he knows I’m free.  I just... I honestly don’t want to talk to him!

But he wont stop.  He demanded today that I skip class tomorrow to talk to him.  I said “okay, fine” after some protesting because I am a pushover, but I have no intentions of actually doing it.  I feel really bad about it but I don’t want to talk to him.  I have a feeling I’m gonna end up feeling bad and doing it anyway, though, so that’s why I’m posting here.  To hopefully somehow break this cycle, lol.

I know I should just say no, but he blows up my phone, one call after another after another, not even giving me time to get to the block button, until I pick up.  It makes me feel really guilty because he shows genuine sadness and remorse if I tell him I don’t want to talk to him.  My parents hate him and want me to block him, but I really don’t want to hurt his feelings, especially since he was my one and only friend two years ago. 

What do I do, Reddit?  I don’t want to hurt his feelings, seeing as I clearly mean a lot to him, but, like... he makes me really anxious and uncomfortable and if it wasn’t obvious already I have anxiety and I’m reaaaally not good at saying no, but this is really affecting my mental state.

Thanks!  Help would really be appreciated.

TDLR; guy I used to be close with who has feelings for me makes jokes about sensitive topics to me, is really annoying in general, doesn’t respect my boundaries or feelings and won’t stop blowing up my phone.  How do I get him to stop?",05Oct2020,1
69,"I’m a 19yo premed college student with no certifications (I live in TX for context). However I’m a quick learner, I know how to pitch credit cards, speak a second language, work well with groups, have good communication skills, am organized, and pretty good at customer service. I’m not knowledgeable about making spreadsheets and have never taken any sort of administration/ business courses, so unless they provide training, I don’t think office jobs are open to me. My experience includes babysitting and retail, but I’m looking for a job that pays more than $10 an hour. I tried Indeed and LinkedIn, but it seems like it’s aimed at graduates, professionals, and not possible without prior training, a degree, or some sort of certification.

72,"My mom has had a progressive cancer for which there is no cure (multiple myeloma) for four years. Last week, the doctors told us that her final type of chemo had stopped working, and we don't have any new ones to try anymore.

I love my mom so much, it's incredibly difficult. Harder still, my dad died a few years back when I was a teen (also from cancer) and I'm an only child, without other family. My mom is super worried about this, and completely devastated that she's leaving me alone. I think this aspect seems to bother her more than the fact that she herself is dying - she's always thinking about me, what she can do for me, how she can help me. Always has.

I had moved away and lived in a nearby city until she got sick and finished school. Then she got sick and I moved back in with her and have been helping care for her and keeping her company ever since. 

So since the stupid pandemic hit, we haven't been able to go out or do much - her immune system is too low and it'd be dangerous. I've been taking advantage of things I can order in for us to do together: snack boxes from different parts of the world we can try, monthly game boxes like murder mysteries we could do together, etc. I also really like to order her clothes and surprise her with them, because she never buys stuff for herself, and so I've been making sure she always has stuff she needs/likes/is comfortable in.

She's been in the hospital the last few days, but she's coming home in a few days. The doctors told us that if this one issue she has flares up, she could only have weeks. But that issue has actually been improving; the doctor said if it doesn't flare up, she could have months.

Being an Italian mother, she always reprimands me when I buy something for her (which I always shrug off). I was on the phone with her at the hospital and told her I bought her some new cute sweaters &amp; a coat for fall, and she started right away getting on me about spending money, but instead of the normal ""you gotta save!"" she's saying stuff like ""you know what the doctors said. Don't buy stuff for me, there's no point."" And ""It won't be fair to me if I never get to wear them.""

She's been doing this more and more with anything we talk about. I know it must be impossible to think any other way in her shoes, but I'm not going to just start treating her like she's already dead. They told us my dad had 2-3 months left to live, and he ended up living for 8 months. 

My whole thing is that nobody had a crystal ball, and so we shouldn't live our lives like they're already over or the worst has already happened. I know she needs to deal with her feelings in her own way, and I'm supportive of what she needs. I don't want to live in denial or anything, but I also don't want to waste the last time I'll ever have with my mother on this earth acting like she's already gone. I can't handle it. I tell her she can wear whatever she wants whenever she wants, that while I understand the situation we also can't know for sure what that means, and that above all, we need to try to live as normal as we can and enjoy each other as much as we can before she's gone.

Am I actually doing a bad thing by getting stuff like clothes for her that she will need in the fall? I'd feel infinitely worse though if she *does* manage to hang on longer than predicted, and she didn't have the warm clothes she needs for when we go to the hospital (we go twice a week) and such. 

I want to be sensitive of her feelings, wants and needs, but I also don't want to frame every single thing I/we do with the ""...if you're still alive"" caveat. I just can't. How do I handle this?",05Oct2020,1
73,"I've been friends with her for about a year now. I consider her to be a very close friend of mine, and to be somebody that I care for deeply. We hangout at her house almost every week and enjoy the time that we spend together. Board games, video games, movies, etc. There's nobody who I want to spend my time. Even if we're doing nothing. Just vibe and enjoy being around around each other. Recently, Sunday- September 27, 2020, I said something to her that has caused her to rethink our friendship. I didn't mean to say, what I said, in a rude manner, but I wasn't thinking about the consequence of the way I had said it.

On Sunday, she offered me apple pie and I declined, saying that she keep it for her family and herself to enjoy. I prefer for her and her family to enjoy the pie. To have the pie benefit her and make her happy. I want her to be happy. She then tells me that I should take the pie, insisting that she'd be tempted to eat the whole thing. With her focused on her diet, she doesn't want any taunting good looking pies swaying her. Knowing that she can be cutely stubborn about her offers and insisting that I should take it, I complied. She then follows up by telling me to remind her to give me the pie before I leave. We both tend to forget to retrieve the food and give for me to take, but either way I don't mind. I'm just left thinking about her and how much fun I've had with her.

I hate to feel the way I felt that day, but that day I wasn't myself. I felt helpless and hopeless. I felt numb. I was okay and felt okay, but I knew that it was the numbing sensation that has caused me to feel okay. I knew that she noticed something different in me, but I just thought I was acting normal in the moment. I just didn't realize it until I left home that day. She asked me how I felt, and I told her I felt okay. Because I did feel okay, I just felt neutral. It scared me a bit to feel the numbing sensation but having her next to me. Having her joke around. I came to my senses and I felt bad for feeling the way I felt, because she doesn't need me acting this way. I kept thinking about who I was to her. I just got insecure at the moment. Acting like a baby. Once I had to leave, we both got up. She went to the bathroom, while I sat there thinking. Then I recalled- The Pie!!! If I had known what would ensue, I would've kept my mouth shut and left that pie in a heart beat. Because she means more to me than the pie. Our friendship means more to me than that pie.

I forgot who took out the pie from the fridge, but she cutely took a piece for herself. I giggled to myself, within my head, because she was being cute. Then she gave me the pie within it's pie container. There isn't much space in my refrigerator and my idea of sizing an item to the littlest it can be, filled my mind. A tiny slice of pie in a big container. I thought it looked funny so I just spatted out, without thinking like the dumbass that I am- saying either ""This looks ridiculous! Can I get it in a Ziploc bag?"" or ""This is ridiculous! Can I get it in a Ziploc bag?"" I thought I was saying it in a funny, shock tone, but my friend told me I came off as rude/picky. She then tells me that ""she doesn't know how to respond to my comment."" I then realized that I had hurt her. I then tell her that ""I didn't mean it in that way."" Assuming that she thought I wasn't grateful for the apple pie but I was. She could give me a crumb of the pie and I'd be grateful. Grateful for anything she does for me. I'm grateful to have her in my life. She's my BFFL. She didn't say anything to me further. I left the house with the apple pie but I felt so disturbed to have it. That day is or will be the last time I will seen her.

I've apologized greatly and explained my point of view, but she's reanalyzing our friendship. I fear that she has distorted me into somebody that I'm not. She's not communicating as to what she's thinking about me. She says she's hurt to think about me, but I don't know what to do. I've apologized from the bottom of my heart and just trying to brighten up things. Asking her to further explain her emotions. To better understand her and find a solution. To talk to me, but she doesn't acknowledge anything. She doesn't respond to my questions. I don't know if she understands my point of view. I just want to help her with all my heart. I want to fix this with all my heart but I don't know how to. I'm left in the dark to assume what's going on, in her mind. Where we stand. I just wish that I could go back in time and not mention the pie. Not to think about the pie. Out of all times that I remember, I remembered that apple pie. I regret it so much.

I just want her back. I want to enjoy her presence once more. I just want things to go back to the way they were. I just want her to be happy and not let the thought of me bother her. Is it possible? Can I save my Friendship? What could I do to fix this problem?

I just. . . I don't know what to do

74,"So pretty much my best friend as been boy-crazy all her life. She has been convinced that finding a boyfriend will fix all her problems for this Disney Princess fantasy that she's always wanted. 

Now we are high school seniors. She got engaged last year, and plans on getting eloped before Prom. Her parents and her sister don't know, and she doesn't want to tell them until afterwards. I didn't even know about it until recently. I've tried to get her to change her mind considering she isn't mature enough (she can't drive, has never had a job before, and still acts like a kid). Not to mention she's only known the guy for three years, he's not a nice guy, they don't really have a plan for afterwords, and her ring was only $20 (it shouldn't be 1000s of dollars or anything, but that's still cheap).

75,"I am currently writing a literary work and I have recently received feedback that the use of the word ""choogled"" was not appropriate as a speech tag.

I frequently use it in situations such as ""he choogled softy"" or ""Kiss her lips and choogle sweet nothings in her ear"".

I understand that this word is not conventionally considered a normal replacement for a phrase such as ""he said"" but nonetheless the characters in my story *keep on chooglin""*

What does the word choogled conjure up in your mind, how would you imagine chooging would sound like in a verbal context.

Personally I think It sounds something like 'to speak in a whimsical and dismissive fashion' but other have said that it sounds like ""speaking with your mouth full while spraying food everywhere'

78,"I apologise because this post is going to be erratic. I have a lot of feelings and it's making it hard to organize my thoughts.

A week ago my friends found a pure bred dog that would cost at least $2,000 to buy from a breeder. The dog was beyond dirty, malnourished, dehydrated, ungroomed and unregistered. My friends placed ads in the newspaper, hung flyers in the neighborhood, and notified animal control, but omitted the breed because it will attract a lot of attention. They've received dozens of calls, but no one that has contacted them is looking for this dog.

I found out who the dog belongs to and I know if I tell my friends that they'll struggle with whether or not they should contact the owners, but given the dogs condition and that they're apparently not looking for it, I'm considering keeping the information to myself. There's only a small chance that they or someone who knows that they have the dog would find out what I have. They've fallen in love with it and would give it a wonderful home. After 30 days they can register as the owners of the dog and it would legally be theirs.

My head says give them the information and let them make the decision themselves, knowing everything I do (there are details that I am omitting to keep this post as anonymous as possible). My heart says keep it to myself and save them the trouble of making the decision themselves, the heartbreak of returning the dog or the guilt of keeping it. I need a outside parties perspective.

I know rigid flat feet is very hard to fix without surgery and some might say it is impossible. Yet this topic seems to be a topic that the medical field has overlooked or just plain and simply gotten wrong. I am no expert but there have been many testimonials of people fixing their flat feet, whether they were born with it or it was acquired. There are exercises to improve the strength in the arch and improve it over time. Also methods like barefoot running. The typical orthopedic response would be to give you some arch supports. This seems to be the typical response in this field, yet it is basically a crutch and will over time make you become dependent on it. Now I just did some mild research on this topic, but the overwhelming proof that flat feet can be improved cannot be ignored by me. I refuse to believe that flat feet cannot be improved.

85,"My question is exactly how it sounds like. Although I still consider myself an introvert majority of the time, I can tell 100% there was a big switch up in my personality (or rather multiple switches instead of 1) in which I started to open up more, talk more, have more friends, etc etc.

Problem is, and I’ve been struggling with this the past 1-2 years, is that at some point I went from not talking at all to never knowing how to literally stfu. And I’ve been called out on it so much recently that every time it happens I crawl back into my introvert shell and my self-esteem just lowers so much more. Especially in the past 2 years, I’ve been told multiple times by my best friends and family that I need to learn to stop talking sometimes, even though they were the ones who kept probing me to talk more for YEARS. I forced myself out of my shell for them and now they want to push me back....

This is fine considering it has its own perks anyways. Part of me learning to talk more was from being manipulated over and over to talk more and “gossip” so other people can benefit from me and use me. And of course, I hate that and hate how I let people walk all over me because of it. 

But now???? I’ve TRIED going back to the way I was. In this sense, quarantine came at the perfect time for me to work on myself in the regard. But now I’ve constantly been pinned the bad guy for never being online, never talking anymore, and even never telling anyone my secrets anymore. At some points I just stopped talking to my friends for a month and a half, not just because I was limiting my socializing but because I was genuinely trying to work on bettering my self-esteem and mental health by staying off social media because it’s toxic for me. You know, cause they say worry about yourself first before others?

But no. I’m not allowed to do that. I know my friends want to talk to me online during quarantine but I seriously wanna go back to when I used to never talk, used to never be on social media 24/7, and used to never tell people about my personal life just for them to shit on it and tell me to stfu.

How do I do this while not being made the bad guy cause ffs some people just refuse to let you grow and I can’t even just cut them out my life so what can I even do? How do I revert to not talking?????

TL;DR: How do I stfu and revert to my former introverted self without having people notice or shit on me for it?",05Oct2020,1
86," 

I am at my wits end and I can't take anymore. I'm a failure and not talented. Here is the list of my problems:

1. My dog is dying. He has incurable disease and he has probably only a few months to live.
2. My research isn't going well. I had a stump for quite a few months and my advisor has been hinting at me quitting. He has no faith in me. I feel hopeless and no matter how much I try I will just fail. He had ""the talk"" with me about how I need to get myself together and that we try different mentor strategies since what has been happening hasn't been working. I think he feels I won't finish. Though, the positive is that he says I have been doing much better.
3. I was trying to apply for a mentorship program and for a leadership position. I was in the program for a year and did a good job, enough of a good job that my student who I mentored is still good friends with me. I was rejected without being given a reason. I believe I made a coworker uncomfortable and I have tried apologizing to everyone involved. Doesn't matter, my coworkers think I'm some creep. One part that just hurts is that two people on the committee are friends I used to play DnD with. Basically, I lost my friends as well and I feel incredibly hurt. I tried to apologize, but I think it made the situation worse.
4. I was nominated to be on the Climate and Diversity Committee in my department. I'm very much into activism and lost the election and found out the situation with point #3 literally in the same week the election was occurring. I think my coworkers seriously dislike me and I feel ashamed to attend any future event.
5. I have a drug problem. I have been taking Kratom to self medicate my depression and feelings of self-loathing. I'm going to a councilor now, but I haven't mentioned this to anyone since I feel if I do I will be fired.

I'm at my wits end and I feel like a complete failure. Basically, everything happened that I described within a week. I can't take this and I had a breakdown. I embarrassed myself infront of the people who informed me I lost the election in point #4 by asking them not to nominate me in the future since my coworkers dislike me. I apologized immediately afterwards and mentioned that my life wasn't going well and I had a breakdown and that I didn't believe what I said. I was crying when I sent that initial email.

Over the years they have helped their own children get into homes etc.   


I was living with them but moved out this month,  long story short my wife cheated on me and i left her, was living with them for 5 months while i got work and got back on my feet, when my grand father found out what my rent was he did the math.    He said with his credit and his bank accounts that he can get the best rate on a starter home for me.

Something like this would be ideal really.  


Now I have hard time accepting this offer,  they would make 20% down payment putting my rent at  right around $300 a month on something in this price range, here in AR there is plenty in this range that are fairly decent.   Less than 100k at least.   


My family WILL have a shit fit i already know it,  they hate me they despise me and are jealous of all my grandparents have done for me over the years,  they are already siding with my ex in this whole break up and the only people to take my side were my grand parents.    


This would pour so much salt in the wounds of family members, other grand children etc, but this would also allow me to get ahead in a time where most people are falling behind.

I’m a guy (20M) and she’s around my age (21F). We both go to the same university. We’ve been good friends since freshman year, around the end of which I realized I had feelings for her. School ended and I had two major trips that I went on, with the idea I was going to tell her how I felt after that. Unfortunately, someone beat me to the punch and they started dating.

It was terrible. Being around her was so conflicting, because I did want to spend time with her, but knowing she was with another guy (and happy at the time) was painful. I tried my hardest to either bury how I really felt, or at least ignore it. It would work for a week or two, but inevitably she came back into my mind.

She dumped her boyfriend this summer (long story, not important), so she’s been single ever since then. I’ve been very seriously thinking about how I can tell her how I feel, but to be honest, I am terrified to do so. And recent developments have made me question if it would be a terrible idea or not.

Basically, last night I was out drinking with friends, and I said something to her that crossed the line of our friendship, in a way that probably made it obvious as to how I feel. She told me this morning it made her uncomfortable, and obviously I’m kicking myself because of this. If there’s one thing this situation says to me, it’s that she doesn’t think of me as any more of a friend. This is where I turn to you Reddit.

I’ve been thinking a lot today, and I’m not sure I can continue being her friend. It’s clear to me now that trying to repress my feelings is not a healthy option, for myself or her. I don’t want to become a source of toxicity in her life, and I think that me repressing my true feelings is becoming a source of toxicity for me.

I’m not asking if I should just cold-turkey cut her off, but what I am wondering is if I should tell her, in person, how I feel about her and that I cannot in a friendship with her any longer because I know she doesn’t feel the same about me. 

I’m not very good when it comes to my own relationships and I’m desperate for some outside perspectives to help me on this. Of course I don’t want to lose her, but if it’s the healthiest solution for both of us I would obviously do it. 

So what should I do?

TL/DR: I have feelings for my friend and want to know if I should end our friendship",05Oct2020,1
93,"I have recently had a bad break up as a result of anxiety and depression, really bad and hurtful. Aside from that i have always had a problem connecting with people because of anxiety and depression and i think it is because i have never been able to feel confident or good about myself. When i have to do a presentation in college and in highschool i would always be on the verge of a panick attack sweating bullets. I have always tried to put these emotions aside but considering all i have left are the good people of reddit im wondering if anyone can give me advice on where to start?

94,"Sorry this is a long one. Everyone in this story is in their mid 30's. And I think it's important that people know I was cheated on by my ex back in my early 20's and people knew and didn't tell me and that was a whole extra betrayal that hurt when I was already hurting. That makes me a pretty firm believer that I should tell a person - friends, stranger, whoever. However, everyone (\~5 people) who knows what's going on is saying I shouldn't tell for various reasons and it's making me second guess myself.

So I had a friend with benefits. We've been FWB for almost 2 years, but no feelings on either side. He is emotionally stunted and I think he's a dick because I know he cheated on his ex-wife for the entirety of their relationship. Sex is good tho, so why not. We both have sex with other people, no problems there, but we don't talk about it with each other much. I found out from mutual friends he was hanging out with his ex-wife again and assumed they were having sex, but whatever, not my problem if they want to be insane and reconcile (outside of me losing my FWB, which isn't the end of the world). Everyone in the group was told it was casual (except me because we don't discuss our other sex partners). However, I've just found out from someone outside of the group that she is pregnant and they're together. I know my time together with dude overlaps with her pregnancy because the only reason it ended is me finding out she is pregnant. Pregnancy seems to be semi-planned (no one knows how much they talked about it, but she chose to not use any form of birth control and he bought a new, significantly bigger place). I very much feel like she deserves to know he isn't being monogamous. I don't know her well, but I know she would not be happy about it. Everyone else in the group admits she wouldn't be ok with it, but they all say if she didn't discuss monogamy with dude, then that's her fault.

Reasons I've been told I shouldn't tell her (and my rebuttals after dashes):

1. She didn't make him define the relationship, so that's on her. -- Any info I've gotten on this has been second or third hand, so how can I really know what they discussed? I can't exactly trust the word of the guy who has no issue cheating on his wife with anyone who walks by.  And while I think it is a mistake to make such assumptions on monogamy, I do think when you're discussing moving in together and possibly discussing having a baby, I can understand why a person might make the assumption of monogamy because it is the norm in our society.
2. Everyone in the group will be pissed at me and that will cause problems for everyone. -- Fantastic reason to do or not do something. Who needs morals right?
3. It's not my relationship -- but it kind of is... or at the very least, I've been dragged into it.
4. She already knows, and is just in denial. -- As someone who's been cheated on, I can say there's a big difference between having worries/doubts and truly KNOWING. I needed to KNOW, for sure, without a doubt, so that I could know I wouldn't live my life wondering if I was wrong. I stayed way too long waiting for that to happen, but I was relieved when I got that info and I got the fuck out.
5. She will be pissed, but mostly at me, and she will not leave him. -- I actually do worry about this one, because I'll fuck up a lot of shit without anything changing, but doesn't she deserve to have all the info to make a decision?

There is one more thing that has seriously given me doubts. One person who is closer to her than most said they basically told her they didn't think this relationship was a good idea, and asked if she had any questions about any doubts she might have (giving her the chance to ask if dude wasn't being monogamous). She declined to ask any questions. I feel like this is second hand and also wasn't super straight forward, so I'm not sure it's enough to convince me not to tell her, but I do feel like it lends weight to #4 and #5 above.

Random thing I feel the need to clarify: even if they break-up, I'm out because I don't want to be in this position ever again. So I'm not hoping for a break up so I can get some dick. But she hasn't moved in yet, so I feel like if they do break up, the sooner the better for everyone involved. I do feel like this makes me more biased towards telling her. Everyone else is like ""It'll end eventually, just let it play out."" But if she moves in, it'll drag out so much longer. The pregnancy is already going to cause them to hang on longer (I would think).

Also, I know if I do this, people will be mad at me, but I think the only friend I will lose with be FWB, which is understandable. I'm not friends with the ex-wife, so I'll just be gaining a hater there. However, I know that FWB has been yearning to start a family in the last year, but gave up on dating. I do feel some serious distress at the idea of taking this dream from him. He could still get split custody, but I would be dashing the happy little family dream. Not that anyone thinks that's going to happen, except FWB, but he DOES and I will be crushing that dream. I don't want to hurt someone like that, but I also don't think the ex-wife deserves this treatment and lying and he's never going to stop cheating.

So should I tell her? And if I should, how? And if I shouldn't, how do you handle having a secret like this and not hating yourself? And how do you handle being around people when you have a secret that pertains to them?",05Oct2020,1
95,"I rent a room from my mom. She just had Knee replacement surgery on the 1st, and twice now my mom has said to me that I’m ignoring her. So far since the 1st, I’ve taken her to and from the surgery, waited In the hospital all day, got a hotel room to be near by for support, bought her goodies and flowers to have while in her hospital room, made certain she was comfortable, got the nurses attention for her when she had needs, once home, I picked up her dogs from the kennel, picked up her prescriptions, did her laundry, cleaned the cat boxes, doing the dishes, made her Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner, refilled her water bottle constantly, went and purchased her extra medical goods at her request, asked her regularly about her needs, helping her put on and take off her surgical stockings morning and night, change out her cold packs 4X daily, the list goes on and on. 
And twice while on the other side of the house where I can’t hear her; I come back to the other side of the house and she’s attacked me with “you’ve ignored me for three hours, while your downstairs, fucking around doing whatever you’re doing, while I’m up her suffering....you didn’t even check on me”. And that’s all I have been doing is attending to every possible need, except assisting with going to and from the bathroom, and changing clothes, showering etc.those things she does herself.
She’s gotten very aggressive these last few days and it’s not letting up and this is only part of her needs, I’ve committed to driving her to her Physical therapy for the next 12 weeks and taking her to do labs 2x/week for two weeks, all while working and taking time off work from my job just for her. And she talks to me like I’ve don’t nothing to help. 
I seriously just want to cry or just walk out on her.

96,"Heya! I’m F15 if that helps anything. 

I have a friend, (M15 Who we’ll call Jay) We’ve been close friends for a little over a year now and see each other somewhat regularly. Over the summer we started talking more and Jay really opened up to me emotionally. I also have depression and had spent the last few months working on making things better for myself so we shared our experiences and gave each other advice. 

Jay is a little relationship happy though. Since we first met he’s had crushes on so many girls and dated around 6 or 7 of them. All the relationships lasted less than a month and he never seemed to care that much as long as he had someone to talk to. 

Problem is, I became the someone to talk to. We talked every day, called each other, we were always in touch 24/7. If I looked at my phone, boom, another text. I was fine with this for the most part though because I don’t have many friends to talk to. 

A few days ago though he said he really liked me. He asked me to go out with him and was really sweet about it. We were up late on the phone and at the time I basically just said “yeah, sure. Why not?” I woke up the next morning and everything finally settled in my mind and I almost puked. I’ve never been in a relationship before and that was wayyyy too fast for my liking. 

That day I ran through everything in my head and basically realized I didn’t like him in a romantic sense, and needed to tell him that, the sooner the better. I called him that night and straightened everything out. Telling him I wasn't ready for a relationship with anyone at the moment and just wanted to be friends. 

He was again, very understanding and said that what mattered to him was that I was happy and he didn’t want to make me uncomfortable. 

We were talking again today, and he just wasn’t in the right place mentally. I asked him to truthfully tell me what was going on, and he said he was upset that I don’t like him like that. I told him that I would give him space if he needed it, but he said he preferred having me around. I asked if there was anything I could do to help, he said no. 

I don’t like seeing him upset and I know he’s hurting but I don’t know how to help. Advice?",05Oct2020,1
97,"So basically there’s this girl I (17m) met about a year ago and I think I like her. The only problem is that I live in Canada and she lives in America (about a 12-15 hour drive). 

For some back story, I met her summer about a year ago and when I saw her I guess you could say “it was love at first sight”. She spent a week here (we were leaders of a camp) and we spent about 5-8 hours each day together, we hit it off exceptionally well and she seemed interested in me and obviously I was interested in her. Being an oblivious teenage boy I didn’t really notice until one of my friends told me she wanted my Snapchat and that she liked me but I didn’t believe him and played it off saying there’s no way and he’s lying. He gave her my snap and turns out he wasn’t lying and she told me she thought I was quite cute and whatnot. Then on the last day she was here before she left she asked for a kiss so obviously I couldn’t miss out on this chance and I kissed her. She left back home and we kept talking over social media and then about 1-2 weeks later she told me she wished we lived closer to each other so that we could date. I kinda agreed with her but never really thought much into it because she lives so far away. My parents met her while she was in Canada and they said they thought she gave off obvious signs that I was oblivious to and that she liked me but I kinda brushed it off as well and denied it (my parents met on an online chat room, had a long distance relationship from Canada and England and have been married for 18 years so they thought a long distance would work). So she left and I started talking to another girl and it lasted for about 1 month and then I never really felt like I liked anyone for a few months, although I had some faint feelings for the girl from America still. Then out of nowhere I started having strong feeling for her again and idk why?

We are both single and I’d say we talk at least like once a week but she has started to not respond as much as when we first were talking(still responds at least 1-2 times a day). Although I do remember one of the other people that came with her that she is really bad at responding to people and she left them on delivered for 2-5 days or something like that. She still seems to be somewhat interested in me because she actually responds with paragraphs and continues our conversation by asking questions and doesn’t rely on me to keep a one way convo. 

So my problem is, should I tell her I think I like her? Should I see if she’s down for a long distance relationship or how could I find out if she would be interested in one? Should I just let it go and how? Basically idk what to do but I would be willing to do a long distance but idk if she’s willing. I need some help because for the past few weeks she’s all I can think about, when I’m at school, at work, with my friends she’s on my mind. I also don’t wanna ruin our friendship either:(

TDLR: I (17m) from Canada met a girl from America about a year ago and we were interested in each other. We kissed, talked and she said she wished we lived closer so we could date. About a year goes by both single, we still talking at least 1 time a week, she’s gotten a bit slower to responding(5 hrs on delivered instead of responding within the hour) but she is notoriously known for leaving people on delivered for multiple days. I started getting strong feelings for her out of nowhere and is all I can think about and I have no idea why. How should I approach this? I am willing to do a long distance but idk if she is or if she’s still even interested but I also don’t wanna ruin our friendship either. What should I do?

99,"Throwaway account here. 

I’m not sure how to feel. I’ve made a post about the situation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/j4gncd/my_dad_started_a_political_arguement_last_night/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and tensions since then were somewhat remedied. 

TLDR: my father started an argument two days ago about politics and then I thought that I was forced to couch surf for a while. 

In that argument, he made a few personal attacks at my character and was the first one to start screaming at me. I had never raised my voice at him back before. 

Afterwards, I left the house and stayed at a friend’s. The next morning my mom had arranged for me to stay at a family friends’ house but then told me to come home that night while my dad was sleeping. 

So today I decided to take the money that I actually earned from 2020 (I’m a student) to create an account that’s only in my name. Prior to this I’ve had a joint account with my parents. 

My dad came into the room and here’s the condensed version of what happened:

* He acknowledged that I never raised my voice at him like that before. 
* I told him that I was yelling because he was yelling. 
* He told me that he didn’t think he was yelling. 
* He told me to point it out if he yells. 
* I told him that that’s exactly what I did but he didn’t listen. 
* He ignored that. 
* He called me disrespectful for me raising my voice, although he was screaming at me first (and I did apologize for that). 
* I pointed out that he thinks it would be okay if he yelled at me but that I’m not allowed to yell back. 
* He said that he didn’t think he was yelling and ignored me. 
* He said that if I can’t be respectful that I should move out, that’s when I told him that I’m moving my money from our joint account and leaving the money he gave me. 
* He told me he’ll take back his money if I don’t want it, then I said that if he thinks that he can scream at me because I’m financially dependent and in his custody, then I don’t want his money. 
* He said I’m his subordinate (he’s a military guy). 
* He said that he’s 55 and I’m 19 and he knows what he’s talking about. 
* I pointed out that he was saying that he was right and I’m automatically wrong and asked why he would start an argument with me. 
* He said he didn’t say that. 

The only thing that I got out of the conversation was a lecture of what to do if he “gets heated” again. 
He didn’t apologize for attacking my character, he buckled down in his claims. 
He kept reminding me that I’m his subordinate and that we’ll never be equals. 
He kept reminding me how much he did for me growing up and how he wants to protect me - which is the excuse he’s using to be able to scream at me.  

I told my mom afterwards that I don’t want to touch any of the money that he gave me and that I’ll be moved out by this summer at the latest and hopefully permanently. I don’t want to accept money or housing from someone who will hold that against me when I protest to being screamed at and verbally attacked. 

Things are really tense right now. He told me that he’s willing to pay for everything but only as long as I just take it when he screams at me. It isn’t too frequent of an occurrence, but frequent enough to get to me. 

I have a little over $3000 to my name. Everything else was given to me, including my car. I’m taking 18 credit hours and my part time is only $9 an hour internship. I don’t know what to do. I have housing plans for the summer on, but I don’t know if I can take it emotionally if I stay in the the house until then or financially if I move out immediately.

Are there any people that could give me guidance? Are there any other parents who can give me some advice? What was your journey in becoming financially independent? Is there any money or tax advice that I absolutely need to know in creating an account?",05Oct2020,1

I didn’t know this and asked if Chloe was going, and she said she wasn’t invited and hasn’t spoken to Sarah since New Year’s. She seems content with staying home on the day of the party.

101,"So I've been contemplating if I should leave band next year or not. I'm a junior in high school and this is my 5th year in band. I am the lead uniform manager and the member with the longest time on leadership. Over the course of this year and last year I've been wondering if I should leave band. Last year things just didn't have that spark that they used to, I've felt like I'm not taken as seriously as I once was, I've felt overworked and overlooked.

Last year I began to realize that everything the band has been doing has been getting progressively worse in quality over the years. People aren't playing all their music, we aren't marching in step (a big deal in marching band), people are trying to get past me and break several rules about uniforms (Not allowed to eat in uniforms)—overall its just been crap.

At the end of last year after COVID hit we decided that we should redo the leadership team, fill in some roles, and finally fill the Assistant Drum Major (second-in-command) position (small band, so only a Drum Major (first-in-command)  was necessary at the time). We all sent in our applications and a few weeks later the Band Director announced that low brass section leader would be getting the Asst. DM position. The Low Brass section leader was new to leadership the previous year and could be a jerk at times. When I asked the BD what the deciding factor was he said, ""If we had a bigger band I'd pick all \[three\] of you,"" which was a nice thing to say... but then he followed it with, ""But I believe God led me to \[Low Brass Section Leader\]."" now.............. This is a small private religious school, but saying ""God led me to believe X,"" is an easy ""get the blame off of me"" kinda deal.

This year everything has kind of gone to crap. The marching sucks, the music is okay, nobody is in step, nobody can keep tempo, people are destroying/losing/forgetting their uniforms, and I'm over here trying to keep everything from falling apart because somedays it feels like I'm the only capable person. Now this year's field show is about a particular pirate movie series and so we have some band members dressed up as some of the main characters. The DM is the main antagonist. The Asst. DM is the main protagonist. The kid who LITERALLY CAN'T LEAVE HIS HOME BECAUSE OF HIS HIGH RISK FAMILY is the main protagonist's male partner and the French Horn player is the other antagonist. I specifically asked, volunteered, and showed time and time again I am willing, able, and capable of doing all the things but I was overlooked.

Am I jealous? Yes.

Am I mad? Oh heck yeah.

Just last month I was doing uniform assignments and because I'm short compared to everyone else (I'm 5'9... everyone else is like 6'+) I asked the assistance of the DM, Asst. DM, and the French horn player to help me put some boxes on the top shelf. I told them where I wanted the boxes and threw it down to them because I'm on a ladder doing stuff on a different shelf and they proceed to treat the box roughly, throw it around, and treat it like a game of Tetris when I specifically asked them to put the box in a specific spot. I grilled them for a moment but I doubt they were even listening.

All that aside... the last thing is I just don't feel appreciated. Every year when we do our award ceremony the BD says every year, ""Straight8Throwaway is who keeps the band running smoothly. He took uniforms and ran with them. He's the best uniform manager we've ever had,"" I get a little plaque with my name on it and a pat on the back... but that's it. Nothing else at any point throughout the year. Not even a good job.

All that begs the question... am I being petty...? Should I give it another year, after all... next year is my final year; my senior year.",05Oct2020,1

103,"*Thank you for reading, I know this is a little long.*

**Background:** In 2018 I (20f at the time) was living in a different city and was told my sister C (25f at the time) has moved out from living with our parents and moved in with her boyfriend whom she met on social media and hadn’t met in person prior to them moving in.  We had a rocky relationship at the time because my parents had allowed me to move away for college, but she didn’t get the same chance when she wanted to go to the same school. So, when I first met M (?m) he was given my sister’s biased opinion about us and the first thing he said to me was “well you’re definitely not as big a bitch as your sister makes you out to seem”. Ever since I tried to forget my initial dislike for him and give him the benefit of the doubt. (I mean who says that to their SO's sister that they just met?) However, M has no sense of boundaries and has caused more drama in our family, mainly the instance where he bullied my youngest sister. 

He told Y(18f) “You have nothing to be depressed about, you’re only 18” and “You ain’t shit who will never amount to anything because of your attitude” when Y mentioned C had gained weight. C was sensitive about the topic and told M the comment hurt her feelings and he texted Y the above. This is what broke the camel’s back. We already had a difficult time with liking him because C started engaging in different habits since meeting him: taking pills for everything from sleep, to an illness she didn’t have until she met him, vertigo, altitude sickness etc. She began lying about small things, making up a story about how M’s car was robbed and they even doctored a police report when in fact his car has been repossessed. She didn’t drive anymore, he used her car, she took the train, she never went anywhere without him, he answered her phone for her and would even text me directly when I would text C a question. They moved 40 minutes away from the city that put them closer to his job and further from hers. 

After this event the family was divided. M has since pushed my sister to cut us out of her life for lack of support for his decision to bully Y, and has never apologized, merely stating “it was over a year ago, I’m over it, you should be too”. C has ceased voluntary contact with us and only texts us if we check in with her. C told us today that she is getting married 10/24 in RI where his family is, while we live in AZ. I told her that if she gets married across the country, I’m not sure if my other siblings will be there for her when she comes back considering we only just received a 20-day notice to try and save to go. C said his family would pay for their wedding which is why they would have it there instead of here and we could celebrate with a small dinner afterwards. I spoke with my siblings who think M is pushing for the wedding in RI and consequently cause her to ruin her relationship with our family and further alienate themselves from us. I’ve tried talking to C about it, but she believes we all have it out for M and refuses to listen to anything about it. 

I don’t know how to reach out to her and convince her I’m worried about her relationship with our family since she’s also pregnant and may have no support after she gives birth. How do I reach out to her and tell her without making it seem like we're attacking her relationship with M? When I've attempted to talk to her in the past she wouldn't leave M's side and he answers her phone for her or she feels like we're trying to start an argument with her when we begin to talk about M's past actions.",05Oct2020,1

106,"Okay let me explain this as thoroughly as possible in order to convey how frustrating this situation is. I work as a housekeeper at a retirement home. My job is fairly simple. I work second shift and mostly take out garbage and clean offices. During my shift I'm not required to clean resident areas unless I'm paged to. One of coworkers works the same shift as me but the job only requires one person understand ably. Said coworker comes in earlier and works overtime so I assumed he helped first shift with there tasks since I was now in charge of all the second shift tasks. I recently discovered through first shift staff that he does indeed not do any first shift tasks. This same person will occasionally in front of everyone accuse me of ""not doing anything"" if I forget to do one simple thing, such as forget to change a roll of toilet paper.

107,"So I (18F) have been dating my boyfriend (18M) for nearly 6 months now. Due to the dynamic of our relationship we cant really let many people know. (He has strict parents along with a couple other factors). Now i would normally be completely fine with my boyfriend and his ex (they dated for a year in 2015) being friends, however she isn't aware of the fact that he is dating someone. He hasn't told her yet because she recently admitted to being in love with him. He told her that he didn't feel the same way anymore and that they could only remain friends. He refuses to tell her about me because she's dealing with a lot personally and doesn't want to hurt her further considering she might still be in love with him and says that he will tell her eventually. Now, as much as i love the fact that he's so caring, it really hurts knowing that she might think that theres still a chance of things working out for them. I really don't want to confront my boyfriend about this but it is also really hurts thinking that he might not be telling her because of underlying feelings. What should I do?",05Oct2020,1

Hello there, I'm in a gaming community on Xbox live and I've run into a huge problem with my friend group. I recently joined a clan and made a few buddies. It's all gone well up until the leader of the clan met this girl and took a liking to her. For context, he is twenty and she is fifteen. I'm finding that the relationship between them is getting slightly alarming and I'd love to find some advice on how to stop things from going sour.

After only a month of knowing her, this guy knows her name, is friends with her on Facebook, and he has her address! He sent her a cake for her birthday, which got her in trouble. But she's finding ways to get around her parents punishments. She continues to talk with him on the Xbox app and has these invite only parties where they watch Netflix together. It's super weird and the guy is all gushy and creepy towards her when we've all been in a party together. I know nothing about this girl and have no way to contact her parents to let them know what's going on behind their backs. I dont want to be that person who ""ruins young love"" but he is twenty and she is fifteen! It would be a completely different story if she was legal, but alas she's still a young girl. :( 

I have no idea what I should do. If I call the guy out, he'll probably kick me out of the clan, and I wont be able to see how things are progressing with this situation. If I talk to her, I feel as though she may not believe me and simply push aside my advice. She has been naïve enough by giving up her address to a complete stranger. I don't put any blame on her, because she is getting groomed, but I'm really worried about her. Is there anything I should do to try and keep her safe??

Almost three months ago, Naya Rivera, a celebrity, died. And my friend (let’s call her Lucy) has been telling me how sad she is about it every single day since.

Also during this time, fires swept through our town. We both got evacuated, some property of my family was burned. Another thing is that I got into a horrible argument with my abusive father. And another thing is that I’m coming to terms with my sexuality in a slightly homophobic household. 

Lucy knows I’ve been going through a lot, and she’s been kind when I tell her. But she won’t stop about this celebrity.

(x-post because I actually think this might be the more suited subreddit). Not officially 'revenge' as it wasn't a partner specifically - but same context.

I ended up hooking up with this girl I knew by association from some friends. We were both into it and we agreed to meetup later in the night. She asked right before she came over if she could video record our encounter for her OnlyFans account. I said no - not really my cup of tea and so she said ok that's fine but she wanted to hook up anyway. She came over - we got down to it and halfway through I noticed her phone was propped up on the side of my couch near my bed with the camera facing us.

Afterwards I confronted her about it and asked if she could show me that she didn't record anything. She showed me her SnapChat and Camera Roll - nothing there (but theres plenty of recording apps for phones nowadays). I was still hesitant - especially because of what she asked right beforehand so I quick pulled up a voice memo on my phone and slyly recorded me asking her to not share anything of me online, she said she would never.

I understand its my mistake to continue to go through with it even with the iffy circumstance - but do I have any way to ensure I'm not going to be a victim of Revenge porn? I don't have her OnlyFans profile and apparently its hard to search for it - and unfortunately our conversation leading up to the act was through SnapChat so the messages are gone. All I have is a voice memo asking her to not share things of me online - and I guess if she recorded a video - she has that. Shes said in conversation that she would never show the face of someone on her OnlyFans, and I have no reason to believe she's malicious and would share it as-is (if it exists). What can I do?",05Oct2020,1
120,"My boyfriend and I recently had to move into my dad’s house (probably about a month and a half ago) due to covid related issues and things were going okay. However, over the weekend my new stepmom expressed an extreme dislike for the fact that we labeled our groceries that my boyfriend and I bought with our own money (we can barely afford to eat, and I explained to my dad previously that we only put our names on them because my brother eats our food and if it gets eaten then we don’t have money to buy more food; I made it clear to him that my dad and stepmom were more than welcome to eat our food) and started yelling at us saying it was disrespectful to her and the house that we did that. My dad, trying to diffuse the situation, randomly brought up the subject of politics. He asked us who we were voting for, and after we answered he explained that him and my stepmother were voting for Trump. I asked him if he thought Trump was racist, and he proceeded to say a horrible statement that was extremely derogatory towards black people. It sickened me and I will not be repeating it, but just know it was very bad. When I turned around to look at him with a face of shock, he laughed and said “look at her face”. Before this point, I had never really realized how racist he was. I then asked if he was aware that Trump had made comments sexualizing his own daughter, to which he responded “so what” and tried to change the subject. I then repeated my question (to make sure I heard it right/give a chance for redemption), and he responded again with “so what”. As a daughter asking her father if he saw an issue with another dad sexualizing their daughter, it was earth shattering to hear this answer. I ended the conversation there, and my boyfriend and I left the house. It’s been two nights and we still haven’t returned. Frankly the idea of being in that house makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe. After he responded in such a way, I began to rethink how certain situations with him throughout my life had played out. Now that I was viewing them in a different light, things that I previously brushed off have started to concern me. For example, when I was 17 he made comments about how my butt looked in a bikini. 

Right now, I think I want to move out of his house and potentially in with my mother until my boyfriend and I can afford to move out. I suppose now I just need to figure out what to do about our relationship as a whole. Is this an issue that’s big enough to limit contact over? I don’t feel safe being around him or her knowing they have these ideals. I was thinking about writing a letter to leave when I go back move my stuff out to explain everything, but do you think there is a better way to do it?

Please don’t turn this into a debate of politics, I’m genuinely asking for advice on how to handle the situation so please only write advice pertaining to that. 

TLDR: I realized my dad is not a good person when made a horrible racist comment. In the same conversation, I also asked if he knew Trump made sexual comments to his daughter, and he replied with “so what” both times I asked. How do I handle this situation?",05Oct2020,1

Sorry this will probably be long. Please bare with me. Also I am on mobile so formatting my be off. I apologize.

So my parents recently let my brother use my car. I hadn’t been able to use it for awhile due to some problems with it and was waiting on getting it back. So what happened is they took my brother to pick it up behind my back because I have said he can’t use it. I understand why they did it because they knew I would say no but it still pisses me off. 

So my brother has my car. I say my car because my parents bought it for me as a graduation present from college. My brother is a horrible driver and has gotten in more accidents than I can count and has wrecked multiple cars. This is why I said he couldn’t use it. However my parents let him anyways. 

When I found out I gave them a week to get it back. They wouldn’t commit to that but said they would try. It’s been 1 month since then and I was just told I MIGHT get it back next week. I hate this because my mom is running interference between me and my brother and he has been cussing her out when she tries to enforce a deadline. 

Anyways tonight I got upset that my brother said I might get it back next week because I was told I would have it Thursday. I had let it go because my brother had text my mom saying F this F you etc and I didn’t want to her to take that abuse. However when he called tonight and made it seem like it was no big deal and said he was going to need to borrow it again I LOST IT. I went into the bathroom and cried. My parents tell me that I need to get over it and I need to help family out. However I feel that I was helping him and now he made his grave and needs to lie in it aka accept the consequences of his actions. He told me I am an entitled B word and that I get everything handed to me. Which really hurt me. My mom says it’s in the past and I need to let it go. I don’t know how to
Even begin to do that. She suggested therapy to help with my issues with my brother. I am not sure if that would help because I can’t help that he sees his Ex wife in me and takes out his anger from his divorce on me. So I guess what I am asking is how do I move on from this? Would I be an a-hole for refusing to be around him except for holidays, birthdays etc? I can’t move out from living with my parents because I am disabled, so is that even possible?

Hello im new here im on mobile and i wanted to see what opinions may be shared here.

I am a 21yr old who is paying of a car loan that i dont like only my wife likes it. The loan is in my name i live with her and have a full time job and pay like 75% of the stuff on the house. The house is hers so theres no issues with rent or whatever so yeah. Issue is i always wanted this car since i saw the spy shots for it back in 2018. Last december my car broke down and got pressured into a dealership car so i could get to work and all that. I preffer manuals but my wife and everyone else says its stupid yet the car i want since 2018 is exclusively manual. Now i have the oportunity to trade in this car which i dont like 1 bit and have no warranty on. But my wife says that she does not want me to because she cant drive stick for long in emergencys. I know this which is why i want to sell the other car i have and keep the money to get her a new (to her) car affordable yet good for her since shes bassically stsrting to get a car. So far i think she just wants me to keep the car and leave it for her and stay with the shitty car i have now that i intend to sell. 

Question here is: Is it okay for me to get the car and get her one by  selling and save up money to buy her one or is it not okay?",05Oct2020,1

Today he made one of these pages where people can leave anonymous messages.

I was in a pretty bad depression for a really long time and I'm now almost pretty much okay. I wanna tell him and be 100% honest about everything but I don't wanna scare him off, since he already knows I have an anxiety problem. We'd also be long distance since I'm away for college.

150,"I (f) am in high school and have my first day of school soon. I moved from far away so I’m joining late and I don’t know how to make friends. I only had about ten friends in my last home and I only hung out with four of them outside of school. I was miserable and I really don’t want to be alone anymore. The problem is  I don’t know how to make friends though.
I used to be super social in elementary school and I was friends with everyone in my class but when I got to middle school I moved and had a really hard time making friends. I was kinda a loser in middle school and the beginning of high school. I have no idea what to say after “how are you?” and I don’t know how to actually start conversations with people. 
I feel like since I’m in the middle of high school and late in the year everyone already has a group of friends to hang out with and they’re not even gonna notice me. I am the shy type too so I  struggle putting myself out there. Not to mention I don’t vape/smoke/drink or anything like that and I feel uncomfortable hanging out with people who do. I just really don’t wanna be alone the rest of high school like I was at the beginning

151,"I was working with a temp worker that had worked in other areas of our company and didn’t have the best track record. Boss man couldn’t find another worker so this guy got placed in my department. Thought he knew more about our area than our people who’ve worked there for decades. Talked down to them, acted like he was a gift to the plant. I thankfully worked in another area but staff would fill me in on things as I am responsible for some finished products. I didn’t straight out trash the guy but I made sure everyone including him knew that I wasn’t going to take responsibility for his screw ups. Things reached boiling point when he called in a union rep because he said staff were harassing him. I instantly bowed out and let boss man deal with it. I went to boss man and said I wanted nothing to do with that guy ever again. They said they’d do their best. I was talking to staff about how we were in the clear for the next season and of course someone overheard and reported it to him. I know I screwed up there. So now that he wasn’t rehired he’s taken a harassment claim and listed me in it as a witness but also me ruining his chances of being hired again. I’m beyond sick about it.

163,"About 2 years ago I went on a tinder date with a guy. Within maybe 10 minutes of the date, I knew I wouldn't be seeing him again. Just wasn't feeling a connection. About an hour 1/2 into the date we were finishing up our drinks and getting ready to head out. He asked if he could come to my house to hang out some more. I know I should have said no because I didn't want to but I definitely struggle with saying no, so I said sure. A couple more hours couldn't hurt. We got back to my house and it was quiet and dark because I had roommates so we decided to just watch something on Netflix quietly. I purposely sat away from him on the couch. Within 5 minutes he had already moved right next to me and was aggressively spooning me and kissing on my neck. I let him do this for a bit while being visibly uncomfortable and eventually was like hey I just wanna watch the movie. He agreed. Not even 5 more minutes later he started doing it again. At this point, I have dealt with this from guys so many times before that I decided to just give in to it because I knew it'd be over and he'd leave. So I pretty much laid there like a dead fish and let him do it and he left basically right after. I felt disgusting.   


In the next couple of days and weeks he reached out a couple of times and I just didn't reply. It has now been 2 years since that date and he still reaches out to me about every 3 months. Today being one of those days. I was so fed up with the consistent contact with me not responding so I decided to respond. I asked him ""why do you continue to reach out when I blatantly ignore you?"" He said he was sorry and just wanted to talk. He also said he was confused about why things ended so badly between us (again, it was one date) and didn't get why I stopped talking to him. He also mentioned that I had once before told him to leave me alone and he didn't understand why. I told him I shouldn't have to give him a reason for him to leave me alone but decided to explain exactly how I felt about that date. He said, ""sorry I made you mad"". I then said something like ""sorry you made me mad? or sorry you pressured me into sex, when I clearly did not want to, by shoving your boner in my back?"" and he responded, ""I said sorry, fuck you!""  


Anyway, this pissed me off and I found him on Facebook. Turns out he's apart of a church and lives in their young adult group home and preaches some really hateful, sexist things. I'm honestly completely fed up with being treated this way over and over again and was thinking about anonymously sending the screenshots of our conversation today to his church. I don't know if I should and am wondering what other people are thinking or if anyone has a similar experience. I appreciate any advice I can get! Thank you!",05Oct2020,1

165,"TLDR; Earlier this year I cut ties with someone I considered to be one of my closest/longest running friends and I don't know how to cope with this kind of loss. It has been 7 months since I last talked to him, I regret how I handled things involving his addictive tendencies, but ultimately know that it isn't something I can change. How can I feel less guilty? Sorry if formatting is weird, on mobile, and names changed obviously.

For a little over a year in 2018, both Tom (21M) and I were just doing our own thing in life and not really seeing eachother much (with jobs, school, health issues, a, for once, serious relationship, moving out, etc., I was very exhausted 25/8 and was admittedly not as good of a friend as I could have been with checking up on how he was). I did know he was seeing a girl (Sarah, 20F) we went to school with, and I just figured things were all good, if he needed me, he knew my number. I can't remember exactly, but I do think he reached out first in the summer of 2019. Tom and Sarah came over for some drinks. I saw he was still smoking cigarettes, and they had to be heading out every 30 minutes to have one. My roommate fairly complained about the smell so we made plans to hang out at his place to Properly catch up later. In this first visit over, he was weirdly aggressive about tiny things with Sarah in front of my gf and I while Sarah was literally making dinner for everyone. I figured he was just stressed or pissed off on that particular day, thought nothing of it. 
We end up hanging out some more, his girlfriend and mine get along pretty well wow, I think she's cool, the 3 of them like to drink, we all end up playing vidya games at least weekly when COVID hits. The only problem is Tom's close to blackout/actually blacking out while drinking gets way too consistent. I don't really like interacting with drunk people to begin with, I can bear it and have fun every once in a while, but the way he always managed to talk about too sensitive of topics for that level of belligerence made it unbearable. Around the same time he had talked about having to drive to work while ""shitfaced"". 
My gf and Tom tried to talk about how she was concerned for his health, but Tom ended with a rant about how we weren't there enough for him in his breakup that was then 4 years ago, so how could she be concerned? I understand feeling anger at bad things that happened, but it wasn't even a year long relationship in high school. I know it clearly meant a lot more than that to him, but it frustrated me nothing he HAD was good enough for him. 
We, for some reason, felt like we had to try to at least get Sarah off of the sinking ship. It was becoming pretty apparent Tom wasn't just ""stressed out"", he was an entitled dickhead to her. Just shit she would say like ""oh Tom doesn't find it interesting when I talk about that"", ""he only is in his computer room all day but then he tries to get mad at me for 'flirting' in the discord server we are both in when I'm just talking to people"", ""when I borrow his ecig he gets a little too upset sometimes"". We knew she didn't have parents to fall back on or people she was close to, so we really tried to let her know we were still there for HER if she needed, we just cannot talk with Tom because he is being an ass. In retrospect, this was dumb, we really should have just cut our losses and blocked both.
3ish months later, Sarah calls me, ended up getting kicked out of the house in the rain without shoes after a fight at 4 am, and manages to get the attention of a police officer while my gf and I are on our way to pick her up. We talk to the cop, he lets us go but warns Sarah about underage drinking. She was too drunk and now upset bc she had to talk to cops AND she wanted to go home. We tried to explain to her that she couldn't go home because Tom was still upset, he would have at least been calling her phone if he really wasn't an asshole, which was really stupid to say to her but I was too tired. My gf valiantly tried to get her to calm down, have some tea and a snack, maybe watch a movie to unwind and sleep, but she ended up just getting more upset because Tom texted her. We let her cry in our room and went to run a few errands. We come back, sure enough she was passed out in the bed, but it was like 2pm and she had therapy at 5 she mentioned the night before. We wake her up, drop her off, and recieve a text to me that essentially said ""If I continue to talk to you, I am betraying Tom."" I don't know what happened to either of them, but I know what my gut is telling me happened. 
How can I let go of this feeling of failing Tom and Sarah despite him self sabotaging and actively hurting the people in his life? This isn't even someone either my GF or I want to be friends with, I just want to be done playing the ""what if"" game in my head of things I could have done to have helped him more.",05Oct2020,1

168,"Okay, so first let me start of by saying I'm 18 years old and just recently purchase my first car when I was 17 a few months ago. I've been paying insurance to my mom for a few months now. I had her insure the car in my name, so it would be cheaper. As I'm taking this year to save up as much  money for university as possible . If I were to insure it myself when I was first looking it would be 240, but my mom said she got it for me for $200 a month. Anyways fat forward to today, I told her I found a better insurance since it cost less and she got all mad saying it would ruin her insurance if I left the plan. I told her the cost of the new insurance I wanted to get which was about 170 and she said just pay her that from now on then. Which I thought was weird, so I decided to log into the insurance account to find out that I've been paying for my insurance and hers plus extra money that's not even going to the insurance. Should I confront her about it or just leave it as is? She knows I'm trying to save all of my money, so I'm confused as to why she would lie about the cost of it to me.

My girlfriend and I are both 15, going on 16. She's been dealing with depression since her parents split and she was forced to move from Manhattan to Pennsylvania, where we met at our high school. Her family is very questionable; her mom/step-dad seems to bully her and berate her about every little thing, which builds up in her and makes her cut... Her dad isn't really any better, he's lazy and absent in her life, all around childish. Her best friend and I are pretty much the only two people she can ever trust.

Her therapist advised her to seek a diagnosis, as she clearly has depression and possibly minor autism. It seems as though her parents are willing, but slacking.

Her older step-sister has had mental health issues in the past, and my girlfriend, the middle child, has always been seen by her parents as ""the safe one."" From what she's told me, her parents will scream at her about how spoiled and underappreciative she is, which gets her so upset that when I'm not actively on the phone she... relieves herself with a knife.

I want to text her mom and just tell her to take her diagnosing process seriously, as well as looking at her ankles if given the chance, but I'm so afraid. I'm scared of her mom blocking her from me because I didn't speak up sooner, I'm afraid of her mom lashing out at her for what she's been saying, and I'm most afraid of blatantly disobeying my girlfriend's trust.

181," Tl:dr - I think Im mentally fucked, and some people say I should head to a psychiatrist, but I dont want to receive any scary diagnoses

 Me and my best friend headed to burger king after working out at planet fitness.  
We made it to the place, and started talking. When I had to interact with the clerk, I literally could not understand wtf she was saying to me, even though she had no accent I just couldnt give meaning to her words. My friend understood everything perfectly and completed the order for me. I often have this too, I have a hard time understanding what is being said to me irl and usually ask people to clarify twice or thrice (I have a reputation in my school as being ""dumb"" even though my IQ is a bit above average, precisely because of that).  
I get irritated and offended very easily, and often get in conflicts with people who I assume to have offended me - even when in reality they haven't (which I only realize upon later reflection).  
Idk why but since a very young age I always felt like I am being watched and what I do is monitored by somebody. Of course I realized that's a silly thought and not the case in reality, it is a feeling I've always had and continue having now. I often hear a voice in my head, that is sometimes clear, that tells me what I should be doing and praises or ridicules me. I realize this is not really a normal thing to experience, but it's never bothered me in any major way.  
Since this has been the case for me since as early as I can remember, I can only blame it on genetics or some type of environment fuckup. At the time my biological father conceived me, he was a heroin addict, and he would often abuse my mother physically throughout her pregnancy with me. I asked my mother about this, and she agrees. She told me (And it is very brutal to realize that my own mother said this to me), that I have always had mental ""quirks"" that her other children don't, and it is probably (in her opinion) due to my father abusing her when she was pregnant with me. 

I have a major issue understanding what I'm being told. I am not bad at talking, as you can see I can form my sentences pretty well and organize my thoughts, but I have a hard time deciphering what I'm being told by others. I usually have to ask the person to repeat twice or three times to fully understand. That's why all the teachers I've ever had considered me to be a difficult child, I always had them explain stuff to me twice or thrice.

I also have a very short temper and get offended very easily, which I later on usually realize is not even needed. I often take offense to something and even get into a fight, only to realize later I really shouldn't have been offended. I've had the police called on me occasionally because of that.

I was never a particularly shy person, but I am terrible socially. Not because I don't try to socialize, but because I just can't do it right. I often can't understand what I am being told and get lost in conversations, and I have absolutely 0 filter (Even though I try to work on it). I have a reputation of being dumb in my social group, even though I am quite intelligent academically. I dont want to be perceived as weird and annoying by people so I kinda distance myself from others. This has caused me a lot of depression which I cope with by taking certain substances I will not list in this post.

I have never gone to a doctor about that sort of stuff, but now I feel I might. I have developed a serious drug problem recently, came close to overdosing last week, and my mother told me I should stop. The thing is, ever since I stopped my personality got so so so much worse and detached from what is socially expected. I can't go like this for long, even everything my mother says (and I love her more than anything) irritates me. Next year I will have to live in a college dorm, I am not sure how I'll go through that experience sober without causing any conflict.

I also think whatever my personality problem may be is genetic.

My biological father was a drug addict and he was addicted to heroin at the time he impregnated my mother (she was 18), he also beat her and tried to kill her once when she was pregnant with me and when I was 1 year of age. He died when I was 3 years of age and never really participated in my upbringing, but my mother says my behavior is very similar to his / I look similar to him / I sound similar to him.

\^ This is very concerning to me because I really hate who my father was as a person. He would stone cold rob people in the streets, beat his girlfriend (my mother), get fired from every job he's taken. It's kinda brutal being told that I am similar to a person like that.

Anyway, I am now considering going to a doctor about this, but then again I'm kinda scared of being put on some type of meds that might interact with what I'm currently taking (sedatives and dissociatives) and the overall stigma that comes with receiving some diagnose",05Oct2020,1
182,"I don’t know what this is but I feel very territorial about my things, my car, my home , my material things. 

It’s not that I don’t want to help . I do . It’s just that people take me for granted when I do help . 
My cousins take my stuff and then assume I don’t need it as much and keep using it until I have to ask them to return every single time .

So does that make me a bad person to never want to give them anything again?

Today my neighbour asked for my car so that they can teach their daughter how to drive . My first instinct was NO . It’s mine . They have their own car , but they want mine because it’s automatic. They could also go to driving school like I did right . I just recently started driving and recently got that car . I just don’t want to give it to them . I am also worried that they’ll damage the car .

The problem is I feel very bad now . I feel hurt . I feel anxious. This happens everytime I have to deny someone something or I have lie them to them in the process of denying. I don’t want to be a bad person but I can’t give it up . Every part of me says not to do it .

I’m also very independent. I was taught from early on never to ask for help, if you can do it yourself. And I try my hardest to do things by myself. I kinda expect others to be like that too. If I don’t want anything from you , you should not want anything from me .

I’m really willing to change my view . I want to change if I’m wrong because lately I’m wrong about everything, everything I have believed in is wrong . I’m confused all the time .

I’ve been at my job for 12 years in a few positions and have never really fully committed. I could/would say that I’ve never really been in love with it. Well really I’ve been ashamed to work there with it being retail and having people know this. The pay sucks, the people you work with are well questionable, and well it’s retail. 


     The other part is the drama and nastiness. There is this woman I work with who has taken this role of being my auntie and acting like we’re family or something. I feel sorry for her because I think she’s just lonely so I’ve let it continue even playing her a bit but it’s just getting to the point where I want to tell her to fuck off.  


      So the other day she’s telling me I’ve given up on life and myself and that I just don’t care. It’s not that she isn’t correct on level but who is she to tell me about how my life is when she herself is one to point a finger. Also she said it was coming from someone else who I question would say that. This woman is one of those social butterflies at work who is good but the level of socialness is too much for me.

186,"Background: One of my best friends (20M) has had a past of severe trauma. About this time a year ago, he was a severe alcoholic and extremely mentally unstable and almost committed suicide. He was in a very rough spot, college and life almost got the better of him. In February this year, he got help and was forced into maintaining 1 year of sobriety from alcohol (alcohol was his only addiction) or else risk removal from something very important to him. 

Fast forward to the present, he did maintain sobriety for 6 months, but he started drinking in moderation and only around others instead of in his room alone. We’re in the US where we can’t buy alcohol because we’re under 21 so on Friday night we had one of our buddies grab us some goods from the liquor store so we could have some fun which consisted of vodka, beer, and 8 four lokos. We had a little bit on Friday and Saturday night, but I remembered how much we had left. We had almost exactly half of our fifth of vodka left and 7 four lokos. 

When I saw him today to work on class work, I noticed his room smelled faintly of alcohol. I immediately asked him about this and he quickly claimed it was just his vape. I didn’t think much of it, but something seemed off about him today. So when I left his place, I thought I’d go check his car because he always leaves it unlocked. I pop the trunk. Lo and behold the vodka is significantly lower than I remembered and there were only 6 four lokos left. Because I drove him home and basically tucked him in the night before, the only time he could have consumed more was while he was alone in his room. This concerns me a lot because I’m fairly certain it could be him going back down the route he took last year. If anyone finds out about this, his life is pretty much over. He’s had so many strikes and he knows the next strike means he’s out. 

Another concerning item I found in his trunk was a loaded shotgun. He’s never told me about this, and I really hope he doesn’t have it for any self-harm reasons. 

I know he sees a therapist regularly and goes through waves and valleys of depression here and there, but I have considerable evidence and suspicion he might be headed down the wrong path again like the one that almost ruined him last year. 

He’s seemed a bit more secretive recently, self-isolated from people, I have high suspicion he’s consuming alcohol alone, and he’s seemed off in general which leads me to believe something could be very wrong with him right now and I want to help him before it could be too late. 

I appreciate any advice",05Oct2020,1

188,"I (19F) have a verbally abusive multimillionaire father

Throwaway account here. 

I’m not sure how to feel. I’ve made a post about the situation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/j4gncd/my_dad_started_a_political_arguement_last_night/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and tensions since then were somewhat remedied but still pretty heavy. 

TLDR: my father started an argument two days ago about politics and then I thought that I was forced to couch surf for a while. 

In that argument, he made a few personal attacks at my character and was the first one to start screaming at me. I had never raised my voice at him back before. 

Afterwards, I left the house and stayed at a friend’s. The next morning my mom had arranged for me to stay at a family friends’ house but then told me to come home that night while my dad was sleeping. 

So today I decided to take the money that I actually earned from 2020 (I’m a student) to create an account that’s only in my name. Prior to this I’ve had a joint account with my parents. 

My dad came into the room and here’s the condensed version of what happened:

* He acknowledged that I never raised my voice at him like that before. 
* I told him that I was yelling because he was yelling. 
* He told me that he didn’t think he was yelling. 
* He told me to point it out if he yells. 
* I told him that that’s exactly what I did but he didn’t listen. 
* He ignored that. 
* He called me disrespectful for me raising my voice, although he was screaming at me first (and I did apologize for that). 
* I pointed out that he thinks it would be okay if he yelled at me but that I’m not allowed to yell back. 
* He said that he didn’t think he was yelling and ignored me. 
* He said that if I can’t be respectful that I should move out, that’s when I told him that I’m moving my money from our joint account and leaving the money he gave me. 
* He told me he’ll take back his money if I don’t want it, then I said that if he thinks that he can scream at me because I’m financially dependent and in his custody, then I don’t want his money. 
* He said I’m his subordinate (he’s a military guy). 
* He said that he’s 55 and I’m 19 and he knows what he’s talking about. 
* I pointed out that he was saying that he was right and I’m automatically wrong and asked why he would start an argument with me. 
* He said he didn’t say that. 

The only thing that I got out of the conversation was a lecture of what to do if he “gets heated” again. 
He didn’t apologize for attacking my character. 
He kept reminding me that I’m his subordinate and that we’ll never be equals. 
He kept reminding me how much he did for me growing up and how he wants to protect me - which is the excuse he’s using to be able to scream at me.  

I told my mom afterwards that I don’t want to touch any of the money that he gave me if I can help it and that I’ll be moved out by this summer at the latest and hopefully permanently. I don’t want to accept money or housing from someone who will hold that against me when I protest to being screamed at and verbally attacked. 

Things are really tense right now. He told me that he’s willing to pay for everything but only as long as I just take it when he screams at me. It isn’t too frequent of an occurrence, but frequent enough to get to me. 

I have a little over $3000 to my name and everything else was given to me, including my car. I’m taking 18 credit hours and my part time is only $9 an hour internship. I don’t know what to do. I have housing plans for the summer on, but I don’t know if I can take it emotionally if I stay in the the house until then or financially if I move out immediately.

Are there any people that could give me guidance? Are there any other parents who give me some advice? What was your journey in becoming financially independent? Is there any money or tax advice that I absolutely need to know in creating an account?",05Oct2020,1
189,"My dog turned 15 earlier this year and it scared the hell out of me because I knew his time was coming. He’s been pretty sick a few times since then, but has always pulled through without any real long term issues. It almost got me thinking he’s invincible. Which sounds dumb, I know, but I guess I was trying to avoid how I felt about it. He stopped eating two days ago, and yesterday morning my wife took him into the vet ER. They told her he’s got advanced pancreatitis and gave us meds to help him gain an appetite, but he’s not gotten any better and my wife is heavily hinting that it might be time to let him go. To me this is really saying something because she loves him more than I do most days.

I’ve had this boy since I was 12 and now that it might be time for him to go I don’t think I’m ready. There’ve been more than a few days where he was my only friend. There’s nobody who’s seen me at better and worse times in my life. Not my wife, my mom, my friends. If there’s anyone who knows me best it’d probably be a tie between my wife and my dog. I just can’t believe it’s time to go. I’ve got so many regrets about how I’ve raised him. I feel like I should’ve spent more quality time with him - taking more walks, playing more when he still had the energy, giving him the treats he deserved. I worry I’ve been to harsh or abusive when training him and punishing him. He’s such a good dog and I hope he’s had a good life, because there’s nothing I can do about it now. And if I fucked up there’s not anything I can do to make up for it.

My question is: what do I do about these feelings? I already know I’m going to make his last day or two great, but how do I cope once he’s gone. He’s known me for most of my life - I feel like I’m about to lose a part of myself. I’m so heartbroken and confuse I don’t know what to do. Getting drunk and high are only going to help so much and it’s not healthy for me to dive in that direction. How do you deal with that? What do I do once he’s gone?

192,"(posted this in AITA but a few thought it might be better here) 

I (F21) work with a guy (M27) who we'll call ""Matt."" For context, we work at a church as sound engineers.

Matt has a problem of not showing up to work until the last possible moment. He is supposed to be there at 3:30 for Mass at 4:00, this dude doesn't show up until 3:57. Why he hasn't been fired yet is a question I have yet to be answered. The priest really noticed this one morning, as he saw I was the only one present and working. He made a comment to me about Matt ""cutting it close."" And I didn't respond to him other than a friendly smile. I did talk to Matt about it later that day. He said he arrives late so I have time to set up, then he checks my work afterwards (he is also my trainer btw). I told him that wasn't smart, because my alarm actually hadn't gone off that morning and I was actually pretty late. We made a deal, that he would arrive earlier from that day on.

Then, he and I had an argument the next week, and I was still pretty upset about it the next day. I didn't completely ignore him or anything, just didn't speak when it wasn't necessary (he didn't even notice).

Our boss came up to me that day and started asking me questions about Matt. Like:  
""What is the latest he has even shown up?""  
""Have you ever been by yourself?""  
""What time does he normally get here?""

I just answered, in simple vague terms:  
""I don't know the latest he's ever been here. I don't really check the time while working.""  
""Well, we tend to share the work usually. Sometimes I'll set up by myself and he'll clean up by himself, or visa versa.""  
""We tend to get here about 6:20-6:30""

I didn't want to lie to my boss, but from the questions he was asking me, I knew he knew something (he's a volunteer police officer) and I figured that the priest must have said something because they are friends.

Apparently the boss told Matt, ""pixiedusttough, said you need to be there earlier to help her with the speakers."" I never said that. I had told him (a loooooong time ago) that I am capable of doing everything except put up the speakers (I am 5'1, trying to put 40lb spakers on 6 ftt stands) and that's all I really need Matt for.

Now Matt isn't speaking to me. Yes, I get why: I was angry with him that day, but I would never do anything to get him in trouble or fired on purpose like that.

This isn't the first time our boss has taken my words out of context, but it is the first time Matt hasn't spoken to me about it. I found out through another coworker. One friend thinks I did the right thing because Matt should be there at the time he needs to be. Another friend says I should have lied because I may need Matt to lie for me one day.

My GFs parents were even working to adopt her and her baby. Until DCS screwed her life, most likely permanently. 

Short and sweet. DCS removed Abby from school. (She just started highschool again). Came to GFs house to get the baby and took them God knows where. Apparently her grandmother is requesting custody. Even though she is a convicted criminal with multiple child abuse charges against her. DCS then told Abby that my GFs parents requested to have her removed. Which is not true what so ever. And banned GFs entire family from attempting contact or else legal repercussions. (All of these things were told to my GFs mom by their lawyer.)

210,"So the guy I’ve been seeing for a couple of months told me that it makes him really mad that my son(3) stays up late. He said that’s one reason why he’s not taking things too seriously and why he’s hesitant to make things official bc if he asks me to move in, he doesn’t want to deal with my son being up late. Understandable. He has a son who is 6, and he compares our parenting styles and makes it seem, without saying it, that I’m not doing a good job.
I’m a single mom, recovering addict and I’m trying my best with my son. I let him get away with things here and there to make up for the things he had to see and live through due to my addiction and his fathers.
I’m not sure why but the whole conversation really pissed me off and made me cry a little so now I just want to end things. If staying up late makes my son happy, then I think the dude I’m talking to can fuck right off. But then again, I see the validity of his point.
Am I wrong? What tf should I do?",05Oct2020,1
212,"My (28f) ex(27m) has decided to end our on again/ off again relationship for good. We were together for 4 years, and have had this other relationship status for 3 years. Early on in our relationship we had a child, she passed at only 17 days old. I haven’t been “right” ever since; struggling with ptsd and depression, struggling to find any worth in myself or the desire to continue living, being afraid of everything and everyone aware the worst very well could happen. It’s a big reason why our relationship hasn’t worked out. 

When our daughter died 2 burial plots were purchased for us, which he later paid for, and she was laid to rest between the plots. There are no openings surrounding the plots and they are behind my grandparents. Up until now we’ve agreed that we both still plan on being buried there but I think we were having those conversations under the belief that we were going to figure it out. I plan on ending my romantic life and fostering in the future. He’s expressed his desire and/or belief to remain alone for his days. However we are both young, relative to human lifespan, and it’s not realistic to think one or both of us won’t remarry and have another family in the future. 

If that very likely case were to happen, what would become of the plots where our child is already buried? I don’t think it’s right that we be laid to rest together, not to ourselves and not to our prospective future spouses. There is also no part of me that wants to try to take away from him being buried with his late daughter. 

As it stands right now each plot is under both of our names. My original intention was to specify which plot belonged to which person and put them under our own names. Suddenly I’m worried about giving up that control without any guarantee he will not sell it or forfeit the plot back to the cemetery. What if he tries to bury someone else with my child? I understand these aren’t so likely but I’d feel much safer if I could draft some sort of contract to keep the plots surrounding our daughter to her parents. I want to do this in the most fair and ethical way possible. I don’t want him to think I’m attacking him or assuming the worst of him. Our disagreements always end with me in tears and he is the one that is ending our relationship, largely citing my inability to control my emotions in a panicked state, so that is the last thing I want to show him. 

Is it unreasonable for me to ask him to sign a written agreement that we will not sell our plots if we decide to be buried elsewhere, but will have our daughter moved to the empty plot instead? Are there other options for us here?",05Oct2020,1
213,"So I have recently been scammed through vec-ex.com website which was advertising as an investment platform. I did a bit of research before investing and didn’t find anything to worrying about it. I was told about the platform after talking to someone I met on a social media site. At first I invested $3000 and it seemed to be working so I invested some more money and in total it was $14500. The website is no longer accessible and cannot get in contact with them.

I’m a single parent with 3 kids and have them full time as their mother has abandoned them because she has mental health issues. I can no longer work full time so I was looking for another way to make money and just so happened to choose the wrong place.

215,"Note- I’m in the UK so most treatment here is free on the NHS with long waiting times unless you pay for private healthcare, and it’s cheaper with insurance


My (19f) sister is 12, she’s going through a hard time at the moment. She’s self harming, and it’s getting pretty bad. She struggles with insomnia too. She’s also started having really severe tics, like with Tourette’s syndrome. The doctor says that it could be Tourette’s, but it could also be fits/seizures, so she’s been referred to the paediatric department urgently. She’s been waiting 2/3 weeks for this and could be waiting more weeks to get seen. My mum has also asked for her to be referred to CAHMS because of the self harm(mental health help for children and teens) 3 or 4 times which the doctors at our surgery haven’t done. It’s taking such a long time for her to get help, and I’m really worried about my sister, especially as I don’t live with her so I can’t keep an eye on her. 

My parents are divorced. Both of my sisters and I don’t really get along with our dad so much, but he’s not a bad person, he does care about us. He lives 3 hours away from us because my mum wanted to move back to her hometown when they separated, so we don’t see him too often. My parents rarely communicate about issues involving me and my sisters, with my mum being extremely petty. There was a point maybe last year when she would tell my dad everything that was going on (my other sister (15f) was going through a tough time too, and was diagnosed with high functioning autism) and he wouldn’t really respond so she just decided she wouldn’t tell him anything anymore, even though she knows my dad is crap at responding and didn’t even ask him to respond to her.

My dad didn’t really know about my sisters issues until she got referred urgently, but as it’s taking so long and it’s such a serious issue, he’s offered to pay for private healthcare so my sister can be seen quicker. My mum doesn’t have money for private healthcare, but my dad does. He doesn’t have insurance so it’ll cost him even more but he said he’s happy to do so because it’ll help my sister. I found out that my dad had offered to pay for private healthcare because he called me earlier and mentioned it, and said that my mum had ignored it.

Usually she tells me all the issues with my sisters, but she’s hidden from me that my dad has offered to pay. I’m really upset about this, I don’t understand why she won’t say yes to my dad and why she’s hiding it from me. I understand it’s her ex husband and she wants to be independent, but it’s our dad too and he wants to help his kids with a serious issue that he has the ability to do. I’m really worried that by the time anything comes back from the NHS hospital, it’ll be too late for my sister. She could be having seizures for God’s sake! I need to say something to my mum because like I said, I’m really concerned for my sister. I don’t know what to say, I don’t want to fall out with my mum because I love her but this has made me look at her differently and I hate that.",05Oct2020,1

Texting everyday all day, spending hours together just hanging out and having fun literally doing nothing and just genuinely liking each other. She had told me constantly that she really liked me and hoped I wouldn’t leave her and that she wouldn’t leave me. We were basically a match made in Heaven I had thought. One night after hanging out and her giving me my first kiss as well. She texts me the next day asking what college I wanted to go to. And I told her I was thinking of doing online college or the one she had been planning on going to(I had planned on going to that college before I met her) and after I told her that she said we need to stop dating because she can’t go to college with a bf. Which really shocked me and came out of no where and it hurt like crazy! She still had 4 or 5 months before she left for college and I knew she was leaving then and I was ok with that. And it’s been a couple months now since she’s left and I can’t get over it. I hurt still and I still wish I could’ve continued to have gotten to know her and date more. But it ended abruptly.

It drove me nuts ever since but by now she claimes she got her period and the pregnancy test was negative. Personally I don't have Facebook but a friend of mine wanted to see what she looks like after telling him the story. On there she had a bunch of baby related stuff / commented on them. Even if she might not be pregnant she sure is fixated on baby's apparently.

Last Sunday she told me she would take the pregnancy test this week, but she didn't messaged me until I asked about it this Friday. She did not respond till Friday but then claimed it was negative.

Now she asked me to send her a picture of me because, and I quote ""I don't really remember what you look like"".

I don't really want to see her again. Even on the day the whole thing started I told her it would be a one time thing.

Do you think there is some malicious intent behind her asking for a picture of me? Do you think she's lying to not be pregnant?

219,"My mom and I signed a lease to leave in December today and reality sunk in. 

As of December I won’t ever get to see my home or room again. We’ve lived here for 14 years, and the feeling of not seeing my room again or the familiar driveway, wonderful neighbors, or anything really hurts me.

I will also be leaving my dad, who has retired and is at home 24/7, making our lives basically unlivable. My mom wants to divorce him and for our safety, we are leaving.

He has abused me and emotionally abused me and my mom for years on end. We’ve ran away from him before and I have told CPA about him when I was little. Recently, he has mellowed out a bit but his disgusting habits are there, and his emotional abuse/controlling behavior is always there. He is actually a bit nicer to me now but sometimes he just snaps and he does make fun of me a lot. He is a raging narcissist. He completely ignores my mom and she is unhappy with the marriage.

We can’t leave the house without him knowing so and he won’t let my mom or I get a good job. I am 23 and my life is very sheltered because of his overprotectiveness. 

I know the answer is obvious - to leave him. But I can’t cope with leaving the house and everything I’ve ever known behind. 

I may never get to walk in the home or get to talk to my father again, and it really hurts me. I hate that I have to choose and I did consider staying in the home, but then my safety would be at risk and my mom would be alone out there.

224,"When i was like 15 I went on a trip to another state with a group of kids in highschool, the only kids from my school were boys but there were kids from different schools so only a few of them were even from the same state as me. 

I was awkward on the plane and didn’t properly get to talk to any of the others, but when we arrived and got separated by age and gender to do the planned activities there were only two girls from my state, I ended up riding the bus with one of them and it was a long ride and in my mind we became best friends straight away. 

She was super funny and dorky and when we were bunking we paired up and spent the nights whispering and laughing and making dumbs noises. We hung out the whole trip and promised to add each other on facebook. (I swear we did have each other on my original account but at the same time I can’t remember now. I deleted that account so I couldn’t even go back and check if she was ever on there.)

And what’s even crazier is a few years after the trip, i was rushing to the city for a university excursion at an art gallery thing (super one of time sort of thing) and I BUMPED INTO HER LEGIT BUMPED INTO HER AT THE TRAIN STATION and she was running late for something too! AND WE SCREAMED AND HUGGED AND LAUGHED! And ran our separate ways!!! And i haven’t seen her since.. 

It’s been more than 10 years since the high school trip. I could never remember her last name! And while going through boxes and stuff from my Mums I FOUND IT! a little ripped piece of paper that has the names of both the girls from my state!! Couldn’t find her on facebook so I googled her! And found One Photo, from some like uni / job thing? idk i didn’t dig i was just bummed it wasn’t like a profile i could just message or add? because i feel like going any further than this would be stalkery like if i gotta put in effort that makes it feel stalky 😂 because i didn’t search like crazy for the paper.. 

every once in a blue moon i’d think about trying to add her on social media but i couldn’t find her and then i’d give up and forget or whatever BUT THE PAPER FELL OUT OF MY OLD SKETCHBOOK and the googling led me to the photo and now i feel like i should just quit before it turns into this CRAZY thing where i somehow track her down and she’s like “lol who are you”

228,"About 3 weeks ago my friends made some comments concerning depression and people who are depressed. The things they said really bothered me(one of the things they said was: why can't they just help themselves or ask for help, they're depressed because they don't want help). I think it's incredibly insensitive of them to say so. My friends feel more like a trio to be honest. They have group chats with just the three of them and so on. After a week after this I messaged them again in a group chat and told them that I haven't been texting them because of what they said. They didn't really give me any response and friend 1(just for the sake of differentiating them) said, ""told you /friend 2 name/"" and they just ignored me and moved on to another topic. It's been more than a week now and they haven't tried reaching out to me so I guess our friendship is now over? 

The only interaction I have with them is friend 2 texting me to ask if people in instagram can see if you mute them because she finds Luke (fake name of course) annoying even though he's literally just basically saying hi and asked how she was doing? This Luke guy used to be in our friend group but they dropped him because they found him annoying to be around. I wasn't close to him at all and barely spoke to him when he was friends with them. He told us last year he was going through some mental health issues and they just basically ignored him and friend 1 even refused to watch the video that he made explaining to us what he was going through and how sorry he is. They even dropped this girl who was hanging out with our friend group because she was new last year and had no friends. They basically just pretended she wasn't there at all even when she tried making casual conversations. The girl wasn't rude or anything and was really nice and I really regret not saying anything about it because she ended up leaving us and had no friends for the whole year after that.

After I stopped talking to those friends, I really reflected in our friendship so far. I reached out to Luke and told him how sorry I am that I didn't really do anything for him last year and that I'll be here for him if he needs anything. He said that it felt good to hear that and that he was going through stuff again right now. I figured that's why he messaged friend 2.

All in all for months now I've felt that I was just there while they were a trio. I'm having mixed feelings right now and I need an advice from where to go from here because I feel lost. Should I try harder to communicate with them? Or just let go? They were my first ""friend group"" so that's why it's kinda hard to let go and I only have one friend now.",05Oct2020,1

I met a guy online when I was 14/15 and he was 18/19. We met because of a secret account I had made on Instagram where I talked about my mental health struggles. He also talked about his. Some time passes. He knew my personal account and I hardly use my secret one anymore. My mental health isn’t perfect (and will probably never be) but it’s improved. I’ve moved out of the home where I was being abused, and get a therapist. He’s stopped going to therapy and things aren’t that much better (he claims). He reaches out again and admits he had a small crush on me. I was so excited to say “oh I also had a small crush on you,” that I don’t even realize that he really meant that his 18/19 year old self had feelings for a 15 year old.......

We video chat by watching movies. It seems like every-time either of us are having a bad day the other is there and a movie and a good laugh is all we need. Then one day I say I can watch a movie but can’t talk much because I need to talk and sing tomorrow for work and he ends of sending me a photo of a knife saying he’s going to end it all..... he stops responding. I actually have to find out how to call emergency services for his country (as we live in other countries). (Yes, I know that calling 9-1-1/999 during a mental health crisis is a bad idea but I was panicking and he stopped responding.) I go to bed that night sincerely thinking my friend was dead. The next morning as I’m forcing myself to stop crying and get ready for work he messages me apologizing. He later just jokes it off but I cry from guilt. 

Later on he gets drunk and admits he has feelings but deletes the message right after. I begin to feel like he depends on me. I don’t know if this is actually his mental health or him just wanting to manipulate me or what. At times he was often there for me telling me I was wonderful and amazing and he was jealous of the people who get to spend their time with me when I felt like everyone hated me. Finally one day after him complaining again that my messages “weren’t long enough” when I told him that I was out alone at night and couldn’t respond I snapped and told him that he also needed to be aware about my mental health. 

Whenever I would ask him not to do something he’d pull a “I’m such a piece of trash Ooooh I hate myself.” I don’t know if he really meant it or if he was just being manipulative or both. But this time instead of babying him about it I told him to get some professional help and he got mad at me. The next day I messaged him saying this wasn’t healthy and that I felt like I was being manipulated. I also told him I know he had feelings and that him liking me at 14/15 when he was legally an adult was weird (the age of consent in his country is 17). He never responded but only answered me when I asked if he owned another account that reached out to me. He never unfollowed me, but that pretty much ended our friendship.

So the big question, was this just some mentally unwell dude who knew having a crush on a minor was weird so he didn’t say anything until I got older (which still sounds weird) or was he just grooming me? Or both? And if so was he aware?",05Oct2020,1

We had to disclose the situation to ICU. Here’s where it’s gets tricky, my sister has had and recovered from Covid in the last 90 days (45 to be exact, yes my moms doctors and surgeon were disclosed of this beforehand). Per CDC guidelines, shes not required to quarantine because of antibodies. We called the nurses as soon as we found out of this situation. We have been told we probably can’t see her. Either of us. I wasn’t exposed. My sister also saw my dad the day he was exposed so transmission is unlikely.

I plan to join grad school in Jan 2021 but I'm really confused about a lot of things related to job hunting after MS so I was hoping I'd get some clarity here:

1. I'm interested in Materials Science/Nanotechnology (experimental) research in industry from a career perspective. Do employers in this field generally prefer PhD students over Masters? I've been told both yes and no so I'm not sure what the scenario is.

2. MS Physics or MS Materials Science &amp; Engineering: which one holds more appeal when it comes to job hunting? I realise it depends on what you've actually done and not just the degree name but I have other reasons to choose either of them, it just seems like a big risk to take an education loan with uncertainty about job security.

3. Should I reapply and go for PhD/MS? I've deferred my enrollment as of now, but one Ivy League school I'm planning to attend provides zero financial aid to MS students. My profile has improved a bit in the past months (I've got a couple journal publications) but again, it seems like such a tiring process to apply/wait for decisions again and I'm really anxious about wasting a whole year but it should be worth it if I get better offers.

241,"So basically I got involved in an argument between 3 people (originally) about two months ago. I honestly shouldn’t have been involved, because I wasn’t there to hear it myself. Taking sides didn’t 100% sit right with me but even then I did not reach out to the person in question, I took the opposite side of till a few weeks ago. Turns out they still see me as their friend, the “falling out” didn’t mean that we would stop being friends, and they were just waiting on standby for me to call. And honestly that took me off guard...because it was almost 2 months. I even prepared myself for anything bad. I said we’d discuss it and we did although I’d have to cut it short a few times because I can’t really call them about something serious or that potentially lead to another heated argument without having an outside source possibly listen in (family, I’m a teenager lol). But besides the short calls I managed to get in stuff I wanted to say or at least tell them that I’d like to discuss the big argument, along with personal issues we have or had with each other because those definitely played into the problems we had. They agreed that we can fix this, the relationship I’m assuming. I called 1-2 times but again— the cut off, though they were still willing to hear another time I’m assuming because they picked up. It’s been more than a week or so, I messaged them instead of calling. It was a really long message and apology about my involvement. And I also added the main issue I had with them because like I said I think it would explain some of the outrage (applying past issues to new issues, or it’s kind of established to yourself that you already have some kind of grudge against someone). Yeahhhh and they didn’t reply, (this is on discord, because of course it is). It hasn’t been a day but I know for a fact that they always reply or are kind of early to read stuff or acknowledge or anything. 

Let’s say they don’t reply, what do I say?? I genuinely don’t know. I’ve been friends with this person for a while now and I’ve known them for so long. I don’t really know if they’ve changed their mind about the “we’re still friends” thing. Damn I must really need to repent if they didn’t mean it",05Oct2020,1

243,"Really need some advice on this one.

I recently went on a trip with my friend and her family. Got my period halfway through, no worries because I brought my stuff just in case. I remember having on the last day when travelling home. After unpacking my stuff, couldn’t find my period bag anywhere and I am super worried I’ve lost it or left it in the car on the way home. What’s even worse is that there is a used tampon (wrapped up obviously) in there since there was no where for me to throw it out. If someone finds that bag, they are in for a nasty surprise. Anyways I am super worried and I don’t really know what to do. 

Advice anyone?",05Oct2020,1
244,"So I have a Samsung note 10, and I keep getting a notification saying that my phone temperature is too low and that charging will resume when the phones temperature returns to normal. A couple days ago I accidentally refrigerated my phone for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. My phones been at room temperature since then and the notification telling me that my phone's temperature is too low popped up way after, but the notification just won't go away. So I can't charge my phone at all. I tried different wall outlets, different cables, wireless charging, different bricks, I even tried factory resetting but the lowest I'm allowed to do that is 10% battery. I really need help finding a way to fix my phone since I most definitely don't want to go out during this pandemic and there were no results on Google.

249,"I (16m) have not one fucking clue what direction I need to put my life in. I have a job currently, and as much as I enjoy this job, I feel as if the pay isn't enough somehow. I currently wash dishes at a pub, and do a ton of prep work on the side. I'm not capable of working any more than 35 hours a week, but I feel like I need to be making more. I have absolutely no idea where I'm supposed to go and it terrifies me. I have this sudden urgency to get my ass away from the confines of having a childhood. I want to live freely on my own, but i have no idea how to prepare for that. nobody ever taught me anything about living under your own care. not my parents, certainly not any of my teachers. I know absolutely nothing about how to lead my life, or even what direction to look at. I'm looking to get my permit soon, and even a car, but the amount of limiting factors there are prevent me from buying a car in the first place. for the last 4-5 months my entire life has been waking up at 2:30 in the afternoon, going to work, coming home at 9:30, and fucking sleeping again. I'm probably going to go insane without having something to work towards. and as of recent, school has been limiting my sleeping hours, and ruining my days off too. all I have room for on my days off now is gaming with my friends, but I've been doing that exact same thing with them for about 7 years. my hobby of building computers is also a little too expensive to be something I can do every day, and I feel as if I switch things up and start making progress in life, I can distract myself from the same inevitable loop of dealing with the same old horseshit day by day. there isn't one day of my week where I don't have 6+ hours of work and a shitload of other responsibilities that I have to deal with, and it doesn't feel right not having any of the gratitude that comes with all of my efforts. the only gratitude I get is watching a damn number go up in my savings account.

which again begs the question. where do I go? do I just stay put and keep watching the same loop happen over and over again? am I even supposed to be making strides in my life right now? I do rather enjoy cooking, and I wouldn't mind pursuing a career in the culinary field, but I feel like before I do anything I need to secure myself a proper place to live. and to do that I feel like I need to know how to do a million other things. I seriously can't stand just doing the same thing over and over again without any of the satisfaction that comes with it, so please. can anyone point me in the right direction?",05Oct2020,1
250,"Short story.

My biological mother has been abusing me in many ways since I was little, up until I finally cut her out of my life when I was newly 19.

Only problem is, from age 16 to 18 1/2, she made me go into debt with her. She kept track of everything, clothing, car, insurance, a 10$ meal. Everything.  And i had to pay every little penny back. At Christmas 2019, she ""cleared"" my debt to her as a gift. She even gave me the log. So out of curiosity I added it up, and in the 2 1/2 years, I payed her $5,410.86  as a minor... (into adult hood but she told me even at 18 I'm not an adult and can't make my own choices)

Is there anything I can do to somehow get this money back, or is she just going to get away with taking 5 grand from me...",05Oct2020,1
251,"this girl and i have been close for about two years. i met her my freshman year and she was one of the funniest, sweetest, and prettiest people ive ever met. ive always thought of her as a really close friend, i knew i had some sort of attachment towards her, but thought it was friendly. she would show a lot of affection towards me but i thought she was straight, so never thought much of it. (i also thought i was straight lol).

fast forward two years, quarantine happens. beginning of it, we start texting a lot, get really close. one night she tells me shes bi. felt like my entire world turned upside down. didn’t know why i felt like something suddenly changed inside of me, but i knew it felt off. we start getting closer and closer over quarantine, she flirts, tells me im on her mind, even says she wishes i was gay. i finally realize that maybe i do have an itty bitty crush on her, so i talk to a friend about liking girls. fast forward a little more, i come out as bi. to a couple close friends, nothing too much, just not ready for it. a couple close friends, including her as one of them. everything seems to be going good, she starts flirting more, tells me she looks for my name when she wakes up in the morning, continues to say she can’t stop thinking about me and i also just can’t stop thinking about her. im happy. school starts (online school), she still reciprocates it, then everything starts feeling off in august. 

i also feel i should include that i changed schools, so i won‘t be able to see her as much anymore (i used to see her at school everyday). 

now, it’s october. it’s been a month and a half since she started acting weird. she leaves me on delivered, something she used to apologize for (its not something that needs an apology, but it just feels off that she doesn’t do it anymore), she barely texts me, she kind of acts like none of the things over quarantine happened, none of the things she said were real. it really sucks because i got really attached. ): i feel like im head over heels and i can’t stop thinking about her. i know that crushes come and go, and if she liked me at all, she probably doesn’t anymore. i know, it could be due to the fact that i changed schools but, in my defense, we do have the same friend group, we would still see eachother ever so often. and even before all the flirting, we were really close friends. i don’t like how im being treated as a friend. plus, how can you turn off feelings so fast? how can you go from telling someone you can’t stop thinking about them to barely giving them two seconds of your day? i know it’s possible, but it just doesn’t happen in two seconds. and yes, it literally happened just like that. one night were flirting and telling each other how much we mean to each other, and then she doesn’t talk to me for the next week. it’s so on and off, im sick of it. some of the things she told me were so genuine, felt so genuine, i just don’t know what to do. regardless of the fact that even if she doesn’t like me, i feel like im losing a friend, and it’s also the changing schools panic that im leaving behind the friends that ive known my entire life.

ive never been the type of person to feel like im drifting from someone if i don’t talk to them everyday. but when im attached, i do in fact overthink a lot. it’s definitely the insecurities in me, but i feel like ive never felt this way about someone before. and ive definitely had my fair share of simping for a sixteen year old. it’s also the first girl ive realized that i have a crush on her. i do think back to the girls that i probably had a crush on, just didn’t know it back then. but this one, this one i know i like. so it feels more genuine than the rest. 

she’s still one of my closest friends, i want to be there for her. i just want to turn these feelings off, and stop dwelling on what we used to be. its definitely clear that she doesn’t feel this way about me anymore, i just don’t know how to make it better for me. 

her birthday is soon, im going to be seeing her. i planned on painting her something, in attempt to remind her that i still love her very much as a friend. but i feel like its eating me to do so. it’s like trying to get her off my mind while fueling it, if that makes sense. 

should i just do something simple? should i give her the painting in attempt to, i guess, reignite the flame? it’s possible that she just needs a reminder of how good we can be together, because i haven’t seen her in a while and this will be the first time since quarantine. please, if you read this far, any advice would help. i want to get over it, but i can’t help but think about what we’d be like together.",05Oct2020,1
252,"So yesterday, my mother and father went to visit their friend that lives like 2 hours away from our house. Later that night, my sister used this gps map that shows the location of every family member. She then saw that my mom and dad were at a casino. Knowing that casinos recycle air and that there is a pandemic going on, my sister got mad. Especially since my parents are pretty old and both have cases of diabetes. 

My sister works with children, so she didn’t want to stay here at the house and get caught with COVID if my parents had it. So she decided to stay at my other sister’s home for the night. She tried calling my parents multiple times but they didn’t answer. Finally, she decided to send a text message to my mom saying she was staying at my sister’s house and that she was setting up an appointment for my parents to get tested.

Somehow my mother took offense to this and sent a reply to my sister to stay at my sister’s house forever and that she hopes she dies from COVID. She then sent my other sister (the one with the house) a message saying to take care of us and that she doesn’t want to see her. It was written as if she was going to die or something. 

Today, my mom has been in bed the whole day and she’s been ignoring the whole family. It also seems like she’s been drinking beer as well. She’s 57 years old and is acting like a teenager. All because my sister wanted her to get tested and I worry about her. At this point, any advice or thoughts on the situation could help. Thanks!",05Oct2020,1

I had an external harddrive with all my daughters baby pictures and videos.
Somehow it stopped working and I thought I lost everything on that harddrive. 

I brought it to someone I found on internet and he could get everything off the harddrive and transfer it to another harddrive. So fortunately I still have all the pictures and videos. But the videos lost all the sound. They are completely mute now.
The old harddrive is already gone. Is there any way to get the sound back?

255,"So my best friend had been in a toxic relationship for awhile now. A few months ago her ex broke up with her and they ended up getting back together a couple months down the road. Then I guess the other day her ex ended up calling the cops saying my friend was threatening her with an AR15. My bestfriend has a pistol and I have an AR15. The only person that has an AR15 is me and the ex knows this as she’s shot my gun before. Now I don’t understand why her ex said it was an AR15 when my friend has a pistol. But my best friend never even threatened her like that with an AR15 and I know this because I wouldn’t just lend out my gun to anyone even my best friend  and she doesn’t own a firearm of that sort. Also my grandparents have had it locked up for a couple months now because I gave it to them to store it for me.

262,"For the past few years of my life, I have been noticing this certain type of atmosphere that almost seems to follow me around, as if I am meant to be apart of it or embrace it. It is this feeling of dark loneliness, but it does not feel bad. It is almost like a rainy night that is there for a reason.

To explain it better I will paint a scene for you.

It’s dark outside, around 2 am. You’re somewhere in Japan in the middle of a city, but not much is happening around you since it’s late. Rain is falling but its neither heavy nor light, just a somber pour. You’re on the fourth floor of some hotel and you’re standing on the balcony of your room. Across the narrow alley below is another tall building. On the side of that building is a bright neon pink light that shines a faint pink glow into your otherwise dark apartment.

I have felt this multiple times, as it can be triggered by various things such as music, phrases, pictures, or other things. This is by no means a bad thing, I want to embrace this mood as a part of myself rather than escape it, but I can’t help but feel like I need to name it before I can do that. If anyone knows what this is please let me know.",05Oct2020,1
263,"Long story short I fucked in my Sophomore year. In my public school, most people used racist derogatory terms because that was the culture in our school. One word that was often used among everyone was the n-word. And as ashamed as I am, I did use this word at times during these years, and I understand how hurtful my actions may have been to people. 

As a person of pacific-islander descent, I had thought at the time it was perfectly alright to say it because everyone that was of color (and even white students) in my school said it. I finally understood the severity of this word in the summer from Sophomore to Junior year when I started picking up articles to read about the perspectives of others that face these terms daily. I realized that I was contributing to racism and I no doubt felt great shame.

Fast forward to senior year. I'm currently taking Chicano Studies (an ethnic studies course) in order to redeem myself in these actions from the past, and of course, I stopped using these terms and eliminated them from my vocabulary. The problem now is I got into an argument with an old friend that, like me, had used the n-word (except he never changed) and now he is threatening to report me to my future colleges. He has video recording (only the sound because on discord, no face) of me saying the N-word about 20 months ago, and he swears that as soon as he learns about what college I got into, he will send the video their way. 

Although I realize my actions should be reprimanded, I never understood the context of the n-word because I am a first-generation immigrant with parents that are pretty racist (in my own opinion). They always spoke negatively of the other races and so I have never been taught by anyone what racism really meant. Even in my school life, everyone used the n-word, which made me think it was commonplace. 

Now I want to know how I should approach this issue because I truly believe I have grown from my past self and now understand these problems. I'm not sure how I can deal with this except for not telling him about the schools that I will apply to and get into, but he said that if I don't tell him what school I was accepted into he would either post these audio clips of me to the media so that the schools will hear about it that way, or he would report me to our high school and get me suspended.

I even considered reporting him if he was going to report me because he very recently used these words, but that's truly an option that I don't want to exploit. If anyone can help I would be very grateful.",05Oct2020,1

ok so ive (13F) been best friends with this girl (13F) since grade 1 and in grade 3 she introduced me this guy (14M) whos her other friend we all became best friends immediately, now were in grade 9.

when me and this guy met in grade 3 we had liked eachother but like we were 8 or 9 so we kinda were just akward. we ‘dated’ for abt a month but then i broke up with him deciding to better off be friends. throughout the years ive probably thought of him differently a few times but just small crushes and they went away. but recently since like idk april i started to like him again. at first i thought it would be like my other ‘crushes’ on him and just go away after i reminded myself how dumb i was being. but it didnt. and then he got a girlfriend (14F) shes really nice and i honestly really like her as a friend we hv hung out a bunch of times and she has absolutely no clue im in love with her boyfriend they hv been dating for abt 2 months. my best friend (the one i met in grade 1) also has no clue. ive never been in love before obviously im 13. i dont even know if i am in love but just when im with him i feel way better. i have a bit of depression and self confidence issues and just idk when im with him all of that goes away. i know people say ur in love when u make up little scenarios of the two of u before u go to bed- yeah i do that. i also just spent the past 30 minutes crying abt him...

i have no clue what to do. i miss him but i dont know in what way. should i tell him? im scared that his girlfriend will hate me which i see why she would. 

when we were younger we were always asked by SO many people at school if we were dating and us being children thought it was so gross and we would never date again.. to this day we always joke abt us ‘dating’ when we were 9 and now i feel since we are older it would be different because were growing up. were still young obviously im not expecting this to be something that could last forever im old enough to know how that works. but even if its just for a little bit i wanna be happy with him.

and im also scared if we theoretically did start dating his gf would never talk to me again and our best friend would feel kinda left out and the 3rd wheel constantly. and i really dont wanna do that to her because shes my best friend in the world. the 3 of us are literally so close we have been through so much together were pretty much inseparable. seriously everyone calls us the 3 musketeers. i love them both so much and i dont wanna ruin our little group there like the only real best friends i have that have been with me since i was little. and i especially dont wanna ruin my friendship with the guy. if i tell him im scared ill get rejected and he wont feel the same and never look at me the same.

268,"Some context of what happened in my life up until now: Parents got divorced when I was 4. I lived with my mom and my older brother. My dad went back to live with his mom. My parents let the house go into foreclosure, my mom got cancer and my brother and I moved in with my grandma and my dad when I was 14. My grandparents owned a restaurant which was in debt and the house was for collateral if they were unable to meet payments. Lost the house when I was 15. My mom beat the cancer and even tho her and my dad were divorced, my parents brother and I moved into a house separated into two apartments and we rented the first floor. My grandma moved in with her sister. I’m about 16 when living there and started smoking weed regularly. My parents are unable to coexist and my mom moves about hour away. My older brother is also heavily into steroid abuse during this time. He had a couple very scary psychiatric episodes here, talking to dead people, angels and demons, and goes to a psych ward for 2 months. Mind you I’m in high school, basically truant but never had any repercussions. My brother comes out but goes back very shortly after for going back into psychosis. Goes away for 3 months. In the middle of all of this I began stealing my dads Xanax and also found an oz of weed my brother had and sold a lot of it. My brother comes out and went to stay at my moms and she took care of him. My dad and I move again because the rent was too high by himself and we move in with his friend he worked with. In the midst of this, we also lived in a flood area and hurricane Irene drowned his car and my car (my mom got be a $4000 Honda Accord when I turned 17). My dads was salvageable , mine wasn’t. The new place we moved too was 30 min from my high school and I had no car and my dad went to work hours before school started. For my senior year I lived with my old neighbor and we went to and from school together. My dad got arrested for a dui before the school year started and in the middle of the school year he was convicted and no longer able to drive. He let me drive his car and I got a job working in cell phone retail. This is where I was introduced to Percocet, 30 mg oxycodone and cocaine. I didn’t graduate high school on time and had to take night classes to get my high school diploma for a year. At this point I’m 18, smoking and selling weed, and taking 2 mg Xanax bars along with 30 mg Oxys.


The craziness in my family only escalated. I was shooting heroin by 22 and arrested multiple times. Went to rehab twice. The second time, a heroin overdose is what got me there and I was serious about getting sober and making something of myself despite all the odds and external factors working against me. I went and lived in a sober house for 18 months. After being there a year I enrolled in community college. But at the end of my time the sober house , I relapsed and had to move out. During my time in community college , I found psychedelics. LSD , MDMA, MDA, DMT, and ketamine. But I ended up going back to heroin and got arrested again when copping in the hood, I was 25 and was beginning my 2nd year of community college. I stopped with the heroin and focused on school on my own for a while. In my last semester of community college I shot up every single day, multiple times a day for 3 months straight. I graduated with a business administration associate degree, a 3.9 gpa and was accepted to my state’s flagship university. My landlord found a needle a week before I left and reached out to a friend of mine he knew and told him. He told my family and I stopped using when I transferred. My plan when transferring was to try computer science. I had a very difficult time this first semester and severely depressed from withdrawal. I passed my classes and got a D in my intro to computer science course. Next semester I repeat it and pass my other math prerequisite courses for computer science. In this semester, Fall 2019, I dropped a lot of acid and rolled a lot of MDA and MDMA. Somehow managed to cheat my through and barely pass my classes. Spring 2019 I began taking very difficult computer science classes , had no clue what was going on in any of them, had a nervous breakdown and withdrew from 3 out of my 4 classes. My advisor told me to switch to an IT degree which isn’t as competitive and difficult and the usual route for ppl who found computer science too difficult. I continued to do acid and started snorting heroin again, didn’t go to the needle though. Ended up kicking the habit on my own, stopped with the psychedelics and got myself down to just smoking weed.

My current circumstances: I’m have about 12k in credit card debt, about 50k in student debt, I’m I’m about the finish my 2nd year at the university. I’m on track for an IT degree that I’m very unenthusiastic about and severely depressed. Life has been hard, and I’ve had some happy moments through it all. I have experienced love at one time and I earned 40k in one year at the cell phone retailer so I did go on some vacations and had some nice things. But overall it‘s been really tough for me to find reason to keep going. Please don’t tell me there’s a light at the end of the tunnel blah blah blah because I’m about to be 27 and you there has been nonstop toxicity whether self inflicted or not. But I’m curious to see what a complete stranger would say to maybe give me some hope.

269,"my second cousin's son (call him U) is my age and we've played together throughout our childhood staying in the same city. 5 years back (I'm 19) his family moves out of the city so we went to see them. i saw U after so long and i was so happy. he took me to his room to show his books and opened the biology book and skipped to the biology chapter and started showing me diagrams of the male and female reproductive system and started to look at me a different way which made me very uncomfortable. tbh back then i didn't know how to feel. skip to the same night we slept besides each other and this guy U had the audacity to start touching me late at midnight. he slid his hand in the blanket and started touching my breasts. i suddenly woke up but I don't why I didn't react. i felt like crying and I'd never felt that disgusted. it was all so new for me i didn't know what to do. i acted like i tossed and turned in sleep so he could take his hands off me. i tried to avoid him for the rest of my stay there and slept besides my mom. fast forward to 2 years he was back in town and we joined the same classes. we used to travel in the same bus. he started touching me again. he used to put his arm around my shoulder and ""accidentaly"" slide his hands inside my shirt. idk why i never had the guts to stop him but i would try my best to avoid him. he's tried to take advantage of me so many timesi felt so disgusted i couldn't tell this to anyone because our family relations were good. i completely avoided him after that. and stopped seeing me. i thought of putting this in the past thinking maybe he wouldn't think of me like that again. he started telling me about his gf. i would tell a few things about my life. he knows about my current boyfriend but my relationship was in a rough patch so i thought of talking to to him for advice. excellent advice he gave me I'll accept. but later on he started suggesting phone sex with him as a distraction. i was man ftw, i really thought he would be different now. i honestly just wanted to slap him at that moment. i texted him goodnight and told him he made me uncomfortable and didn't reply to his texts. what should i do next? it is very difficult for me to tell my parents about that they would ask me why i was still talking to him. that guy could use all the information he has against me if i do anything. should i tell me boyfriend? does anybody else have the same experience?",05Oct2020,1
270,"Hi y’all 
You know how they say you find love when you least expect It. Well I feel like that happened to me, i had just gotten out of a 3 year relationship, and I wanted to focus on my education in college. I had just transferred from community college to a cal state anyways I thought okay game on its me time, I am going to study my butt off, do well, get fit, make new friends basically start a new life. I even made a rule of no boys (I would stop looking for a bf) and that’s when I met him. A guy who I found attractive, and was the sweetest, most patient man I ever met. I honestly couldn’t believe that he existed, I felt like I was dreaming and would wake up, he liked me back and frequently made me turn red. Anyways he had just gotten out of a 4 year relationship so I felt like I was his rebound but he treated me so kindly and never rushed me or anything. I think neither of us were truly over our ex’s but at the time I couldn’t care less because he made my days better. I was happy before he came along and happier with him at my side. Then covid hit, we no longer saw each other things became complicated, our sparks began to die out nothing was the same after not being able to see each other. My phone broke, several things occurs which made it seem like the universe just kept pulling us farther apart. Anyway it’s been months he made it clear that we wouldn’t work out and I can respect that. But I still think about him all the time. I keep myself busy with hobbies books school, but at the end of the day he is on my mind. How do I let go of this guy I will never see again? Should I let go? Is the answer just time...",05Oct2020,1
271,"to give more context I (F) had a recent break up with my ex (M) around 4 weeks ago, he wanted to continue to be friends and he seemed to be over it almost instantly texting me throughout the day of the breakup (we tried to start over as friends) I then asked to be given space because I needed time. he gave me time and I was over him (romantically) in 3 days (I know it's a short amount of time but my immense phobia of abandonment always prepares me for people to leave at any point)

I texted him said I was all good and we could get back to the usual (we commonly play competitive games with each other) we fought the day after we first called again (mainly everything was pissing me off and that was on me and I apologized profusely for anything I said in my haze and same with him, we came to an agreement) and i thought thatd be the end

over the next 3 and a half weeks Iwas the kindest I could be as a way to make up for anything I said, never slipped up again, and always giving encouraging words and being my usual bright self that I was before all was normal but slowly in those 3 and a half weeks he slowly became more and more mean towards me even when I was doing nothing what so ever. and before I had ignored him he had body shamed me on something he knew I was insecure about, which I wasnt cool with at all

soon i became fed up with his behavior and (and yes i know this fixes nothing but my mental state couldnt take it any longer) I straight ghosted him out of no where he texted me everyday (and since it was on a platform that doesnt show if someones read the texts or not he didnt even know if I was seeing them) I turned off any notifications for him weather dm server groupchat, I muted them all and took a break from everything screens mostly in general

over the next 5 days I received texts kinda like these (arent the real texts just examples) (day 1) ""hey we are going to hop on at 3"" (day 2 received nothing) (day 3) ""yo (2 other people we play with) and I will be on today"" (later in say 3) ""yo you good? you seemed chill on Thursday but you never responded Friday. I left you alone yesterday and I was at someones house so I thought I'd give you a day or 2."" (day 4) ""we are going to play (insert co-op game) later you down?"" (midday of day 4) ""I feel like you're kinda ignoring me but are you down to play something in a bit?"" (someone from the group we play with texts me most likely by par request of my ex and I reaspond because they arent part of the problem) ""damn you texted (insert friend), ouch"" (later in day 4 hes playing with one of my friends that is also his friend and I showed up in their game and they acted like his computer was glitching when it said I left (I owe them for that one)) ""are you like a ninja or something? (sends screenshot of it saying I left the game) (insert friend) didnt even see you"" (day 5) (on thsi day they sent me an elaborate paragraph of his day and how he is doing and what hes doing, mind you he hasn't done this since we've been together early/midway through our relationship) (later in day 5) ""dis something happen? do we need to talk about something? what's up with you recently? are you ok?"" (this is when I replied by reaquest of my family who says he was very controlling and I needed to gain the control over me back (and they arent entirely wrong he did control thing I did)) we talk he says he was worried thought I was injured or something serious happened and asks why I said nothing and I said it was off of a vibe (wasnt really at all) and stated I was busy like yea really really busy and I'm not at all but I didn't know what else I could've done and I feel an urge to run back on that but I feel like maybe, it will just be better this way and maybe I just need to let go despite my urges and temptation I'm not sure who or what to trust I'm torn about everything and my mind cant seem to set it straight and I have no one to go and talk it through and maybe get some advice so I'm here instead hoping to get some advice on the situation hes leaving for 2 weeks soon and I'm busy up until that time as far as he knows and after those 2 weeksbim not sure if it should remain that way or not.",05Oct2020,1

276,"Hey,

I’m a single mom to a 4.5 month old baby. Well, his dad helps occasionally, but I live alone with my son. 

I really need work that is flexible but will allow me to cover my bills. I know a few people who work at Amazon, and they have various shifts. My son’s dad has agreed to watch him if I needed to work a few nights. 

I’m thinking like a 4pm - midnight, 3-4 nights a week? This way I can be home with my baby all day, and raise him, and his dad can take over at 3pm when he gets off of work.

What are your thoughts on working in an Amazon warehouse during a pandemic? I’d wear a mask, face shield, and gloves. Shower before holding my baby or getting in bed. 

I have a degree in Education, and I am an experienced teacher. Unfortunately, I’ve had really bad luck with Zoom while having baby at home with me. He’s very vocal now lol. I know there might be other work I can do, but we need money fast :(  Open to any suggestions though.",05Oct2020,1

278,"I feel really bad because I just borderline screamed at my younger sister to shut up, but I'm exhausted and out of methods to get her to be quiet. 

For years now my sister has stayed up till early morning, and constantly keeps me up with very loud noises. She'll be on the phone, or watching something, singing, basically just being at full volume. Even during the day, this behavior would be obnoxiously loud. Fixing her sleep schedule isn't reasonable anymore-- we've already tried everything, and honestly, we risk ruining the fragile relationship we have with her if we try to help her anymore. We're just hoping she grows out of it eventually. Her and I actually get along pretty well, so I feel particularly bad that I just yelled at her. But I can't take it anymore. Even wearing heavy duty earplugs, she's still ridiculously loud, and wakes me up multiple times. I've tried ignoring her, asking her nicely, trying to bribe her, simply informing her how she's affecting me, pleading, even petty payback by waking her up the same way she's woken me. Zero change. Even now as I'm typing this she's singing again. 

I just want to get to sleep in my own house. I have run out of energy to keep asking. I'm the only one who could do anything about this because I have the best relationship with her. Any ideas on how to get her to stop waking me up?

287,"I've always been a pretty nice person, I think. When I was young and immature, I was definitely selfish before I grew out of it, but I can't ever remember doing anything for the purpose of harming someone or making them feel bad. That was just an emotion I could not relate to. The worst I got, when I went through a selfish phase, was that I might not care about someone's emotions if I could avoid seeing them, but there was never a time when I actively wanted to do harm to anyone.  


I won't go into too much detail, but I found out recently that someone (I believe it is my ex, although I'm still in the process of finding out for certain, but it would certainly involve a lot of coincidences if it WASN'T him), has been impersonating me online, sharing personal info (like addresses) of me and my loved ones, and soliciting sexual favors) one of the accounts that was doing this made a post on Reddit expressing an explicit interest in ""ruining someone's life.""  That someone, from the post, was quite clearly me, and it talked about wanting to ruin my life, get me and my loved ones fired from our jobs and make us unemployable.  


Just to be clear: I'm safe. When I confronted the ex about it this he denied it but then this mysteriously stopped. We got the cops involved and lawyered up and amped up security in our home so the legal/physical safety side is taken care of.  


What I'm struggling with is the fact that since that happened, I have this vivid, graphic fantasies of torturing him in the worst and most violent ways possible. I've never had fantasies like this before and I didn't think I was capable of them. Turns out I was wrong. That module was present in my brain but just not activated until now. For some reason I just don't know how to process the fact that this person (or anyone)  wants to harm me (or anyone) simply for the sake of harming me, and I just really want to make him suffer terribly and for a very long time.  


I am of course never going to act on these fantasies, but there's something that kinda sucks about realizing that your own self is capable of this kind of hatred. Anybody else experienced this?

288,"Basically I went to my friends place Saturday night as it was her birthday, her neighbour came over for some drinks as they’re all friends. As the we were getting ready to leave the neighbour tried to hug me, I declined as covid aside I am not comfortable with human contact (I have severe obsessive compulsive disorder and being touched is a stressful situation for me) she grabbed me anyway as she thought it was funny, then for absolutely no F’ing reason she licked my face which sent me into meltdown, I told her to F off and my wife told her off to, but just as she moved away she licked the other side of my face again.

Now, obviously I didn’t react well I managed to ignore the voices screaming to hit her and got myself away from everyone into the house but with my condition rational thought goes out the window and I felt like I was unclean, which resulted in me scrubbing and scratching at my face until the area was red and sore with a couple of scrape marks now on my skin, I then hid in my friends office to calm down because I couldn’t stop shaking. 

My friend and wife found me there and are both aware or the situation and were super understanding but obviously it’s extremely embarrassing for me to be seen in such a vunerable state so I then left.

Here’s the thing, obviously I’m still mad about it, I’m mad that it happened, I’m mad she thought it was funny, I’m mad that I embarrassed myself in front of people, I’m mad that I created a drama on my friends birthday and I’m mad that I’m walking around with scrape marks on my face.

My best friend of six years decided about a week in that she already wanted to sub-lease because she didn't like how we did things (I could go into a whole bunch of detail about this but it really all comes down to the fact that we didn't want her boyfriend practically living with us and when we made this clear to her, she wanted to move out).  Anyways, it's been a few weeks and I hadn't seen her a ton because she was living at home while trying to find a sub-lease.

Cut to now and she finally found a sub-lease and she moved out all of her stuff two days ago.  The night she got all her stuff out I went to text her something and I noticed she stopped sharing her location with me on find friends which I found a little weird cause idk we've had each other's locations for a long time and it's just weird to go in and remove people randomly so I sent her a simple text saying ""are we okay?""  She didn't answer for over a day but when she did it was basically a paragraph telling me that she thinks we're on really different paths right now and that we have different friend groups (we always have so I don't see how this is suddenly an issue) and she doesn't see our friendship continuing like it has.  I'm so heart-broken.  I feel bad cause I didn't answer but like what the fuck am I supposed to say to that?

It sucks even more because she's been so self-absorbed recently and she only hangouts with her boyfriend and she's been trying really hard on social media (I think she's trying to be some sort of influencer which is fine but not when it's making you act completely different) and I just feel like if she wasn't dating him then maybe this all wouldn't be happening.

Growing up I was allowed next to no time to socialize with my peers outside of school, and I moved frequently on top of that, so losing friends became a part of life for me. My parents were often cold and cruel on top of that, hurting me physically and with their words for the crime of existing as I am.

I was friendly with my classmates, and talked with them outside of school as well, but after middle school ended, many of us went to different schools, and I lost touch with them not long after. When I reached high school I felt so disillusioned with life that I felt if more of this was all I had to look forward to, then I would rather have no part of it. And so began the most self-destructive part of my life.

Despite my reservations, I knew that what I was feeling wasn’t healthy, and I wanted help. I knew I couldn’t rely on my few remaining friends since we were friends mostly nominally, and I couldn’t rely on my parents either. If it still isn’t clear why I couldn’t rely on my parents, they couldn’t have cared less about my mental health, and as far as they were concerned, there was no such thing. 

I initially tried reaching out at school, to my guidance counselor. I was performing poorly in a subject my first semester, and she requested a meeting with me, which I thought would be the perfect time. Due to fear of the school reaching out to my parents if I admitted anything directly, I decided to “cry out for help” using doublespeak and body language. I know this may make it seem like it’s my own fault, but I sincerely hoped she would understand that SOMETHING was wrong and ask more about it, at which point I would’ve elaborated. Unfortunately, she reacted in the worst way possible, in a way I never expected. She essentially laughed at me and looked at me like I was some miserable creature unfit to live, and this attitude would continue through all of my dealings with her until I ended up transferring schools.

Before I transferred schools, found someone else at my school who I could talk to. They acquired a therapist to work in the building in my sophomore year, and I started talking to her after I found out about her in my junior year. She soon had me hospitalized for suicidal ideation and I spent almost one month there. I was scared at first, but it really did help, and I felt so good by the time I was released. Sadly, it didn’t last. Despite ongoing outpatient therapy and varying medications for a little over 6 months, I spiraled down into a hell I never even imagined before my hospitalization. I genuinely believed it would’ve been better to have died than suffer like that, but I could barely pull myself out of bed most mornings.

As for what triggered it? Returning to my old life. I still felt good on the first day back. My parents pretended to be nice to me, but my mom snapped back to her usual self almost immediately, yelling at me and cursing at me, asking what the hell was wrong with me and calling me selfish and useless, as she always has. I then realized that my actual life would never match the fantasy I was shown in that hospital. I soon started cutting all of my classes at school, instead taking a nap in a quiet corner of the school. Eventually I stopped going all together. I had no friends who would go out of their way for me there, as up to then, I preferred crying in a corner feeling sorry for myself over socializing. My parents did not take this well as you can imagine, but I won’t get into that. 

I don’t know what triggered it exactly, but the following summer, I decided that I would start working hard for my future, not to be happy, but so that I can be free of my parents like I’d always wanted, and so that I can suffer alone in comfort, rather homelessness. After all, money doesn’t solve all your problems, but it’s better to cry in a Mercedes than in a cardboard box on the street. Any similar shitty quote works too. I got into a decent college not long after, majoring in engineering, mostly off of my SAT scores, but my grades my senior year were the highest they ever were. I managed to get lucky and nailed enough scholarships to get myself a mostly free ride. If I hadn’t managed that, I would genuinely rather have killed myself than bother taking on that much debt, in fact I had planned to if I couldn’t manage a workaround.

Despite their flaws, my parents have been rather supportive of me in college. I don’t mean that they’ve changed their ways, but they are supporting me financially. As far as their attitudes go, instead of trying to change them, I’ve finally settled for manipulating them to serve my interests. I’ve realized that they will never be the parents I needed, certainly not ones I wanted, but I only have to suffer them a little longer, then I can cut them off when I no longer need them. If you think this makes me as bad as them, it may, but in a different way, and I probably will end up maintaining some kind of relationship with them anyway.

Right now, I’m in my second year of college, and I’m doing well academically, and fine with my extracurriculars, but more and more I’m struggling to get myself to be productive. More and more, i’m sleeping in and sleeping late, and spend hours everyday binge watching anime (which I love, and is one of the few good things in my life, the others being sleep and music, mainly).

Despite everything, I still only work hard because I want a relatively comfortable life, working a decent job until I die. I’ve pretty much given up on friendships and dating at this point, and all I want is a quite life where I can be healthy, comfortable, and do the things I enjoy (like watch anime) outside of work. A part of me still wants to die and in my mind I don’t see myself living past my late 20s-early 30s and have no desire to. But I’m ok with that. I tried counseling services at school before COVID, but it wasn’t doing much for me. I can’t afford any other kind of care right now, but I doubt it’ll help anyway tbh.

Sorry if it seems a little incoherent or if the majority of this post seems unnecessary, I just wanted to give a little context to make it a little more clear how I got here. What do you think?",05Oct2020,1
297,"So backstory is my oldest sister has been married to him since last November but has been with him for 5 years now and they’ve had a very good relationship and argue here and there but nothing out of the ordinary. 

Now, the thing is, my brother in law and I always gotten along very well. He’s like the older brother I never had because I only have two older sisters and it’s nice to have male sibling in the mix now. He’s well educated just like my sister and they both have masters degrees and he always gives me good advice on how to make through college and finding good careers and stuff. He even gives me good advice just about anything and he’s very protective of me, especially when it comes to me dating boys and such. Everyone knows he prefers me slightly more than my middle sister. (Sounds like a typical older brother right?)

So last year in October, he came to visit me in Las Vegas because I was in school and there was this cool family brunch thing and my mom was visiting as well. Unfortunately, my sisters didn’t make it because they were at my sister’s bachelorette party in fact. So later in the day, the plan was to walk the Vegas strip with him and my mom, but mom was being a downer and didn’t want to go walk lol. So, he and I decided to go. However, I was wearing some almost booty shorts, but I wasn’t thinking of anything because I wasn’t trying to do anything to him. Plus it was hot that night. However later on, I did feel bad that I wore those kind of shorts in front of him because from other people’s perspective, it could have looked wrong. Plus all the workers at the restaurants thought we were dating... which made me uncomfortable a little bit, but luckily he didn’t think of it anything wrong.

Fast forwarding: this past Friday, I was over at my oldest sister and brother in law’s house after a funeral. My cousins were there too and we were hanging out and of course we started drinking. Then somehow the conversation turned into how my brother in law started telling my family that they should have the sex-talk with so that I know how to be safe I college when it comes to dating and stuff. (My family NEVER had these conversations because of living in a Catholic household). So my brother in law and I started to drink tequila and we continued drinking it because it was a nasty brand and we just wanted to drink it and get rid of it ASAP. Although, he was starting to get buzzed way before I did. I had a better tolerance and I didn’t get drunk until after the 7th or 8th shot. So, what made me uncomfortable was the fact he started repeating to me that I can to talk to him about anything when it comes to sex and all of that. And he kept reminding that one day it’s going to happen and that I should wear condoms to be safe. So I understood and I was fine with that and I took it as if he’s looking after me. What got to me was he kept repeating the same thing more and more as he got even more buzzed. He even kept pouring more tequila when I asked him for only Coca Cola and no liquor. I was fine with it, but then I got a little frustrated when kept adding more because I wanted to stop drinking for the night. Then he keeps repeating the same sex talk lecture over and over and it made me a little uncomfortable. I don’t know if he’s simply saying he just wants to be there for me or if he’s being nosy. Next thing I know I got buzzed quite a bit too and I get horny at times , but I was able to hold back because I know that’s my brother-in-law, I don’t have any feelings for him, and I did NOT want to ruin a marriage and ruin my relationship with my sister (my biggest fear). Plus I don’t want to her to get jealous. Next thing I know, he starts coming up from behind my chair and starts caressing my shoulders like he’s giving me a message and then plays with my hair. The first time didn’t freak me out, but the second and third time had me questioning him, but I was drunk at the time and didn’t realize it. Now I’m kinda worried. Even before we left that night, he kept hugging me from the side and telling my sisters that only him and I know how to drink and blah blah and kept hugging me and all of that. Then he tells me that I should stay over for the night in the guest room and I said no, I have to go home with my mom, middle sister, and grandma. 

Yesterday, we planned a barbecue at their house again and I was little nervous from the previous night. Things started out fine and I was helping him with cooking the meat outside on the grill while everyone was inside. Everything seemed normal until he said we both should eat outside because there was no room inside the house (which was strange because it worked before) but it was crowded so I agreed. What really got to me was my sisters made jokes/teasing him saying that he has a thing for me and that I’m trying to steal my sister’s husband. I never said anything back and then my middle sister teased me and says “hahaha look she’s not even denying it” and I got so f—ing pissed that I told her sternly “I have NOTHING to prove or deny” 

My issue is, now I’m worried and I’ve been keeping a distance from him. Now, I don’t to go to their house anymore. Before I would go in his car with him alone to run errands and it was cool. Now I question if I should anymore. I would also hang out with him by the pool at my parent’s house with no problem when he would come over and swim. Earlier, he did come over to swim and I didn’t want to go out there today. I’m starting to put more a distance because I’m
Trying to prove that I’m not doing anything. It makes me sad because I really love him a lot and like I said, he’s like a best friend to me and has been giving me great advice on how to be a good person and always had a better listening ear than my family. I don’t want to be the one to ruin a whole marriage and screw up many relationships and be looked at as a home wrecker that can never be trusted around a spouse. I swear I was NOT trying to do anything. 

My question is: Am I over analyzing everything? Should I change the way we interact now? Should I remain the same? How should I bring it up to him if I feel more uncomfortable? Or to even my other family members (especially oldest)? Should I put him to the test?",05Oct2020,1
298,"So back in February, a new coworker joined my team at my Job. We had a shift together and he told me that he was in a band and that they were playing at a nearby venue in a few weeks, and the gig was completely free. I love new music so I said that I would love to attend, and that I would bring some friends. The gig was cancelled because the UK went into lockdown, and he let me know that this was the case by messaging me on instagram. We started to chat and I just saw it as being friendly to a co-worker. Nothing more. I then wake up one morning to over 15 explicit images and videos from my co-worker, none of which I had asked for or had even hinted at wanting. I didn't want to cause an issue or create an uncomfortable situation for either of us (although I was well within my rights to), so I simply asked him to not send them again and I was going to cease any out-of-work communication with him. 

(Side note - I was sexually assaulted in October last year, and when I went to the police about it I was told that there was nothing that they could do, and I'd had to relive the memory of it all over again for nothing. This is why I didn't want to take my complaints any further, people tend not to believe you and I didn't want to have to go through the process of explaining the situation again)

I then received a message from him telling me that he was upset and needed help, he then proceeded to ring me multiple times and FaceTime call me a few times too (he had access to my personal number through the work group chat). I asked what was wrong and he started telling me that he was feeling down after being reminded of a situation where he was 'accused of being a sexual predator' by someone that he went to college with. This really triggered me, considering what had happened to me in October last year and the fact that I did genuinely believe that this man could have been a sexual predator. I asked him to stop and leave me alone and I blocked him on instagram. 

He then found my twitter, and messaged me on there too. He apologised, and with me not wanting to create any sort of negative situation when we were at work, I accepted this apology and had a short conversation with him. He then told me he was 'so horny' and I kicked off. 

When the UK lockdown was eased and I was able to go back to work, I showed two of my co-workers the images that I was sent by this man. I showed them these images because I felt upset and very alone. I also wanted to warn my friends that he wasn't a very nice person and they should be wary of him. In hindsight I probably shouldn't have done this, but I didn't really know what else to do.

The news got round to my manager, and now I have to go to a disciplinary meeting because I have 'shared indecent or explicit images whilst on shift'. I don't know why I am being blamed for someone else sending me unsolicited nudes, and I really don't know what I can say to make them see this. 

Please, if any of you know of anything I can say in order to turn the meeting in my favour, please let me know. The meeting is in 3 hours.

TL;DR - A coworker sent me unsolicited nudes and explicit messages, I showed two of my friends at work what I had been sent and I am being reprimanded for 'sharing indecent or explicit images whilst on shift' and I have a disciplinary meeting. I don't know what I can say to get my point across that I am not in the wrong, but I need this job.",05Oct2020,1
299,"A little content, so this person took a photo of me and I'm not happy about it. He's sorta my ex, when we split up he wasn't very happy about it and started threatening me on instagram, sending all sorts of screenshots to my cousin and current boyfriend, including very intimate photos including a video. This lasted for a while. The peak was the moment when he sent me my mothers phone number which he took from my phone without me knowing. All of this resulting in my very declined mental health deleting every social media I have because blocking did nothing, I blocked about 12 of his profiles on IG, but I took screenshots of everything and downloaded instagram data, but the stuff he sent my BF was on facebook and was deleted because...well...who would like to keep that stuff. 


And after 7 or more months of the incident I recovered my IG profile (I'm a hobbyist photographer and I enjoy it very much I shouldn't be bullied away from something I love). Only to find that he has mentioned my private profile in a photo, but he has blocked me. He has shared about 2-3 more photos without tagging me or mentioning me. I want at least that photo taken from his profile, but I don't know the way or if there is even a way...


Also, VSCO has crappy reporting system. He has a profile almost dedicated to us. All sorts of my photos and ours. And I can't do anything about it. I begged him to take them off, but he doesn't want to hear about it. 


I live in Eastern Europe, I don't think cyber bullying could be reported to authorities, and it sounds very stressing to go through that, and relive every moment again. I really want to move on with my life, potentially getting engaged, but I feel this is a big barrier in my mind.

301,"While I will not state the business name, I will let you know that they specialize in Japanese kimonos and related items. I found the company at a convention about 5 or 6 years ago.

Communication mode: FB

So last year I reached out to them because I know that they have haori for sale, but they don’t have anything setup besides a random pick. The reason that I contacted them was because (1) they said that they would send me information as I was interested in a product and (2) I wanted to buy said product. After the initial posting, I followed up about a month later. I didn’t get a response. I then followed another month later and still didn’t receive a response. I repeated this one more time before I had to let it rest because my life got busy. 

A few months ago, they had a sale in which they included haori. While I bought one, I decided to reach out to them. I wrote to them (summary) that I would like to know why I never received a response and that if they didn’t respond to my message that I wouldn’t but from them anymore. And as you may have guessed, they never responded. 

The first person who I talked to was the co-owner of the company and the second one was the company’s FB page. The communication was done via FB messenger as I presumed that was their main source for communicating with customers. 

Did I basically set them up for failure by communicating with that method? Should I try another? Should I leave it be??

The reasons that I am contemplating this is because I like the items that this company is able to acquire. (They do bring authentic Japanese items from Japan.)

302,"My boyfriend and I live together and we just broke up today. It’s October 4th and we are required to give 30 days notice and rent is due the first of each month. Which means that we are required to pay rent nov 1st, and the earliest we can move out is November 30 (to not waste money). 

My ex is looking for a new place and will be out within the month. I have the option of also leaving before nov 1st and to ask landlord if they are okay with a shorter notice period. If they are okay with it, I would be moving back home and saving money on the November rent.

The alternative is that I particularly don’t really want to move back home (parents). but I unfortunately do not have anyone who could be my new roommate. therefore the latest I can stay is November 30th as I have enough money to pay only 1 full months rent.

I would prefer to stay here and I can wait and see if maybe I can make things work by finding a roommate by October 31st (to give full 30 days notice of moving out). I am unsure if I should just leave in October to save November rent (if landlord allows), or stay here as long a so can.",05Oct2020,1

I've been trying to think of ways to have him start doing his homework as he has 3 F's. In math, science, and social studies. I started by saying if he works hard now he will have a great future, but he's a kid so that didn't work. Then I tried to bribe him with candy or pokemon cards and he's been asking for a nintendo switch since they came out and my father promised him one, but he doesn't keep his promises so I've been thinking of getting him one but my little brother doesn't know this yet.

314,"Okay so, bit of background.

I found out recently that the antidepressants I was put on were causing severe anxiety. My psychiatrist kept upping my dosage because they didn't do anything for my actual depression, so there was a solid 2 1/2 weeks where I was in a constant nightmarish state of anxiety. It felt like a never-ending panic attack without a source. Whenever I was alone, all I could do was shake and watch Netflix. I would wake up covered in my own sweat, which soaked through my sheets and shaking uncontrollably. I barely slept, and could only stomach raw cookie dough and alfredo.

Eventually, I decided to go off my meds because I had a feeling they were the cause, and it got to the point where it was either that, or go to the emergency room because I couldn't get myself to calm down. Low and behold, they were the cause. I stopped taking them a week ago and my anxiety is practically gone. My grades are up, my mood is up, I have the energy to do mediation and have a daily routine

Anywho, during that med-induced panic nightmare state, I genuinely thought my best friend (let's call them Bailey) was going to ""leave"" me. As in, say something along the lines of ""you're queer and you suck"", and then fuck off. (I have issues with this, and multiple ex-friends who've done it when I came out to them). We've been best friends for two years and were inseparable in our first year of uni.

So I decided to try and win Bailey over. They weren't talking much about themself, so I over-opened up to try and stimulate them opening up to me, which unsurprisingly backfired. I tried to fix that by gifts, I started putting together a gift thing for them and I told them that I was putting something together for them! This mostly started because they mentioned they need new shampoo and wasn't sure they could afford it. I also got them bubble bath and a plush of their favourite animal.

Not the response my panicky brain was looking for. So physical affection. Kind of worked, but it was a lot more variable. Basically, I went through the 6 love languages to try and find something that caused a response that my panicky brain wanted, but nothing could sate it.

So, after a month of that rodeo, when I finally realized it was my meds and incompetent psychiatrist, Bailey has said they needed a break from me. They didn't read any of my messages explaining my med and psychiatrist thing. They just hounded be for being in such an overbearing state for so long. They have every right to be angry, but they wouldn't even try to hear me explain myself. They didn't give a shit. It felt like I was back talking to that psychiatrist. 

I guess my question is, how can I possibly fix this? I don't want this friendship to end over something out of my control, if it's going to end by anything, I rather it be an issue with me. But... I guess it is an issue with me to Bailey.",05Oct2020,1

320,"So I am in this group of friends an we‘ve known eachother for over 10 years.
Lately, a girl in the friend group introduced a friend of hers and me and this new girl dont really get along that good.
Since it is her friend, Ive been trying to adapt and not make her feel unwanted (trust me, her character is one of a kind).
Apparently, my behaviour towards her still isn’t appreciated. I can be a character aswell sometimes; tough love often is the norm, but usually the opposite person picks up that its only jokes and we laugh it off. Not with her though.


Long story short, this group of friends wanted to go out the other night and it somehow was implicated that I wouldn’t come.
Tbf, First, I didnt respond because I wasnt sure If I hat the time, but the girl that introduced her friend clearly steered the convo into the direction that I wouldnt come.

I then asked another friend in the group if it would be a problem to change their reservation to include me, since I managed to get my work done.
He said it wouldnt be a problem, just a simple phone call. He would ask this girl in our group but it shouldnt be a big deal.
After 5 minutes, he said that we should probably catch up another time.


I now somehow feel backstabbed. I really tried my best and when I asked this girl if everything was alright, she replied with sure, wbu ?

Therefore the question: am I beeing overly sensitive/ petty?",05Oct2020,1
321,"I've been a car enthusiast since I was a kid, love cars so much that I studied automobile engineering and made it my career. I had a great car while I was working in the states, but had to sell it at a low price and move back to my country due to covid. Since I couldn't afford the same car here due to ridiculous tariffs, I'm now stuck with the 27 year old junker my family has that barely works, despite my multiple attempts to have it repaired. 

The engine is weak, the car rattles like a tractor, and both the interior and exterior of the car is in terrible condition. As a car guy , I am totally ashamed of driving this thing. I know that there are more important things here than my stupid feelings for a stupid car, but I can't help but extremely feel sad and frustrated about losing the car I loved, and ending up with this car, since I had so much fun and good memories in the car I gave up. Seeing this old car reminds me of how much of a failure I am. I'm planning to buy back the same model and is saving up for it, but it's going to take a while, how do I deal with these terrible feelings before that happens?",05Oct2020,1
322,"Since before I was in kindergarten, I used to play this “game” I called trap. I would, for lack of a better description, hump my own arm. It was called trap because I only did it when I was thinking about princesses being kidnapped or some other event where someone was tied down. (Remember I was 6 or younger when this started). The girl was always in danger and a large man was always the other person. I thought it was just some weird thing I did until I learned more about sexual situations in middle school. 
Now that I’m even older, I have noticed other habits of mine that concern me. I can’t eat or drink after people because mouths disgust me. Germs I’m fine with, but not mouths. Sex also repulses me. I feel sexual drive, but I have never been turned on by a person (I consider myself asexual). When I think about sex and genitals I feel disgusting and anxious despite having the opinion that it is a natural and normal thing for people to do. It’s like a phobia because I can’t rationalize it. I also have a lot of anxiety about being touched in general. Hugging has gotten better lately, but I still have trouble. Hugging other women makes me repulsed if they don’t have a bra on because I can just slightly feel their boob. Overall, being touched is like a phobia of mine that no one notices because I am usually ok at hiding it.
Here’s why I am connecting it with childhood amnesia about molestation. This is where it gets really heavy (even worse) so please stop if this could harm you. 

There are two scenarios that I could see where this could be possible. The first is from a guy who lived with my grandma. He is her step cousin (raised as actual cousins) and they lived together for at least ten years. Her house was my favorite place on earth until she sold it, but his room always gave me weird feelings. I would walk through to go to the bathroom, and just feel instant dread. I also have this one particular memory of me being tiny and sitting on the bed in his lap watching cartoons but it feels dirty and wrong. I don’t remember anything happening, but there’s just this sense of dread about that room. He was incredibly fond of my younger cousin as well, and the thought of him having done something to her scares me even more. 
The other scenario is even worse for me to think about. My sister. She is only a few years older than me and I have always been “disgusted” by her. We have the basic, nice family sibling relationship, but I have always just hated her. Not in a sibling way though. The same feeling of being dirty I feel about that one memory is everything I feel about her. I cannot hug her. She has tried in recent years and it feels disgusting and sexual. When she lived at home and she tried to hug me or even barely touch me, I would physical shove her away. It caused me to get in a lot of trouble. There is one particular moment where she put her hand on my lower back for some explainable reason, but I flipped my shit. It was some of the worst anxiety I have ever felt. She also would change in front of me a lot and I always got uncomfortable. My mom once yelled at me because I was causing the family to be late because I refused to change in the hotel room (my dad was in the bathroom and my mom and sister were in the room with me). I hate being near her face as well. I can’t even think about these things without feeling a terrible disgust and dread. 
I also have physical symptoms that could be explained by this. I am 18 and have always wet the bed. I once asked my mom what could cause it and she got really defensive saying it was from birth. The issue is that i know when my lee issue started because I peed my pants at school in first grade until it was controlled enough to be only at night. My parents took me to a doctor who told me it wasn’t my kidneys or bladder, and my mom refuses to let me go anywhere again because it “must be just nerve damage or something.” 
I have always had anxiety to the point of crying and puking even in kindergarten. I vividly remember seeing kids messily eat cupcakes when I was 6 and I ran to my teachers trash can. I would pick my nails so badly that they would bleed as well. 
Although this is even more personal, as I said, I consider myself ace but I still get aroused. However, seeing bodies immediately turn me off. The thought of sex even doesn’t do anything. I only feel aroused when it is a non-consensual act against me. For a long time I wasn’t in the situation in my imagination, but that has recently changed. 

I don’t want to discredit others who have gone through this by jumping to conclusions but I feel like all the puzzle pieces in my life are coming together. It would explain a lot about me and I could maybe get to the bottom of who would have done something like this to me were it true. 

Does anyone know anything about this? Do these sound like normal behaviors of a child (especially when they are all combined into one kid)? 

I forgot to mention that my grandma babysat me, so I was at her house everyday from birth until I started school, and then most days after school and every single summer/holiday.

323,"My 16th birthday is in a week, but I feel my intelligence is that of an 8-year-old child. I'm expected to learn how to drive, get a job, etc., but I doubt I would be able to handle any of those things. It's pretty pathetic.

I don't know if I have a future. I can see myself as a drunkard who bums off of other people in order to survive. I barely understand simple math equations and always end up messing everything up when I try to be ""independent"". Fuck, I can't even make myself something to eat without nearly burning the kitchen down.

I guess my point is that I'm an absolute idiot. I've tried to ""un-stupid"" myself, but whatever I do I always end up as the moron in the family no one actually likes. I'm self-conscious about a lot of things, but nothing bothers me as much as this. I value intelligence above most else so it is incredibly hurtful and humiliating when people look at me like I'm the most stupid person to ever walk this planet. Should I just accept my fate as an idiot?",05Oct2020,1
324,"I cannot move immediately, of course. Although I am 20, I need to get my affairs in order and I'm too inexperienced to simply leave, as well as I do not have any trustworthy extended family to rely on without making this an entire ordeal (and I'm trying desperately to avoid that.)

The gist is, I'm tired of living with my mother. I simply cannot handle her inability to cope with her mental illness any longer. I'm exhausted of having my hurt downplayed because hers takes precedence, and while I don't know if I'm justified in being hurt to begin with I just can't help but feel I'd be far happier if I could get some distance from her. I feel calmer when she isn't at home-- which is rarely, as she is unable to work. But the few times it has happened I felt at peace, and able to function, and I want desperately to have that again.

I feel immense guilt at the prospect of leaving for a variety of different reasons. She cannot care for herself(my father does a decent job, but they fight constantly I.E. she berates him and yells at him all the time and I fear what would happen if I don't play a reliable rock for her), and leaving would mean my sibling will have to deal with her on their own, among other things. I feel immense guilt at feeling bitter, and wanting to limit as much contact as possible, but the notion is so tempting that when I feel my most hurt I can almost dismiss my concerns and fears. Almost.

I want, more than anything else, to have that distance so I can discern reality from fiction. She is caring, she is loving and supportive, but she scares me and something tells me something isn't right, no matter how much I ruminate over it. She has called me manipulative, called my sibling abusive, played these off as ""freak-outs"" after blaming her actions on her poor relationship with our father and proceeded to pretend they never happened. I go stone-faced in front of her automatically, and have been since I was 14 and when crying in front of her she threatened to have me put in a psych ward. And yet she has comforted me when I cried over bad health news. Yet she has called us sensitive and told us we should have been abused as children, something that finally made me realize the way she acted was not right. Yet, again, she tells me she is proud of us, that she couldn't ask for better children. I simply don't know how to feel, but I don't want the guilt that will come from being honest with her if I tell her why I want to leave.

I also fear her self destructiveness. She can do very stupid things when she is upset, such as storming out into a bad area without telling us where she is, and giving vague, worrying details along the way. One of the times she did this, I wanted to yell at her because she shrugged off my concern so brazenly and acted like she had simply gone out for a stroll. She can go days barely eating anything and is currently going through a period of that, yet acts like it's no big deal. I...do not want to be the reason she hurts herself. I could never forgive myself if that happened, so I keep my mouth shut.

With all of this in mind, and I apologize if I went into poor detail or truly am some degree of spoiled over this lol, I just need advice. Would it be a good idea to work towards leaving? How could I potentially bring up the topic to her without inciting rage or making her guilt me into staying?

I intend to bring this up with a therapist when I get one, but as I do not at the moment I wanted to hear from other people.",05Oct2020,1
325,"Hi guys. I’m 17 fm who was sexually abused when I was 5-13 years old. I was abused by my babysitter(18 m) my father, my moms friend, my mom friends daughter, and two boys I went to school with. They all have sexually abused me.All this abuse happened before I turned 14. I hadn’t known what sexual abuse was and why even sex itself was. I was always told touching and stuff was just a “game” by my babysitter and that it was adult things. I was so sexually confused as a kid. The abuse that happened to me affected me so much to the point I sexually acted out with someone else. I abused someone. I abused someone I loved. I was 12 and she was 4 and I abused her. I hate myself for it and I know I’m should. I know the severity of what I did and I feel the shame and guilt from it everyday. I don’t even wanna live with myself anymore. I had no idea what sexual abuse was until I reached highschool sophomore year and I was 15. That’s when the memory of what I did came back to me. I was in total shock and the day I remembered it all, I attempted and I even said a vague apology to my sister who I abused. I wanted to just give her the world if I could I felt horrible and I wished and prayed that I could take whatever pain that she could suffer from and transfer it to me times 100. She didn’t deserve that, no one does. I couldn’t believe that I myself was abused and did it to someone else. I just wish I could go back in time and tell my 12 year old self that what I was doing was wrong and disgusting and the worst thing I could do.I don’t understand how I did what I did. Today I’m 17 deservingly depressed, suicidal, shameful, broken and all I can think about is how to make my sister life better. Now a days I feel that because of what I did I feel that I deserved everything that happened to me because instead of telling someone what happened to me and getting the help I needed I hurt someone else. I was such a stupid kid and I wish I knew better and I wish I knew I was hurting her. I feel as though if I hadn’t been abused I would have never turned out the way I was as a kid. I was a stupid stupid dumb child. I hate myself. Now I know better, now I see my wrongdoing. Just wanna say I WOULD NEVER EVER DO THIS TO SOMEONE AGAIN. I WOULDNT EVEN THINK OF IT. It’s disgusting and horrid. NO ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS. It’s weird because I was a victim who then victimized someone else. I still struggle with my abuse and hate that I do because I just wanna work on just making my sisters life better and even if that means leaving her life completely that will be done if she wants me out of it.Now being 17 I spread awareness about sexual assault and childhood sexual assault and talk about the effects but I can’t help but feel like a hypocrite. Im always helping sexual abuse victims and praying for them and all that but I can’t help but feel like a hypocrite. I know there’s people who say I should just kill myself and trust I know but I guess I’m just asking for advice on what I should do better.",05Oct2020,1

like most people nowadays, im forced to go do online school. 

Online school hasnt been easy to say the least. Honestly pre quarantine I was an A student getting good grades on everything but quarantine fucked me up in more ways then 1 and i guess that affected my grades so now I average a D at best.

It doesnt help that my parents are the strict type so Im definitely getting punished alot. they also take to account that this is gonna affect my college life later on which is very true but kinda stressed out about this and i just hope that theyll go easy on us ( most likey not)  because of this awful and stressful time.

335,"Hey everyone. To whoever views and comments on this post, thank you. This is something that’s been on my mind for a while, and I wanted to make sure I’d be doing the right thing in helping my boyfriend when it comes to this. For full anonymity, I am using a throwaway account, and will not mention names throughout either post or comments. Anyway, here goes.

I (16f) have been with my boyfriend (16m) for about 6 months now, and it was only during this time that I have learned about his flashbacks and nightmares. Now, the thing is, I do not know the extent, or the full cause/reasoning of his flashbacks. I never was comfortable trying to find out many details beforehand, because of how delicate a subject I know it is for him, and once before I accidentally caused him a flashback when he first mentioned this to me. Just the mentioning alone sent him into a flashback, and a harsh one at that. All I know about this PTSD-inducing event, was that it happened 6 years ago, it was something he witnessed, and almost committed suicide due to it (though for all this, he has gone to counseling in the past). The only reason he is still alive, is due to his parents finding his suicide notes hours before he was able to do anything.

I do have my suspicions though, of what the event was. Just a couple months earlier, he briefly mentioned he used to have a sister, but she had passed away. And even more recently, he has mentioned that he’s seen her in quite a few nightmares in the past, including one where she was murdered right in front of him, only a month back. I do not know much else about the subject, but I think it’s a good possibility. But since this is only a hunch, I will not assume this is the actual reasonings behind his flashbacks.

Another thing I should mention, is that I’ve never been physically with him during one of these episodes, so I don’t even know his exact reaction. Because of Covid, we’ve only very recent lay been able to be with each in person since school in March. I’ve also never talked him through one of these in the past on the phone, for he’s always dealt with them on his own prior to now. I’ve always offered assistance whenever he would tell me over text that he’s had one, but he always stated that he wasn’t sure how I would be able to help, especially since back then, I was almost never available throughout the day to call due to busyness.

So, the reason why I’m trying to figure out this now, is because of a very recent nightmare episode, that led to a complete mental breakdown. This nightmare had to do with my mom, and she kidnapped, tortured, and almost killed him in the nightmare. I woke him up accidentally (though at the same time fortunately as well) with a text just before the last part (he was napping, not something in the middle of the night). For context, my mom would never do such a thing to anyone, let alone him, or my family for that matter, so the dream he had was unrealistic, but pure terror fuel. The dream had left him shaking, and right after I woke him, I tried offering ideas to calm him down. Long story short, eventually this conversation led to two days of him becoming embarrassed of how he worded some things to me, to the point of him degrading himself by the second day. After a long session of texting (again, this was late in the day). one large thing that I learned from the messages, is that his life is a mental hell at times because of his nightmares/flashbacks (he is also somewhat withdrawn around other people, and as somewhat mentioned earlier through his self-degradation, has low self esteem), but he always feels much better about himself and his mental status when he’s around me. I have helped him in the past through some of his hardships, and even with texting him ideas to help him through his nightmares/flashbacks. With that, I agreed to do whatever I could to be available to call him when another nightmare/flashback strikes (my schedule this school year isn’t as busy, so this is doable for me).

Problem is, with my little experience in such matters, I don’t know exactly how to react. I’ve never called him for this sort of thing. I myself suffer from anxiety, and I want to stay as calm as possible during these calls. Ive never helped anyone, in person, or even over a live call for that matter, coax and talk through something as mentally crippling as this. The first couple times may freak me out a bit, depending on his reactions to such episodes. I don’t believe this will be much of an issue, but if anyone has pointers for me to stay calm myself, I’d appreciate that highly. But of higher priority, I would like some pointers on how to help him, not so much my own worries. The main thing, is that he wants to talk through exactly what he sees through these flashbacks and nightmares. But when talking through them, is it best just to listen, so he can get them off his chest, or offer advice and guidance afterwards? Though this may be difficult to answer, knowing that all people react differently to this sort of thing, and that I don’t even know all the details behind his episodes. I feel like I should ask him himself about how I should help him, but with how this is so delicate of a topic, I don’t know if that would be the right course of action. Should I at least ask for some basic pointers or the like, or gather advice from others, such as this sub? Other than that, if anyone has any general pointers on how to help someone with PTSD and occasional night terrors, please let me know.

Once again, thank you to whoever offers advice.

Yesterday she sent me a message from my snap story and i decided to shoot my shot and keep the convo going because i have waited too long and this is a great chance. She kept the convo going by asking questions back and you know not being short. 

I want to message her again but I don’t know; a) what message to send her without seeming creepy and b) i feel like i would be wasting her time. 

What is a good message to start a convo with your crush.

340,"I've dealt with this phrase before, in a very toxic relationship which is long gone.
It's now happening with my mom. I'm 24, and have this horror theater experience scheduled with my housemate and some of his friends in the middle of November. I've mentioned it to my mom in passing and she has used this phrase which I so very despise. She has also asked whether I am going to a satanic ritual, why would I go to a theater experience with my housemate which I have only met in the beginning on September and said that she would be really scared of me going and would not sleep at night. I have even showed her several national news articles about this event. It seems she thinks I'm literally going to the slaughter house to be slaughtered.

five week later my mom gets a call from the school saying that im failing one of my classes,  I tried reasoning with her but she called it all “bullshit” and  punched me in the eye as a “lesson” for failing my class and making up things.


I was crying in pain and the only this she said was,
“stop victimizing yourself (my name).“ then left me.
after she left I cried even more and she yelled out saying, “ (my name), if I hear you cry one more time I will f*ck you up “

(I got a black eye from this)

She called my dad in the afternoon to take me for two weeks because she was tried of my shit, when he came to pick me up he noticed that my bangs were covering my right eye and he brushed it off to the side so he can see my “pretty face”. 

He was so horrified when he saw my right eye, he admittedly asked me what happened, I told him I didn’t want to talk about it.

He kept on asking me like two or three times and I just broke down crying telling him what happened between me and my mom, he said that he’s going to take care of her but I told him to stop because I didn’t wanna make things worse.

( i even told him the names she called me and how much of a disappointment I am to her and the rest of the family )

I have a decent job in a field I enjoy and with people I care for, and it pays a few bucks more than minimum wage and gives good health benefits. But even with this I'd still need to make about twice as much as I do now to afford even a studio apartment where I live. And even if I could move out, I don't have a car to get myself to work. I've tried looking into roommates but I have some bad stranger anxiety that has closed that door, and my friends are all in decent places.

My parents are great people and have never made me feel unwelcome, that's not an issue. But I feel so trapped. I can't even try and date because the women I've been talking to are so successful and independent, I can't just be like ""Hey want to come watch a movie at my mom's house?"" so I've given up on even that. I can't afford to move out, I can't afford college (and even if I could I don't know that I have 3-4 years of this left in me), and I'm at the upper end of what I can make without a degree or specialized experience.

I don't really know how to describe it... Social anxiety is the most accurate term if you want to name it but it could be something else too.

I have trouble talking to people in public. Sometimes we have Skype meetings at work because we work from home and my anxiety spikes up when I try to express my thoughts, say my opinions, even worse... disagree with someone's idea. I can't even support my own opinion. It happens all the time, when someone disagrees with me or they do not understand what I try to say I just have to back down  because I'm unable to express my thoughts further...

I feel a mild jitter. I'm not sure if it's noticeable but I'm gradually losing control of myself. It's like my brain starting to turn off part by part of itself or that someone takes on control and I lose touch with reality which means I end up hearing my own voice struggling to put words in a sentence.

It makes me feel dumb. Like very dumb. I notice people stop taking me seriously as long as they know me a bit better. Maybe it's just me that sees that but even if it's not real it bothers me.

I'm already seeing a psychologist and it's really tough and expensive. I'm trying to gather as much information as I can but it's just too much and overwhelming. It is really draining me.

I get that she might do that the first weeks, but its been so long and it makes me feel like she thinks im a thief or something. She doesn't have any of her things out except for her toothbrush and it makes ME feel weird for putting my stuff on my desk or bathroom and not constantly locking my things.

2. They started tolerating us going on dates and stuff, then covid hit. I didn't really care much about it but shewas big on social distancing which felt like a copout. We fought a lot and sometimes I would get her to come over but not much. We would talk on the phone but it wasn't the same and she seemed way more okay with that than me.
3. Then she started studying for the MCAT. We would video call but it wasn't the same, lots of fights again. Finally I got her to agree to see me once a week but even that's barely anything. Of course I wanted her to do good but I also want a girlfriend that I can actually see, especially since I don't have any real friends here and my family lives far away. I was stuck in an apartment alone and really depressed, but she still kept saying she needs to study and covid this and that.

She said ok but she was really stressed so I told her to take it at home and meet me in the new town which she was happy about. She pays the expenses 50/50 (without even living here) but with the new plan I'm in this new city alone for a month.
5. She pushes back the test by two weeks because she feels like the first appointment time she got was a bad time for her (early in the morning). Now I have to be alone for a month and two weeks. We plan so that she's going to move right after the test.
6. She finally finishes the test and tells her parents she's moving with me. They freak out, she's really sad. Then her dad tries to fix things with her and she asks if its ok to spend time with them to fix things instead of moving right away.

Even though my dad was married to my mom and she knew that he was married and with a kid, they started dating behind my mom's back. She was my dad's mistress for 3 years until she insisted that dad should divorce my mom and marry her. He resisted at first but finally did what she wanted. He divorced my mom and married her right after. My mom was obviously devastated and eventually she had to move out and she had to find a place and a job (she stopped working when I was born). Needless to say she had to go through A LOT because of stepmom. 

For some personal and financial reasons I stayed with my dad and my new stepmom. I was 13 when all these happened and I rightfully blamed her for all that mess. She was the reason I didn't grow up with my mom around and she was the reason that my 44 year old mom started suffering from severe depression and an overall shitty standard of living. To this day I despise her for that.

It's been almost 6 years now since she moved in and mom moved out. Honestly as a stepmom she has been nothing but good to me. She's never been angry at me or yelled at me. She's always tried to be like a friend to me and help me. We do things together like she always takes me with her when she wants to go shopping and asks my opinion on things. The three of us have been on vacations and adventures as a family and tbh they've been nothing but good memories. I even call her mom now and that's the source of my internal conflict because according to my real mom she's still the ""homewrecking b***h"". 

In front of my real mom I hate her as much as she does but in reality I love my stepmom. She's young and closer to my age and that's why we get each other. She's a great friend to me. Plus she's a gorgeous woman and since the school days I've always enjoyed being seen with her in public. (I'm a man after all like my dad)

That's my dilemma. Should I feel bad for rightfully hating her but also loving her?",05Oct2020,1

376,"Need some advice for my 5 month long relationship

So I (28m) have been dating my girlfriend (21f) for about 5 months now. It hasn’t been the smoothest 5 months but I love my gf very much. Our relationship so far has withstood racist parents, covid lol (wasn’t much to do as far as dates), and religious differences.

Right now we’re both going through tough times as far as financial issues. I lost my job and she works two jobs and is barely paying her bills. I’ve decided to go back to college in pursuit of a degree is computer science and she also wants to go college. 

Lately we’ve both been down in the dumps about our situations but I’ve been trying to not let it get to me and make the best out of my situation. I want to try and be happy and up instead of being down all the time as I see being down in the dumps all the time does nothing for me. However, I feel like my gf is just always sad or upset. I try to help raise her spirits but she tells me there’s nothing I can do whenever I ask. It makes me feel useless and also annoyed. In a time where I’m trying to be happy despite my short comings, I feel like she just stays sad and it’s effecting me. One day she’s fine and then the next week she’s sad or upset. 

I have had a conversation with her about it and mentioned that I feel bad not being able to help her not be so sad and that I ask her if there’s anything I can do for her or get her and her only answers are no or idk. Her response to this was she doesn’t want to have to be asked. I’ve got old her that I need help figuring that stuff out sometimes because I’m not psychic and she just says ok. 

Idk what to do guys and I could use some help with this. Am I wrong for feeling the way I feel? What can I do to better help my gf out when she’s feeling down? 

Please help :(",05Oct2020,1
377,"Hello, 

Sorry for any mistake English is not my first language, and I'm on mobile.

As I said in the title, my parents have been there to help me financially and emotionally those last years. We never got along during my childhood (now 21f).
I was always fighting with my dad and my mom got really depressed because we couldn't understand each other.
As I grew up I understood that they were trying to protect me but they didn't know how to do it. I think the age gap didn't help too (they were 35 and 40 when they had me, trying since 30). Mostly they didn't trust me if an adult was involved (ex: I was bullied in middle school, but the school nurse said I was fine and they trusted her because the adult knows better. (After they confronted the school when it got serious)


Finally we understood each other, we told everything we had to tell and now we're super close. I moved out when I was 19, with my bf. They helped us move in, bought furniture, took us to eat many times, called me when things were rough... I think they spent thousand euros on me to help me settle in life, but they refuse I reimburse anything. 

I thought I would take them to a fancy restaurant, but last time I did and paid, they asked for a copy of the note and paid me back directly on my bank account.

I don't know what to do, because if I use a lot of money they will get mad and pay me back and that's not the point... 

I offered them countless of my paintings they like, redesigned their house but I feel that's not enough for everything they did for me. 

If you have an idea, I'd be glad to read it!

Thank you for reading",05Oct2020,1

 But because of online classes I couldn’t adjust to the new way of learning. I felt more pressured than before, I cried so many times because of how I couldn’t understand the lessons. No matter how much I read the books and the PowerPoints, or I rewatch the video lesson I still couldn’t understand anything at all, I felt like if I ask my teacher they would think I’m dumb.I couldn’t ask my mom for help since she’s the reason why I feel so pressured, whenever I can’t do anything right, my mom would scold me, telling me I’m dumb,stupid and lazy.My dad and my older sister does the same but my older sister would tell me that I cheat so I could be a honor student.

379,"For as long as I can remember I always knew that I wanted to work in law enforcement as a police officer. I’m not sure if I have just lost interest but now I don’t even know if I want to do that. (I didn’t lose interest because of what has been happening recently with police shootings) but for some reason I’ve just lost motivation in just about everything. I graduated high school this year and I am currently taking classes at community college to get an associate degree in psychology. Before I started losing interest, my plan was to continue on with college and get a bachelors in psychology but now I don’t even want to finish my associates degree. People have told me that I just need to find what I enjoy in life and do that but honestly I don’t have any hobbies. All I do is scroll through social media and watch YouTube videos. Sometimes I just want to pack a bag and leave but honestly where will I even go? The only reason I did college was because of my parents. I know that they will be fine if I just finish my associates but like I said I’m lacking the motivation to even do that. Even if I do finish it, what then? I still don’t know if want to do law enforcement anymore. 

Honestly I’m just really lost and could use any advice. 

Please don’t just say “find a hobby and do that for a living” because I’m pretty sure I won’t get paid for scrolling through social media.

I also doubt my parents would be fine with me just quoting college now. I have mentioned before that I don’t want to do it and that I dislike it so far but all they say is “how could you not go to college with the brain that you have”. I always did well in high school but it’s just not the same anymore.",05Oct2020,1
380,"I'm at my wits end. In late August I went to get my mail after being gone a week, and the mailbox was empty. I assumed the carrier stopped delivery because the mailbox was ""full,"" so I drove to the post office to pick up my mail. They had one ad pack wrapped around like five standard envelopes. I have a full size mailbox, and they stopped my delivery because it was like 1/3 full? Whatever, I picked it up and went about my business. Then I stopped receiving any mail for like a week, and then I got one piece of junk mail, and then nothing for at least another week. No insurance or electric bill invoice, or coupons, nothing. Then one more piece of junk mail came. And that's it. Literally over a month and my carrier probably delivered my mail twice, on accident, if they are still withholding my mail. So last Monday I go back to the post office to find out what in the hell is going on with my mail. They check for withheld mail, and tell me that my carrier has all of my mail in their truck (this would be violation of policy, if true). Then they lie to me again and tell me my mailbox is obstructed by a parked car, and the carrier cannot deliver my mail. Then they tell me to ""come back at five"" and pick up my mail when the carrier is done for the day. I come back and find the post office is closed, at five oclock. I wait two more days, receive zero mail, and on both days record the carrier driving past my unobstructed mailbox and delivering my neighbor's mail. I then call the usps and file a complaint. They tell me to expect a phone call from the post office to resolve the issue. I have not received any phone call.

He ended up dying at around 2 AM the next day.

387,"TLDR: Long distance relationship, boyfriend ignores me when mad and plays games all the time when we are together 

Hello i've been watching a lot of youtube videos on relationship advice from reddit and decided to give it a try, sorry for being long but I want to explain some situations so you can judge better and help me. Thank you in advance. (Also English is not my first language sorry if theres some mistakes)

We started dating a year ago and because we live at our parents houses in diferent locations we only see eachother once a month or once every two months. The most we've been together was one week in last august I spent at his house when his mother was on vacation, but for the most part its just 1 or 2 days on weekends. 
Because of the pandemic im struggling to find a full time job but I work on small things here and there so i can afford the trips to meet him without asking money from my parents, so money is not really an issue.
Online our relationship is great, we talk everyday, watch movies and i watch him play games a lot, which i love, we rarely fight and its usually small things that we get over pretty easily. Theres one thing that i need to mention that is he usually ignores me when he gets mad for 1 or 2 days, I hate it and he knows it, but he explained its is way of colling down so i dont make a big deal out of it anymore.
So because we dont have much time together i always want try to make the most out of it, but he doesnt seem to want that and thats were the problem starts. He never say he didnt want it but is actions kinda do and that what im going to explain now. 

That week i spent at his house was not the best for me but i still loved being with him dont get me wrong. First two days were amazing, we talked, we had sex and cuddle after, we watched videos and i watched him play his games. We were on different sleep schedules so i usually fell asleep when he played and he fell at sleep in the afternoon. Because i had nothig to do at his house i would cuddle him to sleep and then watch videos on his computer, he never cuddle me to sleep which i didnt like and i told him in the last day there. Anyway 3rd day he started playing valorant with his friends which i didnt mind at all in the beggining. We had planned to go out for a walk that night and i watched the time pass and he forgot, i didnt want to bother him since he was happy playing with friends and we had more days, he was also making a lot of noise, again i didnt want to ask him to stop but i couldnt sleep at all. It was already morning when he asked if he made too much noise and if i was mad, i told him he forgot the walk and he looked sad about forgetting it so i let it pass eventough i was kinda annoyed about not being able to sleep. We scheduled the walk again for that following night, but night came he started playing with friends, this time he didnt forgot but rudely asked if i wanted to go for the walk, we didnt went and he played again all night making noise. We ended up going the next day tho. (We didnt intereact with eachother much those 3 days as he was either playing or sleeping when i was awake) Last day came and i asked him at around 5am when he wanted me to catch the train home, i asked because i wanted to be there untill he went to bed to make the most out of our time and i tought he would want the same, but for some reason he didnt want to decide and got mad when i insisted. He proceded to ignore me all morning while i clean the kitchen and stuff. I had decide to go around 5pm but seeing him ignore me made me feel unwanted in the house and i started crying (im not proud of it but i was really overwhelmed) and we eventually talked, he started crying too when i told him i felt unwanted and like i was ignored most of the week. We worked things out and i left in good terms. 

Fast forward two months of not seeing eachother but being really happy online, this past weekend happened, it was our first aniversary, he invited me to his house since his mother was going out for the weekend and i was really excited about it, hes not the romantic type so i wasnt expecting anything different than the usual i was just excited to be with him. 
I was supposed to go on friday and come back on sunday (aniversary day) with my father that was going to drop of a cousin at the airport so i had a ride home. But things started when on thursday boyfriend wanted to cancel things because i spend too much money on trips, i got really taken aback and when i told him it was our aniversary he said ""that makes thigs complicated"" which makes me think he forgot but i dont want to ask. After talking and kinda whining about it all night he invited me again, it seemed forced but i really wanted to spend our first aniversary with him and he knew it very well since i was talking about doing something since the beginning of last month. So i went but because of the timming of the second invite i went on saturday morning instead. The day was wonderful, i loved it and i think he did too, then we slept and woke up and started talking and eventually we talked about me leaving, i told him i was going by train at night so we could have more time together i had also previously told my father that i wasnt going with him since it was to early and i wanted to spend more time with boyfriend. My boyfriend insisted on me going with my father (again because of money) and i insisted on going at night, i got annoyed about he not wanting me to spend more time with me and got sulky and layed in bed not talking for a while. It was stupid of me to be honest, but then he got mad for me being mad and didnt even try to make things right, he ignored me all night and morning that was literally our last talk before i came home.

I texted him saying i needed to talk when he wakes up, not necessarily right after he wakes up but when hes ready. He woke up and told me to talk, i started talking and said we are having a comunication problem, especially me, when we are together and that i want to make sure we want the same things in our relationship. I honestly want to make things right and work on our mistakes. He has since started ignoring me again and i dont know what to think of it. 

I really love him, and want to move in together and later start a family with him, i think he feels the same, but at the same time this situation is bothering me. 
As i said in the tittle i think he doesnt give me enough attention when we are together, i dont want him 24/7 looking at me but i dont want to feel left out or unwanted again. Am i overreacting? 

Also as i said money is not a problem for me and i dont understand why he made such a big deal about it.

388,"(readers discretion advised) 

Recently I went out on a date with a guy who in my head I knew was a bit of a player. Still, I live alone in a foreign country as an international student, my classes are all online… I guess I was feeling a bit lonely. So, I went against my better judgement and decided to go on a date with the guy. We met up at 8:00pm. Throughout the week before we had been texting on and off. I have a really big test coming up and I told him I wasn’t really wanting to drink any alcohol, but I would be fine going out for a bit. Of course, I hadn’t been out in a long time, and I broke my first rule… I ended up drinking 3 beers. I was tipsy but not wasted by any means, at the end of dinner we decided to go for a walk. We walked for a bit and then wound up sitting in front of a convenience store for a few hours… he told me to wait outside, he went in and bought more alcohol. I drank it. Still though, I wasn’t plastered drunk, but I was feeling good at that point. I remember everything and am aware of everything that happened and all of my decisions. 

Around midnight-ish he walked me home and then used the excuse “I really have to pee, can I use your toilet?” 

“you can’t wait?” I asked

“no, I really gotta go.” He said

Of course I knew. I knew what his play was. Even if he did have to pee he’s the type a guy that’d find a bush on the walk home and pee there. But stupid ol’ me was feeling… frisky… In my head I’m thinking we could make out a bit, I wanted him to kiss me goodnight. 

Still, I am not the type to have one night stands, nor have I ever had a one night stand… In fact, I’ve been in long term relationship after another… this entire experience was all kind of new to me. 

So, I allowed him to enter my home and “use my toilet.” He walked towards the door. I walked him to it. He exited. I cracked open the door to watch him leave only to see him still standing there. He came in and said “you said you have to study tomorrow, don’t you?” he walked me to my bed, sat me on it. He turned to leave, he exited my room, to which I cracked open the door once again, he was standing there. 

He walked to my bed again, only this time he remained. He layed me back on the bed and we started to make out. At this point things were getting heated, I’m not really sure how but at some point he had taken his dick out… and then next thing I knew I was giving him a blow job. It wasn’t until half way through the BJ that I started to feel this huge sense of panic. I began feeling immediate regret and there was a voice in my head saying *‘girl what are you doing? You barely know this guy…’.* As soon as I came to this realization I stopped, and I said 

“look, I’m sorry but I don’t want to do this… I’m not really the type of girl to do this stuff on a first date. I want to stop.” 

He said, “I mean… that’s okay… should I leave?” 

“I’m not sure… but I don’t want to have sex or do anything more that’s sexual.” I replied

He said okay and then next thing I know he was passed out on my bed. We both slept (though I didn’t sleep well because he is a cuddler and tbh I like my space when I sleep). 

The next morning around like 5am or so we both woke up and his dick was pressed against my bottom in the spooning position. He didn’t do anything though, at first. We were talking for a little while and then he pulled his dick out and started jerking off right there. 

“can you please suck my dick again?” he asked

I began leaning closer and then realized what I was doing “no.” I said

“well, can I at least cum in your mouth?” 

“no.” I said again.

So idk why but I feel the need to specify the *way* I said no. It wasn’t a playful ‘no’ like “haha, oh stop, no way, hahaha” but it wasn’t like a stern ‘no’ that you might say to your dog.

It was more like a “no sorry” with a shake of the head. 

I think my mistake was what I did next. I didn’t mind kissing him or anything like that, but I wasn’t ready to really go further. I was thinking like “*well, maybe he just had serious blue balls, I guess I shouldn’t have stopped half way through… the least I could do is kiss him or something while he jerks off, maybe that’ll help him get off better…”*

So that’s what I did… I started kissing him, thinking that it’s the least I could do since I just stopped half way through the night before. 

After a few minutes he said “I’m gonna cum” and next thing I know he had grabbed me by the back of the head and shoved my face near his dick. I tried to move my head but he had a hold on me pretty good. I had two choices at that point: let him cum on my face or in my mouth, cause there is no way I could move in time at that point. I chose my mouth. 

Of course, I spit it out soon after and I said “wtf I said I didn’t want to”

To which he replied “Sorry, just couldn’t help myself” (or something along those lines, I can’t remember exactly what he said).

He fell asleep again… I didn’t kick him out. He left around 8 the next day because he had work. 

People that I have talked to (though not in this much detail) have all said its my fault because I let him in my house and I led him on. If it is, then it is. But I need someone who I don’t know to tell me this so that I can get real confirmation.

400,"I grew up in the heart of the capital city of a 3rd world country. Cars are expensive yet there’s a much more convenient transportion over there than here in the US. There are different kinds of busses, there are pedicabs, motorized tricycles, taxis, trams or trains etc. I also grew up in a middle class family so we were fortunate to have a family car that only my dad drives. Girls don’t usually drive over there, some (if u are rich) hire drivers to drive their cars. And upon coming here, i always feel so pressured by my mom and other people to get my license. My mom always say that you can’t go anywhere here if u don’t have a car and if u can’t drive, which is true especially here in California.( I still do public transportation but it’s hard and they suck) and when i meet people i have to explain to them that i don’t have a car and dont have a license yet and they’d be so surprised.( some guys actually got turned off about it ) and i felt secluded in that situation like im such a weird or a loser. Now, i did try to get a license, a passed the written test but failed the behind-the-wheel test 2x already. ( one examiner called me “Awful” which was very sad). I did practice and enrolled myself to a driving school still it wasn’t enough. My co-students are actually 15 or 16 y/o and they passed (their parents probably supported them) unlike my parents who just say stuff but dont actually help u learn (tough love , it’s an asian thing i guess). But I’m already 22, freaking 22 y/o girl who can’t drive , i honestly want to give up but i can’t cuz i live here now. I say to myself that i’ll probably just become like Cardi B who’s rich but can’t drive or Sometimes i want to blame California or US cuz other 1st world countries have good public transportation why can’t US have that. But that’s not a reality, that’s not my reality. 

I enrolled myself again to a driving school so im still trying even if i dont really want to anymore.

401,"So. Basically. It’s 13:33 right now. School lunch is over, and I thought I ate enough. Turns out I was wrong and I’m now starving and in pain thanks to that. There’s still four hours left of the day and I have no clue what to do. 

I can’t go to the store because 1. Leaving school grounds during school hours is not permitted (even though this is college...) and 2. My mom would beat the shit out of me if I spent money without asking for permission. I asked for permission during a similar situation a few weeks ago, and she responded with ”you should have eaten at the school lunch. No.” Last time I also fainted because I was starving so that was fun.

402,"We've been together for two years and we're both girls. Her family is homophobic and she also wants to go to med school... I haven't felt like a priority in a while...

1. We both went overseas for six months at the same time (to different places). When we got home her parents found out about our relationship and it was a shitshow. I told her to ditch them and move in with me but she wanted to fix things with them. So for like two weeks I didn't see her.

2.  started tolerating us going on dates and stuff, then covid hit. I didn't really care much about it but shewas big on social distancing which felt like a copout. We fought a lot and sometimes I would get her to come over but not much. We would talk on the phone but it wasn't the same and she seemed way more okay with that than me.

3. Then she started studying for the MCAT. We would video call but it wasn't the same, lots of fights again. Finally I got her to agree to see me once a week but even that's barely anything. Of course I wanted her to do good but I also want a girlfriend that I can actually see, especially since I don't have any real friends here and my family lives far away. I was stuck in an apartment alone and really depressed, but she still kept saying she needs to study and covid this and that.

4. She had to retake the MCAT because of a test center problem. It wasn't her fault so I was ok with it but I told her to move away with me and take it in the new city. She said ok but she was really stressed so I told her to take it at home and meet me in the new town which she was happy about. She pays the expenses 50/50 (without even living here) but with the new plan I'm in this new city alone for a month.

5. She pushes back the test by two weeks because she feels like the first appointment time she got was a bad time for her (early in the morning). Now I have to be alone for a month and two weeks. We plan so that she's going to move right after the test.

6. She finally finishes the test and tells her parents she's moving with me. They freak out, she's really sad. Then her dad tries to fix things with her and she asks if its ok to spend time with them to fix things instead of moving right away. I say it's ok if you take a few days to try to fix things with them.

Today I talk to her about when she's supposed to show up and she says next weekend would be good (she was supposed to come this weekend). I just hung up on her. I'm sick of it.

405,"To explain, because I'm immensely depressed and lethargic, I recently decided to do something about my health and started working out six times a day at my local gym. There's this guy that works there who's a professional and has been super nice to me and about two days ago he asked me out( and no, I do not have feelings for him in any way). At that moment I froze, said no, and ran out of the gym. Since then, I feel extremely nervous and on edge every moment, like I'm in danger. I think about that moment every second and feel anxiety. Maybe it's because he was a large, jacked guy and I felt threatened or because I'm not very social and a person liking me came across as a shock. It could be that I questioned his intentions or the fact that I have to go back to the gym( I also take other classes there) and face the awkwardness. Or maybe he reminds me of my dad beating me as a kid, I don't know. But the main problem is that it's been a few days, and I still feel abnormally stressed out and tense about it. I have been recommended medication for my depression, but I chickened out and never got further help. Could my extreme tension atm be related to this? I have no idea what to do and what is happening.

(I’m not a native english speaker, so forgive me if I make some mistakes) 

Hear me out, please. I’ve been friends with this person, let’s call them Y, for almost ten years now, but lately I’ve been noticing some things about their personality that just... are a no from me. 

As the years have passed I’ve been unlearning sexist and other similar behaviours, because I want to be a better person, but this friend constantly chooses to be ignorant about many topics. A good example was when they said they agreed with J.K Rowling’s transphobic opinions and even though I tried to let them know I thought they were in the wrong, they refused to listen to other opinions. And it’s like that with a lot of situations; one time they even said that they thought sex between two men was disgusting in the same sentence that they were complaining about being called homophobic. 

They think they are always in the right, and that their beliefs are the correct ones, even political ones.

And lately I’ve had very little to zero patience when it comes to Y. I know the pandemic has taken a toll on a lot of us, and that some of us have trouble with mental health, but I feel like it’s not an excuse for the way they are behaving.

They get angry if I try to make a joke, they get angry if I tell them that they did something (TO ME) that I didn’t like and are constantly playing the victim. A friend of ours recently got into a relationship and the first thing they did was tell BOTH our friend and her bf that even tho THEY (Y) didn’t accept it bc they knew our friend was going to get hurt, they’d support her. And have constantly made comments about how they hate our friend’s partner. And I think it’s not fair at all, because when Y has chosen terrible partners we have never done stuff like that, and give our opinions only when asked, since we know Y will probably get mad.

Also, Y has this tendency to expose me. You guys have no idea HOW MANY TIMES they’ve let out a secret of mine or have made a comment about certain situation of mine that I simply did not want mentioned, in front of other people, and they think it’s funny and even admitted to sometimes doing it on PURPOSE.

Another friend of ours and I had a talk a few days ago and she seems to think that Y is not a good person.

The last straw for me was that I made a meme about us that I wanted to share on fb, but when I mentioned it was done, the first thing Y did was say ‘you can post that, but do NOT tag me on it’ because they care A LOT about how their fb profile looks and I got fed up. I said ‘and who the f*ck told you that I would be tagging you? i had no intentions of doing that, you idiot’ and more things that I won’t repeat. I KNOW I shouldn’t have said that and that they felt bad, but god, I just am so tired of their bullshit. 

I feel like our friendship is deteriorating bc they care way too much about things that don’t matter (like trying to be popular on social media) and not enough about other stuff (like being a better friend). Not that Y’s a bad friend bc they’ve helped me a lot of times and I helped them, too, but lately... I can’t stand them. They’re rude and so entitled... a couple of friends have told me that I should end the friendship but I don’t know what to do. And since then I’ve been really distant from them.

I do not try to talk to them and if I do sometimes I am rude to them. My friends say that should talk to Y but 1) I’m a coward and 2) I KNOW they will get mad. I know them, and they will create a whole circus if I tell them everything that’s been bothering me.

409,"If my brother ever sees this, keep quiet please.

You might've already guessed why my father wouldn't allow my mother to attend because of the pandemic, but there was also another cause.

My Uncle (Mom's Bro.) died recently due to diabetes, before he died he and his family were tested for the Covid in which he and my older cousin tested positive, awhile after that my uncle dies. They were planning on holding a funeral, but my cousin still have Covid and didn't take the necessary precautions like wearing a mask. The same goes for the people who lived with him in that house (he was isolated for 14 days, but that was it). Now we there's at least more than 5 people who live in our house so if my mom were to be infected the chances of everyone else getting sick is possible. Skip to today when my parents discuss about whether my mom goes or not they get into a big fight, they also as my opinion for the matter and I had to agree with my dad since he is  a bit old and had a few medical problems. Of course I didn't say my opinion out loud since my mom would most likely feel betrayed judging of her attitude. I'd like to express my concerns, but at the same time I never really properly mourned since I know that everyone will die and it would be better to die a short painless way than a long painful ride.

410," The story begins with my sister, who, about a year ago, finally relented and adopted a dog. She didn't want one but her three kids kept badgering her so she relented on the condition that her children fulfill their promise to care and train the dog. And so, Banjo, a drop-dead adorable chihuahua/terrier mix became a new member of her family.

The kiddies had done a good job dog-sitting my pooch but my dog came to them trained. Banjo, on the other hand, is a three-year-old untrained and unsocialized little Napoleon.

Fast forward one year, Banjo is still not house-trained and the kids only sporadically carried out their duty to walk/feed/train Banjo; which means it ends up being my sister and BIL that takes care of the dog most of the time. Worse, the children repeatedly interfere with Banjo's crate training by consistently taking him out of the crate to play and then left him unsupervised with free access to the house. As you can imagine, accidents are almost a daily occurrence; sometime thrice daily. On top of that, Banjo's cuteness is only matched by his stubbornness - he seems to understand he can't relieve himself inside the house, he just chose to ignore that understanding. To his credit, he stopped going #2 inside, but unfortunately not #1.

About a month ago my sister has had enough and surrender Banjo. The day before, my heartbroken nieces and nephews begged me to save Banjo. I offered to adopt Banjo but my sister shot it down. She said her kids need to learn responsibility and consequence - what kind of example would it set if they failed to live up to their end of the bargain but uncle just steps in and saves the day? She has a point but I thought the kids are just being kids - is it reasonable to expect elementary school age people to be responsible enough to raise a dog? I think perhaps Banjo was put in a no-win situation from the beginning. The kids told me Banjo yapped and tried to run back to them on the day of surrender. My sister told me my nephew cried.

In a surprising twist, my sister got a new dog a couple of days ago. I thought that undercuts her argument about her children learning responsibility and consequence, but she said this dog is for her not her kids. So it's alright.

Back to Banjo, he and my dog are like brothers - he loves following him around and copies what my dog does. He also likes me very much. There were times when I was leaving my sister's house that Banjo would run to my car and tried to jump in to go home with me and my dog. So yeah.

So here we are - I just saw Banjo's picture popped up on the adoption site. He looks confused and scared in the picture and it just breaks my heart. I know if submit an application for him, there is a good chance I get accepted. But....

\- my sister is not going to like it.

\- I don't know if I am capable of training Banjo. He seems very stubborn.

\- I don't know if I can take care of Banjo after shelter in place is lifted and I have much less time at home.

\- I don't know if this indeed set a bad example for my nieces and nephews.

On the other hand, if I do adopt him, I have no doubt it'd be a really good situation for him. He gets to reunite with his brother and he gets to stay with me - I dog sat him a few times and he always love being here. I can picture him sitting in the adoption center right now looking for me to come in and rescue him.

My heart wants me to go save him, but my overly logical brain is telling me to just leave it alone. It's just a dog. He'll get a new family and be happy. Why cross my sister over a dog? It's not worth it.

412,"Sorry for the vagueness but as my partner uses reddit (not this sub, but still) I'm worried they'll work out this is me and get upset.

 I am in a group of people who face difficulties from groups trying to take away our access to needed facilities, though I've only met a few people from these groups, I'm hyper aware about the risk these groups have to people like me (even though I think in reality this risk is pretty minimal). This hyper awareness does lead me to jump to conclusions when people say certain phrases these groups also say (though people rarely mean it in the way these groups do). 

My partner said one of these phrases in a discussion a few weeks back and I snapped saying how that thinking leads to a death for people like me. They understandably got annoyed, saying that whenever they state things like that I always bring it back to being a threat to me, when that's never what they mean. I apologised and aim to improve myself so I'm less emotional on this topic and just generally a better person. 

They've moved on from this now, but I still feel extremely guilty for making them feel demonised, but I don't know where to start in stopping myself finding this topic emotional. I don't want to ask my partner, because I know they'll feel bad leading me to feel like I need to change. I know if I stop feeling as emotional on topics like this it will improve my relationships (both with my partner and with friends) as well as improve me as a person, so I think pursuing this change will be a good thing.

418,"I have a mix of pretty bad personal issues that affect my wellbeing. I've been looking for professional help but it's been a struggle due to 1) not clicking with the professional and 2) tight finances

My partner and I have been e-dating for about 3 months now. While I'm quiet and prone to avoidant anxiety, my partner is more headstrong and has had outbursts from insecurity. Because of their personality, they've really allowed me to open up, step out of my comfort zone and I'm talk through most things. But whenever I start to withdraw or be avoidant (which is often) my partner gets upset and say some things that can hurt. 

Earlier today, I was going to phone my grandpa for a casual talk but froze before I could dial the number and was opting to give up.

I try to defuse the situation by making light of the situation and explaining why I'm freezing up and they tell me ""I don't want to anymore of your excuses! It's just a phone call!"" before saying they'd break up with me if I didn't make that call. In the end I couldn't phone my grandpa and they ended our online call. 

After both of us cooled off, I go to check on them, apologize for what happened and ask if they were angry. They apologized and told me that they weren't angry but felt alienated and powerless whenever I let my anxiety take over. They want me to keep stepping out of my comfort zone and want to help expose me to the things that stresses me out (similar to exposure therapy) so that I don't keep living a life dictated by anxiety. 

I understand why they did what they did but it still hurt. I also understand that I do need to confront my anxiety head on but it often feels like I get pushed when I'm not ready to do so yet.

When we were young I have fond memories of us playing and getting along really well. Something happened in our adolescence and he just started to be so mean. They'd call me fat, stupid, ugly. Yell at me for things that are out of my control. Make fun of things im interested in. 

My sibling was talented and smarter than me. I was never the sharpest crayon in the box, but they would flaunt how smart they were, or how good at guitar they were at me all the time. My parents would brag about them at parties and show them off like the trophy child. 

Whenever I had friends over my sibling would barge in and make jokes, entertain my friends. At first its cool because you're just hanging out, but after a while they would make fun of me and overshadow me. They would use the excuse ""im just teasing, we all make fun of each other here"". 

Eventually they'd tell me I'm not allowed to hang out with ""his"" friends because I'm ""less fun"" to be around. Maybe I'm a bit of a drag and im a bad person to hang out with but people would always ask why I dont hang out with them. I never had an excuse. My sibling just didn't want me there. I'm always afraid of losing friends because I'm scared they'll like my sibling more than me. 

We drifted apart even more when we became adults. We both moved out of our parents house, they moved to a city 6hrs away, im not too far from home. We would interact every once in a while on Facebook but never a real conversation with each other for almost 5 years. 

Until I get a phone call. My sibling got into a car accident a few years ago and won their settlement. They've had $20,000 waiting for them at a law office in our hometown for a few years but they never stopped to pick it up. Never desperately needed the cash until about now. They have to be the ones who walk into the law office themselves to pick up the check, I cant simply go into there and pick it up and mail it. 

They don't have a car and apparently didn't have money for a greyhound to deal with this urgent issue. At first I was told that they had lost their job due to covid and had some damage to their apartment they had to fix. Whatever, they're family, im not here to judge, im here to help. I'll take care of them. I'll drive the 6 hours and pick them up. Then another six hours back to our hometown. Then another 6 to drop them off. Then another six back home. Oh and this trip is going to collide with our grandmas birthday! So I won't be going to that either. 

It turns out later that my sibling was involved in some legal trouble and needed some money to lay low until the police find a different thing to worry about. No warrants or anything with their name on it, but a picture of them committing a crime. They didn't get fired or lose their apartment either. I work a job that I can lose if im caught doing anything illegal and this son of a bitch has me harboring a fugitive? Not to mention, this fucker is $20,000 richer and didn't even bother to pay for fucking gas? Call me entitled but you could buy me gas or lunch or something... 

On top of that, they haven't spoke to my parents in months. My mom and my sibling got into some type of argument about politics or something (my mom is a boomer, i cant help her stupid politics) and my sibling refuses to let up. This happened a few weeks before my trip to pick them up. They won't speak to my mom or my dad. Its taking a huge toll on them. I try to visit whenever I can because I can see how its affecting them. Theres liquor bottles all over the house, kitchen is a mess, the dog keeps getting more toys. 

I have to keep it a secret that I saw and talked to my sibling but I also have to keep my parents happy when their favorite kid is ignoring them. Keeping up the lie and saying ""oh no I haven't heard much from my sibling at all"" really sucks. 

Honestly I'm not sure if they even realised how I felt. Almost like Gamora and Nebula's relationship in the Marvel universe. I feel like a resentful prick and my sibling is gamora, woefully unaware that I just want to have a family. When they needed my help I hoped that trip we could hash some things out and repair this relationship. Its not the case at all. They had their headphones in the entire ride and I just listened to the radio and avoided getting speeding tickets. 

My relationship with my sibling would be fine if we just remained Facebook acquaintances. We could go our own paths in life and just greet each other on birthdays or some shit but this feels irreparable. On top of that my strained relationship with them is breaking up our parents mental health. Ive tried to let them know maybe they should just reach out and say hello but they won't bother. I dont know what to do anymore. The more I think about them the more I get angry at them. 

TL;DR my sibling has treated me like shit since we were kids. Now they're treating my parents like shit. I also had to put 1200 miles on my car to pick them up and they wouldn't even buy me a bag of chips.",05Oct2020,1
424,"Obligatory mobile post apologies and I’ve had to edit this down a lot. Thankyou for your time:) 

IfI were asked who my first bully was I’d say it was my mom. Ever since I was young she has constantly made comments about my appearance and my personality.’ She would frequently make comments about my body, start dieting out of nowhere as a fun family thing (!), and leave her google search history open with things like ‘ my child is fat what do I do’ open and would complain that me getting lifts from my dad to the gym was a nuisance and got in the way. She only started praising me after I lost weight and had a glow up. 

This led to serious self esteem issues and social anxiety of course, I self harmed often and developed a warped sense of self and body. I didn’t eat for two weeks and exercised every day. At 12 I allowed myself cheat days and meals. 

I grew out of it and loved myself more. She began complimenting me but hit me with ‘ are you sure you should wear that, your stomach is showing’ type comments. She stopped once she realised they didn’t affect me like they used to. 

Just now I mentioned I wanted to dye my hair and she told me I needed to make hard decisions in order to be a lawyer and would fail if I didn’t. Harsher words were used. I replied that this issue is so superficial and trivial and that my future career has nothing to do with it. She then said that I make her feel like shit and she’s sorry she’s a bad person and I’m so sensitive. 

I feel like I’m being gaslighted or have been since I was young. I feel awful, after years of repressing my emotions and how badly her words hurt me I finally am working through it and inviting open communication. But I’m met with the fact that I make my own mother feel like shit and a bad person all because I’m ‘ sensitive’. I don’t know what to do, it’s just a constant mind fuck all the time. I can feel the emotions so I know they are real but the constant ‘ you’re overreacting and sensitive and actually the problem’ make it so hard to work through.

426,"We have known our next door neighbors for about 5 years and we get along really well. We often will get together for dinner and hang out. They have a daughter in her mid 20’s who we also get along great with. She is a very responsible 20-something, very mature, no partying or drugs and hardly any drinking. She has a masters degree and has been working in her field for about 9 months.

Our neighbors recently accepted a job offer in another state and they are going to move, but their daughter wants to stay in the area in order to have more experience at her job. (She has been there less than a year.) She plans to move closer to them in a year or so. In the meantime, she’s talking about getting an apartment. The apartments in our area are crazy expensive considering it’s a rural community. A one bedroom in a “safe” area of town is $1,200.

My husband and I have discussed offering our guest room to her as a rental. He thinks it would work out great, I go back and forth. Sometimes you don’t really know someone until you live with them...what if she’s not as great as we think she is? What if we’re not as great as she thinks we are? I feel like we most likely would get along, but there’s always that chance of things going awry. What if she has some weird habit we can’t deal with? I’d hate to commit to letting her live there for a year and then some or all of us are miserable.

Any advice?",05Oct2020,1

428,"(I apologise for any grammar errors, suffer a bit from dyslexic so bear with me lol)

I have struggled with a lot issues from around the age of 12 with relationships with family and external people and life in general  have always been unhappy in sense?. But I always loved doing school work, working and trying to improve myself personally. But after being out of school for 6 months and losing my job early into the covid shit show, in a sense my life was train and it has completely detailed and have lost myself in the misery of it all.

I have started my first year of university doing a mechanical engineering ( I love knowing how things work and being creative well, I used to anyway a year ago when i choose the course ) I don't regret picking and I want to go down the line of work and have planned this for a couple years. Currently just finished an online class and just completely lost with everything, Overwhelmed in a sense? 

When it comes to friendships I've never really had tight group of people just people dropping in and out of my life with no massive connections which honestly I'm content with I enjoy my own company and love having peace to myself but it's difficult to maintain a positive attitude on my own as I get caught up on my thoughts. I've had two ""relationships"" one last a year and another last around 6-12months and were as successful as the titanic were always set up to fail in the end looking back.

So it's just everywhere I look is just misery with no escape and personally finding it's difficult to focus on what's important. I would also say I've lost my motivation to be disciplined in my ways I find it harder to get off of watching a show or playing video games to do something productive always negotiating with myself. Usually never ends well as motivation is scarce so discipline is all that really kept me in my work.

I miss doing exercise at the gym I was at it was my favourite place to be but shocker again covid fucked that up an now there isn't another gym within 40mins of my home. I could exercise at home yes but, I like separating my life rather than doing everything at home I would much prefer going somewhere and not giving myself the temptation to stop what I doing.

Again, Sorry about any poor grammar but yeah just rambling on a little but any suggestions to get me back on track would be great.

Thanks",05Oct2020,1

433,"Most days now I’m getting maybe an hour or two of sleep for work. As soon as I started this job, my mom started to make me fake timesheets for a different job I never even went to, making me transfer all the money to her. Apparently it has to do with education as I’ve seen the check and it comes from a school. I feel so terrified of that, I have such bad anxiety, but I can’t say no because I live here and I start losing my composure when she degrades me for saying no. I’m also on a medley of medications for disorders I might not even have, as I’ve been trying to find out what’s wrong with me psychologically, and changing meds and stopping meds so often has my emotions really crazed. 

At my real job I work at a gym, and with all of this going on I’ve repeatedly asked to not work mornings for over a month, saying I wasn’t doing very well. Repeatedly, but apparently I’m the only person in the company that can work these terrible shifts. My grandpa died two weeks ago and I wasn’t allowed to have any time off. I feel like I’m starting to crack, being used at home and at work, but I’d feel so guilty quitting my job just so I can try to pick myself up and go stay with someone else until I can get things under control. I don’t want to break the law, but I’m so mentally susceptible and weak that I can’t fight her on it. I can’t focus at work, and I take breaks to just try to keep breathing because I’m tired of not having an education and working these awful jobs when it seems like the grandest task to try to take care of myself.

I’ve been depressed and I recovered a little bit from anorexia as soon as I started this job, but all feelings of motivation and vigor I had to start something new is only replaced with this dread of life, I want to leave it all behind so bad it hurts. I want to say no, to hell with everything, quit, leave my mom- as I luckily have support to help me- but I’m afraid of inconveniencing them when they’ve done right by me once upon a time.

434,"I’ve known my friend for about 2 years and he’s never acted mean like this for no reason. But basically we were playing a game that I take seriously, and he started being annoying by wasting resources that I needed. After that, I followed another team mate expecting him to follow, but he didn’t, and when we ended up catching up to him, he jumped off a cliff in-game and left. I was upset and asked him why, and he just got mad and blamed me for following the other team mate and going to get supplies when he wanted to attack enemies. Then, he started laughing and left the voice chat after I said I didn’t want to play another game. I cried after he left because I just try to be nice and I felt like he resented me for reasons unknown. 

It probably just sounds stupid but i’m not upset about the game, i’m just upset about the way he said things and how he blamed me, it felt so bitter. Maybe i’m just overreacting and being childish for crying over nothing, but this really hurt me. I really cannot handle when someone is acting meanly to my face for no reason.

453,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

So, me and my boyfriend started dating when I was 19 and he was 22. He was super protective and caring of me, we had great communication out of bed and he didn't want to rush me into sex (I was a virgin). I remember being freaked out when I first told him I wanted to have sex, and he wanted to make sure I was 100% comfortable, and said he wanted to wait until I was ready (which we did). Early on in our relationship, after we had sex, I told him I want to be whipped until I bled (something I'd never done before). 

He was freaked out, cautioned me about doing such a thing in bed and said that it might not be a good idea for us to do, out of fear for my safety. But I assured him that I could handle it and it was something that I really wanted to do, sexually. A couple of weeks later, he decided to do it. He whipped me in bed, until I bled. Mid-way throughout, he asked me if everything was okay, and I told him it was. At a certain point, he went to the bathroom and brought me tissues. I was too hurt to use them, so he simply put them next to m. I mustered the courage to use them, and started crying, and he told me to go to bed thinking about how he made me his little bitch - with no aftercare once it was all done. This entire experience made me super uncomfortable, caused me some nightmares, and a couple of days after, I decided to tell him how it all made me feel, and thinking he went too far. He apologised, felt terrible and said he would never do such a thing again. I decided to break up with him.

However, we remained friends after the incident, and I am considering giving him another chance. Is what my ex-boyfriend did unforgivable? Am I wrong for wanting to give him a second chance?",05Oct2020,1

It’s so absurd and I feel like we can’t talk to any of them without it being about politics which is very alienating for us, and also super distressing.

But that mixed with rising COVID cases causing panic and things shutting back down, and the dreadful seasonal depression starting to kick in... Man is it hard.

We’ve both been experiencing immense sadness for “seemingly no reason” (of course I’m sure it has a lot to do with all the above factors, it’s just that nothing in particular seems to be triggering it at any given time). Not only that, but it’s like we can’t even help each other because we both just feel the same way. We’re both so drained. 

I’m wondering what you guys have been doing to keep yourselves from slipping into this deep dark hole.

It felt easier at first (back in like, March/April) thinking that there is a “light at the end of the tunnel” but I feel like we keep expecting to see an end in sight and there just isn’t one, or it keeps moving further and further away. One of my ways I’ve always used to cope with my depression and anxiety is to think about the next thing I’m looking forward to doing (ex: a vacation, a concert, etc). 

But now it’s so hard to have things to look forward to; when all of those things are suddenly things we simply can’t do (or shouldn’t do due to the pandemic). It feels like the only thing to look forward to is the end of this whole thing, but like I said before... God knows when that will be...

We’ve tried to channel our hobbies (art, music, whatever) but the weight of everything seems so heavy neither of us have the desire to actually do any of those things. We always start but end up just giving up after trying to be engaged for more than 5 minutes...

Anyways, any advice would be appreciated. I hope you’re all doing well. I know this post sounds so depressing, but a better time WILL come. It’s just hard right now...and it might be for a while.",05Oct2020,1

459,"I (21f) was with my boyfriend (27m) for 6 months. I “technically” broke up with him.....I say technically because when I did it, I was just angry. It was one of those situations where I was like “ i’m done with you don’t talk to me ever again” - but I didn’t mean it. I didn’t think it would actually happen. I tried to reconcile but he was short with me so I took it as a sign to just let it be.

It’s been almost a month since the break up. I’m literally not sleeping, eating and can’t even watch a movie without getting distracted thinking about him. 

Since the break up i’ve done a lot of self reflecting on our relationship and know where I need to improve. However im feeling conflicted on what to do because I almost feel like he was always just a prize to my ego. I have a lot of self esteem issues so I often struggle with wondering if i’m really in love with someone or if i’m in love with the thought of them. And in this particular connection, I feel like I used him for my own benefit.

I haven’t been able to get over the fact that he is the one ultimately choosing to walk away. I always figured if we broke up I’d be the one to do it. I feel desperate to chase after him almost only just to feel like “ i’ve won “. Obviously I know this is a really shitty mentality to have. I just don’t know how to accept this feeling of abandonment. 

Any advice?",05Oct2020,1

461,So first off I was brought up Muslim and I'm gay. I'm agnostic and don't really believe in Islam. Anyway I've been struggling with internalised homophobia even after months of coming out to many people and trying to accept myself for it. But growing up Muslim it gets engraved into your brain that being gay is the worse thing you can be. It depresses me and me thinking about what my family would do to me if I came out gives me so much anxiety and I can't stop thinking about it. I've already told them about how I'm agnostic and they yelled at me and called me sick. Having your son/daughter be gay and a non believer is like the biggest disappointment you can ask for in a Muslim family and I don't want them to think less of me just because of who I find attractive or who I wanna marry. I haven't said anything about being gay but since I was young they have thrown the f slur at me and made jokes about me being gay and harrased me for it which just makes me more depressed.,05Oct2020,1

465,"All,

I am pretty certain this will not get much traction, but if possible I'd appreciate if anyone can shed some thoughts.

I (26M) dating (30F). We have been together since Aug 2020. We have had a whirlwind of a relationship , She has come from a hella lot of trauma and myself too. We are both happy, getting along and really looks like things could be progressing in a positive way.

A few weeks ago, she took my virginity. Yep, I was one of those saving it for Jesus. It wasn't an issue for me, and since we have done the deed 4-5 times. 

Regardless, my lady was previously married for 6 years. Thats great, and of course she has done the deed with her ex-husband before.

That always was an issue for me prior to meeting her, guess due to my own insecurity however, I enquired into her sexual history. There was a chap before me, who she had known for around 3 months and dated for 4 months. She had sex with him around 4 times. She really did like that guy, and saw wedding bells with him. It didn't work out.

What has happened, is unlike thinking about the moments with her ex, I've become obssessed with the thoughts of her and her ex-bf. She has praised me for my size, my style and how I make her feel.

I have become overwhelmingly uncomfortable in the past day, thinking fuck.. was he bigger? They done it 4 times probably numerous times. Is anything im doing brand new? This girl told me that sex for her is sacred, but she shared it with dude (clearly as she saw a future wit him) SOUNDS STUPID.. but I was the first person to ever buy her a gift, is this the truth?

I feel like im so off balance right now. I was never concerned, intact confident about myself wit her. she loves me, we are really hitting it off, working on each others energy. She makes me feel amazing and I do the utmost best to do that, she's obsessed.

Whats up with me fam? Why am I more focused on her ex-bf as opposed to her ex husband? why has this form of retrospective jealousy hit me so hard?

Any of ya'll can relate?

(Side note, of the Purple pill school of thought, holding myself to some tough macho bravo but I am really fucking breaking behind my ask)

TLDR; I'm retrospectively jealous over my partners exBF. I am questioning every single sexual move, look and smile. Its killing me.",05Oct2020,1
467,"Ever since the start of this year, my relationship with my dad has been pretty sore. It might be because I'm a teen, maybe it's COVID or the social unrest or who knows. Anyways, my dad and I have been butting heads recently, and I'm just paranoid about everything. I always have to avoid him, and he always does weird things around me.

First of all, he is very annoying. Every time he talks to me, he hits the palm of his left hand with the side of his right hand, as if he was cutting bread. It's so annoying when he does that. He is probably just trying to make a point, but I don't believe that is in the Standard International Dictionary of Body Language. It's gross when he does that, and he also touches me when he talks to me. I feel sexually harassed when he does that to me, but I don't say anything about it because he will get angry.

And he has terrible anger issues as well. Anything small thing can tick him off, and he yells and stomps around the house. I'm so scared when he is angry, it's almost as if he wants me to be scared of him at all times. When he gets angry, he usually wont forgive people for the next couple weeks.

Also, he has gross hygiene habits. He wears a pair of skin-tight pants in the house, and he drinks water out of a mason jar. I've suggested buying him a mug many times, but he just says no and insists on drinking out of a mason or former pickle jar. Also, every time he eats a muffin, he tears it up into small pieces. I don't know why he does this. It's not like he's feeding birds or has braces or anything. When he makes a sandwich, he uses his dirty hands to grab out all the ham or cheese, and he puts his nose up to it and sniffs it really loudly. I literally have to take red duct tape and put an ""X"" on the foods he sniffs.

He is really ugly as well. He has puffy hair, bulgy eyes, a thick unibrow, tons of wrinkles, an ugly, weird face, a double chin, stray whiskers growing on his face, large breasts, a potbelly, and thick thighs. I can't believe my mom even married someone like him. I really wish I was adopted or that he is my step-dad. I shave regularly and exercise my butt off, just so I don't have to look like my dad.

And he has stinky breath. When he talks, I can smell his bad breath. He brushes his teeth, but apparently he still has bad breath. It's probably because he is overweight or because he eats too much.

I've tried talking to my dad before, as well as talking to my mom. However, my mom won't change at all, and there's no way I can leave the house. The worst part is that my dad disconnected my computer and my sister's computer from the printer. He says it's because of a new router, but I think he changed the printer settings on purpose. Since I have to print a lot of stuff for school, I have no choice but to send my documents to my dad to print. And when I go in his room, he always lectures me or tries to talk to me. I just hate him. ""My dad is my enemy"" is basically my motto, my bio on social media, and my catchphrase.

Also I hate talking to him. We disagree on all issues, from big issues like what I should study in college to political issues to religious issues to things about other people. He tries to brainwash me with his messed up value systems. And every time he talks to me, I have to cry. I can't believe I have to cry like a 5 year old girl when he talks to me. I cry only when my dad talks to me, which probably stems from my hatred of him. I really wish God gave me a different father.",05Oct2020,1

469,"For context I have adhd.

I cannot string together a coherent sentence **for shit**, unless I either pause with ""umm"" or I'm trying to talk while someone is interrupting me. Even if I prepare the speech in my head before saying it out loud, by the time I have finished thinking of the sentence, someone else will have interjected and my window to say something will be gone. Also, sometimes I piss myself off with the amount of times I have to say ""umm"" while I am talking. I wish I didn't do it. There are times where I can split my sentence into two completely separate passages of speech (giving me time to think), but these opportunities are few and far apart.

471,"Hi,

I feel I have little knowledge of finance, money, and how the world works. I don't know where to start I keep grasping one straw after the other and in the end, give up when it gets twisted. I try to make sense of things but always fall short. 

I need to understand the basic terminologies used in everyday life and finance sectors when it comes to money and similar instruments. 

I am interested in learning how money works, in companies, firms, and on a world scale. How investments work and how business decisions are made. How one factor helps propel or drag down the other. How companies are evaluated and how people go about predicting a companies future or markets overall. 

People might say these are common sense but I have absolutely zero knowledge about these. I know these are complex things that will need time and I am willing to put that time. what I need is a path so that concept are much clearer than just random words floating inside my head.

I hope to get replies from people who can give fashion or style advice here.

I've been really feeling self conscious about myself and my appearance. This has multiple reasons:

1 I wear a hijab, and I wear it more ""strict"" than women and girls in my area. 
(I don't show my ankles nor feet, I don't show my arms, not even past the joint of my hand, my chest is covered by a scarf at all times; I can't wear jeans nor jogging pants, only long skirts and dresses; nothing tight fitting, even when wearing a skirt I need something long to cover up my ass area. People aren't supposed to see my torso area neither.)

2 I'm not allowed to wear make up or nail polish, not even clear nail polish

3 I can't wear any kind of jewelery, my parents allow rings tho but they look ugly on my long fingers.

I'm not particularly ugly or beautiful. I'm normal looking

All my friends are stylish and have super cool clothes and I just look like an idiot with ugly clothes and plain shoes.

476,"i am 24 now. i've been putting off driving as long as i possibly could because it terrifies me. (my parents didnt want us driving until we were 18 anyway because onf insurance costs and stuff) i dont really know how to describe how much i dont want to drive, but the best way i can think about it is this: i have never had a panic attack, so i dont really know how one feels, but sitting in the drivers seat of a car is the one thing that has ever made me feel like i would actually have a panic attack. 

it's not like i've been mooching rides off of everyone because i dont drive. i'm lucky enough to live in a city with really good public transportation. i went to and from university on the bus all five years i was there. i take the bus to and from work. if i want to hang out with friends, either i take the bus and meet them at the spot, or i carpool with one of them. there has only been a handful of times i havent been able to do something i wanted to do because i don't drive/have a car. it's happened so few times i could probably count them all on one hand. i dont need to drive.

however, my dad wants me to. he's practically forcing me to at this point. 

he claims that i dont actually have to drive once i get my license, but i know thats a lie. even now, when all i have is a permit, he sends me on errands for him and my stepmom. i know its not gonna stop just cuz i get my license. in fact, im pretty sure they're only gonna make me drive more, which, like i said, terrifies me like crazy.

but since i dont seem to have much of a choice, i'm trying to get over this fear. i know the basics of driving, but no one really wants to help me learn. they expect me to be proactive and just go hop in the car and drive around, but im just not capable of handling that, especially on my own. everyone is scared of me wrecking their car, or they have to return the car theyre leasing soon so they cant afford to have me mess it up, or they just dont want to help, or something like that. the only person was at least kind of open to helping me was my older sister. but she doesnt live with us, and because of the covid, my parents dont want anyone coming over or us going to someone else, so she can't help me. so i'm pretty much on my own.....

the only ""advice"" that people give me is ""you just gotta do it, you get used to it eventually"" or ""its not that scary. stop worrying so much"" and that doesnt help the fact that my heart is pounding in my chest at high speeds and my stomach is in my mouth any time i try to drive a car. if any of you have any actually useful tips, i would greatly appreciate it",05Oct2020,1

478,"Sorry, I’m not actually sure if I should be posting this here. But I’ll try to explain. This almost might be NSFW. 

I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for almost a year. We’ve known each other much longer and up until yesterday, have had little disagreements but never a major fight. But I found out he had been watching porn and had lied to me about it. I was raised by an incredibly religious (Baptist and Protestant Christian) family and had been forced in my younger teenage years to attend many anti-porn conferences. They usually talked about why porn was cheating, why anyone who watches it has an addiction, that you’re committing infidelity in your relationship and that you’re committing the greatest possible sin by lusting after another person. I have since drifted away from the religions I was raised on (for different reasons), but up until yesterday, I hadn’t realized why I was uncomfortable with porn. Early in our relationship I had expressed to my partner that I was uncomfortable with porn, and he agreed to not watch it while I took more time to explore my feelings on it. 

Yesterday I had discovered he had been watching it and tried to hide it. We had a fight followed by many discussions about why I was more hurt by the lying than the porn itself. He and I have decided to continue moving forward and hope that rebuilding the trust will make for a stronger relationship, because neither of us want to end things over this. 

I’ve spent the past day reading articles about porn in relationships and what it means to normal couples. I’m learning that not everyone believes it to be cheating, and a lot of people actually view it as a healthy aspect of their relationship. I want to confirm, I have never watched porn. I honestly don’t know what the content really is like. My partner does not use it as a replacement for me, nor does he build an emotional connection to it or the people in it. 

My seeking for advice is not about how to fix the trust that was broken, as we’re working on a solution that works for us. But I’m not really sure how to break out of the religious conditioning I was subjected to when I was younger that greatly changed my view on this topic. If you were raised in an intensely religious upbringing that installed deep rooted beliefs on “normal” things, how did you decondition? Especially in healthy romantic relationships? I’m not really sure of the first steps besides reading non-biased articles. I’m wanting to try viewing this as someone without those deep rooted feelings attached, potentially to change my perspective.",05Oct2020,1
479,"Now I don’t usually use Reddit but right now I really need some help. For the last 2 days I’ve been getting a nightmare, honestly one of the worst ones I’ve gotten so far. It started with me being in an apartment. My neighbors door opened (can’t remember how I got to his door) but we were ok friends (he’s this guy I find attractive online) so I walked in jokingly, I turned around and knocked on his door and he laughed and opened it twice. We got inside his apartment and just chatted for a bit, over time he slowly turned into my cousin. Like he himself wasn’t even him anymore, he became my cousin so it was her apartment and she opened the door and everything. I didn’t notice this difference in the dream but I noticed it when I woke up. Anyways, we were talking about family and how life was, until I finally noticed something... my nephew wasn’t there. I asked her where he was, he lives with her. She became quiet, didn’t say a word. She started changing, her face looked almost like a clown? But without the makeup, her face itself was the makeup, her mouth became the horrifying plaster of something I could say satan himself looks like, her eyes turned black, and she called herself something, “kaffa?” “Kanna?” “Kanfa?” I can’t remember but some variation of that, she then took a share of broken glass (I don’t remember where she got it from) and she stabbed me with it as I was trying to run away for my life, I couldn’t do anything but stay there as she stabbed me. It was almost as if my soul left my body and I was watching myself get stabbed by her, but I could feel every time she dug that shard through my skin even as though I was only watching myself.

My second dream was almost the same. Except this time it wasn’t the dude I found attractive online, it was my family that lived at my cousins house irl (her, her 2 brothers, their wives, and my nephew). We were all in the car, we were having such a fun time, I didn’t remember anything from the dream before at the time. Everyone was happy and nothing was out of place. Until someone said that my nephew wasn’t in the car... and all of a sudden everything hit me, I remembered my dream before. I screamed her name (whatever her name was) and my cousin transformed again, she became the same horrifying creature, she grabbed a shard of glass and stabbed everyone with it, I was in the very back seat so I had to watch all of them get stabbed one at a time, and then I got stabbed. This time I didn’t watch myself, I just woke up instead.

Something I forgot to mention, in both the dreams there’s supposed to be 2 creatures. I don’t know how I figured out there’s 2 of them, I don’t know how the other one looked or what it’s name is, all I know is that there are 2 of them, in both dreams. The second one just either never showed up or I don’t remember it.",05Oct2020,1

Let me first introduce myself: I am a student living in Germany and I’ve been searching for a job for almost half a year. Right now, I need help in one particular case: I applied for a job at a local supermarket ca. 6 weeks ago. After 3 weeks of waiting I called the manager of the market, but didn’t get him on the phone, because he was on vacation. So I tried it again last week and the manager immediately told me that I should call him the next day. No sooner said than done, I called him again the next day. He told me he would call me the next day to make an appointment for me to come. I was really happy and waited and waited. But no call. 

Even after 3 days ( to be fair 2 of them were no work days) I still didn’t hear anything. 

What should I do now? 
Should I just forget the job and move on?
Should I call him once again?
Should I just keep on waiting?

My parents have never been the affectionate type so they never complimented me on anything that I can remember. They also haven’t missed a chance to spot my flaws. Both of these things, they say, are to make me strong because the world will point out my flaws otherwise so it’s better that they do it. However, the world is supposed to bring me down, isn’t it? If I do something wrong in school/college, my teachers will punish me for it. If I slip up at work, they’ll criticise me and discipline me for it. I think that parents, therefore, should be supportive and encouraging. 
My mother told me today that some of her friends (while they were with more people) commented on my flaws and so I should correct those flaws. And I asked her if she defended me at all and she replied “why would I defend them when they are right?” Those “flaws” are the reason for my lifelong esteem issues so I was very hurt by this. Her relatives do the same all the time and she stays quiet even then because of the same reason.
I have never allowed my friends to comment negatively about my parents so I find it a little weird that they allow their friends to pass comments on their child (even though my parents never say anything about anyone else’s children).

Anyway i spoke to them about my mental health and life events. I mentioned i miscarried my son in the beginning of the year and the effect it had during lock down then i mentioned i want to have a child in the future.  I am currently working toward becoming nurse. They  then said i should have a baby or work with vulnerable people because of my mental health.

I feel terrible for a multitude of reasons especially lately it’s probably depression but I wouldn’t know since every time I suggest something is wrong with my head my parents push the idea away (I hate that at 20 I’m reliant on them for stuff like this). Another thing is that lately I’ve been feeling like such a burden on my friends who usually just want to help, and whenever they do try I and up getting annoyed and usually shut in more. I’ve lost interest in so much and just wish I could enjoy things again. I’ve also had an absolutely ridiculous crush on one of my best friends for what feels like 2 years now and I feel like I am ruining that friendship because of the way I feel about her. We used to talk about every day now it’s once a week if lucky but we still Hang out in a group at least once a week so idk.

492,"I'm 14f and I have a older brother older brother(16) with autism. Both my brother and I live with our mom and I want to move in with my dad. 

Background/more info- My parents haven't been together since I was 5. They are friends but my mom is a hard person to talk to. If you disagree with what she believes is right she'll go nuts. For a while my mom has been living with her parents who are divorced as well. My older brother was diagnosed with autism when he was about 3-4 I think. When my brother gets mad he'll throw stuff push stuff off of shelfs and hit. When I was younger I learned kinda fast not to get involve with him when that was happening. I will usually lock myself in my bedroom with a bat and make sure I have my phone in case he does something that harms someone. In my opinion he's a smart kid he knows what he's doing. When my mom threaten to take take he stuff he'll go nuts casue to him his stuff is his stuff no one can take it not even if you want to look at it. When my mom does take his stuff he'll say sorry and act all sad and get it back. Then sometimes the same thing will happen. I do really care for my brother I don't think he's a monster at all but right now I'm afraid  of what he could do.

My breaking point- With covid going on I've been doing school at home and I lock my bedroom door so then people don't just walk in. My bedroom has a bathroom in it and it's pretty much the only one anyone use's because almost every bathroom is broken or if someone needs to shower. I don't have a choice but to let them in because then I'll get yelled at. Even with the lock on my door anyone can get in if the just take a screwdriver to it and just push it. My brother and I go to same school but my mom took him out and is having to homeschool him. she got mad because my brother was still doing get to know me assignments for about 2-4 weeks. With how my mom has been doing homeschool she teaches my brother about different places. She prints out flags for him to paint. I paint a lot for a hobby so my mom ask if she could use my paint. I let get because I I can't say no. So I asked what color she needs and I got them. My brother usually doesn't come with her. So this happened recently my mom had come in to ask for some blue and yellow paint, while I was in school. So I let her in and my brother came too. Which I didn't think anything was gonna happen because there was no indication of what was gonna happen. I open a drawer where I have my yellow paint and my brother went to grab some really good yellow paint so I with out thinking went to get it out of his hand and when I did get it and put it back he hit me. Like kinda hard he left a red marked. I was in shock and I don't think I had time to think because my grandma had put some newspaper down on my desk and my brother saw that a hit it off. I was afraid he would push my computer off so I went towards my desk and covered my stuff with my body. My mom saw the whole thing and told him to get out and he said ""NO"" my brother was right behind me and I was just getting ready to get hit again. My mom had to kinda pull him out and she said sorry and left to deal with him. She closed my door and left. After she left I just started crying at this point my face didn't hurt at all it was just the fact that it happened. After a while my mom came back and said that he never be allowed in my bedroom. again except when he needs to shower. After she left again I went to get something to calm myself. after about 10-15 minutes my brother knocked on my door and said sorry and left. I heard my mom say ""good boy"". I didn't really think he was because knowing my mom she made him do it. Later that night her and I got into an argument. I told her I wanted new lock with a key so then I could keep my door locked at all times. Because I thought she said he wasn't allowed in my bedroom at all. She had told him that he's not allowed in my bedroom when I'm in there. Which to me is just idk because if your gonna say he's not allowed in bedroom then why would you let him in. Then my mom went the rotate that she usually takes a guilt trip. She kept saying that I think he's a monster and that I was afraid of him. At this point I was crying so hard I couldn't speak. I tried to explain that I was dramatized as a child from him hitting me so much. She legit said "" That is normal my own brother hit me with a chair"" ( my moms brother died when she was about 16 I think) Now I wish I said that its not normal because he has autism her brother didn't. My brother when he was younger never really got in trouble for doing any of it. Then she says that he felt really bad with me from growing up with him. I don't think he was. Usually my brother will get food the next but since this had happened my mom had said she wouldn't get any food. I found out he did and I asked my mom why and she said "" he felt really bad. He was curled up in a ball and looked upset."". I almost snapped because I didn't even except the apology in the first place.

My mom has been wanting to get someone to come to house to help with my brother. But the person my mom wants to go with is super busy and may not be able to get us in until November. I can't tell my mom half of what I think about my brother because she just thinks I hate him. That's not the case at all. I have more I want to write and there is a lot missing but I really want someone's else opinion that's not in my family. With family I live with put me on a double standard. With my dad he understands and he is kinda on my side.",05Oct2020,1
493,"My (24M) girlfriend (24F) has depression and has been somewhat open about it since the beginning of our relationship. She would get little episodes here and there, but it was never that big of deal. She often just wanted to be left alone for a couple of days and then she would call when she was feeling better. I tried to be there for her, but she just wanted to be left alone and I gave her her space while and I respected that. Well, flash forward to now, and we're living together in a one bedroom apartment. Another episode comes up and she won't get out of bed. I tried helping her again, then I gave her some space for a few days, but it just doesn't go away. We're going on a week and a half now where she won't get out of bed, won't eat, won't shower, won't do her part around the apartment.

I try suggesting things and making things like accomplishments and goals like ""by the time I get home from work, could you please put the chips back in the cabinet and plug your laptop in"". But it doesn't work. I try helping her shower and change and that doesn't help either. She just get mad at me and starts crying. And its frustrating because she won't allow me to help her but she won't help herself either. I tried calling her parents, but they live out of state and won't fly back here ""just to take care of their overdramatic daughter"". I tried contacting her friends too, but they said to just give her a few days. The thing is, it HAS been a few days and it's starting to get concerning.

Beyond hygiene, I'm worried about her physical health too. Because she won't eat, she's losing weight that she really can't afford to lose. She got out of bed to use the bathroom yesterday and passed out. I wanted to take her to the clinic to make sure all was well, but she didn't want me too. Today, she stayed in bed all day at the expense of literally peeing her pants and laying in it for an hour this evening until I came to check on her and noticed the smell. Then it was a whole other issue to make her take a bath.

I don't know how to help her anymore. She was on medication, but I can't force her to take them even though I really try. I tried calling her psychologist office, but he's out of town until next Wednesday. I really don't know what to do here. I don't want to take her to the hospital because I know she would hate me for it, but it's starting to seem like my only option because I don't know how to handle this on my own.",05Oct2020,1

495,"I run a group on Facebook and have some Moderators and a fellow Admin. Everyone is arguing because we can’t come to an agreement on a rule about members blocking admins and mods. The current rules states that if a member had an admin blocked, they get booted. Some of the mods want to boot members for blocking them too. Sounds reasonable however there are some conflicting reasons why I’m reluctant to allow that. 

One of the mods trolls a bit and gets into heated political debate and had many blocks prior to becoming a mod. Another mod wanted to remove someone for blocking them but the block was done because of a disagreement from another group unrelated to our group. 

In general it makes sense that if a member blocks a mod or admin they get the boot but when you’re in several other groups and get blocked for disagreements, it seems unfair to punish the member in an unrelated group. 

Now all this being said, mods can still see what a member posts even if they are blocked. 

I tried to compromise and said if a mod is blocked they should have an admin message the member to find out what happened before removal. But the other admins disagrees because that’s more work to do for something avoidable. 

What should I do?

TLDR: Should members be banned from a FB group for blocking a mod even if it was for reasons outside the group?",05Oct2020,1
496,"So I haven’t texted my friend in 4 days. But I’m worried he won’t text me again. This happened before. Where I didn’t text him for a while and he never texted first and we didn’t speak for a long time. I’m always the one starting convos. He claims he doesn’t text first cuz I always do it, ik that’s a excuse. He told me like a month ago that he hasn’t spoken to his best friend in a month. And all of his friends. I pushed it off thinking that I’m different and he would speak to me still. But he showed me in every way I’m less different from his friends. So him saying that basically he didn’t text his best friend was a red flag...cuz if he can go a long time with his own best friend, then for me it’ll be the same. Its painful to me that it knows he doesn’t care enough to text me.
The last text he sent was just a a response to me apologizing thinking he was mad and didn’t wanna be friends. He keeps saying it’s okay and we are friends but it doesn’t feel like it.

Things were goin well in the friend zone I was really enjoying it she's a very fun person to get to know and talk to. But last night i asked a question i knew i probably wasn't suposed to, it led to her thinking the only reason i liked her was because i liked being liked by her and its true i did i wont deny that. Though the part her liking me never existed and so it was all in my head. 

After being friend zone i started to rethink why I liked her and i was confused, why did i suddenly start picking her up on my radar? I thought what happened that day, the day she asked me what i thought of her. I should have just asked her what she thought of me before spouting out 'i like you' after habouring feelungs for months but what is done is done i can't change what i did i can change how i am now but not what i have done.  

She doesn't listen to a word i say, juat says I'm a guy and expected to much from me she thought i was different that i don't and wont lie that im sweet and she started to fall for me but now she feels scammed that nothing was real. I don't know how to respond other then sorry, i could act out but is that even right? We never actually moved passed being friends and i wanted answers i overstepped a boundry and am paying the price. Losing a friend hurts but losing her hurts a lot too I think something started to grow inside me while spending time talking with her and now i feeling these feelings i dont know how to explain them except im down. 

I honestly think this can't be fixed i am pretty sure she has trust issues from what i could tell from getting to know her. I said all the apologies i could i think all i can do is wait it out. 

I can see why she may never want to talk again the reason why i started to like her is shallow.

But can feelings change? Yeah they didn't have a strong base but at the time i didnt even know her i just thought wow she is beautiful. She also denies being beautiful all the time that hurts me a lot when she says it. Before i would just stare and believe she was perfect. But talking to her i know she has a lot of flaws but im okay with that i learned a lot about her and i was happiest talking to her, she doesn't know that i would push all my other responsibalities back a good few notches just so i could continue talking with her each day. i felt that we both needed a FRIEND like eachother.

500,"Hi there! I'm not sure if I'm being dramatic or maybe I should say something to my husband....

His sister visits once a year and we live on opposite sides of the US. She's closer to me in age than my own two sisters so I really enjoy seeing and spending time with her. She's here for about 4 days before she heads back home. Last week I asked my husband if I should take any time off from work to spend time with her - he said no, that we would be with her all weekend and he probably can't get time off anyways. So I dropped it, and we had a great weekend with family.

Last night around 5pm he announces to the house that he just sent a text to a coworker and he now has Monday off and then they start making plans to do whatever today. I felt blind sided that he made a decision like that and didn't think to include me or let me know ahead of time to see if I could get a half day.

I feel like a child for even making it an issue because he's just exciting to spend time with his sister but it's been bugging me. When things are going on with friends or my family, I include him without second thought because I see us as  ""we"" and not just 2 seperate people who are married.

502,"Me and my boyfriend are together for more than 2y. Even though our relationship is wonderful, we did had arguments and disagreements in the past. Some of these disagreements would include:

 *&gt;him not wanting to rent an apartment together, rather just save some money up so we could buy an aparment or a house.*

*&gt;Me being invited to go hang out with my friends, but my boyfriend is never included, which hurts us both, but usually I'm scared to talk about it.*

And so on. 

At that time, these topics were more of an argument, rather than a discussion and I felt really down about it. So eventually, I spoke up about it to my best friend. (which now I believe was a mistake to do so) 

My bestfriend has a boyfriend, and sometimes she invites me to hang out with them two, but my boyfriend is never included. Whenever I mention that I'm not comfortable going out somewhere without him, then they say 'oh yeah, he can come too'. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend noticed this, he is not happy about it, mainly feels hurt, because he is rarely invited somewhere to go out with my friends. He said for him, it seems strange, since his friends always invite me to go out somewhere if they do, but my boyfriend doesn't get the same thing back from my friends. He believes that my friends doesn't like him.

So he started investing himself more into my friends. So almost for a year, he started inviting my bestfriend and her boyfriend out to do something, but most of the time they find excuses why not to go, my boyfriend invites her boyfriend to play video games, which they do play, but sometimes it just feels off. 

&amp;#x200B;

And recently, rarely, but I do hear from my bestfriend passive aggressive comments about my boyfriend, which I'm afraid to react to, just because I don't want to seem that I am overreacting. 

But especially yesterday, when me, her and two other friends were sitting outside drinking coffee, we started talking about buying apartments/houses, etc. And my bestfriend said ""Well, your boyfriend doesn't want to live outside from his mom until he's 30"". And it stuck with me. Of course, that is not the case, which I mentioned, he just doesn't want to throw money away on rent and rather just get a loan. Those two friends agreed that It seemed like a reasonable plan, which made me a bit in ease. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the fact, that I told about this argument to my bestfriend and now she mentions this about it near other people really bothers me. And also her creating future plans and not even mentioning about my boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, my best friend and a few other friends (which are our new friends) are organizing a Halloween party just between us. They never asked me about it, just planned me in, but didn't mention a thing about my boyfriend. Currently, they are just planning and not mentioning anything about it to us, but when they will, I'm considering saying that I'm not attending.  
 I know If I'll say to my bestfriend that her passive aggressive comments hurt and also her not including my boyfriend is unacceptable for me, we will have an argument, I don't want to have ""drama"".

513,"NOTE: If you’re thinking about telling me that jobs are not a priority right now, or anything COVID-19 related, please don’t reply. The point of this advice request is to get advice about what is a good starting point for a job and what I should do.

Hey guys. Im 21 years old and I’ve never had a job, or even applied for one. Before I explain further there are a few things I’d like to clarify:

- I didn’t finish high school and dropped out of my final year (personal reasons)
- I haven’t properly started uni/college (I’ve only been doing short courses for the last three years)
- My mum has told me that EVERY single job requires some sort of qualification. I asked a few other people, and they told me otherwise. It’s made me sad, because of how much I’ve missed out and that I think it’s too late now.

The problem is, I want to enter the workforce when I’ve never been in it before, but the COVID-19 pandemic has really affected availability, opportunities and operations. What is the best starting point, and what should I apply for, considering I don’t seem to have any experience or skills? I doubt that I will ever be considered. (PLEASE do not say anything fast food related, there are rumours that they don’t treat their workers well there and I don’t wish to work in that particular sector.)

Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to your responses.",05Oct2020,1
514,"Hello,

I will try to be detailed but also as short as possible. I was raised christian, so I always believed in waiting until marriage to have sex but I watched porn and masturbated growing up and when I was 15/16 I had my first boyfriend and he would masturbate me over my pants while I was asleep and I would feel kind of uncomfortable but it also felt good so I felt guilty. I knew I wasn’t ready for sex so I felt very weird. 

fast forward I went to college and i’m not very religious anymore and I started exploring my sexuality and I ended up losing my virginity and having a lot of sex and it was good for like 8 months but now I’m still with my boyfriend that I lost my virginity to but I keep having anxiety attacks when we try to have sex. I love him so much but I don’t feel horny anymore and I never really want to have sex. this sucks because he does, and you know usually I would too but for the past couple of months I have had no interest in sex or masturbation or physical touch really. 

i’ve been really sick lately and i’ve also been depressed and i’m on SSRIs which I know contributes to it but still? I just want to feel sexy and horny again.",05Oct2020,1
515,"I found a post that my boyfriend made a few years ago, and in this post he was asked ""how do you feel about interracial couples?"" His original answer is ""Unnatural and freakish, not meant to happen. White and black, or Asian? Don't even get me started on that."" For those who might still wonder, he's White and I'm Asian.

I've been crying all day and until now I still don't know what to do, I don't even have the courage to ask him at this moment. I just want to disappear. The word ""freakish"" just sticks in my mind and I can't help myself but keep thinking does he feel that I'm freakish too? Does he feel that our relationship is disgusting as well? I know it's been a few years until now and a person might have changed a lot in these years. I just can't kick these thoughts out of my mind.

I need to clarify that I think he is a sincere and polite person, as least that's the impression that he've made on me. He approached me first and after talking for a few months he asked if I was willing to be his girlfriend and I said yes. I just don't know if he really loves me or is it because he's so lonely that he forced himself to find someone to 'love', to even start a relationship that's unnatural to him. Could anyone understand my concern?

I know maybe most of you will recommend me to have a conversation with him and talk about this, how should I start it? How should I get over it? What can I do to make myself feel better? Thank you all in advance.",05Oct2020,1
516,"One could describe my lifestyle as eccentric. While I take care of my adult responsibilities (holding a job, paying my bills, I live on my own) but there's no getting around that I'm a 29-year-old woman who spends her freetime bouncing on hopper balls, cuddling teddy bears, jumping in bounce houses, dressing in tutus, denim shorts, overalls, and lace-up boots, and watching cartoons. But my community treats me horribly because of it.

People tell their kids to not turn out like me. I've had people pop hopper balls while I'm playing on it, yelling at me to grow up. I've had people smear me as a pedophe trying to lure in victims (I'm not. I would kill myself before ever touching a child in a way that damaged them psychologically.)

It's been a passion of mine for a long time, but lifelong depression and anxiety have held me down.

On the outside I present a genuinely caring and charismatic mid 30's man. Well liked to most that come into contact with me. Inside I'm holding the plane together with duct tape and one engine working.

It's been a struggle the entire year fighting against my own mind to keep going. I've been able to get my A+ and Security+ certifications which are good steps to entering into the field in a help desk / support role.

519,"I'm a 20 year old law student living with both my parents, i'm also an only child. My father is 70 and my mom 54, my mom has had depression for over a decade and my dad just yesterday was diagnosed with it.

My dad was always the one who provided for the family, he had a full time job while my mom was a housewife and they both supported me. As my mom was struggling with severe depression he was always there to support her as i grew up. But recently, with the pandemic, things started to change.

My dad was really afraid of the virus, he was scared that he was going to catch the virus and pass away, leaving my mom and myself to live off with way less money, which wouldn't even be enough to pay for the rest of my education for example. My dad's terrified of that. As if that wasn't enough, he also got diagnosed with diabetes in the same day.

My dad started to unnaturaly lose a lot of weight and was constantly troubled by everything. This in turn made him less able to emotially support my mother and caused her own depression to get worse. When he got diagnosed with diabetes things it got even worse, it severely impacted his own self confidence and will.

My dad says he's going to look for medical assistance but at this point i'm not sure he'll actually follow through because of how scared he is of catching covid. Both him and my mom are always sad and depressed, mom is always crying and i'm even having to pull more weight than usual in regards to housework.

I don't know what to do. I'm scared, as a student i never had to deal with anything like this. The mood in house nowadays is always down, like a funeral home. I try to help my parents in this battle but at this point i'm not sure it's even doing anything.

I thought about getting a part time job, but the money won't amount to much and i'd be around them even less, making it more difficult to be there for them. And i'm sure my parents would be devastated if i dropped out of school to look for a full time job. Not to mention that i'm still three years away from getting my degree.

This situation clearly is not sustainable and i know it can't keep going on like this for long. But i also don't know what to do. We don't have any other family and i'm scared that either my dad or my mom will degenerate to a point where they'll just give up.

I try to be strong and carry on like nothing is happening. I act like i'm perfectly fine while in front of them but i cry like a baby in the shower. I feel like my life is spiraling out of control and that it'll come crashing down on me at some point with me being unable to do anything about it. I want to do some to make this situation less worse but i just don't know what.

I'm desperate for advice right now.",05Oct2020,1
520,"Hello all. I need some advice, something that the internet is always good at giving. Contrary to what I use reddit for, I've been feeling awful recently and I don't like explaining my emotions all too much, I usually use reddit for comedy.

But the state I am in at the moment, there are only two good things coming out of my life right now and that's working out and playing games. I am living at home for university, I didn't go out to a uni to stay in because that's too expensive for me. Because I'm living at home I'm slightly lonley, I have my family but I myself am alone with no friends at all. With COVID going on, my university has failed to prepare for my second year. I only go in twice every two weeks and everything else is done online. The university has badly prepared, almost every module is having problems. One module has failed to explain anything useful regarding the assignment, another module hasn't adjusted perfectly to the online teaching and my other two modules lack any tutorials and only give me 2 lectures per week.

The assignments are confusing for everyone at the moment and no one seems to understand what we are doing. The universities failure to prepare has made me feel awfully miserable, its my second year as well and I feel betrayed. I feel destroyed. Everyday I've been waking up in the morning to revise and the more I revise, the more I feel like I'm not doing anything, I'm not understanding as much as I used to and I'm not gaining anything. I feel that everything I'm studying isn't going to do anything for me to do well this year.

All of these problems have been a result of Boris Johnson's awful policies as prime minister of the Conservative government. I don't want to get political here, but the conservatives have done the worst job in dealing with the COVID 19 pandemic. If kids can go back to school, why the fuck can't students go back to university? As of right now, a year 1 primary school student is getting a much better education than a second or third year university student. Boris's polices are a disgrace and everything he has done as prime minister has been a joke.

I just don't know how to gain any motivation to study at all. I have more motivation to go to the gym and play games than I do in studying and I used to hate exercising but I used to love revising and learning about what I want to do in the future. Now I try to revise but it feels like each time I revise I do a clumsy awful job. I can barley focus either. 

Can anyone help me get the motivation to study at all? I also want to stress that my social life is awful. I have no friends at all as most have gone away to study. I'm all alone and I never really got along with many people in the first year because I hate the university mentality of drink every week and go partying, it's not something I find ""fun"" or entertaining at all",05Oct2020,1

528,"F|20| I’ve been having an ongoing battle between my friends and leaving to see my family or boyfriend. I’m currently in college and choose to go off campus for the weekends to either visit my family or stay with my boyfriend. I see weekends as a chance to break away from the anxieties I have with school and everything as well as recharge. 
Whenever I leave I know my friends at school and are going to be upset and we are going to have issues. I feel guilty and sick when I leave because I don’t want them to be upset. I think it’s important to recognize I’ve never had a close group of friends growing up. My best friend lives almost an hour away and I haven’t seen her in months and yet she doesn’t get upset with me for not forcing a visit and never questions our friendship. 
Recently my friends have gotten worse in my opinion. They told me through text that they feel like they are on the back burner. I’ve tried to explain to them that I’m there all week during classes and we usually hangout till 12 or 1 in the morning most nights. I’m confused why it matters I’m there for weekends specifically when I’ve told them being off campus makes me happy and feel better. They twist my words a lot through text and I know having the conversation in person won’t be much better. I will get backed into a corner while they tell me I’m the issue and basically a bad friend. Nothing is truly an issue till I leave though. 
I’m not really sure how to handle this situation and any advice would really help. Please help I genuinely care about them as friends but having these fights over texts is getting exhausting and drains me physically and mentally.",05Oct2020,1

1) driving on private property, big parking lot

2) she was at a stop sign and we had the right away, she jumped and hit us in the driver side quarter panel (correct term?)

3) her insurance is claiming she was in control of the intersection and that she crossed multiple lanes, which isn’t accurate at all (wouldn’t we have hit her?)

4) we live in Alabama where a party has to be 100% at fault to pay out anything 

5) my wife and I are both unemployed at the moment (should be remedied next couple of weeks). Our saving is depleted 

6) we have an old beater that we’ve paid off to get around but it’s only a matter of time until it needs more work done. I’m Door Dashing right now so we can eat and have lights etc.

7) our insurance said they’ll go to arbitration once we pay off the deductible, but who knows if we’ll recoup anything 

Dealing with this has caused no end of stress but we just don’t know what to do. 

We should both be employed full time (she’s an RN and her license transfer got hung up, I’m a librarian and going through a promising interview process now) in the next few weeks but we’re a LONG way from the $1,000 deductible.

So basically my dad is a drunk. He physically abused my mother until their divorce and then me after their divorce.  Long story short I learned a very toxic form of love.  

Enter my first relationship. We’re both physically abusive to each other.  We’re young and both alcoholic.  We’ve both gotten sober and have met up later and both have gone to anger management and gotten that behind us.  I forgive him and I’m not sure if he forgives me but I try everyday not to be that person he dated. 

After that I got in what I consider a one sided abusive relationship. He hit me. He raped me. He tried to kill me. He’s been convicted of all these things.

I was sheltered growing up and certain things just don't click for me as quickly as it does for most people. I struggle a great deal with social situations that is usually why I stick to online interactions. They're easier for me but recently it's gotten difficult. I am 24 F and my best friend is 25 F, who I'll call Ginger for sake of clarity. We are both married. We met online on an online community through similar interests somewhere over 5 years ago. We weren't immediately friends and I don't remember exactly when we did become best friends. It just kind of was that way day one day? We had been working together on a project and when the project was over, she expressed wanting to keep in touch because of how close we were and it lead to Facebook requests and now we are connected in very many ways. She means to world to me now and I have been asked to be her childs god-mother. I never expected this.

For as long as I've known Ginger, they've been regarded as what people called combative. She seemed to want to disagree or argue with everyone on everything. I don't want to really give too many examples because if she finds this post... ahaha. So I'll try to give like blueprint examples (plausible deniability?)

In a public instant messaging platform, the administrator is posting a few links about a current issue and the importance of awareness (it isn't a really controversial issue, think how to vote and how to register) and Ginger said, ""I think we all know how to do lol"" and even I found this unnecessary and a tad snarky? But a lot of people started going back and forth with, ""You're allowed to have your opinion but this channel is for this kind of thing. You \*can\* just mute it."" And guys, like they were all nice and gentle and understanding, no one was mean or snarky and Ginger was. It was like Ginger was seeing a different side of the conversation.  On that project we worked on, Ginger was more or less in charge. Ginger often tried to prompt discussion on a specific decision. It really felt pointless to ever have an idea different from hers because it always turned into her claiming I'm arguing when I'm just stating my thought process on the decision/idea/task/what have you. I don't know what I was supposed to do differently in between ""Hey guys lets talk about this."" and ""I don't want to argue about this."" The only other option I feel like was to immediately agree with Gingers points, but if I do that, then Ginger is upset that ""no one is participating in discussion."" This particular project is now dying.   
I REALLY wish I could explain this better but it happens so much more. 

Then there are times where I will think we are having a discussion and that everything is fine but then they are mad at me. She stonewalls me now. We can't talk about anything because, ""I don't want to argue."" I'm not trying to change her or anything on subjects, I just want to be able to talk to her without feeling like she will get mad.

We have visited one another, me to her last year and her to me this year.  My husband and I are not well off and we planned around that but her husband wanted to do extra things like take scooters around the city instead of walking. I had never taken scooters or even walked around the major city I live ten minutes from (sheltered, lol.) I told him he didn't have to pay for these extra activities and that we could not pay him back. We pushed we were very clear. As soon as they got home, he went off on her in public about how we should have pushed back harder and he shouldn't have had to pay for so much. A gas tank he literally pushed on us. We are also not going to refuse a fill up, lol. I couldn't speak freely around her because he was around all the time I quickly learned the was a \*lot\* I was privy to that he wasn't and it made me uncomfortable because I was not prepped on, ""Don't say this. He doesn't know about this. He doesn't know I tell you that."" I also don't like secrets. Which is another reason I am uncomfortable here. I feel like I've mad a decision about our friendship without and its actively damaging my feelings towards her. Our conversation have dwindled in frequency and are often short. 

I vented to a mutual acquaintance, because they saw the public thing(they were equally confused), who admitted that their own previous friendship had failed because of similar reasons. It's getting to the point that having an opinion different than hers or anytime a hottopic comes up, the conversation dies for hours to days. I don't want to stop being Gingers friend but I can't take this anymore. It's driving me nuts.

544,So my friend likes to complain allot but it's never something that matters and it just bums everyone out. like yesterday we were playing world of tanks with some friends and he got shot and killed. now instead of shrugging it off and going forward he started ranting about how the game was unfair because he didn't back away on time. this wasn't like the tent game we lost in a row or something it was the first match. so i asked him if he wanted to play something else. he got angry at me like i insulted him or something and then he said he enjoyed the game. all of my friend were listening and after that no one said a word until like 10 min later. this happens in every game you can die in that we play. so my problem is that i want to tell him to go easy on the complaining but i don't want to hurt him feelings because he is a good friend. so i need some good advice reddit so do your thing,05Oct2020,1

551," I don't *want* him out of my life. I care too much and it feels like a betrayal to all the love we shared. My boyfriend is my best and currently *only* good friend. The closest I have to friends are a few girls I text sometimes from my college, who I haven't seen since March (thanks COVID19 and my college's decision to only teach online this year). If I leave him I have to start over, maybe move in with some strangers in college in autumn 2021 (if my college returns to in person teaching/lectures). My parents love my BF and they think I have it *altogether* at the age of 21, that BF and I will move in together in autumn 2021and then marry in 5 years etc etc. For a long time I did feel like I had life sorted after meeting seemingly the perfect guy for me, at 18. This man adores me against all odds, so my feelings feel wrong to me. 

I've had doubts and pushed them away a lot since May this year, but for the last 6 weeks or so, I've felt like I can't marry him ever. The thoughts of moving in with him next year makes me feel trapped, because then I can't leave and it's the next step towards marriage. I used to fantasise about this stuff and see wedding dresses and think ""wow, the day he asks me to marry him will be the best day of my life!!"", now I feel guilty when it's mentioned. 

 My issues lie in different ethics?. He is OK watching Logan Paul videos despite the whole suicide forest fiasco?, for example. He used to enjoy reading erotic stories of incest as a teen. When I was disgusted he didn't see an issue with it, until I explained why it was wrong. I feel like the right guy wouldn't have ever liked this crap and would've unfollowed Logan Paul given how awful he is as a person? His former crushes, real and celebrity, have always been very skinny, I'm short, curvy and 120lbs, so that isn't me. He said he always imagined himself with a woman like that. I have a bad relationship with dieting and food and feel like I'll never be skinny enough for him lately, even if he makes it clear I am. He finds any woman over a size 6 gross and makes fat jokes?!? Whenever he hears about a celebrity allegation, he will ask ""eh did it really happen/how do we know she didn't make it up?"", he takes an innocent until proven guilty stance, I hate it. I'm inclined to think ""I hope it isn't true"" when I first hear of something. He is also a super picker eater, won't eat salad or any dish with onions or peppers, we only get to eat in places with pizza/burgers/pasta. 

I can't tell if I'm nitpicking out of a fear of commitment or if these are genuine issues? I feel guilty even typing this as he is such a sweetheart to me and maybe I'll just die alone if I'm stupid enough to leave? I have cried just thinking about leaving him but being with him forever feels scary?",05Oct2020,1

553,"throwaway because reasons. skip to the tl;dr if you don’t feel like reading the details, but i’d like to clarify that i am not famous in any sense of the word, and would only be considered a “successful” musician by the most modest standards possible. i live in a very active music town, and my projects get local attention— that’s about it. 

so for context, i went through a really sudden and painful divorce last year after my partner had an affair. my ex employed a number of inventive methods to keep it a secret, but the most humiliating is they cheated completely out in the open. they told our mutual friends that we had an open marriage, and asked everyone not to bring up their other relationship around me or with me because i “preferred not to know details.” so no one brought it up. my partner had a second relationship, and everyone knew but me.

i coped by writing songs. while everything was falling apart, i kept a “song diary,” and wrote one song a week for 12 weeks. i wrote two about how i was being treated before i confirmed the infidelity, and continued through the experience of finding out, trying to fix but ultimately ending my marriage, and reeling from the sudden shock of a lonely new life.

as painful as it is, it’s my favorite stuff i’ve ever written. i had been struggling with writers block for a long time when i started, and this just poured out of me. i grew as a person and as a writer over the course of it, and honestly i’m proud of it. but i am hesitant to share it, so i’ve been sitting on it for months.

i want to release it. i truly poured my soul into it, and like most artists, i feel compelled to share it with others who may appreciate or relate to it. but i can’t get past my fear of what might happen if i do. i live in a fairly small, very tight knit town (kinda like a giant high school tbh). when this went down, it involved so many people directly and indirectly that my life was more or less publicly ripped apart. i am afraid of how it will be received by people directly and indirectly involved. it doesn’t name names, but it doesn’t have to.

i don’t want to be seen as petty or vengeful towards my ex. i don’t want to do this for attention, to embarrass them, or to air our dirty laundry. i don’t know if it will be taken that way... or if i should care. making the album has been about expressing myself and healing. would releasing it make me an asshole?


tl;dr: i wrote an album about my ex‘s affair and our subsequent divorce. the songs aren’t subtle about what happened or how my ex treated me. our breakup was very public in our community, and the album would get local attention. i want to share it because i’m genuinely proud of the songs, but i am afraid of being seen as petty or vengeful if i release it.",05Oct2020,1

557,"sorry this is gonna be pretty long 
so on saturday it was my 21st birthday party. my parents have been divorced for about 10 years now but have always gotten along. my dad is engaged to someone else who he has three other kids with (my parents have four together including me) my stepmum had gone home a bit earlier in the night to check on their kids but my dad stayed behind. i wasn’t paying the most attention because i was too busy having fun. 

however at some point i had gone upstairs to grab my dressing gown (it was about 4am and cold) and i came back down and was dancing with my mum’s best friend. i turned and saw my parents very very close and my mum had her arms around my dads neck. i’m like 99% sure they were kissing. obviously i was drunk but i’m pretty sure i knew what i was seeing. i also spoke to my roommate and best friend tonight about it and he said he noticed they were being weird and separated themselves and apparently another good friend of mine made a comment about it too. they also disappeared together when everyone left and my 16yo brother couldn’t find my dad. 

this also isn’t the first time i’ve seen them be weird. my mum has picked him up in the middle of the night and i’ve seen weirdly flirty messages between them (i knew i shouldn’t have looked but it was confusing). they’ve always gotten along pretty well except that my dad cheated on my mum with my step mum so i’m at a loss as to why this would be happening. it broke my mums heart, so why would she potentially do the same thing. 

two of my brothers were at the party (18 and 16). the 18 yo was upstairs passed out but my 16 yo brother was still downstairs. he obviously wasn’t drinking but was on his phone and i’m not sure if he saw anything. i’m reluctant to bring it up in case he didn’t see anything and as the eldest i’m pretty protective over all my siblings. 

i’m really stuck on what to do. i don’t want to say anything to my parents because it’s super awkward and i’m not sure what they’d say but i also feel very uncomfortable with this knowledge and wish i knew what to do. any advice is appreciated!",05Oct2020,1

560,"So recently me (20) and my now ex-girlfriend (19) of 1 year and 2 months have broken up; I live in America, she lives in the Netherlands.
I've been trying to learn Dutch even before we began dating,  so that I could communicate with her in her native language (her English is AMAZING and damn near perfect, but I thought it'd be cute if we could both speak Dutch together). I bought several children's books and done a few online learning classes, so I have a small knowledge of the language already. 
I've really come to like the sound and structure of the language, and have so far enjoyed learning it, but I am becoming unsure if I should continue, in fear that it will just hurt me to continue. She was my biggest inspiration to start learning the language, and I even planned on immigrating to Holland to live there with her. Without her, I currently have no other reason to continue learning other than for enjoyment, or to speak in a group chat I joined to help me learn from native speakers.
However, I also feel that it would have been a waste of time and effort to stop learning altogether. I haven't lost any respect nor admiration for the language, and still find joy in understanding even the littlest of things, like memes or kids books. Plus, who knows, I may need it one day? 🤷🏻‍♀️

My mom (52F) lives across the country and has been having issues with her health that have made it hard for her to keep a job over the last year. I’ve tried to help but being far away limits what I can do, especially being in graduate school and having financial woes of my own. Well, her ex boyfriend who she’s been living with (they’ve lived together for several years and broke up about a year ago) continues to message me to get me to do something about my mom since they still live together. I recognize that he doesn’t want to be around her anymore and their relationship is over, but at the same time she’s an adult and I can’t control her. I also don’t feel like I should have to end my lease and move into another apartment (would be the seventh move since starting undergrad) with my mom.

I’m not trying to rock the boat and be confrontational, but at the same time I just don’t know how to respond to this to get him to understand that I spent the better part of 8 months bending over backwards and doing everything I could do for her from easily over a thousand miles away and she’s her own person.

567,"I (34m) come from a dysfunctional family. I haven't really had a successful life but I want to build one for myself. I did okay in GCSE ( 6 A\*, 4 A)  and A level (3 A). I also went to uni to study bio med and I got 1st for my 1st and 2nd year. I left after 2nd year (21yrs old at the time) because my mom wanted me to study medicine and not biomed. She made sure to tell me to quit biomed whenever she got the chance to but she would act supportive of my study infront of our family. It got worse during 2nd year because my mom called me almost everyday, even during my exam day and tell me stuff like ""If you don't quit biomed and study medicine, don't bother calling me mom"" ,""I gave birth to you and took care of you and this is what you do for me"", ""If you don't quit, you can consider me dead because I will be dead"". You know, the normal manipulation stuff. I quit after finishing my 2nd year and my dad was furious with me for quitting. I have not told a single soul about what my mom did and how it affected me. 

During my childhood my parents in verbal row which turned physical and my mom was badly hurt by my dad (she was bed ridden for 2 months). After school I used to take care of my mom. My mom used to hit and spit on me but the worse bit was she would scream at me and blame me for nothing being strong enough to stop my dad and tell me that I should have been dead or that she should have killed me, (yeah not abort by kill, lol). And the worst thing was she used to do this and tell me that I reminded her so much of my dad. I was 10 years old at the time. My dad hated me because I was always took my mom's side and I taking care of her. My older sibling (OS) was in private school and by the time my OS came home our mom was already feeling better. My OS was always in their room during school holidays so my OS never saw what I saw. Things got better after 3 yrs and I got a younger brother when I was 14.  Things have gone better between my parents since then but there is still distrust and hate between them. My OS seems supportive when I'm down but when I do well, my OS, just gets very moody and angry at me. 

After I quit uni, my life turn for worse. I deleted socials and changed my phone number because my friends would ask how I was and why I left and stuff. I felt sad and mad about my whole situation. I did try to take my life when I was 23 but failed miserably. Since then I'm stuck at low retail jobs. I have no ambition because whatever I do will never be enough for my parents, especially my mom. I was just tired. I got diagnoised with depression and I was on medication for 7 years. I stopped the medication when I was 30. I'm asian and I will always stay with my family. Me being on low level job means I don't get paid much. I tried to join the Army but my parents were very angry about it. I had the education and physical requirement to join but my parents made me withdraw by saying that they will kick me out, bascially rendering me homeless. I was in the rut but then I decided to do better and I went to college again when I was 31. I studied law, business and economics. I got A,A and B respectively. I was so embarrassed to be there with kids who were 16 years old. My younger sibling was very supportive. I was planning to go to uni last year but I just felt like it wouldn't matter and this was my life. I'm glad I decided to go to uni this year.

 I'm currently in my first year studying Business management and Marketing (been 2 weeks now). I feel much better being away from my family. My mom told me that it's too late now and I have already thrown my chance for better life and that I should just work and get settled down. Like how am I suppose to support a family when I can't even support myself properly. I work around 45-50 hours every week and I earn 17k annually. How is that enough to support a family? And I don't believe in love either after seeing how my parents are. And even if I do come to love someone I will never put them in this situation because I can't leave my parents and I will always take care of them. I don't want my future gf/wife to deal with not only my issue but also my family issue. I talked with my OS 2 weeks ago when I arrived at uni, and my OS was asking if I made any friends and I said no, as I had only moved in to my dorm for 1 day. My OS respond was ""You'll always be a friendless loser, hahaha"". I talked with my OS yesterday and I have made some friends and I told my OS that and then my OS's response was ""They are young, so you should leave them alone and find someone your age. For them it will be like hanging out with their grandparents, hahaha"". I have no idea what to tell my OS.

I have come to realistion that I'm a mentally weak person and I have a massive problem with codependency. I had done some thinking and I have come to conclusion that I won't be able to leave my family. I want to make a lot of money so that I can become financially independent and be able to help my family out. How do I make money? Could anyone point me to sites or reddit thread that will give me some ideas about how to make money. I'm willing to put in time and energy but I don't know where to start. Being away from my family, I can slowly feel my mental fog clearing and I want to do better but I don't know where and how to start so that I can have a better life and better living standard. I see people doing better with their life and I feel happy and motivated when I see them because I think that I too can have better life to a reasonable point if I apply myself (I don't mean the people in social media, I mean people I have met in IRL). But talking to my family member does make me a bit upset and when I see their name pop up on my phone it fills me with dread and anxiety. I have been to psychiatrist and therapist but I never felt comfortable enough to open up to them, so going back to them won't help. Here, I have anonymity and my family won't be judged for my problems. If I average out my family they are good people and they have helped me. They still take care of me. I help them out by paying for bills and groceries but I want to be able to do more for them and myself.

So i just remembered some SERIOUSLY FUCKED UP things i did when i was a kid( and some other fucked up things ive ever done in my life) And i cant seem to forgive myself for it, and im thinking im gonna go to hell for it.. Im an atheist but my OCD wants me to be a Christian again, so i can be sure god can forgive me even if i did something so awfully wrong. (I know im not sure if Christianity is the real religion, but idk what to believe other than the only religion I've ever believed in)... Also i I don't think im gonna be a Christian, cause there'll be another OCD theme. And it'll be, ""What if Christianity isnt the real religion, and X religion is the truth, and im gonna go to hell bc of believing in the wrong religion""",05Oct2020,1
572,"TRIGGER WARNING. Sorry if this is erratic my mind is going a million miles while I write this. Throwaway account obviously fair warning this is kind of long TL:DR at the bottom. 

I (34F) made the biggest mistake of my life 9 yrs ago by marrying and staying with my ex(51M) who was physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, and sexually abusive. I first met him when I was 18 y/o and a senior in HS. Apparently, my 18 y/o self was smarter than my 26 y/o because I kicked him to the cur but then reconnected 8 yrs later and got married six months into the relationship.

 Yeah, that's right I found a real winner and I was wife number 5 to him. See the pattern here? You're probably wondering why I stayed with him for 5 yrs. Well simply put he wasn't like that in the beginning, it was a trickle effect scenario it took him almost killing me one night to actually leave him. That was 4 yrs ago I hit the ground running and haven't looked back. 

This morning I had a message pop up on FB messenger and lo and behold it's him. Which honestly sent me into a mini panic attack. Now normally I would just block his new account and not respond but here is the thing. His FB profile picture was of him and a younger woman at a guess she is around the age I was when we first started dating. Honestly, my heart stopped because whether rational or not my mind immediately went into panic mode of he's doing it again. This girl is going to end up being his next victim. And I know he will do it again because as I said I was wife number 5 I wasn't his first victim. And if he follows the same pattern she won't notice it just like I didn't until it's almost too late. I also have this repeating thought of what if he goes to far this time? 

You're probably wondering why I didn't turn him into the cops. The simple yet complicated answer here is I grew up in foster care I was abused as a kid the cops didn't believe me then and I feared they wouldn't believe me this time so I felt it was just better to get a divorce as opposed to going through all of that again. 

So what do I do? Do I reach out and warn her? Do I just mind my own business and get on with my life? What if I don't and she ends up how I almost did? Then again she probably won't believe me because I wouldn't have believed any of his exes either because he was very good at painting himself as the victim in all his relationships. I mean I guess he could have changed but am I gambling someones life on that? Help me out here please...

TL:DR Abusive ex-husband reached out and u found out he is now with a young woman that I fear may end up reliving my hell or worse. Should I mind my own business or say something?",05Oct2020,1

I have a rocky past with my parents, and I don’t keep in contact with them or share much of anything in my personal life.

574,"I’m currently taking a very challenging class. My teacher is very intelligent, but he is very vague about what is going to be on the test. Today we took a test, and in my school tests are worth 50% of the grade. This was the first test of the year and it was very, very hard. A lot of the material we didn’t even go over and was exclusively from the book. 

Now the school is currently on a hybrid schedule, where students are either in Group A, Group B, or virtual. Unfortunately I’m in Group A, and had to do this test in class. It wasn’t open notebook and it was purely from memory. About 8 of the 30 students, including myself, were in his class at the time.

Before the test, the remaining 22 students planned to go on a Group FaceTime to do the test together. I didn’t pay it any mind, because maybe it was a joke or a hypothetical. Well they actually did it, and several of the students sent answers for the entire test in the class group chat. I didn’t see this because we weren’t allowed to use our phones for the test.

And to add insult to injury, several of the students have contacts with upperclassmen who were able to feed them answers as the test was live. And many of their parents are in the field related to the test, so that was another form of cheating going on at the same time.

The teacher did nothing to prevent this. He is very old so maybe he doesn’t know about all of this technology or thought that we were saints. He let this go on. 

I’m angry because I studied all weekend for this and still did bad. I got most of the questions incorrect, so I definitely failed, if not close to that. So did the other 7 students in person alongside me. We all agreed that the test was extremely difficult. But most of the class did well because of the virtual cheating system they created. I don’t want to snitch and look bad, but I’m really upset and angry. And the virtual kids get to always do this. I fucking hate school now because whatever grade I get is easily triumphed by someone virtual or in Group 2. I won’t be able to get valedictorian or do nearly as well as the virtual kids.

Maybe I should just drop out of this class or do all virtual. I want to go to school, but is it even worth it anymore? What’s the point? 

TL;DR: More than 2/3 of the class cheated on a test worth 50% of the grade, while the remainder, myself included, did very poorly.",05Oct2020,1

I’m 16M and have always thought I’m straight. I’ve had crushes on a bunch of different girls throughout school and have always liked and done stereotypically boyish stuff (ik that’s not indicative really of my sexuality). I also was never remotely attracted to my friends or anything like that and never really felt attracted to guys.

Ok so I also had unrestricted internet access on my iPod touch since I was like 8, and I started by looking up things like boobs and it kinda just escalated from there.

578,"We both like anime and watch it from time to time. Some years ago we stumbled across a game called Teaching Feeling, wich is a dating sim about taking care of this girl that's all beaten un and stuff. But you can also rape her. We downloaded the game out of curiosity and, naturally, we were disgusted and uninstalled it right after.

During quarantine, my brother told me that he downloaded the game again, but only because he actually wanted to complete it and get all the endings, so I didn't give it much importance. But later I realized that somehow he actually catched feelings with the anime girl of the game on a certain level. This was just the beginning.

You see, he is a far-right conservative sometimes leaning into straight up sexism and homophobia, and he's not very successful with women in real life. He's also a great artist, but according to him, he sucks at drawing women. After playing that game, he began to draw a lot of girls with the same anime art style as the game. 

Days passed, and now he starts playing other anime dating sims, he changed his laptop wallpapers to anime girls and kept himself in his room with the door closed 24/7, although not locked. Every time I entered his room, he quickly closes his drawing notebooks or his laptop and looks at me with a creepy stare, and when I leave, he closes the door again, this time locking it. I feared that he was doing something bad. 

One day, out of worrying curiosity, I sneaked into his room and looked around his notebooks and his laptop, and found, along with drawings of regular anime girls, lots of drawings of most hideous degeneracy, secret folders of porn and hentai and screenshots of the girl in Teaching Feeling being raped, along with fanfiction of the characters of different games and a work in progress of a dating sim made by himself with our female school friends. I confronted him (didn't tell him that I searched through his computer) and he told me that he was not proud of his drawings and that he would scrap them. But after many days, he still closes his notebooks and his laptop and looks at me with anger. 

I fear he is becoming obsessed with this, and I feel really uncomfortable and creeped out. Please, I need advice on how can I deal with this.",05Oct2020,1
579,"Hi all. 

Recently, my neighbors dog had gotten loose outside of their house and bolted. During this time of then looking for them he had found myself and my dog while walking on a leash. He ran up and ignored any commands and the two fought. I got involved to break them up and upon which the dog bit me. He is normally a saint when it comes to other people and I truly believe him biting me was an accident. He doesn’t like other male dogs which mine is one and it is just a big set of unfortunate series of events. We are friends with the owners of the dog and found out his shots weren’t up to date and so I had to go get a rabies vaccine to be safe. No I don’t condone their actions of the shots being late but nothing can change the past of that not being done. When getting treated I have to report the animal to which I said I didn’t recognize the dog. I don’t want anything to happen. They will be paying the hospital bills and have taken responsibility. Animal control wants to ask me about it more and I’m afraid of consequence if I’m dishonest but I don’t want to report the dog as this is a lone incident and I care about him and them. Do I still remain oblivious to who the dog is or do I even have to talk to them? Thanks. Person of Michigan.

580,"   I've been living at my great-grandfather's house for about 5 years. I moved in when I was 11, after my great-grandmother, his wife of 47 years, died. I was his favorite grandchild, so I needed to be the one to keep an eye on him, to keep him company.   


   It started out great, just a small child getting spoiled more consistently by his great-grandfather. However, over time, I started getting depressed, but that's a whole other can of worms. But it caused a divide between he and I. He's so much meaner than he used to be. He insults my hair, my weight, every choice I make. But I guess that's what age, losing your wife, and early on-set dementia does. I was in my room way more often, but everyone else still saw it as her room. As my great-grandmother's room.  


   My great-grandma was a chain smoker, she woke up and put a cig in her mouth before she put her glasses on. Smoked two packs a day, without exaggeration. I bring that up because the walls, the furniture, everything in here that was hers, is absolutely CAKED with 47 years of nicotine. I've gone nose-blind to it, but my partner has a sensitive nose and it gets to her so bad that she has trouble sleeping, she gets headaches, etc. I can't imagine it's been good for my lungs, me being in here for the past five years, either.  


   My partner moved in with me a few months ago, and her stuff is in here now too. She's really sweet and I love her to bits. Recently she's started cleaning the walls of the nicotine. I get into fights with my great-grandpa almost everyday nowadays, because he is very much stuck in the past, and doesn't want anything to change, want me to change. He's 79 by the way. I can't stay in the past though. I'm tired of telling myself that this is ok. I need to grow and improve as a person. We're not allowed to touch most of the stuff in our room because it was my great-grandma's. I've asked my mom and my grandma, but neither want to help us. They loved my great-grandma too. My mother has been talking about getting a storage unit for the stuff, but there's been no progress on that. She'd need to convince my great-grandpa to get it, but we think she's scared to. But I'm not. I'll fight to be my own person, with my own room.  


   I have more self-respect now than ever, and I am tired of being treated like this is fair to me. To us. I'm tired of people treating me like I matter less. I loved my great-grandma so much, but she's gone. I understand that it's a sensitive topic, that she was a glue to the whole family, but this isn't fair. We can't keep living in a room that's cluttered for the sole reason that no one will let us move her stuff out. We have two people living in here but the room says three. I have grown up in a room that no one let be my own, and now my partner has to live with it too! I don't know what I can do, but I have to do something.",05Oct2020,1
581,"I’ve got a year left. But, I’ll need to bust ass to make it through. Somehow, I wound up spending 10 years on this thing. My priorities are very different in my early 30s than they were in my early 20s, and I’m beginning to doubt my passion for the career I’ve pursued for so long. 

If I’d read this far, I’d advise the author to just finish the damn thing. 

But there are some other details. 

1. My program lost an important form of accreditation in my field (APA accreditation, psychology), which severely limits my career options, and has resulted in a situation in which I will be unable to earn more than about $30,000 per year until maybe 2 or 3 years after I graduate - it is literally impossible to live on a salary like that in my area. 

2. Bosses and managers tend to be narcissistic assholes who are obsessed with personal growth. I can’t stand them. Also, there is a culture of bullying and hazing those below them in the hierarchy. 

3. My commute right now is 2 hours each way for a full-time unpaid internship, which is a result of our losing accreditation. There is no possibility of changing this. 

4. Although I find the work of being a therapist interesting, it’s also challenging and I’m not personally suited for it. I’m much more suited for research, but I chose a clinically oriented program and if I were to try to transition into research it would mean a couple more years of unpaid internships.

5. I make more money as a writer, the work is way easier, my clients and supervisors are way nicer, I get to be an introvert and no one cares, I can work whenever I want, I just closed the deal with a client who will pay me a rate that allows me to earn $300 per hour at my pace if work, it provides the flexibility and anonymity I desire in a career, it’s interesting, and if I focused on this I could travel, which is something I’ve always wanted to do but was never really able to (my parents were poor).",05Oct2020,1
582,"I (22f) have been on the pill since I’m 15. I have awful mood swings since going on it and get extremely depressed if I miss a pill or when I take my 7 day break. 

I came off the pill once before for about 5 months and my bad moods were gone. My head usually feels foggy but being off the pill made my thoughts feel clear. I had never been happier than those 5 months until eventually I got acne which is why I went back on.

I’ve now decided to come off again and have been off for 3 weeks. My mood feels great but I’m afraid of getting pregnant so young. My boyfriend is supportive but I still wonder am I stupid to risk giving up my 20s.

584,"For thirty years, I suffered from depression that made me feel totally worthless; obviously, people took advantage of that, whether consciously or subconsciously, and used the fact that I would bend over backwards to make them happy and never ask anything for return. I recognized the patterns, but it was a lot easier because then for me to ignore it or forgive it quickly, believing that I deserved it anyway. Finally, I started taking Lexapro back in February of this year, and now I suddenly don't feel so worthless. 

There are tons of examples in which I feel wronged, but this specific case is the pettiest on my part: my birthday. Look, I have an identical twin who has a severe mental deficiency, so no one knows no human on Earth is special or unique  more than me and others in my boat. I also know that I am an adult, all my friends are adults, my husband is an adult, and being an adult means that schedules are nigh impossible to sync up and no one actually cares about you either. I get it! HOWEVER, every year I make absolutely certain to make them feel even a little special, but no one extends that courtesy to me. My husband actually has to ASK at least once during the week leading up to it what the date is every year. My dad will send gifts to my twin, but forgets (?) to acknowledge me in any way. The most I've had to look forward to on my birthday for the past few years was the empty platitudes one receives on Facebook from people you rarely speak to and a card from my grandma (that one I actually do appreciate). This year of course no one can expect much, but for my birthday I got the gift of crying alone in my bedroom while my husband played truck simulator (again), then later in the week I got another gift of babysitting my friend's kids while she and her boyfriend sat on the couch ignoring us (again).

Man, I know this post has been mostly venty to this point, but I really do need advice; I finally told them that their behavior is selfish and they apologized profusely, but I know deep down that their apologies mean nothing. No one has tried to actually rectify the situation, so I know this is yet another case of ""sorry I was a dick, but maybe next year I'll remember to not be a dick! I won't actually take responsibility for any of this"".... So... How do I forgive them?? It used to be so easy to forgive and forget, but now I still feel anger/sadness/resentment towards them. I know it's extremely petty and selfish to still feel this way after to weeks, but I'm just as hurt now as I was two weeks ago.

Not long ago, she called me saying that one of her bridesmaids got pregnant and won’t be attending the wedding due to the due date being close to the wedding date.

I (20F) was best friends with this girl (20F) for about 2-3 years. She had a manipulative ex boyfriend that she kept going back to and so did I. Me and her had flirted a lot in the past and planned to have sex when we were 18. When we both weren’t with our boyfriends we decided to do it and went out to a restaurant with friends first. Afterwards it was just us in the car and I started breaking down about my recent breakup saying I didn’t want to be alone and she invited me inside. Now what she said is she ghosted me after 2 years of friendship because I coerced her into sex (back when we were 17-18). I understand how she could feel that way but I was very confused. She undressed first by herself, she got on top of me and performed sexual acts on me first and then I did sexual acts to her. 

Later afterwards, she would ghost me from time to time whenever she’d get back together with her boyfriend. When we were friends she would say things like she was glad I was her first and that it was very special to her. And even did things like kiss me at a concert, and afterwards asked if she could shower with me (which we did). All in all we were just really close and she ghosted me and changed her number around the same time that she got back together with her ex again. And I finally confronted her and she called me a rapist.

How should I go about this? I apologized to her for making her feel that way but it wasn’t my intent but I could see that I hurt her so I kept apologizing. She threatened to report me to my college board and kept calling me a rapist.",05Oct2020,1

The title may kind of sum this up. The experience was very anxiety building for me, as it may not me for anyone else. 

When I was in fourth grade in Halloween I went to the bathroom. But, was greeted by this little girl asking me so much questions. She then said she was going to tell the principal on me. I had no idea what I had done to her, but she said why did you say I have problems. I thought she meant me saying “No I’m in fourth grade”. When she said was I in fifth. 

I was going to tell her I did nothing wrong, but I was the stupid shy kid who never stood up for herself so I didn’t. I was crying, and begging her not to cause drama. She threatened me a lot. 

When I told may parents I was in fifth grade, and they said they will tell the principal if I wanted. But, it took place in the bathroom so I had no proof. I think she got the wrong person, I NEVER saw this girl before who was in first grade. I was in fourth. She once met me at fifth grade, and was still acting like the complete possessed monster she was. I was shivering when I saw her. 

Years have passed, and I wish I told the principal. I hate myself so much for being a scaredy cat, and chickening out. I always have thought about this everyday, and now am loosing interest in everything. This little girl ruined my life. I wish I told her I did nothing to her.ONLY if I stood up, then I would’ve avoided this. I’m craving revenge. 

I got diagnosed with depression, and anxiety, and I’m sure this had a role to play in it. I’ve been avoiding the demon for so long. I’ve become a totally different person. At fourth grade that “innocence” was RUINED. Severely, back then I was a mess. 

This girl ruined my life, and I want to march back in the school, and report her, and kick her butt(not actually cause a fight). I don’t know how to change myself anymore. I’m ruined. What can I do? And I know I’m being over dramatic, I wish I wasn’t so obsessed.",05Oct2020,1
603,"Me and my ex were together for nearly 3 years. We were really close, but she broke up with me in June. It started a couple months before that when she wouldn’t hang out as much. When she did it, she said she had some things she needed to work on with herself. I asked if it was a possibility if we could ever try to make it work again and she said she didn’t know. She said it would be better if we stopped talking completely, but we’re still friends in social media.

I haven’t been able to get over it at all. Well last night I was in the dumps, and I put what was our special song on social media. She gave it a like. Does this mean anything or am I just reading too deep into it? Should I try messaging her?",05Oct2020,1
604,"A little background knowledge: my family has been Lutherin  for my entire life. For all of you who don't know what that is or what they believe, it's basically a branch of Christianity where they think that being gay and acting on it is wrong, they believe that their branch of Christianity and their beliefs are the ONLY correct beliefs and everyone should be a part of it, they go to church every Sunday and are seriously religious. In the case of my parents, they also believe that God is the only way to cure pain and suffering, and that's where my main problem comes in.

I figured out that I wasn't a Lutherin Christian at the beginning of this year. Making this realization took a huge weight off my chest. The rules of Lutherin Christianity are really strict, and I didn't agree with a lot of them, which really stressed me out. Since I decided not to be a Lutherin Christian, I've been trying to figure out what I do believe in, and I finally settled with a type a deism. So basically, I believe that there is a God (or multiple gods) that created the world, but they don't interact with it in any way. I've been very content with these beliefs, and I don't want to change for anyone.

The only bad part of my situation is that I made some friends at my Lutherin church, and I constantly felt like I was lying to them when I was with them. Since a lot of my morals are that of a Lutherin Christian, they never suspected that I could've made a switch, and so when they would pray or worship or talk about God in a very holy and perfect way, I would feel so alone. Over time, I gained the courage to tell my closest friends about it, and there were overall okay with it. A couple were disappointed, but they still accepted my decision anyway and didn't try to convince me otherwise.

But then the problem comes down to the most religious people in my church, and that includes my parents. I haven't told my parents directly that I'm a deist and not a Lutherin Christian, but I've given them some pretty big hints and shown that I'm not a part of their beliefs system anymore, and they aren't having it. They still force me to go to church and participate in religious discussions and follow all their religious rules. They even sometimes force me to read the family devotion even if I tell them that I really, really don't want to. And the worst part of it all is that they believe that if I just pray to God and give surrender myself to Him, then my mental illnesses will be cured, and so they aren't doing very much to help me.

The one thing they have decided to do for me is get me a therapist, however they don't trust any therapists who aren't Lutherin Christians, so that's a big issue. They first got me someone from my church, but of course that didn't work out, since our beliefs didn't match up. They are now refusing to get me a therapist who isn't a Lutherin Christian, since they think that they are only doing it for the money. It's this constant war between my parents about this, and I don't know what to. They just will not accept that I'm different, and it's really stressing me out.

TLDR: My parents cannot accept that I'm not a part of their religion anymore, and they are starting to use it against me and make my life miserable because of it.",05Oct2020,1
605,"

I’ve been talking to this girl since august. We’ve known each other since we were kids and recently we’ve been reconnecting. She’s always texting me good morninggg and we text 24/7. She seemed to really like me 

We hungout the other night and everything was going great until she dropped a bomb  she’s in this long distance relationship with a guy she met online. She was complaining saying how he’s a douche and she’s not sure how to cut things off and was even saying stuff like “I just don’t connect with him how I connect with you” 


So I texted her saying we can’t talk anymore and she hasn’t texted back since thankfully

I have no clue what my dream job is. I have no passion at all but I need to start going to school or something now but I don't know if it's even the right step for me

I need to get to my next step but I don't even know what that next step is. I've felt like I've been stuck for over a year. Every direction I walk in is just another wall infront of me.

I'm too poor to afford college, too afraid I'll fail out and even if I go in to school I don't even know what I'd go in for

608,"Throwaway here. I’ve posted a couple of times about this situation. 

Basically, three days ago my dad started a political argument and he started screaming. He started making really personal attacks at me. I’ve never raised my voice back at him before and I had a scare that I would be couch surfing after that interaction. I eventually came home, and he told me that I was being disrespectful for yelling back at him. He told me, among other things, that he would pay for everything (housing, food, college, car, phone, etc.) but if I yelled back at him (even if he was yelling) that I need to move out. So now I’m trying to figure out housing and financial independence because I’m tired of getting screamed at. 

As of now I’ve been advised to clear my thoughts and have a conversation with my mom mediating. Ideally, it’ll be a time when I unload my thoughts without him getting aggressive again. 

He has a twisted view of family because he’s a military guy. When we were younger, he’d scream at my mom to scream at my siblings and I if he didn’t scream at us himself. Growing up, I always just took it when he would get in my face and yell at me. This is the worst it’s ever been because I actually engaged with him. 

Yesterday, he came into my room and told me over and over again that I’m his subordinate and that I’m not allowed to yell at him back even if he yelled at me. If I rose my voice at him back, it’s disrespectful and if I can’t be respectful he wants me out of the house. 

He’s not one for civil conversation, so when I sit down with him and my mother today or tomorrow, it’s likely that I might get kicked out of the house. 

All I want to tell him is that I’m not okay with his expectation that I should show him unbridled respect when he’s allowed to disrespect, scream, threaten, and criticize me. 
I want him to acknowledge that he’s hurt me and that he was yelling at me (he always says that he isn’t yelling when he is). 
I want him to know that I felt threatened and that’s why I rose my voice back at him (he’s acknowledged that I’ve never done that before). 
I’m basically going to tell him that if he keeps using his money and power over my life as an excuse to scream and disrespect me, that I’ll move out and leave behind all of the money, cars, and protection. 

I’m trying to make plans right now for what happens worse case scenario, because I have only $3000 to my name, a $9 part time, and housing plans for the summer but not earlier. In the event that I’m couch surfing again, I don’t know if I should tell any of my extended family about the situation, because I’m afraid that it my anger my dad even more. My family is already splintering because of we lost my grandma (his mom) last month. If I hurt his pride, I know he won’t forgive me (at least with my experience in the past with him). 

He’s threatened me in high school that he’s a powerful guy and could ruin me, although he wouldn’t acknowledge that he said that. He told me that he only remembers things that he actually meant in the past. Growing up, he’s said a lot of things to me while he was angry.  I just don’t know what he actually meant or not. I don’t want to find out the hard way if he truly meant that he wants me out and be unprepared. 

My mom is completely broken up about this whole thing. She’s siding with me, she doesn’t think I should apologize and has tried reasoning with my dad. My siblings are concerned. They’re being very nice to me because they’re not quite certain if I’m going to get kicked out or not. They understand what’s happing though; My older brother (M21) gets screamed at all the time and called names because he doesn’t quite get along with my father (his ADD doesn’t help). My sister (F16) has also been subject to my dad’s screaming. Up until now, I’ve been his favorite (I’m sure I’ve told you before) partly due to the fact that I’ve never engaged with him while he would scream. 

Am I making the wrong move? Is being subject to screaming and threats worth financial stability? If I choose to move out immediately and become more financially independent, what money advice would I need to know?

I've had struggles with both high functioning autism and a dysfunctional family environment, both of which I did therapy for a not too long ago. I'm finishing up training to be an EMT and then relocating to another part of my state to start a new life. I intend to spend the first few months getting settled with a job and finding friends and engaging in hobbies. There are Meetup groups still active with precautions where I'll be going, and some things seems to be open again following COVID-19 protocols. But down the line, I would like to get my feet wet with dating. It's definitely not something I want to just jump into right when I'm on my own, but after a while I'd like to give it a go.


Though, given the global pandemic, socializing has become much trickier. My social skills are fairly normal at this point in my life aside from some awkwardness and sometimes being soft spoken. I heard dating apps have been more used, but it seems to be a general opinion that at least for guys they are not a worthy investment. As for hobby groups, I definitely know I can make friends there but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use that to date. Like for martial arts for example(which I like), I'd never do it since if things don't work out it can be awkward and one or both of you may leave the dojo/gym.

I come from a family of 6 members including my parents,  me and my brother and sister changed country ( we are studying abroad) leaving my younger brother (16 years old)with my parents.
My parents have the habit of changing houses and cities ( not intentional)  every year, my brother gets attached to a lot of people very fast and it pains him to say good bye and meet new people to make new attachments and leaving them afterwords because of the constant moving.
I try to keep in touch with him and supporting him with all my heart because we are apart, he started opening up to me and I was shocked to know that he was suffering from depression to the point where he gets heart aches that pains him and makes him cry, unfortunately for him this year my father was unemployed and was taking his anger on my brother emotionally not physically, then he started cutting him self, and filming them and showing it to me which I replied to it negatively and tired to show him why what he was doing is wrong and that it hurts me seeing him doing this to him self, he does all those stuff because he wants attention and if he doesn’t get it he does something bazaar to himself only to get it, he doesn’t value his life, he enjoy being reckless he believes if he dies then it’s fate and not taking precautions ( like speeding while driving accompanied by  passengers who keeps telling him to stop but doesn’t listen and feels proud of him self ( he doesn’t see what he is doing is wrong and keeps talking about his dangerous adventures even if I told him to stop and that is worng and that I don’t wanna know, he just doesn’t get it and does it anyway)).
When I try to give him advice he cut me off and talks about how bad his life is and how his father is making is life a living hell, he just want me to listen to him and so I did, and if I made a point which he can’t deny or discuss he stops me and tells me that he is talking to me and considering me as a friend and if I kept talking he would stop talking to me all together as if he is proud of his doing.

I took a DVS in auto mechanics, and then worked at a shipyard as a pipe fitter/millwright for a few months, got layed off at the end of their contract. I never really liked working on cars, so I basically applied to every other field that my experiences could be relevant in, all the while working at a small general shop. 3 months later, a school calls me and says they need a teacher and they liked my profile.

So I like heavy metal music and such, and though I like death metal musically the lyrics, themes, album covers, song titles, etc. make me deeply disturbed and traumatized, I'm afraid. This is because it has been quite a few months since I first got to know about two bands, which I'm not gonna name as their names alone triggers my anxiety.

I know that their aesthetic is made deliberately and specifically with the purpose of being shocking, disturbing and disgusting, but just knowing that doesn't change the fact that, for the better part of these last months, everytime I listen to music, regardless of what genre (which is something I do a lot, I used to love music), it directly reminds me of these two things. (I refuse to call them bands anymore)

But the worst part is when I'm in bed, trying to sleep. I cannot sleep because I cannot stay a single minute without thinking about them. There is one verse of one """"song"""" which repeats in my brain non stop. Even the mere existence of these bands and of death metal has become a source of extreme anxiety to me. One night I started to cry, I couldn't breathe and I was in utter and complete panic, because I couldn't stop thinking about them. 

From what I have found, which is to say nothing, no one has ever had this issue, just me. Which I find baffling. I honestly cannot even imagine how someone could listen to a song by either of these ""bands"" and not be immediately and profoundly disturbed, let alone liking their ""songs"".

I am so sick of this. All I wanted is to be able to listen to I song I like without being reminded of these sick, disgusting people's garbage. I wanted to be able to sleep without constantly thinking about some necrophiliac scumbags' sick fantasy.

623,"Hi everyone,

I have always been an overachiever in an academic context. I graduated with near perfect grades in both high school and college (I graduated this past spring with a biochemistry degree). I decided to attend dental school, particularly an accelerated program in which I will finish a year early. I just finished by first quarter, and I got a 2.7 GPA, my grades have never been this low in my life.

We take both lecture and preclinical courses (drilling plastic teeth and sculpting teeth out of wax). I got a C in the waxing/indirect vision course (the main focus of this course is to work on crowns). I got a D in the drilling course (fillings). The reason I got a D was because I failed the last practical, which was worth a majority of the grade this quarter. Aside from these poor grades, I got As and Bs in the lectures. Lab is definitely tough because it's a new skill, and one factor to consider about these grades: they are all interim. I can improve my grades until the end of the academic year, which is when everything is finalized. So, if I bust my butt, I can pull my lab grades up to As, or Bs in the worst case scenario. Some of the battle is just developing the skills, and I have been practicing diligently over the break we just had last week, and I think I improved a lot even in that short span of time.

I was just seeking advice on how to keep pushing forward and not give up, I've always aspired to enter the dental field. Dental school is hard, and I sort of felt I wasn't cut out for the field based on my performance in the beginning. I would like to improve, but I feel somewhat discouraged because I have some steep learning curves to overcome. I forgot to mention, I will be remediating the lab I got a D in, which is basically extra practice time (this is a bonus because we have limited lab time during the week b/c of COVID).

My back-up career is to be a PhD in biochemistry since I love research, but this is a longer schooling and does not guarantee the financial stability dental school does. Those are two factors that are holding me back from leaving dental school.

Anyone have any words of wisdom/advice? Thank you so much!",05Oct2020,1
624,"My (46F) mother and I (14F) have a pretty good relationship. She's pretty strict, especially about school but she's a good mom. However, recently she's been really, really stressed. We've all just started online school, and as a teacher she's been spending a lot of time rewriting lesson plans. And, understandably, that's stressful! Sometimes she'll not want to speak to us or want us to speak to each other when she's been working all morning. As an introvert, I can understand and do the best I can to accommodate her. 

The only problem is, online school has been causing problems between my sister (13F) and me as well. My sister's the most social person in our family, and without being able to talk to her friends as often she been bothering me for attention instead. Sometimes during class, after I tell her I'm busy and not to be bothered. Unfortunately, she can't seem to get it and has repeatedly come in and tried to distract me while I'm in class resulting in trouble for me from some of my teachers. I really want to be a good student this year, and honestly my sister bursting into my room during class isn't helping. I can't talk to my father without being made fun of, and my mother will yell at me about ""having her own life"" and ""too stressed to deal with it"". I can't scold my sister on my own without getting in major trouble, and I haven't been able to bring it up with my parents without being shut down. What do I do?",05Oct2020,1
625,"Long story short: Started college trying to get an associate's but eventually stopped after 2 semesters. On my third semester took classes and about a week later school started, I dropped them all. I thought maybe joining the workforce would be better for me, it was not. About 2 years later, all I did was work retail, didnt get much out of it other than some cash and ""real world"" experience. 

Decided to explore my interest and went for a certificate. Got fafsa to help pay for the classes and so far, I really dont like this program. I have to take it online which all ready sucks since I cant learn that way and i was recently diagnosed with cancer so I was very depressed during the summer and still am now. I'm completely drained both mentally and physically and doing a class I just find boring, it's looking like i wont be passing my class. I'm incredibly confused on the homework problems and pre quiz work, the lectures and homework overview lectures dont help much for me and the information isnt sticking.

So how bad would it be if I fail this class, how much would I owe? My GPA is about 3.3, I received 1.5k in fafsa (500 for tuition)  and I havent failed a class once but I do have 1 W from history (prof was godawful) and the 4 classes I dropped (for some reason I cant find those classes in my course history) and these were taken without fafsa",05Oct2020,1
626,"To start off, I don't really want to give out to much info about my past or relationship with my father, other than it being a typical father and son relationship most people have, I have an older 27 year old sister and my mother.  What I'm about to type really just happened and I honestly don't know what to do or who to talk to about it first. Sorry in advance for any grammar errors, or any sentences that don't make any sense, i'm actually in shock right now that my father has done this to us. 

&gt;Recently, my father has been going on business trips out of state almost every month, which in itself made me suspicious that something might be happening other than ""business matters"" since business trips weren't such a frequent thing with his job. Last week my dad came back from his business trip, my mother and I had to pick up him up at the airport and drive him home. When we picked him up he asked to log into his Facebook and messenger app on my phone, since his phone was dead, which wasn't really suspicious or anything in those terms since he uses facebook a lot. A couple days has past, and today this morning I heard him taking a phone call in a low voice in the other room. At this point my mother had already gone to work and I was awake getting ready for online zoom university. When I heard my father take the phone call the other room I found it suspicious and unusual since usually when he talks on his phone with anyone he usually speaks very loudly, like to the point where it sounds like he's yelling but not in a bad way. But this time it was different, he was talking in a low discrete voice and me being nosey, I was curious and was lowkey putting my ear against my door to listen in on to what he was saying.   
&gt;  
&gt;I overheard him talking to another person, talking about how they were doing, how did they sleep last night, etc. while talking in that low discrete voice which seemed very suspicious. Me being the type of person who over-worries, I remembered how he had logged into my phone's messenger app, so I had checked that app and saw that there was a recent chat with another woman. I checked the chat and I saw that my father had been messaging this other woman, for a good while now, saying how they miss each other now that he has come back from his ""Business trip"" and calling each other ""love"".    
&gt;  
&gt;I knew if I kept scrolling up within the chat I wasnt going to like what I see, never the less I kept doing so and I actually kinda wanna throw up now.   
&gt;  
&gt;I found out that they have actually been seeing each other for the past couple months (To maybe half a year?), and apparently the other female has a family of her own, but no husband. My father has been talking to her as if he wants to be considered the ""Rich Step-Father"" to her kids, and is looking to rent out a home near where she lives. I couldn't read anymore or else I would actually start throwing up.

627,"I’ve been friends with my best friend for 14 years. We have always been so similar despite having different up bringing’s. Her family was making six figures and going on vacations every month as my family was barley getting by and my mom was going through drug addiction. Fast forward 7 years and now my mom has passed, I’ve lost my job due to covid, no car and still trying to get by. Meanwhile she has been living with her parents rent free, working with her mom after she got her a job, after ruining her college career her parents spent 100’s of thousands on. She’s been through everything I’ve gone through and has stayed by my side through it all which has really bonded us. But, now with everything going on in the world she is hardcore showing her privilege and siding with Trump knowing how much it hurts me and effects my life when it has literally no effect on her since she is not in the real world. We keep fighting, I try so hard to ignore it but she will still complain about her health care when she actually has insurance and I don’t. I have bipolar disorder, and chronic depression and cannot afford the things I need. I tell her how much Trump has messed up my life the past year and she is still supporting him while being hypocritical and not thinking of my life. I love her, and I don’t want to lose our friendship but we keep fighting and she hurts me so bad. I’m not sure what to say or do anymore.

630,"So hi, I (13M) recently started to come out of my comfort zone and came out to a few people at my school about the fact that I am transgender (FTM), most of my friends and classmates reacted positively and were very supportive of me, though I came out to a boy in our class that didn't take it that well. He made fun of me for it, then proceeded to tell almost half-the class (Even though I visibly told everyone who I came out to just to keep it within our friend circle until I am comfortable with going fully public) and phrased my transition in words so that most of the class would turn against me, so comments that 'It's against mother nature!', 'But you have been gifted a gender, you should cherish it!' became the usual comments I get when someone brings me up.

Every day he'd let me down about small things that wouldn't be masculine in his book (Painted nails, pink backpack, the fact that I am an artist and 'Boys cannot be artists'!, the fact that I can't bind my chest (Mostly because my mother doesn't approve of me being trans), etc.), though this sounds silly it seriously would hurt me. I told my supportive friends about this though they wouldn't even care since he was such a great friend of theirs, they didn't believe a thing I said that he has done to me, some of my friends didn't even take the matter seriously, the worst thing is that he acts all nice in front of them, telling them how much he cares about trans people though they could leave for a moment and suddenly all trans people are the worst-against-the-nature creatures. Once they did take it seriously, though he only nodded and said he'd stop, though this behavior only continued and continued.

I have been having this trans problem in my family as well, I have been not sure if I can come out so I just nudged the topic around with my mum. She has been extremely negative about the idea of anyone in her family being trans or part of the LGBT in general, though she is fine with people outside her family being LGBT for some reason. I even once suggested her buying more boyish-looking clothing and she was instantly onto me with the words *""You'd embarrass your family and disappoint your grandma why would you ever want that?"",* the farthest I could get from her is for her to get me a pretty masculine looking hairstyle. When I actually had the courage to come out I have been instantly yelled at and denied. So if I would tell my mother about what is going on at school I bet she would 100% side with my 'friend'. So I have nobody to turn for help to, I am almost hopeless by now. What am I supposed to even do, I am cornered.",05Oct2020,1

632,"My \[22\] gf \[21\] and I got back together a month and a half ago after a year apart.

We had a rough start, the first year we couldnt hangout much and it was because her and her parents wanted us to have a chaperone.

I felt a lot of pressure to change for her and because I was infatuated I did a lot of this. 

After a year of this back and forth she decided to formally date me and by then I had checked out a bit. Things didn't change much when we were dating aside from me being more withdrawn, we still didnt see eachother much outside of work. We only dated for 2 months before I broke it off because of a few reasons, I was being toxic, I felt controlled and I realized that I had feelings for my bestfriend so I ended things. 

My brain keeps ruminating, I remember when I went to talk to her about ending things I was considering asking her about taking a break as I felt overwhlemed and unsure but it seemed as though this was a mutual feeling so we came to an end instead. After the breakup I confessed my feelings to my friend and we had a short fling, it felt a bit off at first so I kind of pushed her away and said I wasnt quite ready for that but overtime it felt a bit more normal so it continued, then I crashed again and realized once again I couldnt do it so I cut things off cause I didn't want to play her, and I needed to sort my shit out. I waited a while and worked on myself a bit and realized I wanted my ex back so I reached out, we had a good talk she was angry with the hookup for a while understandably but eventually took me back. Things are good, we see eachother lots and there isnt really any pressure, not negative anyways. It's great. Except I am ruminating over my intentions for the break up still - Did I want to take a break just to see how things would go with my friend? Did I just want to hangout with her again ? (Gf at the time asked me to stop hanging out with her when we dated because we were really close and friend had feelings for me, but was respectful - didnt hit on me etc) or did I flat out leave her for someone else? Idk I know I felt sad and relieved after the break up but I keep thinking im a garbage person for how it went down - like I don't think I wanted a break to keep her as a back up I think I genuinely just wanted to see my friend again but then I confessed my feelings when I realized the breakup was more mutual ? Idk what I was thinking I just know I cant accept that things are good now and that I dont feel like I deserve her. Idk what to do please help me figure out how I can sort this out and put it to rest. I have tried talking to her but Im tired of torturing her with the past. Im just so anxious and I want to let this go and be happy since she is over it and things are good, and we are both 100x better to eachother but this guilt is going to make me end things if I dont sort it out.",05Oct2020,1

Hi everybody, I’m kinda in a dilemma here because I’m not sure how I should go about this. So the story is I (19f) have a friend, named Alison (also 19f) who I cannot stand. I have no intentions of being around her. Here’s the problem though, she’s closely connected to one of my current best friends, Jen. Jen (19f) loves to hang out with Alison. They like to party together, drink, smoke weed, etc. I genuinely don’t care that they want to participate in that kind of lifestyle, but I’m now a lot more mature than I was a few months ago, and I don’t like to get into partying anymore. When I’m around Jen, we usually do not party or participate in anything illicit but when we do we do it in a responsible manner (ex: we don’t drive, we don’t smoke in public, etc). Allison, on the other hand, doesn’t give a flying fuck about being drunk or high in public. Allison has done so many fucked up things that if I were to list all of them this post would be like 3-4 pages long. Alison has embarrassed me countless time in front of my parents, people in restaurants, and even my other friends sometimes. I really have no genuine interest in being friends with her anymore. The problem I’m having right now is that since Allison is so connected to Jen, I’m afraid that Jen is going to think I’m a bad friend for not wanting to be friends with Allison. What’s the best way i should handle this?

643,"So this is a weird situation. I’m working freelance  for a company under two people. I’ve been at the company for almost a year now. One of the people (A) is fantastic, prone to mistakes but good at owning up to them. The other (B) makes many mistakes, owns up to none, and blames me for not being proactive enough to catch their mistakes before they make them. They give me partial information on everything and leave me to scope out and look for the rest even though they have the information. The way the company works is that as long as you have good performance, they don’t care about how you do the job. Because of my efforts and my team’s efforts, B is performing well. Recently I interviewed for my own job so I can get company benefits but honestly I’m considering telling them to not consider my application anymore because of this person. While I would like to work for the company, the ongoing gaslighting and the excessive effort I have to put in to get a basic job done is exhausting. Also working for the company directly will not change this, but will make it harder for me to find another job if needed and will make it even easier for this person to continue making my life difficult because there is no threat of me walking away. Before me, 4 others have walked away from this job because of B’s behavior. There’s no opportunity for me to give feedback as I’m not a part of the company formally. The only reason I’ve made it this far is because I’m used to really shitty bosses historically and know how to deal with a B. The job itself is easy and fun outside of this person. 

Do you think I should rescind my application? What would you do? I don’t know how to make it clear that this isn’t okay with me without damaging my opportunity or damaging my relationship with A and the company.

644," 

PLEASE HEAR MY STORY OUT! This is really embarrassing and depressing to say but I am turning 29 at the end of this week and I'm still stuck working a minimum wage job. Yes I am a grown ass man working for minimum wage. And it is not a living wage. I live with my single mother. My mother is kinda like me. She did go to college but dropped out out after a few semesters. My mother like me does not make good money so I just live with her and we split the bills. I did go to college in my early 20s, well, I attended my local community college. I didn't really know what to do. I had no sense of direction. So I just took a bunch of ""General Education"" courses, a bunch of them that it allowed me to earn a piece of paper that says ""Associates in Science degree"". It doesn't really mean anything. It just means I took a bunch of Gen Ed courses. It's basically a stepping stone for a bachelors degree. Back when I was a full time student I also worked a part-time job (physical labor-30hrs/wk) at the same time. I know that there are a ton of people out there who are doing more than what I did but I am what I am. It took a toll on my mental health. My anxiety and depression were through the roof like 11/10 kind of bad. I've been on antidepressants. I feel like it never really did much for me so I got off it. I took a hippie-ish route and just took a break from school and work. I read a bunch of self-help books. Got into meditation. Learned how to be healthy. This ""mental health break"" did wonders for my mental well being. It's not a cure all but I can definitely feel a significant improvement. I can say I am a lot better now.

After a few months of this mental health break I went back to job hunting. My employer didn't mind my unemployment gap since its just minimum wage work and it seems like they really needed people at that time. I considered myself lucky cause I know unemployment gaps do hurt your resume and your chances of getting hired. I promised myself that is the last time I'm gonna take a mental health break again. Fast forward to this day. Time flies fast btw. I realized how I fell into the comfort of my own routine. I'm still stuck at the same job. It dawned on me how I did not want to do this forever. This is the last year of my 20s. I want to move up. Pick up a real skill and grow. I'm not dreaming of being mega rich but I want financial security. I also want to make my mother proud and happy. I realized how tough it is to be a single parent for her. How much she worked hard for us. This never dawned on me when I was young. I want to give back to her.

I realized I want to go back to school. Achieve something. It's just that I'm weighing the pros and cons of it. I'm scared of Ageism. It's a very real thing. I always hear that a college degree doesn't even guarantee you a job nowadays so there is that too. I'm scared to take out student loans and not be able to pay it off. The last thing is I don't have a clear sense of direction yet. The things that I'm good at, what I love to do, what's in-demand, and what pays decent never aligns. I can't think of one career that checks all the boxes. I've been thinking of what I want and should do but I just get frustrated. I can do really well in school if my mind is on it but I do not have any clear direction at the moment. This pandemic didn't help either. I hate online class learning. I've took them before and I really hated them. I do a lot better in a real class setting. I told myself that I am not going back to school until everything goes back to normal.

I was hoping you guys can give me some insights and advice given that I provided my history. I would be really happy and thankful for even just a little bit of advice. I hope you random strangers in the internet can help me in some way. Thank you!",05Oct2020,1

Since starting my PhD, I have the funds to move out and be on my own. But my mom told me to stay home this semester to save money since all of my classes are remote due to Covid. The thing is, I would feel bad moving out because I don’t want to leave her with my angry brother and alcoholic father. When I bring up moving out, she gets sad since I spent the last 4 years without visiting home once. And I don’t want to leave my brother in a place he clearly hates (which i believe is why he lashes out at my parents). And honestly, I feel guilty having left my brother here for the past 4 years while I was having fun in undergrad. But at the same time, I feel so drained every single day. I’m scared I won’t do well in my classes because of the environment that I’m in. I don’t know what to do.",05Oct2020,1

666,"Today, while I (26F, white) was placing an order at Chipotle a woman (aprox. 22F, Black) brushed past me pretty closely. At this location there is a wall behind the ordering line so they can fit more booths in the sitting area. Because the line space is pretty tight I kind of put my arms up in front of my face and turned so I wasn’t face to face with her when she brushed by. 

She said something that I missed, and I said “I’m sorry you just don’t need to be that close to me” while making a little pushing motion with my hands because she was still really close. She then said something like “I’m so done with these white women” and kept getting me to try and respond to her, so I just turned around and stood to my back with her. She was obviously annoyed, and I felt like nothing I could have said would make the situation any better, so the best thing I could do was end the conversation. 

When I walked outside, she was waiting near the door talking on the phone. She kept saying/almost yelling things to me as I walked to my car. It wasn’t obscene or anything just like “oh look at this girl, walking to her car, why won’t you talk to me”. When I drove out of the parking lot she was standing next to her car, clearly filming me on her phone. 

I understand that she thought I was discriminating against her (or overly annoyed with her) because she was black, and **I do not want to make** ***anyone*** **feel this way!!** 

Is there any way I could have responded to let her know that I didn’t mean it to be racist, but I understand why she would take it that way because of her past experiences; or is it best to just remove myself from the situation because nothing I can say will undo the micro-aggression she felt?",05Oct2020,1
667,"I'm hoping someone can give some non-judgmental advice here. It's a little long.

I (27 F) have been with my therapist for almost three years. I get along very well with her and she has helped me through so much in the past few years. I talk to her once every three-four weeks and in between. There's never been an issue of crossing boundaries.

Recently, she had self-disclosed about her relationship ending, but it tied into what we were discussing. She didn't spend any time talking about it.

A few days after, she sent me a text asking me a question - to be more specific, it was her asking me what my ex-boyfriend's last name was because she had recently met someone who sounded very similar to how I described him with the same name, and it's not a big city. I told her and it turns out it wasn't him.

The conversation continued somehow and turned into her confiding in me about her ex and her breakup. I'm in school for social work and I know all about this (before anyone tells me that this is flat-out wrong), but I didn't want to be mean and responded. She responded once more before saying ""I'm sorry, you're my client and I shouldn't be putting this on you but I appreciate the safe space you've given me.""

The conversation was harmless and no reason I would ever go report her. However, it made me think of how much friendlier our sessions has gotten. She never used super professional talk which I like that she doesn't, but it almost sounds like I'm talking to a friend at times, and that's not what I need in a therapist.

She's great and I've enjoyed therapy with her. I'm also worried about finding a new therapist, but I don't want this stunting my growth. I don't feel like I'm getting the proper help if I feel like I'm talking to a friend.

668,"throwaway because this is something i dont want anyone i know to find out

i graduated from college this year. however, just right after everything academics-related were over, covid hit. while i've technically graduated, there weren't any ceremonies held because of the virus. this happened back in april.

ever since then ive just been at my parent's house and playing video games all day. at first i was completely fine with how things are because i was thinking that i could finally get the break from college that i've always wanted. however as time went on i started to get more and more anxious about things. it's been 5-6 months since then and all i've done was play video games.

thing is, there's nothing i can do about it. i cant apply for jobs because i havent paid everything from the university yet, so i still dont have my diploma. i live in asia, and in my country you can't really get any jobs unless you have a diploma (at least for jobs that my course has prepared me for). without those, the only jobs i can apply for are manual labor stuff since i live in a rural area, but i dont really want to work in those jobs because of covid (we live with our grandparents and my sibling and cousins are just kids). my parents are fine with the situation, they understand that with the virus going in there's really not much i can do. most of my college classmates are also in the same situation, and they seem fine with just waiting it out.

this situation is stressing me out though. i know there's nothing i can do about it, but i cant help but feel anxious. with every day that passes it feels like im just wasting more and more of my time. what really makes me feel ashamed is that i feel like im useless, my younger siblings and cousins are all studying and my older siblings are working so at least they're doing something productive, meanwhile im doing neither. i cant even bring myself to do anything anymore. i dont play videogames much anymore nor do i do any of my other hobbies (watching shows and going on bike rides, although for biking's case i cant because my town went on lockdown) because i always feel guilty about them.

this has been long already so im gonna cut it here, i hope my english isnt too bad, tbh while writing this i considered many times just stopping because of how ashamed i am to admit that to everyone and myself that im just a useless freeloader who does nothing all day. pls help, i just want to get this guilty feeling out of my system",05Oct2020,1

An acquaintance of mine drove me to our mutual friends New home for a small house-warming get-together. She ""knew' the house number but I did not so I followed her.

I couldn't believe what she was doing. 

Our friend's neighbor answers the door, very upset and politely yet angrily that we have the wrong house and that we upset her disabled child...at 10pm. 

I apologise and excuse us. Our friend's house is next door, and he comes out to greet us. My acquaintance is laughing about the situation, while still outside in the front yard, and the neighbors are in their pajamas standing outside their door in disapproval. 

While I know I was not the one to cause any of this, this isn't about me. This is about our friend's neighbors, and his first impression in a new neighborhood. I feel something should be done.

I have been pressuring my acquaintance to do something for them as an apology. Her reaction is ""yeah, you're right. I don't know what to do so let me know if you think of anything.""

Ugh!

678,"Sorry, it’s long. Advice is much appreciated.

After 6 years I finally had the courage to phone my GP (General Practice) and booked an appointment and got a call back from my doctor since well, COVID doesn’t let us do face-to-face.

So I opened up. I’ve never told an adult any of my problems partly because when I was under 16 my parents would end up getting told, I’m 16 now by the way.

So long story short I told my doctor about everything. How my issues started and how I think I “mentally matured” before everyone else because I started self harming when I was like 11 and I said my theory is that I’ve gotten worst because I took too long to seek for help. 

I described the usual things you would hear from someone who’s depressed and suicidal but then I went on to talk about how I’m really concerned about bipolar in particular and I’ve monitored my behavior and I tend to have more longer manic episodes (so, energetic and just really hopeful for the future and all that jazz) and then everything comes crashing down for about 2 weeks for no actual reason then it’s back to manic episodes. Of course I can’t diagnose myself hence why I had to call someone because I want my mind to be at ease.

One more thing I mentioned is how I’m the exact definition of Antisocial Personality Disorder (Sociopathy) which ties in with narcissism. I’m the literal definition of both of those and I’ve said about how I manipulate, how I put up a facade to suit others so I can get what I want and also how I take my anger out on others and blame them and I said I show no empathy for that or anything else at all. **Although I understand I can’t get diagnosed as an under 18 for that.**

After all of that I got told that I’ve to wait until I’m 18 and she just gave me two numbers to two different organizations that deal with children. I wanted to put my mind to rest and see if there was anything up for me. I feel as though she just brushed it all off after I said I don’t have intentions to kill myself when I cut.

I guess she forgot about me even though she texted me and told me happy birthday on the day and I've talked to her the most compared to my brother who hasn't talked to her in a number of months to a year because my parents are divorced and my dad doesn't encourage communication or more like...cusses a lot when we even say the word mom. Anyways, I'm happy for him ^_^ but my dad seemed to pity me and was reflecting on how shitty my birthday was which made me kind of depressed but I didn't complain and said it was fine because it is. Birthdays before you turn 20 are more special usually anyways right? Then he said he wanted to do something for me still and asked what I wanted. I couldn't think of anything but I was starting to have ideas about maybe getting into knitting and getting some yarn to make hats or maybe scarfs! I started when I was little but I'd have to relearn it now. Anyways instead of that he popped his head out the door and said he bought me something instead. I knew I couldn't say no or he would get really mad and call me ungrateful but the odds are 98% out of 100% shitty when he gets me gifts without consulting anyone.

I also have another pair and a pair of earphones....Needless to say I didn't want them but if I told him that he'd be mad at me so I tried them out and everything. Then he kept wanting to test it and told me that he only got them for me to try them out to see if he wanted to order a pair for himself. I wasn't really mad. Just disappointed that it all happened like I expected. I guess he realized I was from my face and he got angry anways and called me an asshole when I said that I have headphones and he could have these ones if he wanted them instead of buying another set.

Bestfriend (f22) we’ll call her sharon 
Boyfriend (m23) call him john 
Bestfriends cousin (~38-40 f) call her janice 

Ok so i kinda of live with john and he isnt the best boyfriend. We have a rocky relationship. He was controlling and most recently he hit me once and i filed a police report. I know its bad. But since our relationship has been like this Sharon and john pretty much hate eachother and im always in the middle. 
On friday i got upset with john and decided to go bake at sharons house. We were drinking and i decided i wanted to go back to johns because he made me dinner and that was my initial plan was to eat with him and have a nice day but because of the argument it got interrupted. 
Sharon told me to stay and i said i was going to leave. She told her cousin who she lives with and i know fairly well that i wanted to leave and she told me to stay the night. Shron then said if i left she would kill herself. We both have depression and anxiety. 
I agreed to stay and john said he would come
To get my car. So i told her i was just going to go speak to him and id be back. I went out and we went to the store a few blocks away. She texted me saying it was too late and i didnt have to come back. I said i was just going to the store and id be back but if she really didn’t want me there id leave. I was half a block from her house and i was in the car with john when i saw her standing there. I stepped out of the car qnd she asked me why i was doing this to myself. Janice was with her. I was trying to deescalate the situation when i noticed her arm has slashes all down it. Then she started fighting with john. And i just started hyperventilating and then went into a full on anxiety attack where i was on the floor uncomfortably screaming with janice holding me.

686,"It's really hard who you call family. My dad passed a couple of years ago and ever since then it's only been me and my mum. My mum has nice but has been dealing with a lot of things my dad has done to her and their marriage even prior to him getting ill which is something I knew of already. 

Ever since I was a kid they would have marital problems and fight almost everyday. They would fight physically and verbally and my mum would always get hurt. As my mum is a devoted Catholic, she still chose to be with my dad saying that it was her 'spiritual responsibility.' Being the weird kid that I am and living in such a religious and conser household, I had a hard time finding who I was and being myself because I was always told to do this and do that. I kept a forced smile on my face because they told me I can't tell anyone about what was happening in the family because it would tear us apart. So of course an innocent child who only knew nothing then but to obey, I followed exactly as ordered. 

I had suicidal tendencies even as a teenager, bullied a lot as a kid for being short and fat. And it tore me apart. I hardly have confidence and my self esteem is low. There are times when I have gone past that but it still haunts me. I have been always shy or afraid to talk to people because I'm still afraid that they won't like who I am, or they might not like what I say. I became too conscious and too aware of myself in a negative way. I never went to therapy because my mum said I'm being too sensitive and other people have greater problems so I should be grateful. 

After my dad's death, I knew I had to be strong for my mum like I've always been before. I was always her sponge, even my dad's. I thought I could do it and I can set it aside, won't take a toll on me. Since my dad died she would always talk to me for 3-5 hours saying how much she felt sad and disappointed about her life and their life and I sat down to listen but sometimes, giving her advice is tough. She acts as if I'm blaming her when I'm not. And she likes to tell me that I don't understand her when my whole life I've been here for her. I don't want to get tired but she's always turning the tables around as if it were my fault. 

Yesterday, I decided to cut myself again due to a large fight that we had. She was saying how demanding I was and that I never understood her (again). I got mad and shouted and locked myself and felt useless and shit again. It's so hard to be in the stage of my life where I should be planning and thinking about my future but all she ever tells me for that is that I'm selfish, I never understand her, I never think about her. 

Her negativity always dawns on me and it haunts me so much especially that we are in the same house. I am having so much thoughts these days that I cannot even do anything, I cannot process anything even because all I have in my head is a lot of panic and at the same time thinking that I will not make it and it will go wrong, that maybe I should just die. I'm trash and I should be dead. 

I am having such a hard time. I don't know how to live in this place with her and I can't even move out because I don't have enough savings. I'm so tired of dealing with her blaming me all the time for no good reason just so she could say that she is right. This has happened several times and I've just reached my peak right now.

This past couple of months 6 of my close relatives(including both of my grandparents) have died and it has affected my entire family especially my mom because she has had to do most of the paperwork and meetings and had to take care of my relative's personal affairs and hasn't had time to breathe. Anyways I haven't been doing good in online school and I'm failing everything and my mom has gotten to the point where she just locks herself in her room or just busts into tears or screaming. I don't know what to do and I'm trying to bring my grades up but I just feel like a piece of shit for doing all of this especially because she has a past of being hospitalized for stress-related things and blows up when she feels overwhelmed.

690,"My roommate and I just moved into a new apartment and everything is great. On the first day we moved in, my roommate saw a bug in his room that was small and on the ceiling, he immediately was very paranoid and afraid that the apartment had bed bugs. So we called the office and they sent out pest control, they determined there were no bed bugs and also treated the apartment just in case. 

He has never had bed bugs before, and neither have I, but I used to be very paranoid about fleas as my dogs growing up always had them. Neither of us gets any bites while sleeping or in the apartment, and the only times he has seen a ""bed bug"" it has conveniently disappeared once I rush into the room, or ask for a picture. His girlfriend who stays over a lot has had bed bugs before and she is adamant that we do not have bed bugs and has never seen a bug in his room. A couple of nights ago I went outside and got a mosquito bite on my arm, and now he is very worried there are bed bugs everywhere.

But I haven't seen any bugs in any part of the house, not even roaches and this is the south. I have two cats and if we had bed bugs they would be itching themselves all the time, and I would be able to comb their fur and see bites or bugs but there are none. How can I help my roommate not be so paranoid about bed bugs? 

We just moved from a terrible house where he stayed for a few months, and I lived for a few months. It was dirty and had roaches and none of the other roommates ever cleaned. So I am assuming he is waiting for his living situation to become toxic since that is what he has been used to the past 4 years of not having a stable place to live.",05Oct2020,1

My kids birthday is coming up. I’m hopeless and don’t know what to do. Temp agencies won’t answer the phone (using text now app). I can’t work with my wife because I worked there once before when I was 16 and they won’t let me back along with the other jobs I’ve had.

696,"Alright so first and foremost, my girlfriends drinking is NOT a problem. My lady suffers from pretty severe PTSD, anxiety and Bipolar Depression. We have been together for going on 8 years. We have 2 beautiful children and she is a fantastic mother. With that said, my girlfriend drinks just about every day. Small amounts. Like one or two drinks a day, max. It helps her relax AND it helps her anxiety/panic attacks. With that said, after she has a drink into her, she loves me better because shes not super anxious and insecure AND she is more interactive with life in general. Not just sulking around. She HAS tried other methods. The pills they had her one (she has tried like 11) make her suicidal. Therapists made her feel worse. Needless to say, she is never intoxicated. Hardly ever buzzed. 

As you can see from above, I dont think she has a problem. Far from it actually. Our families think the complete opposite however. I dont drink personally so my family thinks that she isnt the one for me or that she is a bad mom because she drinks. Her mom also thinks the same. Constantly bitching about it. Mind you NEITHER of our families live anywhere near us or visit so they dont see how she is on a daily basis and they dont see that this actually helps her. 

So, I'm getting ready to propose. I'm super excited. I'm mad fucking nervous. I have the whole thing planned out. Well, I broke the news to everyone because I wanted them there. Shit hit the fucking fan and I started getting all these texts about how I'm going to ruin my life by marrying her. I'm so tired of defending her against our families. I'm so tired of our families trying to make out like she is a shit mom when they arent even around to witness how great of a mother she truly is. 

What can I even do here? Most of her problem is growing up with her mother and her mom has such a hold on her mentally that she would never be okay with cutting her out despite being treated like garbage.",05Oct2020,1
697,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this kind of question, but for the past few months I've had violent, disgusting, hateful impulsive thoughts that come out of nowhere and I'd like some advice on how to control them. I'm not diagnosed with anything and can't afford therapy.

some examples of my impulsive thoughts are incest, racism, urges to burn/cut myself (I quickly distract myself), convincing myself I'm a p\*dophile, to repetitive things such as ""scratch your ring finger 9 times or your family will die"" etc. these thoughts make me feel disgusted with myself and I don't know where they came from or how I can get them to go away.

I'm sorry if the title makes it seem less important, the idea just came and I couldn't ignore it but this ones in regard to my dreams. Since before I was 12, I've wanted to be a singer. Actually, perhaps even before that, for as long as in can remember I've wanted to be sort of the next taylor swift. Don't get me wrong, I'm not obsessed with being famous, but it's more about creating art and different styles of it and just depicting life through art which I'm  passionate about. Music and art is one of the only things I'm extremely passionate about. However, my family is a bit conservative and I'm afraid if I ever told them they'd downright disown me. Since I'm a child of immigrants, and my direct family is kind of all I have, I don't want to lose them. I knew this so I suppressed my feelings all this time and told myself it's a phase but now I'm 18 and in my second year of engineering and this dream is the only thing I can constantly think about. That's what I wanna do, pursue music but I'm so scared about how my family will react ( I really don't think they will understand) and if I'm even good enough. I haven't ever been able to perform in front of people. If I can I'd give everything up for this, but I wonder if I have the courage and If I ever gain any, do you think it'll be a good idea? I can't let this dream go because I feel like it's what's gonna keep me happy and otherwise it's like a fire in my heart I just can't put out, and if I want to act right now is the perfect time compared to when I'm 30 stuck in a job I hate.

704,"I work in a restaurant as a manager.  We've been unusually busy lately.  There also aren't as many people available to work.  We don't have many adults that can work mornings, and the teenagers that work nights all are in school so they don't want to work more than 2 days a week.  Making a weekly schedule is a nightmare.  All the managers and myself have been putting in extra work because we have to all work 2 or 3 positions every shift.  I don't mind long hours when I have every position covered, because then I can just focus on managing.  When I have to take orders, then run back to the kitchen, then run back out to expo them, and then take them out to customers, I just run myself ragged.  

I've been feeling run down lately.  I worked over 40 hours in 3 days last week, and this is my first real day off for a week.  I feel like I have a sore throat and am achy, so I might have a cold coming on.  Maybe I'm just imagining it though.  I'm not sure.

I was thinking of asking my boss to let me work less hours.  The past few weeks I've been pushing over 50 hours.  I'm pretty comfortable at 45, assuming we are fully staffed.  I am on salary, so I don't get anything extra for those extra hours.  Also, I am more concerned of the types of hours I am working.

It was really confusing as a child to know who to believe and most the time my siblings and i were fighting for each parents attention and us kids would just cause a lot of drama and fighting between the parents. this contributed on until i was fifteen where it reached its peak and i finally cut off my mom. 

Something that is kinda important is i was abused as a kid by mom moms boyfriend at the time. And I never told anyone because i was scared and i’m right before i cut off my mom my parents read my diary and found out. They told me they think my mom new about it and i was really terrified for my mom to find out i was abused by her ex so yeah I stopped talking to her. 

For the past three years i’ve been very adamant that i would never speak to my mom again and it caused a lot of fights between me and my stepmom because she never trusted me and always thought i was just going to go back to my mom much like my older sister did. I get it, when we were kids we told each parent things about the other and like i said we caused a lot of drama. Which i regret. And i have made it clear to my mom that i don’t want any drama and i won’t be talking about the either parent to the other

Any way, I just started to start rebuilding my relationship with my mom as i have forgiven her and my dad for the manipulation i faced as a child and i don’t think she new about my abuse like my other parents think. I’m really happy to speak with her and meet my nephews that I never got to met but i’m terrified to tell my dad and stepmom as i still live in there house while i got to college. 

I just want to know if anyone has faced a similar situation or just has any idea how i should tell my parents. Sorry this was so long.",05Oct2020,1

723,"This is a long one, so thanks for those willing to read. 

I’m a 24 year old male.

A little (lot of) backstory, of course. I met my ex-fiancée, “Allie,” we’ll call her, in eighth grade. We had homeroom together, since our last names are both towards the end of the alphabet. We kind of “were a couple,” but never kissed or even held hands. We “broke up” towards the end of the year, but again, looking back I don’t really count this as having actually dated. 

We went to different high schools (I stayed in private school, and her parents transferred her to the local high school one town over where she lived). In 10th grade, we reconnected via text through a mutual friend (my best friend was dating a girl who knew her from childhood, and she recognized me from Allie mentioning me in the past). We texted a bit for a month or so, nothing serious. She said that she’d never stopped liking me after middle school, etc. I didn’t have my driver’s license yet, and her parents didn’t want her dating, so I basically ghosted her since I didn’t think it could ever work, and I didn’t have the heart to “break up” with her again.  

As the years went by, I would always text her “Happy Birthday” on her birthday, and she’d text back asking how I was, what I was up to, etc., but I’d never respond. She became really successful at school, doing college courses in high school, and ended up graduating with two degrees in less than four years. Junior year of college, I actually responded when she asked me how I was doing after my annual birthday text. We texted non-stop for about a month or so, but at around Christmas time of that year (her birthday is mid-November) she stopped responding. She’d text me every couple of months, apologize for being too busy to talk, etc., but we didn’t really connect again until just before that next Christmas, in our senior year of college. We were friends on Facebook since the summer after 8th grade, so we were relatively up to date on each other’s lives. Of course, I also watched her go from 8th grade girl with acne and braces to a stunningly gorgeous college student. For this time (the year after we re-connected via text in our junior year of college), and the year before/after, I would talk about her with my friends if I’d been drinking, and refer to her as the “one that got away.” 

Fast forward to senior year of college. She was at a university about two hours north of where we grew up, and I lived at home and went to college one town over. She started texting me in the beginning of December, and we’d text non-stop, back and forth for hours, every day. This went on through the holiday, and we talked on the phone while she drove back to school at the end of Christmas break. This was the first time we’d heard each other’s voices since the last day of 8th grade, almost ten years earlier. After this, we started talked every night, usually for 4-6 hours at least. We’d chat, watch synced up TV episodes on speakerphone, etc. I found out that right before she’d started texting me again, she’d been broken up with by her boyfriend of over a year. He’d left in the middle of the night and cut off all contact with her. Of course, I worried about the whole rebound thing, or that she just wanted a “friend” in her time of need, but I was too head over heels at this point to care, or at least to not risk it.

In late January, after much prodding from her, I finally agreed to drive up to her school and spend a Friday afternoon/Saturday with her. This trip, and subsequent trips, became a romantic relationship about a month later. She had a hard time at first, still getting over her ex, but we eventually began dating officially in late February. She had had several serious boyfriends in late high school/college. Her first time was with her boyfriend senior year of high school. She then dated a guy she met on the first day of class in college, and then after him she dated the guy who left in the middle of the night. I mention this because I hadn’t really dated at all. I’d had one sort-of girlfriend in my early college days, but we only go to third base. I’d only even made out with one other girl before Allie. So, needless to say at this point, she was my first everything. Lover, “love,” etc. So, she had me really out-gunned as far as relationship experience. 

By March, she’s already told me that she wants to marry me and be with me forever. We kept coming back to each other, I was always in the back of her mind, etc., and we were meant to be. Now, normally this would throw up huge red flags for anyone. Not me. I was so infatuated with this girl, I barely flinched. I never would’ve said that stuff myself, but I never once said “too fast” or anything to make her think I thought otherwise. I also agreed to move across the country with her for her graduate program. This will be a HUGE deal later on. Basically, she’d always wanted to go to this school across the country, and told me right when we started dating that we shouldn’t be together unless I was willing to move there with her a year and a half later (fall semester of the year after she graduated, and took two semesters off) As I would later put it in arguments: “If you’d been into one-armed guys, I would’ve cut my arm off.” So, being hopelessly in love, I told her I’d move there the next fall. 

The first six months go by, with the biggest obstacle being our families. My parents were fine, other than thinking (correctly) that we were moving too fast. Her parents were something else. They didn’t even meet me until June (we started dating in February), because they remembered me as the boy who broke up with her/ghosted her twice, and they had really loved “Daniel,” the guy before me who left, and thought that Allie had moved on too quickly from him. (They had also been discussing marriage and all that). 

So, come August/September, she’s really pushing me to propose. Again, the blame is partially on me because I never discouraged this sort of talk, and she took my lack of objection as reciprocation. A big reason behind the early engagement was so that we would be engaged/settled by the time we needed to move across the country together. Now, I loved this girl, a lot. I could definitely see myself marrying her, but just not that soon. Also, I was a big proponent of the proposal being a big surprise, like in tradition/the movies, and she wanted it staged (photographer to capture the moment, her wearing the right dress, etc.) She eventually wore me down, and I bought the ring in early November, barely nine months after we’d officially started dating. I took her dad out to a nice lunch, and got his blessing. In hindsight, he spent more of the lunch asking how okay I was with this, and how sure I was, as opposed to the usual “you better take care of my daughter” stuff, with him of course knowing how she could be. 

I planned everything out – a road trip to somewhere she loved, stopping along the way at one of her favorite childhood places, where I would pop the question. Trip was booked, plane tickets and car rental were paid for, everything.

Then it fell apart. My dad offered me a job at his company. Six figure salary even though I had no experience whatsoever in the field other than a six month internship when I was a freshman in college. Allie and I could both tell he was doing it to keep me from proposing/move away. That being said, I still couldn’t resist. My dream had always been to work as an executive as my family’s company, and one day run it. Here was my chance. All I had to do was tell the girl I loved that I couldn’t move away with her (which meant 3+ years apart) and therefore likely end up broken up, and definitely not engaged. She’d applied and had already been accepted/committed to the far-away school, so she was now going regardless. 

After thinking about it for a couple of days, I took the job. She hated me, her parents hated me, and I kind of hated me. We didn’t break up, but we didn’t get engaged (her parents also made it clear I no longer had their blessing). My dad ended up not being able to hire me at his company. Long story short, he realized it just wasn’t right to give me the same job as guys with relevant degrees and years of experience. He was right of course, but it still sucked. 

Allie and I patched things up, and her parents got over it in time as well. Things went on normally for a while, but our relationship didn’t really get better. She was controlling, and wanted to spend every moment together. I was more go-with-the-flow and liked dividing my time up more between friends and family, as well as her.

August of that year comes around. It’s been 9 months since the whole not-moving thing, and the time came for her to move away. We’d already set rules for long distance. I would fly out once a month, maybe twice if I could afford it/get the time off of work. She left, and I enjoyed it for maybe a week. After having someone over my shoulder all of the time, I could stay up, eat pizza, play video games, and get drunk every day for the first time in almost two years. After about a week, I really started to miss her. By the time I flew up to see her for the first time, I was dying to be with her, and couldn’t concentrate on anything because I missed her so much. I decided that I would propose, for real this time.

In November, while she was home for Thanksgiving, I proposed, and she said yes. Everyone was happy except my parents, who thought Allie was delightful, just not the right fit for me (the controlling stuff). I told them they needed to get on board, and to their credit, they did, and everything was fine. For a while. We continued long-distance for the next 4 months, but I agreed to make plans to move across to the country to be with her.

We ended up living together for this first time due to COVID. Her campus closed, so she came home. Up until this point, her parents had refused to allow her to even spend the night with me, other than half a dozen crazy circumstances nights, because they didn’t approve of non-married couples living together/spending the night together. Her (now 24, but already 22 when we started dating) allowing her parents to control her like that was a longtime bone of contention between us. Anyway, since I worked at an “essential” business, and would be exposed to COVID, her parents allowed her to finally move into my apartment, so she wouldn’t expose them after seeing me. Soon after she moved in, we leased an apartment in the city where her school was, with a move-in date of September 1st, 2020. Over the next couple of months, our relationship went downhill. After months of relative freedom 3 weeks out of the month, she was now around 24/7 to be upset about how I would rather spend time with my friends playing golf than with my fiancée. Side note, she didn’t have any close relationships other than her parents and me, so if was busy, she’d basically do nothing except school work and watch TV. What I saw as controlling-ness, she saw as me not wanting to spend time with her. I still agree that she wasn’t necessarily wrong, but I just wasn’t a good fit for her. For example, her parents were both that way (only ever spent time with each other, and neither had any real friends). 

This downhill motion continued until about a week before we were due to move away. I had a job lined up to start in early July, and we would stay in her apartment until our joint-apartment was ready on 9/1. A week before we moved, we had a three hour fight, and I ended up driving her to a park, where we talked for several more hours about the state of our relationship. I told her that I didn’t like where we were, but that we were basically stuck together for the time being. We’d signed a lease, paid thousands of dollars in fees/deposits, I had a job lined up, and I’d already given notice/been replaced at my current job here at home. Not to mention we were two and half years into a relationship, and were engaged. However, I said, I would only do this for one more year. About a year from now (the time of the argument) we would be asked to renew our lease on the apartment, and if we hadn’t improved, I was going to leave and return home. I can’t stress enough that I still loved her at this point, and I wasn’t rooting for us to fail. 

We move to the city. We’ll call it “New York.” Before moving, I sold my car, sub-leased my apartment, and sold all of my furniture, intending on being in NY for 3 years, minimum. 

I ended up spending just over 2 months in NY before calling it quits. We had numerous relationship issues, almost all due to lack of communication. Also, I absolutely hated my job, and living there. Looking back, I think I reflected by dislike of my job/living situation onto my fiancée, but our relationship certainly had issues we carried on from back home. Some things were a result of us seriously living together 24/7 with no friends or family around to break up with time. NY was still in mostly-lockdown due to the pandemic, so even other activities outdoors were limited.

Now comes the part that I really feel like a piece of shit about. 

For years, at my job back home, I worked with this girl who we’ll call “Rachel.” Rachel started a year after me and my best friend got jobs at this large company. By the time she started, I was an department supervisor, but my friend was still at the entry-level spot, so they spent a lot more time together than I did with her. We both thought she was really cool, and super cute, though I didn’t tell him I also felt this way. Long story short, he asked her out, and they dated for about a year and a half, breaking up right before Allie and I got together. 

Now, while they were together, I kept to the bro-code and threw all of those thoughts about her being beautiful and awesome out the window. I didn’t even accept her friend request on Facebook. Over time, my best friend eventually left the company to get a job in his college field, and Rachel worked her way up the ladder at the company, same as I did. By the time Allie and I were engaged, I was an area manager, running 4 different departments, and Rachel was one of my department managers, reporting to me along with her 3 co-workers/fellow managers. This meant that she and I worked side-by-side all of the time, including late nights with just the two of us. In the six months or so before I left for NY, I really started to have conflicted feelings about Rachel. I loved my fiancée, but Rachel just seemed to be everything she was, and more. Basically all of the good stuff (looks, funny, same interests, etc) but without the controlling-ness or other problems. As my best friend’s long-time girlfriend, she’d also seen me wasted and basically had seen my at my worst, and still thought it was fun to be around me. I chalked it up as a work-place crush, or a “grass is always greener” type thing. I was also afraid that if I ever did pursue it, I’d lose my best friend (who by this point I’d asked to be the best man at my future wedding to Allie). He’d taken it really hard when Rachel and him had broken up (she left him, he tried to get her back numerous times, and made a fool out of himself in front of a lot of people at one of the attempts). Nothing ever happened between us during this time, not even a hug or an alcohol-induced close call. I was really careful to hide how I felt, with a few slip-ups here and there after drinking, but for the most part, she never knew. She dated a couple of guys after my friend, which bothered me more than I like to admit, especially when one of them was a guy from work (another branch of the company), who I was sort of friends with.

On my last day at the office, after my goodbye cake and all of that, Rachel helped me carry some stuff out to my car. I came within a breath of telling her how I felt, but fear that she wouldn’t feel the same way and shame about the fact that I was already engaged made me just wish her the best and drive away. It was 4 years almost to the day when I left from the day she started at the company. 

So, back to the day I broke up with my fiancée, two months after moving to “NY.” My parents were visiting, and we were basically bar hopping, just catching up. Allie, feeling ill, and sick of my ignoring her for hours while I goofed around with my dad, went home, leaving me alone with my parents. I proceeded to get pretty wasted, and decided it was a good time to text Rachel, who had asked me a work-related question several hours earlier. I had alluded to having feelings for her in the past while drunk at work parties and stuff. Never anything embarrassing, but starting to say stuff and then catching myself, and other suspicious stuff. 

So I basically told her I regretted never having the courage to ask her out or tell her how I felt, and that her current boyfriend (the guy who I knew from work) was a great guy, and I didn’t want to mess that up, and sorry for putting her in this position, blah blah blah. She was shocked of course, and could tell I was wasted, and told me we’d talk about it in the morning if I didn’t regret it. 

I went home shortly after, and had the worst fight yet with my fiancée, over how I abandoned her, didn’t come home to check on her, drank when she wasn’t there, etc. I was throwing up in the toilet at this point, as she stood over me and yelled at the top of her lungs. After collecting myself a bit, I told her it was over, and I left. I spent the night on my parents’ couch (they rented a condo for the weekend). 

The next morning, I told my parents we were broken up, and that I was going home. My parents asked me a hundred times if I was sure, because if I had better be if I was going to do this. I said I was. Rachel texted me, saying that a phone call was definitely in order. I agreed, and went to my office to put in my two week notice, and tell my boss I was going back to my home state. I told Allie that I would be by later that day to get my stuff (just suitcases of clothes). I remember feeling relieved at this point. Allie and I had almost broken up many times, and I was glad that it was finally over. I sat on a park bench for several hours waiting for Rachel to be on lunch so we could talk, just thinking about how much my immediate life/future had changed in the last 12 hours.

Rachel called me, and I spent an hour relating everything. She said it was a lot to think about and that she’d let me know once she’d had time to take it all in.

I went to Allie’s apartment and got my stuff. She was devasted and crying, and apologized for how she’d reacted. I just sort of ignored her, got my stuff, gave her a hug, and left. This was the last time I ever saw her in person, all the way up until I’m typing this.

My parents flew home, but rented out their condo so I would have somewhere neutral to stay while I did my last two weeks at the office. Rachel texted me two days later. It was really long, but basically said that she had no idea I’d felt this way, and that she was going to break things off with her current boyfriend (not because of me, but because they’d been having serious issues for a while). She said she’d like to go on a date with me when I got home. 

Rachel and I talked a lot over the next two weeks, learning about each other and asking questions. We went out to dinner the night after I flew home, and agreed to take things slow. Be friends first, then see what happens, etc.

In the meantime, Allie and I have exchanged tens of thousands (literally) of words via e-mail and text over the two months following the breakup. We didn’t communicate at all for the first month or so, other than what was necessary to cancel the lease we’d both signed. Basically, we talked about what went wrong, what issues we had with each other, with each other’s friends and families, etc. We talked about a lot of stuff we’d both kept bundled up inside when we were together. It’s made enough of an impact that I do really believe that things would be different if we ever gave it another shot down the road. 

Allie still loves me, and cries every day, and can hardly go grocery shopping or listen to the radio without breaking down because of how much she misses me. She says she knows we’re meant to be, and that we’ve always found a way back to each other. She’s also said she knows we need time apart, though she doesn’t know how long. She wants to see how her graduate program will work out post-covid (it’s still all online), and she wants to see how I’ll do working for my dads company (I got a junior executive job here after coming home from NY). But, in the end, she thinks we’ll be together, and be better than before with all of the new communication we’ve had.   

And then there’s Rachel. In the two months since we’ve started talking “in that way” and the month and a half that I’ve been home, we’ve gone from friends to something else. We see each other almost every day (maybe not seeing each other 4 or 5 days total in the last 6 weeks without at least a quick lunch or something). We haven’t slept together, but we go make out, and cuddle in bed watching TV/reading, and stuff. Rachel has said she’ll know I’m ready for an actual relationship with her when I take the step of telling my friend about us. I know that, if I told my friend, she’d gladly become my “girlfriend” officially. 

But I don’t know what to do. When I’m with Rachel, I feel happy and like we could have a future together. But at night, and while I’m at work, and sitting in traffic, I miss Allie. We (Allie and I) still text here and there, and she keeps me up to date on how she’s doing, almost as if we were still together. I know it’s probably cruel of me to give her false hope, and I have, on multiple occasions, told her that we may not end up together, to try and curb that hope. I’m happy with Rachel, and she’s great, and I don’t want to hurt her. I think she knows on some level that I’m not fully invested yet, which is why we haven’t slept together. (On my end, I’m actually pretty scared of sleeping with anyone except Allie, who it’s the only person I’ve ever been with).

724,"Hello, so I’m a 20 year old male in my junior year of college studying psychology with a minor in philosophy but before that I was in my apprenticeship for carpentry while I was attending high school through opportunities at a vocational school I went to. I’m 100% up for the idea of buying and remodeling homes as they need it and renting it out to people for a passive income. However being only 20 I don’t have the money to buy a house on top of remodeling what needs done. So I was wondering if there was any sort of program or place of discussion to have per se an investor buy the house and supply the funding for the material in exchange for a percent of the houses monthly income. I would be bringing my qualified knowledge and labor in remodeling the table. Any guidance in the right direction is greatly appreciated!

725,"Warning: I am lazy af and this might read as ridiculous to many of you. I'm kinda a baby.

Before the pandemic I might go once, twice, maybe three times a week to school because attendance was mandatory for those classes - but there were ALWAYS classes that I skipped, sometimes even the mandatory ones, because I knew I could study better at home, and I honestly just hate going. It's so exhausting having to be around people so often. I can barely stand leaving my house for 3-4 hours once every now and then unless it's either me being alone or with my friends/family, and I'm a pretty introverted hermit.

729,"I am a freshman in college living in a dorm room with my roommate, I will call her Mary (fake name). Mary and I began talking a few months ago and got to know each other before agreeing to be roommates. However, due to obvious reasons, we only met online and there are several aspects of her that I was unaware of. Online, we got along great and could carry out conversations and everything seemed perfect. Living together, I am finding that she is very different and we struggle to find conversation as well as the general feeling of incompatibility between our habits and personalities. 

Now comes my troubles. When talking online through all those months, Mary constantly brought up that next year she wants to rent an apartment. I agreed, not seeing any issues with continuing to be roommates in later years, which I have come to regret. She has constructed this big plan of her boyfriend coming to move in with her and my boyfriend and I living in a second bedroom, that way rent is bearable. It also doesn't help that I am quite literally the only person she is friends with on campus and she doesn't socialize with anyone else but online friends and people in her home town. 

Mary is still bringing this plan up, making me feel that our incompatibilities are only felt on my side. She is also insistent on this plan because her dad will apparently no longer be providing her a place to stay after this year of college. I feel really guilty for not wanting to follow through with our original plan and leaving her to have to stress out over living situations, but I would rather take my chances with a stranger in a dorm room next year than rent an apartment with her. I don't think she is a bad person and don't want to hurt her feelings or make her feel like I dislike her. What is the best way to tell her? 

Tl;dr - my roommate and I made a plan to rent an apartment next year before actually moving in together.

For the second half and up to now majority part of my life my step dad has been very much a father figure- a much gushier father figure than my biological dad (as in he’s very supportive and has taken my side in fights with mom and also regularly reminds me of how proud of me he is despite there not being much to be proud of cuz I’m really mediocre imo). I have a good relationship with my bio dad too but it’s much more casual like I’ll see you when I see you so we don’t talk all the time or anything. 

So now I’m getting married and I want them both to be included but don’t know how to set that up organically and tactfully. I don’t want to offend my bio dad by splitting up duties altogether tho- like what if he wants both the walk down the aisle and the father daughter dance. I dunno what to do. I haven’t set any expectations to either at this point.",05Oct2020,1

733,"Hello, I like listening to Reddit stories but I'm asking for advice.

I'll try to be as objective as I can, here's some background; I'm young and have a lot of siblings, I'm pretty much in the middle but I'm the oldest that hasn't moved out, and under the e circumstances wont be ato move out for a while. The summer was relative to the situation, reasonably normal. I was doing online classes and the place we live was decently clean, we got comfortable with this and since we havent had people over very often, we haven't heard anyone elses opinion or feedback of the cleanness of out home.  We had someone come over that was like a health inspector to a restaurant, to us it was to the health of the kids. They told us we need to clean up the place or we will be taking a long trip. My mother acted like a Karen knowingly, she lied and when I called her out on it she smiled, she absolutely hated their guts. My mother would not clean, she has her own apartment and would come back and forth, staying for a few hours and doing absolutely nothing, maybe just vacuuming and doing dishes. The mess was much bigger than that. I knew that she wouldn't do anything so I had to go through the whole house and clean it. She had made up enough lies and exaggerated certain parts of what happened and got us a different person to come to our house. She did not learn her lesson.

Here's what recently happened that I'm requesting advice on; Where I live, the schools are giving out food for any family that comes by, as you might know, school food isn't very good, its cheap and gets you by. My mom took full advantage of this, she figured out a way to get the most food per week, I'm speaking enough food to last multiple people a month in a week, and she'd been doing it for a few months. She treats it like gold. I was babysitting my youngest sister and a few other siblings and I was making a few sandwiches, It was going pretty good, but I need the tomatoes and lettuce, I find the tomato, and I know as a fact we have lettuce. I couldn't find it in the mess of a fridge, it was filled with cut peaches in a liquid, absolutely disgusting turkey, chicken, tuna, and other various sandwiches. you get the point it was absolutely impossible to reach the back of the fridge. I wanted to clean out the fridge, so I did a few days later. I wish I took a before and after photo but it was glorious, I couldn't resist cleaning up the pantry as well, I was actually able to see what was in there, no more apple sauces, no more cut peaches in liquid. I knew my mom would be very angry, but she kept such disgusting things in that fridge and pantry, its as if she found out we didn't want to go to church again. She always threatens to tell our counselor, or to get my father for child support or to turn off the wifi, I've outsmarted her with the wifi, she hasn't called the counselor and her saying she'll get my father for child support is like a myth. She only lets a few siblings stay, she things my father has no say in who gets to stay. He has always done his best with us, even if he hates her.

Pretty much my mother might have some problem with hoarding, verbal abusing, stubbornness, close-mindedness, and just being a person I don't want to be around because I don't feel the safest with her screaming, threats and all that. How would yall recommend trying getting her to change, I've tried being diplomatic, she rarely makes compromises and if you want something done the way you want it you need to brute force it, and even then it won't last long. Is it my attitude towards this? I think it's unhealthy to live like this, whos behavior needs to change? I just want to be able to look in the fridge and see everything I need to make a sandwich without having to clean out the fridge of raw dough and nasty liquids.

Thanks for reading, I'm not sure if this is the best place, but I'm pretty sure it's in compliance with the rules. I did vent a bit in this post so any advice or question would be much appreciated, no matter what views you have.

While I was typing this out my mom went to get more lunches, I've checked out the kitchen, she was at least organizing all the stuff but in my opinion thinking irrational. She recommends I do dishes and laundry, not to clean up her messes that interfere with our motivation among other things. She gives us no motivation, I do well in school and she doesn't do anything.",05Oct2020,1

736,"There is a girl in my year and form who sits next to me in every class I have, we were assigned those seats because of Covid-19. Recently I have noticed a change in her behaviour when she is around me, and I don't know whether I am reading too much into it or not.

When I'm with her, she copies my handwriting (not what I write, but how I write it, then she writes differently when she's not near me), she laughs at everything I say (even when I haven't made a joke), she also talks about very personal things in front of me. Like today for instance, she told me about how she is late getting out of school quite a lot and was on Friday because she was on her period and was in the bathroom for a while. She compliments me often and stares at me when I'm looking away and she can't think I see.

739,"A little backstory:

At the beginning of the pandemic, I broke my hand in a work accident and right after lost my job due to COVID. I ended up moving in with my boyfriend's family in the suburbs as I have no family that I could reach out to; I cut ties with my family after an abusive childhood where my mother sided with my abuser, her husband. Shortly before the pandemic, my partner moved out of his apartment and back home as he travelled for work most of the week. This year has been a rollercoaster for me as it has been for many people. It was one of the worst feelings in the world to lose my independence and ability to take support of myself. In addition, moving in with my partner's family was a huge deal as they are Indian immigrants and I am white. Having their son's partner move in definitely is not a common thing in their community and they took a huge risk by opening up their home and hearts to me. I am so incredibly grateful for what they have done for me and think about how different my life would have been post-shutdown if they had not been here for me. It has given me the time to pursue a career change and build a great relationship with my partner's family. However, there is definitely a family dynamic that has been extremely difficult for me to process.

A little about the family:

My partner (M30) is the eldest with two younger twin sisters (26) and I am 27. They are all very family-centered as is common in their culture and have lived together their entire lives with the exception of my partner who has worked been independent since college and lived on his own up until the pandemic. He moved back home shortly before I lost my job and his work put a stop on travel. His sisters however, have never been expected to work or contribute to household chores. My partner in addition to his parents  has supported them in many ways by buying them necessities, providing non-necessities, paying for their phone and bills, and driving them places. I am simply not used to this mentality having worked since I was 15, supported myself entirely in my adulthood, and even put myself through college. My partner is extremely generous and has never asked for anything in return. Although it isn't really a financial setback for him, I firmly believe it teaches them nothing about responsibility and even enables their mentality of depending on others to do things for them. I will also add that they don't really ask for things either and are pretty low maintenance in regards to lifestyle. However, this family dynamic has firmly been established and I am worried how this will translate into our lives as we hope to have kids of our own one day. 

The meat:

My boyfriend and I are looking to move back to the city upon me getting a job, which alone has been a huge stressor and source of anxiety for me. Last week, my boyfriend's mother informed us that when her daughter returns to school she would like her to live with us while she attends classes Monday through Friday. Long story short, she deals with extreme panic attacks and often becomes immobilized, unable to walk. I feel extremely anxious even thinking about the living situation. I also feel like we are unable to say no because of the huge favor that his parents have done by allowing me to move in with them. Not only do I feel like we will be raising an adult who is our age, but we will also be put into a position where if she experiences a panic attack we will have to be the ones to have to deal with the situation. I do not feel equipped to deal with these episodes and as much as I can be a role model to her, I am not a therapist. In the past, she has had panic attacks while out on walks where she had to carried into the car and cared after for hours. In addition to my concerns regarding her panic attacks, I am stressed out about the idea that we will expected to provide for her during her stays included paying for her Ubers to and from classes. Even more so, I feel like this will set a precedent that we will be her fall back in life and support her as an adult. She is a capable person, however I have witnessed her lack of drive in life. 

In regards to finances, my partner's mom has not expected us to pay rent however, we are planning to buy all new appliances and gift the equivalent of what rent would have cost in household gifts after their planned remodel. My boyfriend has a great deal of pressure put on him by his parents to be a miracle worker in his sister's life and to be the family problem solver. He recently co-signed on his parents mortgage which he will also be helping to pay for. Don't get me wrong, his parents have been nothing but great to me, but I am starting to see the disproportionate expectations that they place on him versus his twin sisters. His mother has made comments before like, ""Well at least they have you two to fall back on."" or ""Now you are their big sister and family is expected to be there for family when in need"". I feel an immense pressure and I haven't even gotten on my feet yet! I have been in the midst of a career change and applying for jobs. And now, our apartment search will have to accommodate his sister who will not be contributing financially or to household chores. 

I feel like a terrible person if I say ""No"" but I cannot imagine being a pseudo parent to somebody who is my age! I don't feel like saying ""no"" is an option and I would be fine if she visited a couple of times a week in between classes or needed to stay with us occasionally. However, I am in no way ready to have a third person living with us who I will be responsible for in ways that I am not ready to be.",05Oct2020,1
740,So I take care of these stray kittens and they sleep on my porch on a bed I gave them. I have trained them to allow me to pet them and I like them very much.

After 1 year drifting apart me and X bonded again and as would happen so did me and Z, i feel more close to Z. 

She talks all day about X ( they broke up just recently), and wants to get back together badly, I have seen this girl on a daily basis and she is truly and deeply in love with X, but the thing is I know for a fact X has been texting Y throughout the 3 years I have know him, once while we were drunk he told me that he's gonna spend night with Y.

742,"I don't know if I should also post this in a legal advice group as well, but here's my situation:

I'm in CA, USA.
I received an email, about a week or so ago, from someone claiming to be a lawyer in the UK. Very brief email telling me his name and that he was a lawyer who represents a family member of mine, (shares the same last name) but who passed away a few years ago. Man had no wife or kids, so the lawyer has been looking for a relative, and found me. 
I emailed him back, just saying that the name kinda sounds familiar. (I also have a huge family all over the place, and honestly have not met all of them..)

Anyways, I get another email back a week later from the lawyer, and he gives me more details. The details he gave me were, the name of the place the lawyer works at, and that my family member moved to the UK young, and became an oil investor. The guy has a ton of money that has been left unclaimed for years because the lawyer hasn't been able to locate any family, and according to him, time is running out before the bank has legal rights to the money and keeps it. He said he found me, and could give me the paperwork to fill out, and also the bank's information, so I can contact them directly. He said there is a 30% fee to him, but only after everything has been processed and the bank releases it all to me, then I pay him 30%. He assured me I won't have to pay for anything, until after I get it all.

Now, I've only told 2 people about this so far, and both seem to think it could be a scam to get money from me somehow. The thing is, I looked up his name, and the place he said he works at, and it seems to be a real place in Leicester, UK. A website and everything.

So like, I'm really torn, because it seems legit, but also, like, really random.

Any help with this would be fantastic, thank you !",05Oct2020,1

749,"So I'm 20 (almost 21) years old and about 21 credits away from my bachelors. I've worked full time and gone to college since I was 17. Started at my local community college, then I did about a year of college away from home at our state school, then moved online  right before the pandemic and went back to my hometown. 

I work in finance/accounting. Entry level, 40 hours a week, $35k a year. I live in my boyfriend's parents basement and pay next to nothing in rent so I can pay for school out of pocket. My boyfriend and I are high school sweet hearts, been together 4 years. I have a dog, he's a handful but I love him. Pretty easy life. 

But I feel like I'm missing out on a lot. I've never lived in a different state, didnt get the ""traditional"" college experience, have worked full time since before I was legally an adult. I'm responsible I think. I have a 401k, minimal loans, good credit, financially independent (minus the basement living situation).

751,"I (F18) met someone (M18) through an app last year. Let’s call him Matt. We talked for a while, and things got pretty intense within the first two weeks. Matt was very flirty, and I was really into it. He, at the time, had a girlfriend of almost two years. I was aware of this after one week of talking to him, right as things started to get somewhat sexual. Matt would send clothes teases and flirt a lot with me. I, in return, would flirt back and send some small teases too. (This all usually only happened after 10:00pm almost every night) One night, Matt sent me a nude. I saw it coming, and didn’t mind it because I enjoyed the flirting. He asked for one in return, to which I said no. I was uncomfortable with sending nudes because he lived in the same area, and we went to the same school.. I was scared he would possibly leak them if I sent any. I told a friend what he sent me, and she just so happened to be friends with his girlfriend. My friend told the GF (which she was right to do. I didn’t really want anything to happen between him and I because he was in a relationship, and what we were doing was wrong) GF confronted Matt, and he blocked me. They broke up a month later. I saw Matt almost every day for the rest of the year, as we walked past each other several times in the halls at school. 

In october, after splitting from GF, he got a new GF (we can call her Beth). Beth added me on snap, and made me miserable. Beth knew that him and I knew each other, but I’m sure he didn’t tell her the whole truth. She would always make sure I knew that she was with him by sending me ‘streaks’ and random pictures of him daily. My heart would start to race, and my chest wouldn’t tighten, making it hard for me to catch my breath. I knew what she was doing, and so did my friends. Beth was purposely showing off Matt to me to make me feel jealous. I never understood why, but I assumed she felt jealous of me, and a little threatened by my place with Matt. I later confronted her a few months later, when I could no longer take the anxiety from opening up her snaps, asking her to please stop sending me photos of Matt. I explained to Beth in the absolute NICEST way possible that what she was doing had a very negative impact on me. She said she was ‘sorry’ and that though she never admitted to be doing it (we both knew what she was doing, and she knew I knew), it was never to ‘hurt’ me. After the conversation ended, she then deleted me on snap, thank god!

Beth and Matt recently broke up after almost a year together. It’s been over a year since everything has happened, but I’m starting to feel ‘hung up’ on Matt. I can’t seem to get him out of my head, and I kind of want to reach out to him. Most of it feels purely physical, he is pretty attractive, but part of me wants a relationship with him. I’ve been feeling this way for over a year, and I don’t know what to do. I know he’s no good for me, but a small part of me wants to be with him. I haven’t been in touch with Matt since last year, and I haven’t seen him since Covid-19 shut everything down. We still live near each other, which makes me feel somewhat confident that he would be interested in starting something (which is bad since I know it isn’t a good idea to get with him considering everything that has happened between him and I) What do you guys think? Am I in the wrong? I know I shouldn’t be thinking about him, but I’ve tried almost everything to get him out of my head, and nothing seems to work. Any advice??",05Oct2020,1

753,"I am a co-head coach for a small school's cross country and track teams. I've been here for 5 years but over the last two my co coach has started skipping out on practices. Sometimes it's legitimate reasons like she's sick, but other times she says she's too busy or just doesn't show up. It's gotten worse and worse. At one point I had over 30 kids by myself for 2 weeks. This season she's barely come to any practices. When she does come she has no clue what we are doing, but tries to take over and the kids get really confused. (Honestly she doesnt even know all their names). This past weekend we had a local 5k that we are in charge of and I did all of the prep work for it, which was fine, but LITERALLY the day before the 5k she told me she was going to the beach this weekend and left me by myself to do the event. This has been on our schedule for the last year. At this point I am fine running things on my own, but it's just annoying that she doesn't do her job but still gets half of the money since we split the coaching salary. Also (not as big of a deal) but people still consider her as the single head coach because she was here before me. It just sucks watching her get credit for all the things I'm doing. She is supposed to be back from the beach tomorrow (although she still might not come to practice) and I get angry just thinking about our next interaction. She considers me her friend, and quite honestly I am a pushover so I don't want to throw her under the bus by talking to our athletic director and I hate confrontation so I also don't want to address it with her. I know if I do she will give me a sob story about how hard of a time she is having with work and life etc. That leaves me with the only option of suffering through it.

I have always had problems swallowing. When I was young my mum said that my swallowing sounds ""hard"", like you can hear it when I swallow.

I have always had a fear of swallowing wrong and dying of something blocking my airways. In periods I have problems eating, when I feel that something is in the back of my mouth to long while eating I panic. Usually I eat really slow and drink a lot of water. It has become a problem when eating out with friends and I don't really know what to do.

They did an x-ray 2 years ago where i had to swallow something but everything is okay anatomically.

I know its in my head but I don't know how to train myself to swallow right.

My coworker just started last month and we get along super well, she dresses pretty masculine and I’m 99% sure she’s gay.

His GF and him go to bed, at point which point I (Baked after smoking a J) was up waiting for my gopuff (was about to tear into too many kinder buenos). 

His girlfriend comes down, irritated at him, and worried, as shes sick of babysitting him. We chatted for a bit as I tried to calm her down, see what was happening. After a couple min, I check on my roommate to see if he was up: he was passed out, covered in vomit, face up and likely choking on it. I push him to the side and wake him, and he. Is. FUCKED.

The image of him, passed out, grey and covered in vomit doesnt leave my head, and I am still petrified as to how close he was to dying.

I honestly just hate myself and have been extremely depressed and i am having trouble understanding why. I mean i was medically diagnosed with depression and anxiety when i was 5, but how i feel now is the worst I’ve felt in years. I hate everything from how ugly i am to me being overweight (5’8” 225lbs) to me not being able to talk to people or socialize because im extremely introverted, shy, and I have trust issues, and everything in between. I haven’t even talked to a girl in 3 years, let alone date one, which definitely isn’t helping. Idk, i just hate everything about me. And especially when i make excuses for myself to eat something unhealthy and then i look back at it and absolutely despise myself for letting myself go. I used to be 250lbs over a year ago, lost 50lbs, then quarantine hit, gained back half of it, and now i have such a tough time getting motivation back or get back in a rhythm. Since I’ve been alone so long and I’ve gotten ghosted a couple times with no explanation, that probably made my depression and anxiety worse, but at this point, i feel like the low I’ve hit is gonna become permanent, all aspects considered. And I never want to talk to anyone because I’ll feel like im bothering them and then i shut everyone out and become cold because I don’t want to burden anyone, i including my parents, they don’t deserve to be put through the shit im going through.

766,"I'm a 24 M, and I am suffering.
My mind is too stressed to make a comprehensive description, but I will try my best. 
Key points about me. 

1.I am a dropout.
2. Started trading as a career.
3.Can't concentrate, focus, work, excersise or be productive.
4.i have clinical Adhd. But no medication. Even when on meds no help but a burning stomach and a dizzy head. 
5. I'm always on games or YouTube. Drowning myself in anything that is not grey 
6. I'm very depressed. 
7. My parents got me to start a ug degree. 
8. I can't study. 
9. I can't make money 
10. My parents are loosing patience and I am loosing hope. 
11. I tried so many things from block times, alarms, pavlokwatch, anything. It works for two days to a week. Stops. Back to square one. 
12. Flow states and binaural beats. 
13. For the Live of God, I can't seem to be stable enough to meditate nor have enough will power to excersise. 
14. My family is not rich. It is middle of middle class. But die to the market crash, we became lower of middle class. Loosing most of our savings. ( not a mistake made by me. If my suggestions were followed we would have made money, but father didn't trust me enough on that call) 


At this point I'm tired of life. Nothing seems to work. 

I really don't want to mention the fact that I had considered suiside many times.because that will drag the Conversation in another direction. Along with the fact that I don't have the balls to die as well. But for the sake of transperancy, I will. 
The last urge was three weeks  ago. When my parents gave up on me studying and asked me to leave. I just walked out. With nothing. No mask. No phone. Nothing. 

Eventually they brought me back home, but I was on my way to die. I just gave up. 


For the last 8 - 10 years of my life. I have been nothing but a failure. The only reason my last suiside urge was handled was because, if I died, my parents would blame themselves and my younger brother would have a bad example. 


I feel like it's OK to just let it go and die in silence and hope for a better one next time, if I get another chance. Cause that's the kind of life I lived . 

Ignoring the death, means I have to live. For something. Anything. Hell, I have no advantage living as well.

I can't make my body do what my mind intends. 

Wait. That's a lie. My mind won't focus on what my priories are and seeks instant gratification and escapism. It is just passing time. Waiting for death.
Honestly what is the difference between imagination and reality of you can never tell the difference. 
You can trick yourselve imaging to be what ever you want and experience life. And Death. A sweet release. 

It really won't make much of a difference. If you were forever in the matrix, the matrix is your reality. The others are really to you. From your perspective, that 
Is life. And that is death. 

While that is a good fantasy, Saner minds prevail. 

So I guess what I wanted to ask was.. Help. But I need an anchor. To somehow concentrate and work. Once this happens I will have more time to handle my emotions, depression and adhd. 

Ps: I didn't bother checking my Grammer. Please excuse  my crude ligustic skills. A dying man doesn't have to be speaking perfect English. I got bigger issues.


TLDR;  Desperate need to concentrate or focus on my work, shielding me from my distractions. Some way. Anyway to anchor me to live. So that I can have enough time to deal with all other aspects eventually and prosper.",05Oct2020,1

the owner of the company I work for has a clear conflict of interest with the head of HR.

I'm friends with the owner on FB and he's always posting photos of him and the head of HR together. The owner is married. my boss's FB profile pic is the HR's granddaughter WHOS 6 years old. It skeeves me out that my 50+ year old boss's FB profile pic is a 6-year-old girl who has no blood relation.

HR is also a nightmare. She's been on thin ice for months. always condescending to the people who work in the manufacturing part of the building (I'm in administrative). They've hired a new HR person to deal with more of the people side of things because in my bosses own words ""\[head of HR Woman\] is not a people person""

I think she is afraid that I am here to replace her but that is not my intent at all.... I don't want her to find out I spoke to you about this, please. Things may get worse for me if she does.""

771,"So this is a situation that I very much do not want to be in, yet you can never help feeling the things that you feel. I am 18, and I have really fallen for one of my male teachers. Right of the bat, I am fully conscious that this is a highly inappropriate situation, so I guess I am here to just let it all go and get some advice on how I can truly move on. Also I want to apologise in advance if anything sounds cringe ( i am not a fan of that talk either) however sometimes you just cannot make something not sound cringe. 

So as aforementioned, I am 18 and i am in my final year of collage and have fallen for my male teacher who is in his mid 20s and has a girlfriend. I have always been someone who has been attracted to people slightly older than me, whilst also being a person to not fall in love easy. Yet, this guy for some reason has ticked boxes that I didn’t even know I had. I have had a unbelievably strong attraction to him for over a year now, and it just so seems that whenever I try to do something in order to move on and remind myself of how unrealistic the situation is, it seems to work for about a week and then the feelings start flooding back.

You may be thinking, what is it that makes you like him so much? Well, I suppose it’s the fact that he seems to be so much like me, but in the best way possible. We are both very nerdy people and he always seems to say niche things that I will/would say, whilst also we share the EXACT same interests and humour. And I am very embarrassed to say this however I think I would go as far as saying I feel an ounce of love for him. As although he is not someone who looks wise strikes female attention I love his personality and I love all the little things that he does, whether it be his little quirks or the way he walks, and if there was a circumstance where I could have a shot with him I wouldn’t want to be with anyone else...so as you can imagine it’s an incredibly frustrating situation for me.

In terms of me I am someone (and I don’t mean this in a big headed way at all as I don’t in any way see this as a achievement) however I do get male attention a lot, and I am a tall slim woman who gets called pretty and gets told that I look as though I could pass for early 20s, so if this in anyway helps frame the situation for you more then great. However in terms of how we interact (as you may be interested) we get along on very friendly terms, he’s never been off with me. Near the end of last year (before corona) I had to see him at one point to hand in some work and we had a moment where we held eye contact quite a lot and he kept being overly nice to me, thanking me about 5 times and acting as if he didn’t want me to leave. I have felt some energy at times between us, and caught him looking at my chest. However all of this could just be nothing. But also this is why I mentioned the bit before about me as he may just find me visually appealing (god that sounds awful but I hope you so what I mean).

So to conclude on this absolute dilemma...I just feel so stagnant, frustrated and upset I guess.  And I just have no clue how to move on. As I mentioned before, I have tried everything!!! And i build up this strong sense of control telling myself all sorts of things, but then I see him again and the strong wall just breaks down. I really do love him in a way. However for my own sake I need to move on, as I don’t think anything could ever come of this. Or please  just tell me any thoughts you have on this. Like do I write him a note on my final day so that I can get some sort of closure? (I would make sure it’s down to earth and simple) Or will that make me look weird? 

To conclude I just want to stop feeling so emotionally drained from this situation, as this has been going on too long.

778,"(I have also posted this in r/caregivers, but worry it wont get enough traffic, so I've posted it here as well)

I am an in-home caregiver in the US (specifically NC), that works the graveyard shift, and I’m looking for speedy advice. Here’s the situation:

Nearly all the caregivers that work in the home have had some negative (and at times frightening experience) with a male neighbor who just moved in next door.

One has reported seeing him peeking through a glass door, and has heard loud footsteps on the ramp leading to the back door. Another has been yelled at by this same neighbor on her way to shift change, but wasn’t able to make out what he said. This same caregiver reported a worrying phone call. She picked up the house’s landline telephone, and heard heavy breathing on the line before the caller hung up. I myself have never seen anything happen, but did hear loud gunfire that seemed to be very close. The most frightening thing to happen so far was the discovery of a window screen that had been partially popped out of the frame, with black scuff marks abound the edge that suggest the use of some sort of pry-bar.

All of these incidents have been reported to the agency, and to the family of the client. Both are in favor of increased safety measures, such as blackout curtains, and security lights, but are resistant to the idea of installing a security system or making a formal complaint to police.

Frankly, we are all scared shitless. We deserve to feel safe in the workplace, and in my opinion, the relatively low pay we receive is not worth the potential danger. We’ve agreed amongst ourselves that something more needs to be done, but aren’t sure what to do. We worry that if we report the issue directly to police, we might face retaliation (we work for a small private agency that has no HR department, and from what I’ve heard, caregivers have been re-assigned, or even terminated, for less).

Some caregivers have considered leaving, as the situation has gotten progressively worse. I don't want to leave my client - I've been with her for four years, and love her like my own grandmother - but I become anxious before work, and as the night goes on, every bump and rattle nearly gives me a panic attack. We have planned to make one more strong appeal to the owner of our agency to intercede with the family, but if this is not successful in producing effective action, what should we do?

Thanks in advance for any advice, because we desperately need it.",05Oct2020,1

780,"I'm a 20 year old student and I live with two roommates in a large city in Brazil. Since March, we had been following pretty normal, vaguely agreed upon COVID precautions--working/studying from home, reducing trips to the grocery store, limited contact with those who don't live with us. Both of my roommates have romantic partners and have continued to invite them over to our apartment on the weekends throughout the pandemic. I've never objected to these visits considering the obvious importance of those relationships and the understanding that their partners had also been following social distancing protocol. 

Over this past month, public opinion/behavior has dramatically shifted away from social distancing here. Bars, restaurants, schools, malls, salons, churches, etc. have been reopening and people are seeing each other a lot more. My roommates have felt more comfortable to go out and see friends at bars and street parties with large crowds, invite friends over to our apartment, go get haircuts at the barber shop, take more frequent trips to the grocery stores and mall. One of my roommates has taken a job at a bank where he will be spent all day indoors with lots of social interaction.  

I understand the need to work and have an income, even if there is some assumed risk, but I don't agree with my roommates' justifications for their suddenly relaxed attitude towards social distancing. Considering the still high number of COVID cases in this city, the larger trend towards unnecessary physical contact, and the growing social circles of my roommates and their partners, I feel my health is being unfairly put at greater risk each day. 

I've had open conversations about my concerns with both of my roommates and they're not open to changing their behavior. I no longer feel safe in this living situation and I'm considering finding a studio apartment where I can live alone.

I tried to explain to him that I'm not attracted to her and she's kind of annoying, so no, I don't want to have sex with her. Even if I were into her, I'm not that kind of person. I never have been.

But he was saying I was just nervous and I should just go for it, yada yada yada. I didn't want to. I wanted nothing to do with her.

Long story short, she came over to spend the night, and oh no, she's got nowhere to sleep. Would I mind if she slept in my room? Because of trauma from my parents and the way they raised me, I can't say no to people. Ever. I just can't. I don't know how.

I did *not* want this girl in my room, but I felt like I had to say yes. Next thing you know, the pump for the air mattress is missing, so she'll have to sleep in the floor, right? Wrong. She asked to sleep with me, and again I can't say no.

At this point I'm fully aware where this is going and what's about to happen, but I can't say no. I just can't. I was (and am) completely and utterly repulsed by this girl but I felt like I had to. I felt like I was obligated to.

So we wound up fucking.

This process repeated 5+ times a week (almost every night) for weeks. There were times she would even come over just for sex. I never wanted it. I always did my best to ignore her. If I knew she was coming over I'd lock my door and pretend to be asleep. But sometimes I just couldn't avoid it, and sometimes I didn't even know she was coming over until she came busting into my room to jump me.

Long story short, she broke it off because she wasn't ""ready for a relationship."" We were never even in one. She just thought we were, apparently.

I still have to see her multiple times a week because she's my roommate's wife's friend and she's *always* over at our place.

Keep in mind, I'm 20, only had 2 serious girlfriends, and I have Asbergers so I really don't know how to handle shit like this. Hell, my body count was only 2 before I met her.

Meanwhile she's 27, divorced twice, two kids with different fathers, and has been passed around like a joint at a hippie convention.

I only have 2 friends. That's it. I'm living far from home with no family contact, and these are the only two friends I have. Friend #1 (my roommate) still thinks I wanted it and I'm just trying to sound cool, friend #2 thinks it's funny that I had to have sex with an unattractive person (how attractive she is isn't relevant to whether or not I wanted to have sex with her, it's just the reason he thinks it's funny).

They're both good friends and good people, but I absolutely cannot convince them that this is a legitimately big deal to me. One thinks it's funny and the other thinks I'm lying. I just need someone to talk to about it. I don't know what to do. I'm so far from home and I miss my family and I'm just so lost and scared and confused.",05Oct2020,1

789,"During lockdown I felt extremely guilty from the time I wanted to leave my friend behind. I didn't feel welcome around her, like she didn't want to be there. I apologised for trying to find a new friend group and talked bad about her to them before knowing her side of the story. I told her everything that happened and why it did and it hasn't felt the same since. It's both are faults but I don't think she'll ever admit it or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I was always overthinking it all along.

She ignores my messages from time to time, goes on socials, shows she's active, doesn't open my messages and then comes back after a bit to finally message me. She doesn't talk to me in school maybe because we're further away on seating plans. She doesn't share much and when I talk or rant about others she doesn't reply with anything like she usually would. She doesn't care about me basically anymore but I'm too afraid to ask because I've asked a million time for reassurance but it'll probably annoy her. 

I just don't know wether to even try. She'll be better of without me and it'll never be the same. She trusted me and I broke that trust. What should I do?

791,"We've been together for two years and we're both girls. Her family is homophobic and she also wants to go to med school... I haven't felt like a priority in a while...

1. We both went overseas for six months at the same time (to different places). When we got home her parents found out about our relationship and it was a shitshow. I told her to ditch them and move in with me so she would have a safe place to stay but she wanted to fix things with them. So for like two weeks I didn't see her.
2. They started tolerating us going on dates and stuff, then covid hit. She was big on social distancing which felt like a copout. We fought a lot and sometimes I would get her to come over but not much. We would talk on the phone but it wasn't the same and she seemed way more okay with that than me.
3. Then she started studying for the MCAT. We would video call but it wasn't the same, lots of fights again. Finally I got her to agree to see me once a week but even that's barely anything. Of course I wanted her to do good but I also want a girlfriend that I can actually see, especially since I don't have any real friends here and my family lives far away. I was stuck in an apartment alone and really depressed, but she still kept saying she needs to study and covid this and that.
4. She had to retake the MCAT because of a test center problem. It wasn't her fault so I was ok with it but I told her to move away with me and take it in the new city. She said ok but she was really stressed so I told her to take it at home and meet me in the new town which she was happy about. She pays the expenses 50/50 (without even living here) but with the new plan I'm in this new city alone for a month.
5. She pushes back the test by two weeks because she feels like the first appointment time she got was a bad time for her (early in the morning). Now I have to be alone for a month and two weeks. We plan so that she's going to move right after the test.
6. She finally finishes the test and tells her parents she's moving with me. They freak out, she's really sad. Then her dad tries to fix things with her and she asks if its ok to spend time with them to fix things instead of moving right away. I say it's ok if you take a few days to try to fix things with them. Today I talk to her about when she's supposed to show up and she says next weekend would be good (she was supposed to come this weekend). I just hung up on her. I'm sick of it.

792,"So my mother and I share an amazon prime account and we’re pretty good for respecting each other’s stuff and not being snoopy when it  comes to Christmas shopping. Well today I accidentally came across what she bought me for Christmas and to put it simply, I hate it lol. She bought me a “bed in a bag” set which is something I definitely would love but it’s in a colour and design so far from anything I would put into my house and made out of a material I’ve mentioned a few times about disliking. My issue is what to do now. I don’t want to be ungrateful or unappreciative because I really am thankful for her and all the things she’s ever gotten me but I know I would probably never use this set and wasting things like that sucks. Wasting money is also something I would absolutely hate to see her do on me but I don’t want to straight up say anything because I’m not even suppose to know it exists and I don’t want her to think I snoop through everything all the time. How should I go about this? This is a silly problem I know but I’m a horrible liar so I can fake it come Christmas but I think she would see right through me and I’d hate to disappoint her like that.

793,"I feel angry and resentful. And it's over superficial bullshit. I'm over 6 foot, broad shoulders, good body shape, strong jaw, working towards a degree I'm passionate about. Part-time job, I hit the gym, I have some decent savings built up. However, I've got mild Asperger's, along with a lot of other issues that come and go, such as depression, anxiety, etc, etc, that come from some negative events in my past and my childhood. Thus I find making friends really difficult. I know how to socialise and I feel I can do it pretty well. But I haven't made any new friends in years, despite me meeting hundreds of people the last few years. I haven't clicked with any of them, like there's this barrier. 

I've felt very alone recently, especially during A-Levels. I remember the last day where everyone was having fun in their groups of friends and I stood on the sidelines watching trying not to burst into tears, realising I had wasted so many opportunities for fun there. I only had one friend I'd talk to in class with. I wasn't able to click with anyone else there. Granted I was quite avoidant of people as I felt they didn't want anything to do with me. While there and afterwards, this left me feeling very depressed, which carried into my first year at uni. At university, I was excited for a fresh start and decided to just put myself out there. 

I went to my first party (at the age of 18). I started to go to loads of accommodation parties and society events, but was not able to make any friends at those either. Despite the well over a hundred people I met during my time there. The first party I went to I met two people and got their SnapChat, they said we should link soon. I woke up the next morning in a good mood before discovering that they had both blocked me. I don't know why. Initially I didn't care and tried to get on with the course. 

But I got so down seeing all the groups of friends around the city I dropped out and wasted a lot of money there. I dropped out in February, moving back to my family home. Feeling like such a failure compared to other people my age, I got a retail job and worked throughout the initial covid lockdown. Now I work there less and commute to a centre 4 days a week where I'm studying a new degree (by train. I had been so low the last few years I haven't yet learned to drive). I haven't been able to click with anyone there yet either. 

I feel I can mostly somewhat socialise normally and not be anxious or anything. I can hold eye contact, good body language and make jokes. And when socialising I try to ignore all of these feelings, and just be in the moment and try not to push too hard/too little so I don't come off as too intense or too distant. I don't say or do anything weird, either. But it doesn't seem to make a difference. I don't understand it. I feel unable to make friends. I updated my profile picture on Facebook the other day and virtually no-one has liked it, not even any of my older, extended family who know me well and frequent it regularly. I feel rejected, angry, resentful, and unlikeable. I feel bad for myself for having these feelings and caring about this when it's honestly superficial rubbish. But it would be nice to be able to make new friends, even just superficial ones. 

I think about the amount of people I've met and how none of them seemed to click with me and what that must say about me. I do have a couple of close friends, but now they are living away from home. I haven't made a new friend in years. I've been out with these close friends to pubs and such and met their friends/strangers, etc. Yet they didn't like me. My friend even showed me screenshots of them talking shit about me in a WhatsApp group I'm not a part of. Of course they acted nice to me when I was out and met them. Though at the time I felt ignored by them. The same friend now has a girlfriend and recently she put a picture up on her private of an antique trinket of someone with a deformed and ugly face, tagged me in it, and captioned it saying it was me. That really hurt. I don't consider myself ugly, but it makes me wonder if I am. One of his ex-girlfriends also actively used to tell me she hated me.

I feel so angry and resentful for all these years of being rejected. I'VE DONE NOTHING TO FUCKING DESERVE ALL OF THIS. I've had some rough family experiences in my childhood. I'm always anxious and sometimes down. But I do feel like I have a lot going for me. I work a lot on myself, and put myself out there, but I'm a complete loner. I feel like I'm losing it. I hate feeling like this. I want to have faith in people. But at the same time I feel like walking out the door and causing fucking destruction to everything around me. I want to smash up random people's cars with a hammer and break the windows to their houses with rocks just as a big fuck you to people in general. Someone help me out here. I don't understand why I've been treated like this. I'm so sick of it. Of all the many, many people I've met. I can't click with any of them. Some actively dislike me. And yet I see people who are actually weird, or who are really creepy, but of course THEY are likeable. It has to be my fault. I feel bad for feeling so whiny and immature. But I feel like I'm at my breaking point. 

TL;DR - Met many people over the last few years. None of whom I could click with. Feel very resentful, angry, upset and unlikeable. Don't understand it as I feel confident in myself and that I have stuff going for me. I don't act weird, too intense or distant, and I feel can socialise well. I don't get it.",05Oct2020,1

So there is this cute little Labrador that has been roaming the streets for a while.
When I first saw her she clearly isn't a ""wild"" dog. She clearly had a home so I called someone with a microchip scanner.
So after the scanner guy comes and gets the owner's address.
Since it was nearby I quickly went to my house and grabbed a leash and took that poor dog.
I have later learned that the reason she escaped was since she was tied in the front lawn which for the record didn't have any kind of fence.
When I returned the dog and talked to the family it was obvious that they didn't check on her enough as they clearly didn't tell she ran away.
I thought this was a one time occurrence so I quickly forgot about it.
For the next couple of weeks, a few people that go to the same dog park as me returned her home. From what I've been told we returned her for 14 times in the last couple of weeks.
One day, she came back to the park I first found her in, and this time she had a name and phone number on her collar.
I called the owners and they sent their kid to bring her back home.
She clearly didn't want to return and she fought not to go with them.

This dog is clearly not happy in her home and I am unsure as to what to do.

798,"Hi, I need advice and I have no idea how to seek help. I am a second year college student and I am working a retail job atm. I had a really rough first year and now I have fallen into academic probation, now I have found my self failing again.

It is hard to pinpoint when exactly it started, but I have never really been a motivated person in regard to anything that doesn't interest me. I had very poor grades in school and now that has extended into my secondary education. When ever there are things assigned I feel an onslaught of dread, like its a threat. So when things are assigned or I find them boring I ignore them, which I know is wrong but actually sitting down and doing them feels like torture. I have been diagnosed with ADHD (Inattentive type) and I have always had severe anxiety, so I have a slight explanation for my inclination to avoid things but I have been unable to create any coping mechanisms or ways to work through these situations.

 I have been lying to my parents because I know if I tell them they will be disappointed in me and hate me because this is the third semester I have done this. I haven't done a single assignment for one of my courses and have been trying really hard to keep up with the rest and do my job. But now I have no one to ask for help and setting up counselling through my college has been long and tedious, the only therapist I had has now retired I don't really have any person in my circle I don't feel absolutely guilty asking help from.

 I want to get better, I don't wanna live like this anymore because it hurts so bad. I am so privileged to be getting this education but to be honest I feel that it is wasted on me.

799,"Hello everyone, First time posting in this sub, so forgive me if it wrong, but I could really use some perspective of different people.

About two days ago, I had to put my 16 year old dog to sleep. He lived a long, happy life, but he never drank enough water to mix with his food, which caused some bladder stones to appear, or at least, this is what our vet said to me. He had surgery twice to get them removed, as it had happened twice before, but seeing as this was the third time within a year and a half from his last one, we decided it was finally time to say our goodbyes.

Here is where I need some advice. After the deed was done, I was talking to some friends of mine that asked me if I would be getting a tattoo of the paw print that the vet gave me. I was confused, as the vet did not provide me that, or even give me the choice to do that. I looked into it more, and asked my friend who is a vet in another state, to which I discovered that it is normal practice for a vet to ask if you want the paw print of your beloved pet before they euthanize them. This has been bothering me, as I said, they never even brought that up, and I don't think I can handle the excuse of ""they forgot"" or think it's an acceptable excuse.

My dog had been with me since I was 8, been through the worst of life, and the best of life, and several moves, some even across the country (U.S.) and it infuriates me that I wasn't offered this. So, is there anything I can do? I don't think I can sue or anything, and even if I could, I don't think I would, but is this really just one of those things that I'm just going to have to shut up and deal with, or is there anything I can do in terms of at lest some sort of compensation, or at least an apology? It may be dumb, and I may just be a little emotional, but he was my best friend, and it hurts me to know that I wasn't given the option to preserve him in some way.

Once she accidentally took a wrong bus while she was heading home so she was late and when she called her mom to apologize, her mom told her dad what happened, her dad called her and told her that she’s screwed or something like that, she literally had a panic attack on the way home and when she got there she was still panicking and upset so and apologized again but her parents still told her that she’s awful, that’s she’s lying and that she faked the whole crying and shaking and she also isn’t allowed to hang out with that friend of hers because she’s “a bad influence on her”.

807,"I'm 15 and in high school. My relationship with my parents is... complicated. My dad and I get on ok for the most part, but he is pretty unreliable generally. My mom and I don't really get on well at all, and she's overbearing. My parents while not divorced, severely dislike each other and often use me as communication between them or to vent about how the other one is awful. I don't think I've ever seen them say anything good about each other. And I don't really trust them with much at all.

 I don't like my home life at all, and if I could/had the means to then I would move out. But since I'm 15 and can't really do that for a little over 2 years, the next best thing would be to be self-sufficient. I'm trying to make a plan to become more self-sufficient to the point where I can move out by the time I turn 18 (about 2 years) or by when I graduate (2.5 years). So far I have some of the things I'm gonna try and do to be able to fulfill this plan. But of course it's not complete and I need some advice.

Firstly, I was going to start off by taking my driving test before the end of November, so that I will be able to get my license when I am 16. I turn 16 in about 2 months. Also part of the short term (now until the end of the year) is to save up $1,000, of which I'm only a few hundred dollars off.

The next part of my plan would be 2021, and the first thing I would do is get a car. I know that the money I have won't be enough for a car but oddly enough this may be one of the things I will be able to get with the help of my parents (maybe... or just see if a relative is selling their car or something). If I could do this part this year I would but I think it's highly unlikely. The other thing I will do in this year is get a new higher paying job if possible, and try to have $4,000 at the end of the year. 

The final phase of my plan would be 2022 and then possibly the first half of 2023. I would want to have maybe $6-8k saved by then. I will separate my bank accounts for myself when I turn 18 and keep all my legal documents. At this point I also want to have some idea of what I'm doing after high school, whether it's college or work. Then, at the end of this, I should be able to leave my house forever in a relatively decent position.

Things I will be doing throughout this entire plan is: budgeting my money wisely, spending more time away from home (once i can drive/ even when i cant), and also general tasks myself (keeping my own living space tidy, making doctors appointments, etc)

816,"Hey all, I am a university student \[female\] who is also juggling work. College is 100% online as of right now, but I am taking an extra course so I can get more credits to graduate on time. I am generally a good student, however I just recently had surgery a few weeks ago and the doctor says my recovery time is about 7 months. I can't work out/do yoga, let alone move comfortably, eat junk food, get my heart rate up, lift heavy things, etc. Even laughing hurts right now. I was already busy/stressed prior to the surgery but I was managing it well as I was able to exercise and sometimes even go outside. Exercise also helped me because I was recently cheated on by my ex. Due to the pandemic, I can't go outside to hang out or shop because I have a very weakened immune system right now. I also can't online shop because I live in a third world country that doesn't have credit cards. This means during my free time, my options are limited. Living in a third world country means my internet connection speeds are super slow and sadly I don't have any books to read. I wanted to learn how to bake and apply makeup but I don't think I will have the physical capability nor energy to do so at least for the next few weeks. I need some advice preferably to those who have been in a similar situation so that I can keep sane and what to do in my free time so I'm not that stressed because it's unhealthy and my body will have an even slower recovery time.

820,"I am soon becoming 15, and I’ve spent my entire life saving up for stuff that I want, like a PC or a PlayStation since I only have a PS2 and would like a PS4 or 5. I’ve had the same phone as well growing up, and I used to put on a note my money savings. For example “August 27 19, 578$” and so on. My mom then decided to save my money for me, saying she was gonna keep it safe and even copied my money saving note onto her phone. So far so good, right?

Fast forward to now. I switched phones and lost my notes from the first one, but I still remembered the amount and kept the current amount on my new phone. This was gonna be my first time ever using the savings to buy something (I was gonna go buy a gift card for a friend’s birthday) and decided to take out 25 dollars. I go to my mom in the kitchen and ask her to take out 25 dollars. She goes “Show me your note” and I show her the note on my new phone specifically stating “2020, October 2nd, $1522”

She starts shaking her head and asked for the “Real note” and I told her again I lost it when I switched phones, I then told her to show me her note and she goes “Deleted it!”. I ask for my money because she was genuinely upsetting me. Next thing you know, she pats me on the back, says “Don’t EVER trust people with your money” and smiles telling me to go back to whatever I was doing.

It’s currently October 5th and I have yet to see any money. And my mom still says stuff like “That’s what you get when you trust too easily”. Am I being spoiled or naive? And what do I do?",05Oct2020,1
822,"I have a somewhat long front walkway, which is made of many shallow steps. It’s not super steep, but it’s definitely sloped. Lately, neighborhood kids have been walking to the top (my front step) and biking down the steps. They were not invited to do this and I’m worried that they’ll get hurt and I’ll be responsible because it’s my property. 

How do I get them to stop? I’ve asked and told them several times but as soon as I go inside, they do it again. They won’t tell me their names and I don’t know where they live (and I’m not going to creepily follow them to find out). I’ve thought about posting on next door, but I think it would be weird to photograph them and without a picture, I’m not sure the parents are aware this is happening. The kids are between 7-10 years old.

823,"so I posted this story on tifu about a month back. I would give this young homeless man food a few times a week. He was really young like 18 and I kinda looked out for him. After months of this we formed a friendship and on offered him a room in my house if he could maintain a job. Well I helped him get.a job at a local restaurant he was living with me and contributing and overall was doing really great. This kid had a rough upbringing and just needed a chance.  Well covid hit and we both lost our jobs and eventually I had to move back in with my mother forcing him back out on the streets.no felt terrible like I really let this kid down. 

So the update is time went on over the past month we got past the prior dilemma from the old house. We kept in touch and I went to eat with him weekly. He was sleeping outside again but eventually got him into a shelter. The shelter has a limit due to covid and he had to leave last week. I let him stay in my car a few nights but can't continue to do so. I'm looking to get him a cheap hotel for the month. When I first posted this to tifu it blew up and someone set up a gofundme for him but then my post and account was deleted shortly after posting the gofundme. It raised 1k and that is almost enough for his hotel stay. I will probably cover the rest if I can. But was told to give an update. I posted this and it was deleted. Idk why.

Overall it just felt like one of the biggest errors I committed in my life. Although right now he is stable its still crushing knowing he is back on the streets and I'm worried he may slip back into his old ways. Do you guys think I should stay at the hotel with him or leave him be on his own? Been wondering if it would be good for him to be on his own after all this",05Oct2020,1

Hi so I (F22) need help in deciding what to do. This is the cast. Bestfriend (f22) we’ll call her sharon Boyfriend (m23) call him john Bestfriends cousin (~38-40 f) call her janice

Ok so i kinda of live with john and he isnt the best boyfriend. We have a rocky relationship. He was controlling and most recently he hit me once and i filed a police report. I know its bad. But since our relationship has been like this Sharon and john pretty much hate eachother and im always in the middle.

On friday i got upset with john and decided to go bake at sharons house. We were drinking and i decided i wanted to go back to johns because he made me dinner and that was my initial plan was to eat with him and have a nice day but because of the argument it got interrupted.

Sharon told me to stay and i said i was going to leave. She told her cousin who she lives with and i know fairly well that i wanted to leave and she told me to stay the night. Shron then said if i left she would kill herself. We both have depression and anxiety.

I agreed to stay and john said he would come To get my car. So i told her i was just going to go speak to him and id be back. I went out and we went to the store a few blocks away. She texted me saying it was too late and i didnt have to come back. I said i was just going to the store and id be back but if she really didn’t want me there id leave. I was half a block from her house and i was in the car with john when i saw her standing there. I stepped out of the car qnd she asked me why i was doing this to myself. Janice was with her. I was trying to deescalate the situation when i noticed her arm has slashes all down it. Then she started fighting with john. And i just started hyperventilating and then went into a full on anxiety attack where i was on the floor uncontrollably screaming with janice holding me.

The police came and then the ambulance came. In the middle of me screaming or just before i barely saw That sharon screamed and left. I was then taken by the ambulance to the hospital. While i was in the hospital sharon called me To say she was going to be admitted as well (but she never was). They gave me Ativan and i was so exhausted i just fell asleep. When i woke up I called her to see if she was ok she said no and hung up on me.

John picked me up when i was discharged an hour later. Sharon tried calling me the next day but i wasnt able to talk to her yet because idk what i would even say. John wants me to cut her off. And i just dont know what to do.",05Oct2020,1
825,"I (30F) work at a homeless shelter, and we have quite a few kids/teens right now.

We loved each other very much but he did something that hurted me so i decided it was for the best if we broke up and so we did for 2 months the first month i was broken and i cried a lot after a month i decided it was better if i moved on because i dealed with a lot of pain. I met this guy and we could find it well but in my head he felt more like a friend and i still thought about my ex. I ended up sleeping with him but it didn´t feel right. This made me realize that i was still realy in love with my ex so i ended things with him and me and my ex started talking again. We started meeting again and everything went really well we were so in love again. untill we had an conversation in the car he said that if i would have been with some one else in the time we broke up he would never want me back again. I didn´t dare to tell him at that moment but after 3 days i told him because i felt so bad. He was realy angry when i told him and he said that he never wanted to see me again. After a few days he decided that he wanted to talk and he was realy sad about it because he hated the idea of me with someone else. Right now we are seeing each other a few times a week but things are still weird i realy want him and only him but he doesn´t believe this anymore and he says he wants me but also when he talks about the future i am not involved in it anymore i realy dont know if its better to end things or to fight for him because i don´t want to hurt him and without me he wouldn´t be in so much pain right now.,05Oct2020,1
827,Where do I begin. I guess since I graduated high school a little over a year ago I fell into a pretty bad depression for the first time in my life. All of my friends were moving on and going to college and I sat at home and did nothing because I didn't 4hink I was good enough for college and didn't know if I wanted to go. Fast forward a few months and I am now dating a girl for the first time in my life and I'm starting to feel really good again. Things are going well and then I find out she is pregnant. She was scared at first because she didn't think she was ready but we talked it out and we decided we would raise this child together and do everything we can for him and we are both really excited about it now. The entire process has been difficult for me because I decided it would be best to move in with her so I can be there to support her but that meant that I had to move 45 minutes away from my family which causes stress on them as well. I've been looking for a job for a while now and it's extremely difficult to find a job that works with my schedule so I can see my family and be with my girlfriend when she needs me. It also doesn't help that I have no real formal education. I don't have alot of money and that creates the most stress right now because I have to take care of a baby soon even though both sides of the family are extremely supportive. I guess the fact that my girlfriend has a good job and far more money than me also adds to the stress because it makes me feel inferior on so many levels. I've talked to her about it but never really mentioned the fact that I'm really stressed because she seems to be doing so well financially in life and I feel like I'm just barely scraping by.,05Oct2020,1

I’m 15 and recently I’ve noticed I internalise stuff too much. If someone insults me, tells me off or something bad happens to me, it’s on my mind for days and I can’t seem to let it go. I don’t like it because it puts me in a bad mood and I don’t know if this makes sense but it feels like I have a pit in my stomach whenever I randomly remember said incident. Usually on the night the situation occurred, I struggle to sleep. 

Around two months ago, someone misunderstood something I said and accused me of being a victim blamed (long story and I promise I’m not a victim blamer) and it was on my mind constantly for like a week and once or twice a day it still pops up even though I made amends and fixed the situation. 

Apparently this is similar to my money problems. If I wanted to buy something, and I’ve set money aside to buy it, as soon as I purchased it I’d feel guilty and regret it even if I was happy that I bought it at the end of the day. I’m bringing this up because I wrote about it on this sub before and I asked why I did this and I got told it was because I was ‘internalising’ it and I was wondering if it’s the same thing?

838,"Hello all. I’ll try to make this short. 

I work a 9/80 schedule at my job. For those of you who don’t know what that is, I work my 80 hour pay periods in 9 days so I have every other Friday off. There’s 9/80A and 9/80B. The A and B just refer to which Friday I have off. 

So, I work a 9/80B. At some point in the past 3 months, my boss switched my schedule to 9/80A for some odd reason. I was unaware of the change since I didn’t ask for it, so I kept to my schedule. However, this means that I’m being marked absent every other Friday, using my paid time off for the whole shift, and then being paid overtime rate for the Fridays I am there. 

He blamed me for telling him to change it when I never did, and then blamed me for not checking my time which is COMPLETELY his job since we electronically clock in. Additionally, he never once called me on my “absent” days to check on me which, at my company, is a HUGE no-no during the COVID times. We fire people for no call, no shows. Also, there’s COVID protocol in place for if you miss work, you HAVE TO talk to HR and be cleared to come back to work (just make sure no fever or symptoms, none of which has been done.)

Anyway, this has led to me being slightly overpaid for months and me draining all of my hard earned PTO. I’m switching to a higher paying position starting next pay period, so I want my PTO that was paid under my current salary to be “refunded” to me. I did the math and said “this is how much I owe the company to get my PTO back” and he told me it was actually “twice that” and that it would be better for me to just take unpaid leave instead. It objectively isn’t better, if you’re following along. 

I bypassed him and went straight to accounting department and got it sorted out, but I had to fight tooth and nail. 

My issues are that:

A. He never once called me to check when I was absent, especially during the pandemic. 

B. He let it go on for MONTHS without telling me and expected me to do his job. 

C. He blamed me to my face and then in an email thread to accounting that he doesn’t know I’ve been forwarded. 

I’ve gotten it all sorted out, but with literally no help from him, my supervisor. Had I been any less adamant and any more of a pushover, I would have been screwed out of literally thousands by the end of it. 

Is this worth bringing up to his superior? I’m happy to have it sorted out but incredibly frustrated and disappointed with how he has handled it.",05Oct2020,1
839,"So, there’s this one girl in my uni friend group. Basically, since the first time I met her I’ve been kind of drawn to her, I just thought she was really cool. 
I’m the youngest in our group and they all kinda treat me like a younger sister. Most of them are 2-3 years older. Normally I don’t really mind and I kinda like the attention and the doting.
The first time I met her we were talking about sexuality and I told them I’m bi. She said she’s also into girls and that made me feel some kind of way. In the first weeks we would only hang out in a group setting, but the last week we’ve been hanging out the two of us and it’s really fun. She even went with me when i got my nose pierced! But at the same time, she tells me all about her hookups with her tinder dates. She also points out our “age gap” a lot and gives me advice about things, in a sisterly way. 
She also said that she isn’t looking for anything serious at all and that she just wants to have fun.
But I noticed that while we’re hanging out I’ve been developing some sort of crush on her and I don’t really know what to do with it. We’ve only been friends for like 1-2 months but it feels like I’ve known her forever.

The reason I know this is because her roommate has secretly been feeding me information about this. The fact that I know someone who I love is outright lying to me makes me extremely anxious. So much to the fact that I was forced to take medication to relieve my anxiety. 

My question is do I end the relationship with the woman I love to save my health.  Ending the relationship require me I to throw the roommate under the bus because how else would she know I have this information. 3 lives would be effected if I did this. I would feel the worst about betraying the roommate who I know he doesn’t have many friends. This action would surely end their relationship.

Please help this is killing me. The anxiety is killing my as I am writing this. 😢 . No lie it brings me to tears.",05Oct2020,1

846,"I have a unstable household where my mum n dad are only together for god knows why as they keep screaming at each other all the time. I barely remember any positive or a loving memory.

I got into self-harm, started having blackouts, lost my sense of self, and saying that I hated myself would be selling it short.

Seeking shelter, I got into in a relationship for ~10 years which turned out to be an abusive one as years progressed and only good thing that came out of it was my decision to get professional help.

About 2 years ago, got diagnosed with Panic Disorder, and upon initial therapy Borderline Personality Disorder, which explained my avoidant &amp; abandonment issues, and helped me find something to live on.
After 2 years when I finally stabilized, finally my world turned for the better
1. My aforementioned relation ended in a brake-up with me on the reciving end. (which surprizingly went super peaceful)
2. I got into a new govt. job as a Lecturer
3. I met a new wonderful person that I connected with
4. I started caring for myself, and started looking forward to the next day.
And my life was finally on track! I was happy, true to myself, on my best behavior and towards therapy.

Suddenly CoVid happened.
Therapy was halted. I ran out of meds in 2 months (I reduced dosage and tried as long as I could to keep the stock)
After 1 month, I regressed. And bad. I became super-impulsive, eg. I shaved my head because I could not find a barber.
I started lying, doing whatever I wanted, avoiding responsability, scared to lose anyone (even the ex).

By this time, I was long-involved with the new person at the job, on the verge of finalizing marriage and settling down.
3 months of self-hatred, fights, and hurting the one I planned on living rest of my life with. They couldn't keep up my lies and I ended up hurting em real bad as I was still in touch with my ex-.
They have been very forgiving and understanding but now I cant ask them for anything anymore.

I an really tired, it took just 2 months undo all I did in 2 years?
Is there really no hope for me?
I know I need to work on myself, stop playing the victim card, and build an honest true-to-self life. But I am so torn inside, confused, and hate myself. If anyone can, please, help?",05Oct2020,1

848,"A really horrible day

I’m not quite sure where to begin. I had just about the worst day today, took any little self esteem that I had and just shattered to. To preface, I’ve always been very insecure about my face, and not only that but I’ve had people straight up tell me to my face what they thought of my face (aka, ugly). This was in elementary and middle school. Now I’m a senior and today we were taking a test in a class where the teacher required us to turn on the camera. It was all fine until I turned mine on and I saw these three guys just start snickering. Needless to say, it wrecked me. At this point I should know that I am ugly (and there’s nothing wrong with self awareness or at least knowing that not everyone looks pretty) but idk, I’m a girl and it sucks soo much. The funny thing is it also made me realize something. I’ve probably had maybe 6 people in my entire life tell me I could model cause I think I have pretty strong features, but now I look back at it, after what happened today, what’s been happening my whole life, I now know they meant I could model like those “unique” models which is just a nice way to say unattractive. It’s a big contradiction in how I can be complimented as a model but then be evidently ugly. Cause let’s face it if someone calls you a model, they probably are just thinking of a general attractive person and not necessarily those “unique models” so in general models are thought of as highly attractive. But how can that apply to me when a a majority of the people I’ve known have made it clear what they think of me. And I know it may sound like I’m exaggerating but I’ve been called ugly so many times by so many people that it’s literally the first word I think about when I think of myself. I’ve known for a while that I am ugly (in fact I barely look in mirrors, I don’t take pictures and it’s even worse when filters don’t even make you look better), but before I used to take some kind of comfort in thinking that maybe it was just all in my head or my past bullies coming back to haunt me, except now it’s confirmed. I always knew but it sucks that it’s very evident to others. I know I’m probably gonna read “beauty is subjective” “don’t worry what others think” etc, and these are true but I’m a girl living in a society where no matter how smart a woman is she always boils down to her looks and I don’t have any of that. I don’t even have a question, I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore.",05Oct2020,1
849,"First time posting to this sub, and will try my best to explain my situation. I’m a 23 year old female accounting student that’s in my last year of school till I graduate with a bachelors in Accounting. I grew up with biracial parents, my mom immigrated here from China in her 30s where she met my dad who is a run of the mill country guy. Growing up I had some harsh living environment from my mom who was an extreme tiger mom and my dad having really bad anger issues. I was raised with piano lessons, and doing schoolwork on top of school work a grade ahead of whatever grade I was in by my mom every night. I was pretty brainwashed into thinking that anything below an A was the worst devastating failure ever and that I’d grow up to be a doctor. In my teen years I was really suicidal and depressed and constantly felt like I was letting my mom down and burdened by this sense of failure and I didn’t think I’d go to college. 

Even as I write this I’m not sure if I was raised normally would I have chosen a different path but I picked a college really far away from my parents and went in as undeclared and was doing well for myself until my grandfather in China unexpectedly passed and my moms mental health took a sharp decline. I ended up failing the semester and moving home to be close with my mom and now widowed grandma who doesn’t speak English. I took a semester off and was working a retail job and being pretty happy until I felt pressure to apply to college and go back from my family. I applied and decided to pursue accounting kind of on a whim because it was something I felt like I’d be good at, and a job I felt would make my mom proud. It hasn’t been easy but with therapy, medicine, and a strong relationship I’ve been able to continue on this path telling myself once I got a job and graduated that I could essentially “start” my life and honestly have felt like my life has just been on pause this whole time just waiting until I got a degree to “live my life”. 

Now here’s my issue: my university switched from being online to an in person school setting this semester and I’m taking two of the hardest courses in my major this semester. It’s been ridiculously challenging going back in person, and I’ve felt like everything has been “on the line” for me because the classes I’m taking are only offered once a year by one professor who has been known for being ridiculously hard. I’ve been putting in very heavy effort with studying and attending class through an hour commute each week but have been failing this class despite my effort. Half the class is failing but my professor is someone who will fail half the class if that’s what it comes down to. 

I’m sure this is an insignificant or dumb reason to feel bad, but I’m starting to question if I’ll truly pass this semester. I’ve had a lot of mental health struggles along with some family issues and although I’m 2 semesters out from graduating I’m starting to face the reality that I won’t be able to graduate within the year, and it’ll be pushed back to two or more since this class is the class I need to take the rest of my courses, and won’t be offered again until next year by the same professor. 

Years of being raised in high expectations, I’ve never felt I lived my life for me. I’m not sure what I want but I realistically know I need to get support myself and grow up. I’ve put off anything I’ve wanted to do in my life off until I graduated and got a proper “job” because I’ve felt inadequate, riddled with anxiety and depression, and unsure of myself without this degree.  I’ve been putting in the effort for this class but I can say I will more than likely fail at this point. I’ve woke up the last few weeks feeling hopeless with school because the lectures, readings, assignments haven’t changed my reality of failing tests in this course. 

I feel embarrassed to have not graduated until I was 24 (if things went as planned) and now am just ashamed and unsure of what to do thinking about facing this failure and another year pause until I can finish the rest. I recently got Covid from a relative who is a nurse and have had to quarantine with my boyfriend and it’s also made it so much harder to focus on doing well in school. I’ve talked to my boyfriend and mom about failing and they’ve encouraged me to try to the end and it will be okay regardless but I feel ashamed and hopeless because the efforts I’m making studying and with assignments aren’t helping and I feel like no one understands how I’m feeling. If I fail this course I don’t know what I’d do in terms of with my life, because I felt like this was all I had going for me. I’m scared and unsure, but I just feel like my world is ending and I’m riddled with shame, fear, and depression. If you read this far thanks, I tried to make it as non emotional as possible but even now I feel overwhelmed and depressed.",05Oct2020,1

851,"My apologies for this post's out-of-order layout. I don't tell anyone when somethings wrong and I'm still learning how.

I'm 20F and I had a stroke last year, my mental health is absolutely destitute, and I've lost my scholarships due to COVID. 

I need advice on random ways to make money, how to not off oneself while an oligarchy seizes your country, and what steps to take post-stroke to prevent death... or cause it, should the situation become worse. 

I've always kind of depended of suicide as a way out, but now I have a fantastic SO, and I don't want to abandon him. I feel like I'm stuck in limbo, poisoning the lives of everyone around me with my worthlessness. 

I'm stressed over the fact that I might become a college dropout. I'm stressed that I could never afford any kind of medical follow-up after having a stroke. I'm stressed that everyone around me is getting COVID and dying. But what stresses me out the most is that, if my country wasn't such an ass-backwards, capitalist, money-grubbing shithole, all of my problems would be solved- rather, they would have been solved before they even began. 

I just want to know how to adult. Where can I run to? Nowhere is safe anymore. I can't even die securely. You get arrested if you fuck up your own suicide in the US (in my state anyway). 

I've been doing small freelance tasks to earn a little cash. I design logos and write people's essays and build PowerPoints. I sell photos of my feet and anything else that I can receive money for. I was assaulted by a boyfriend when I was 16 and these things leave me feeling disgusting.

In the end, the advice I seek is:

How do I motivate myself to do anything when I'll probably end up in a gulag, homeless, or dead anyway?

How do I make $8000 to avoid going into college-related debt?

Is there anywhere I can find free, online counseling services (besides Reddit)?

How do I cope with the fact that I can't escape the US?

How do I not have another stroke?

How do I deal with the aftermath of a stroke (I've experienced horrid short-term memory-loss)?

How do I do anything? I've failed at life. I just need to get better.",05Oct2020,1
852,"Hi guys, so I 18F just started college. I think I have OCD though I've never seen a doctor for it or gotten medically diagnosed, I've recognized that I have a lot of unusual mental rituals that other people I've met don't have, etc, but it's suddenly gotten a lot worse due to college and I would really appreciate some insight as to what is going on/how I can control it.

So I started college and I live in a  dorm with tons of other freshmen. On my floor there are probably 20 ish girls and 20 ish boys (the floor is divided into 2 hallways, one side female one side male). One day, I noticed these thick gooey drip stains on the wall near my desk in my dorm room. They were symmetrically aligned in 2 relatively neat rows, and looked a lot like glue. I later found more of these gooey drip stains on other parts of the wall in my room. My first reaction was that they were cum stains. I asked around and most people told me it was glue (though some boys - possibly trying to mess with me - told me it was cum). I had maintanence come in and the guy even scraped it off with his finger and told me it was glue, but for some reason I was still latching onto the possibility that it was cum. My parents assured me that even if it was cum, it had been on the wall for 3+ months and any disease it could have carried was long dead, but I was still so grossed out by the idea and started going paranoid over the possibility of catching HIV from the dried glue cum on the wall, so I started cleaning all my belongings that I thought might have accidentally scraped the ""glue cum"" wall before I noticed it. I ended up taping papers over the walls so I don't have to look at the glue cum and that fear has pretty much gone away, though I'm still paranoid about the tape giving out and the paper (which touched the glue cum) will fall and land on my face and give me whatever disease the glue cum carried.

Next came the bathroom paranoia. So I share a bathroom with all the other girls on my floor, and needless the say the stalls get pretty disgusting. But whenever I go pee, I'm paranoid that the pee will splash back toilet water onto my arms, etc and transmit to me HIV or whatever disease is floating around in the toilet seat. There aren't any toilet covers provided but I always put down a make-do layer of toilet paper before I use the seat. However, yesterday one of these toilet papers that I put on the very front part of the seat (the part that usually has period blood stains or pee stains from when people stand up and it drips) fell onto the floor. There weren't any blood or pee stains on the toilet seat at this particular time, but the thought of there having been previous stains on the seat freaked me out into thinking maybe the janitor didn't get it all off and there were still miniscule blood molecules on it that the toilet paper touched, and the rim of my pant leg touched the toilet paper that fell that touched the toilet seat that may have had blood on it, which meant some  blood molecules may have gotten onto my pant leg. The toilet paper was dry, and there was nothing visible on the toilet, so i tried reasoning to myself that I was being irrational and it was fine. I was too tired to think too much about it and went to bed. But, when I laid down and my leg came into contact with the pant rim that touched the toilet paper, I felt a sharp prick/wet feeling of a single wet droplet touching my leg. This freaked me out and I was afriad maybe I did get some liquid on my pant rim after all and now it was on my leg, and I was going to get HIV. I tried reasoning to myself that this was an unlikely mode of transmission, but the very idea still grosses me out. 

Similarly, I washed my bathrobe the other day with a ton of my other clothes. I used the warm water setting when I probably should have used cold, so one of the clothes leaked a pinkish red stain onto some of my other clothes. My bathrobe also has a problem with losing color everytime it's washed, and this time I noticed that the rim of the robe belt had turned white-ish (the robe is supposed to be gray). I didn't look too closely at it, but later that day I took a shower in the public shower room. Before I first stepped into the shower stall, I turned the water on to test the temperature.  When I turned off the water, I noticed these shiny white specks on the shower floor. I'm very nearsighted (around -7.5 in both eyes) and wasn't wearing my glasses at this moment so I basically couldn't see anything clearly. I figured they were just water droplets reflecting light, so I stepped in and took a shower as usual. But after I went back to my dorm room after my shower wearing my robe, I noticed that the robe belt rim that was turning white-ish had some pink on it. I immediately freaked out and thought it was blood, and that the white specks on the shower floor were a sign that the previous person didn't rinse completely, and maybe they'd left period blood on the floor that I couldn't see and consequently dragged my robe through. I then tried reasoning to myself that the pink (which was a pinkish gray) did not look like blood, but the location of the pink stain happened to be on the spot most suceptible to touching the floor when I put the robe on. This freaked me out even more and I tried rationalizing that it was probably due to color contamination when I washed it and the pink was probably there along with the white except I didn't look closely before, but part of my mind still thinks it's blood and I'm going to get HIV from it since it touched me. It's been 2 days and the pinkish stain is still the same color, which wouldn't make sense for it to be blood since blood turns darker, but I'm still irrationally afraid that it's blood.

Overall, I feel like I'm being crazy and irrational so I've resisted the urge to go all out and wash my bathrobe, clothes, bed sheets, body, etc everything that touched something that may have touched ""blood"" (because I've already had several of these washing sessions in the past few weeks and I'm getting tired), but now I feel like I've just given up and let myself get disease from the ""blood"". Is this normal or Am I being completely irrational? I feel like this is OCD but the scenarios I invent feel so realistic in the moment that I think I'm being perfectly rational, but then think back on it later and think it's crazy, but then realize that it technically is plausible which ends up freaking me out.",05Oct2020,1
853,"I recently moved away from my home city in the UK to university that is about 3 hours away. Because coronavirus in English universities and the whole country is spreading a lot we are all barred from going to events that are not online and meeting other people outside of our flat (I live with 7 others). I've been at university for just over 2 weeks now and the biggest problem with the pandemic that I face is finding real friends. All of my old friends from sixth form are either playing in groups together as they haven't gone to university or are settling in and making friends with their flatmates. I struggle with this because all of my flatmates are fairly normal cool people and I am quite an introverted nerd and I don't share much in common with them. Don't get me wrong, they are all nice people and we get along, but I'm not really friends with them like they are with each other. I often don't know about things that are going on. I did go out to meet people on my course at an outdoor cinema and that was good, but we haven't spoken much since and cannot meet anymore. Plus, it's hard to make friends with people on my course online too, we have a discord server and various chats but everyone obviously keeps more to themselves online.

I skipped 1st grade and I've been told my whole life that I was extremely smart and that school was going to be easy for me. This was true until the beginning of the year when I didn't understand anything from the first math class. 

I don't know if I have gaps because I didn't follow the virtual classes assiduously at the end of last year or only because this year is the last year of high school and it's supposed to be harder. 

Anyways, I work a lot to try to keep up but my efforts don't pay off and I feel extremely demotivated. On top of that, I have trouble concentrating when I don't understand something and constantly ask my friend to help me (she's really good in math and physics which are the two subjects I'm bad).

It apparently isn't listed high enough on the autistic scale to be considered a disability according to my sister(21F) but I've always been horribly forgetful and flighty with things.  Not trying to blame a mental problem for my problem here since I know plenty people can have everything I listed and then some and do plenty with themselves. 

When I was younger like maybe 6 to 11yr old me could be asked to get up from the TV to get something out the fridge. In the few seconds it took to get from the living room to the kitchen I would of forgotten why or what I came to the fridge to get.  Things are at least a bit better now but when it comes to retaining things I need to know or trying to focus on one task without getting distracted by a random thought or noise it  still happens more then I care for.

I want to move out my mom's house one day and try to job search again for places out side the small city/town area I live. There aren't a lot of jobs in this part of Indiana and even though there are other means of getting around available like Uber and a township transport they come with some annoying hang ups for me.  Uber can get costly to use daily and township can be a bit unreliable with it's pick-up times since it's basically like a local free tax bus that makes a lot of stops or gets the time wrong. They also have a restrictions of only Mon-Fri between 7am to 7pm.  They can go at least 4 different places outside my area so they are worth it in a way. 

This is where I call it ironic to use the word ""drive"" because I know the obvious answer to all this is to get my scrawny butt up to take the written test for my license again and then the driven one.  I took it once before after studying and passed. I can't recall exactly when but I want to say maybe 2015 or a bit earlier.  At the beginning of this year I was psyched myself up to do it again. Trying to focus and retain what I was reading in the updated drivers manual and online practice tests. Then they shutdown the BMVs and I think at some point I just either mentally gave up or just been lazier about it. I think there's another word besides lazy that fits though it might just be a bigger word for lazy. 

Then I took to long with driving practice with what I think at the time was a workone program or something close and lost my chance to.   My last job before getting laid off in July was school sub custodian that travels around each school within my area so everywhere was pretty close to home with and easy to get to with both township or uber if they ran late.

I have plenty goals as motives from what I just listed but the drive to do anything to reach them just doesn't feel like it exists.  At max while typing this the tab for one of those ""free driving test"" for the written portion is open on my screen.

So now my boss's boss is pissed bc these meetings are their entire lives, especially in Covid times. He brings it from the meetings to my schooling. He tells my boss that the hours I need to be at clinical and in lecture aren't going to work in the event that they needed me later and my coworker couldn't work. My boss is now basically telling me to think it over and decide whether or not I'm going to choose to stay in school- and that my job is on the line for it. I came too far to give up now.. but I also live alone and need the money. I'm so down right now.. any advice would be helpful.",05Oct2020,1
867,"So my best friend, let's call him Oscar (15M) and I (15M) have been drifting apart recently. It started when I accidentally found his reddit account, and on there I found a post about me. This post wasn't nice and basically said that he doesn't want to be friends with me. He apologised and said that he thought it months ago and it didn't mean anything, I believed him. But I was also curious and went through the rest of his reddit, however there were some personal posts on there that I really shouldn't have read. There are two reasons I went through the rest of his reddit:

1) I wanted to know if there was anything else about me on there (there was)
2) Oscar is a very shy person, he doesn't tell any of us about his personal life, and I was curious. I learnt more about him from his reddit than from him, I felt like I deserved to know about his life, so I continued going through it all. (Btw this isn't me trying to justify my actions, I'm just saying why I did it)

And now because I went through his reddit he's really upset with me, he was the sort of friend that you talk to all the time and the person you play games with online, and I miss him. I really really miss him, and it probably sounds crazy especially because this happened 6 days ago but I've felt really lonely. My grandmother was taken to hospital yesterday and I've been really upset about it and he's the person I would talk to about it. 

I just don't know what to do, I really don't want to lose him, I don't know if he needs space and if he does I don't know how much, if he asked me to stop being friends with my other friends I would I just don't know what to do.",05Oct2020,1
868,"My girlfriend and I have been together 10 months. We are both seniors in highschool and with the pandemic we've had some rough times but we've gotten through it and are planning what we're gonna do in college and how to make it work.

She has a lot of male friends, which I'm fine with and understand, I have a ton of female friends. I do my best not to be jealous or possessive, and trust her. I don't tell her she can't hang out with anyone, what she can't wear, or what she can't do. I only ask her that if she wouldn't appreciate me doing something with another woman (or guy as I'm bi) then please don't do it with someone else. 

But sometimes I can't help but feel wary of some of her male friends. I understand what it's like to be the guy best friend and sometimes you do have feelings for the other person, you just can't really express it. I can't help but be a lil jealous occasionally as she's known a lot of these people a lot time and it makes me wonder if she wouldn't have more in common with them. I understand this is my own insecurity from past traumas and relationships, and I have talked to her about it when I feel that way, not to tell her not to do something but for reassurance.

So I just wanna know if it's normal to get a little jealous or be wary of your SO's friends? I do my best not to let it interfere with my relationship and to not be controlling, I just wanna make sure I'm not a bad guy or anything for having these feeling.",05Oct2020,1

I have 3 semesters left but tensions are super high between my family and myself. My brother (17) is abusive and purposefully causes drama between my mother and I so now she hates me. 

They both want me out of the house (even though im the only one who does chores and cooks in the house) So I'm trying to decide what i need to do because its got to the point where i can no longer safely stay here. (My brother is extremely violent and my mom is worried he will beat me up) 

I'm torn between spending an extra 4000$+ a year to move into a single dorm on campus and droping out and moving to another state with my partner. 

Im really worried about my finances, im only in 8k debt (thankfully) but most of it is from loaning my mom money that she swears she will pay back (she wont).

I live in a different state but have the same group of friends. Well anyways. 2 months go by and I got a call from the police in her town. They asked me to come in for questioning about a sexual assult claim they recieved. The girl said i sexually assulted her last time i saw her 2 months ago. What do I do? I go to the station this friday to talk to the investigator. I think I will be fine because everything we did was 100% consensual.

873,"Hi this story is a long one but I would so greatly appreciate if you read through it all.

I’m gonna change a few things about the entire story but that shouldn’t mess with the important parts of this story.

About 3-4 months ago I posted an advice post on a different topic, one person (let’s call him Mike), messaged me offering really good solid advice. We soon got to talking and I learned that he was in his late twenties, now I was 17 but I didn’t mind because it was just simple talk, nothing serious and I didn’t share any of my personal information (also consent where I am is 16). After about 2 weeks to about a month it progressed and we became friends. At this point Mike knew my age and we were on a first name basis. At some point in between that time I had started to really like Mike and got a crush on him. Now I want to make it clear that he had made no advances towards me, he fully acknowledged my age and knew boundaries, telling me not to even share any personal info. As we talked more I told him I liked him and he actually said he had some feelings for me to. I know what you’re thinking, but please read on. We acknowledged that we liked the other but we just continued to talk as friends. At the end of month 2 it was pretty much full blown flirting and everything. You could even say dating but we didn’t want to put that label on it because I was underage. I fell really hard, and although he lived miles away from me I truly did like him. We’d facetime, snapchat and text all the time. We even talked about actually meeting once I turned 18. He was probably the only light in my life at that point. I had no friends or a good relationship with my family. I was truly happy and he made me happy.

At about month 3 my mom walked into my room at 2 am because my light was still on and heard me on facetime with someone. She demanded to know who I was talking to, took my phone (the moment she walked into the room I ended the call so he didn’t hear anything). \*read added part\*

\*Now please listen to me, the next part I totally did on my own, in hindsight it was the worst thing to do but please don’t blame it on him. As most relationships go, sexual stuff begins, it mostly began with me. That was a bad idea, but I guess I couldn’t help myself. I didn’t send actual nudes but I did send teases of me in underwear, and then slowly topless but nipples covered. I only sent the ‘topless’ ones for about one week until this event of my mom walking in on me on facetime. Now a detail that you have to know for the rest of the story is that I didn’t have a shirt on (I did have a bra) so she obviously as my mom went berserk.

She read through all my texts because in an effort to create a better relationship I gave her the password to my phone. The next few days after that night were hard, she gave me the cold shoulder and didn’t bring up the topic at all. That was until about 4 days later when she still had my phone in her possession, checked it, and saw that I was talking to Mike (my laptop and phone are connected). That is when she first blew up and told me that what I was doing was wrong and why in the world would I like someone who I didn’t even know. She also knew from the texts that Mike had a job because I’d regularly tell him to have a good day at work. From that she concluded that he was older. I had the lecture of ‘what are you doing, why would you do this, who is he? There is no reason you should be talking to someone like that etc’. But I didn’t listen. I loved Mike and he was my happiness, I couldn’t bear to just let him go. So I continued to talk to him behind my mom’s back. We'd message on my phone and I’d delete the texts or on reddit, something she doesn’t have access to. This went on for about 1-2 weeks, until today. Today I came home from school and she sat me down and gave me another lecture as she found out I was still talking to him. Now she had the full scope of things. She knew that he was in his 20s, that we liked each other, and that I had sent him lewd pictures. She went on about how he is using me, he’s a pervert, I'm breaking the law and that he doesn’t actually like me, it's just an act and that I have no self respect. She wants me to remove his entire presence from my life because my father currently has a very serious heart condition and any stress could cause a heart attack (or sudden death) and him learning about this would surely put him in bad shape.

Now I know, I truly fully know that the relationship is wrong, what happened in this relationship was wrong, we could have waited until I was fully 18. I know that I have to choose but I am finding this decision unbearably difficult. I do not want to lose Mike from my life as he is the only outlet or happiness I have left. What do I do? I realize we can’t have the same relationship that was going on for the past 3-4 months but I also can’t lose Mike from my life, and on the other hand I have to actually think about my family.

Any advice would be appreciated, and also without judgement. I realize the wrong stuff that has happened. (also ask if you need any clarity on certain parts, I wrote this in a rush)",05Oct2020,1
874,"Hi everyone,

I have always been an overachiever in an academic context. I graduated with near perfect grades in both high school and college (I graduated this past spring with a biochemistry degree). I decided to attend dental school, particularly an accelerated program in which I will finish a year early. I just finished by first quarter, and I got a 2.7 GPA, my grades have never been this low in my life.

We take both lecture and preclinical courses (drilling plastic teeth and sculpting teeth out of wax). I got a C in the waxing/indirect vision course (the main focus of this course is to work on crowns). I got a D in the drilling course (fillings). The reason I got a D was because I failed the last practical, which was worth a majority of the grade this quarter. Aside from these poor grades, I got As and Bs in the lectures. Lab is definitely tough because it's a new skill, and one factor to consider about these grades: they are all interim. I can improve my grades until the end of the academic year, which is when everything is finalized. So, if I bust my butt, I can pull my lab grades up to As, or Bs in the worst case scenario. Some of the battle is just developing the skills, and I have been practicing diligently over the break we just had last week, and I think I improved a lot even in that short span of time.

I was just seeking advice on how to keep pushing forward and not give up, I've always aspired to enter the dental field. Dental school is hard, and I sort of felt I wasn't cut out for the field based on my performance in the beginning. I would like to improve, but I feel somewhat discouraged because I have some steep learning curves to overcome. I forgot to mention, I will be remediating the lab I got a D in, which is basically extra practice time (this is a bonus because we have limited lab time during the week b/c of COVID).

My back-up career is to be a PhD in biochemistry since I love research, but this is a longer schooling and does not guarantee the financial stability dental school does. Those are two factors that are holding me back from leaving dental school.

Anyone have any words of wisdom/advice? Thank you so much!",05Oct2020,1

877,"Sorry for the generic title. Throwaway account since my main has a recognizable username. 

Content warning for mentions of incest. 

Yesterday, a very close friend of mine and I got into it online over two characters in media that I’d mentioned I was uncomfortable seeing art of doing romantic/suggestive things, because they were adoptive siblings. The friend in question threw a “well, actually,” at me, and started telling me that it wasn’t as bad as “blood” incest, and implied it was better. 

This shocked me, and I told him plainly that if this was something he was going to defend, that I didn’t want to be talking to him anymore. He took it into Discord DMs and when I’d told him that it seemed like he was defending it, suddenly he backpedaled, telling me I was putting words in his mouth and making false assumptions. He’s done something similar before - which, that time, had left me crying alone while he berated me - and I felt lost and confused. The next thing he said was, quote, “Stop putting words in my mouth and be the good friend I make you out to be.” 

This was my breaking point. I snapped on him, telling him that he was doing all of this to defend his stance on *incest*, and that I was tired of his manipulative behavior and constant gaslighting. I ended my last message to him saying, “Don’t talk to me until you can fix your behavior.” then blocked him on all social media - besides Discord - and haven’t heard anything back. 

The problem is, I don’t have a lot of close friends. He and I were part of a close-knit group of only 2 other people, and I had to leave all of that behind. Now, Im stuck with the realization that I’m totally alone all of a sudden, with nobody to say good morning to and hop on a game with, and it’s killing me. 

Part of me wants to reach out to him and see if anything can be done - if there’s any way I can get him to see how much that behavior hurts me, as someone who recently left a household full of it, and if I can help him fix it. The other part of me feels as though I’m justified, and shouldn’t be trying to fix our friendship all the time. 

What should I do? Should I wait a few days, and come back and see how he feels? Should I reach out right now and try to talk it out? Should I just drop him completely and try to move on? I’m at a loss.",05Oct2020,1

MmThis guy and I have been friends for a while. He’s a shy type of guy. We get on pretty well and have the same humour.

He came back twice more so the last time I took him back to his ""home"" they said I could keep him if I wanted. They said he had gotten their dog pregnant and they couldn't afford the upkeep of so many animals.

I was elated but he would need a lot of help. I got his allergies under control, neutered him, got him a flea collar, up to date on shots, heartworm test and prevention, chipped...the whole nine yards. 

I did all this thinking I would foster him until he was ready to go to a great home. But I got attached.
I think he's attached also.

We've had our differences for sure. He's torn up the couch, tried to eat my cat, run away chasing after animals, chewed up countless shoes and toys, cut his leg open because he jumped on the counter and broke a glass.......

Me and my husband have finally come to the conclusion that we may not be the best home for him so I am surrendering him to a no kill shelter and paying the 100.00 fee for being out of state.

I am currently dating a man who lives an hour and a half away from me and driving to his place requires driving on the highway.

This weekend he really wants me to drive down there to hang out at his place and its giving me so much anxiety!

891,"Sorry this is long. Since I can’t tell my family any of this I’ll talk some strangers on Reddit. 

Context: I (34f) grew up in a westernised/Asian family dictated by my (now diseased) paternal grandmother. She was a narcissistic and manipulative person who took out her depression, anger and bitterness on her family. My grandmother had 2 sons my dad, the eldest, and my uncle. My dad was the favourite because he was the eldest and my uncle was conditioned to be submissive to my dad in every aspect of their life. My sister(36) and I were brought up the same. In this dynamic, the elder child has the crippling responsibility for themselves and their younger sibling to be perfect in every way or be punished. The younger sibling is left always being wrong. Any success the elder achieves is lorded over the younger. Any success the younger achieves is treated as a failure because it shows the elder sibling up and so both are punished. This behaviour is carried on through adulthood. As a result it’s almost impossible for the siblings have a healthy loving relationship when they’ve been deliberately pitted against each other their whole lives. 

My grandmother particularly preyed on my mother who is now in her 60s and a shell of herself after the years of psychological torture from her MIL. My father never stood up against his mother for his wife. My sister and I grew up surrounded by angry, mean and manipulative adults. I have struggled with depression my entire life because of the way our family functions. I started having suicidal ideations at 6 or 7. As an adult I’ve rallied against my upbringing and found a supportive husband who cares about my mental health and building a nurturing and communicative family for our son. 

I’ve watched my sister marry into exactly the same type of family as ours and she moved to the other side of the world for her husband. I never thought much on this because so many people do recreate their parents’ relationship for better or worse. However 7 years and 2 children (8f &amp; 5m) later it’s very clear my sister is raising her children in the same toxic way we were raised. It breaks my heart. 

One night 1am (my time) last June 2019 my sister called me. She never calls me so I knew it was serious. 

Her husband had just been taken away by the police for abusing her. My BIL has been physically abusing my sister for the entirety of their second child’s life. He started hitting their son when he was 4. His family are prone to screaming matches that can involve fire arms being pulled. My sister swore me to secrecy until she could get her and her children safely back to our country. She asked me to find out as much information as I could. She wanted to be in our country by August/September 2019. She put me in touch with one of her friends so we could safely communicate. 

I called everyone I could think of Government departments, Consulates, friends in neighbouring countries close to her so she could use them as emergency safe houses, and I found her a lawyer who specialises in international domestic abuse family cases. I researched “fleeing to safety” clause in The Hague convention so she wouldn’t lose the children. (The law of the country she’s in isn’t geared well to help domestic abuse victims fleeing the family home.) My husband was ready to buy plane tickets for her and the children. We amped up our first home buying in a desperate hunt from a 2 bedroom house to 4 bedroom house so we could house her and the kids. My husband suffered stress migraines that presented as strokes from the pressure suddenly put on him. 

Through all of this I could not tell our family. 

By October 2019 my sister stopped talking to me. Her friend ceased communicating. By Christmas my sister emailed me saying everything is fine, she feels nothing for our family and never intends on coming back to our country. I am never to tell our parents. She dumped this on me in a moment of weakness and because she knew I could take it. Anyway, I have a nice husband to look after me. 

She continues sparse communications with our parents, enough that they think she’s just busy being a good mum and wife. They were due to visit my sister for my nephew’s 5th birthday but COVID and my dad’s failing health stopped that. My parents love my sister so much. They spend hundred every year sending care packages, gifts and money to my sister. They have kept her bedroom exactly as she left it when she moved out of home 15 years ago. 

I’m in this awful limbo of knowing my sister’s life is dangerously miserable and I’m helpless to do anything. Watching my ageing parents’ unhealthy marriage is a daily reminder of my sisters future if she lives that long.

She and I have never seen eye to eye. We are chalk and cheese in every way but I would do anything for her. I would rather she was in my life making it a living hell than this awful not knowing if one day we’re going to get the call that my BIL has killed her or one of the kids.

897,"Hey guys, so during 2020 I've drank more and smoked more, I've done more drugs in general than I ever have. I haven't done a lot of drugs but I kinda went from not doing any to trying some out of no where. Anyways, that part of me is pretty much hidden from everyone except my bf and a few friends. I'm 20 yrs old and considering that I legally cannot buy anything even if it were legal I kind of want to back off of it. Take a break. My bf and friends are asking me to also. I've had a few cigs here and there to help me cope with not having weed and I liked them. I've also heard other people say that's their alternative usually when they have to take breaks for drug tests and etc. My issue is that I can't get anyone to buy me a pack and legal age was increased to 21 unfortunately. I feel like 20 yr olds should've been grandfathered or something. Usually to get anyone to buy for me I have to sit through a lecture or being guilt tripped. I really don't want a lecture about how bad they are or how bad of a habit they are to start. I've asked a few strangers while just out and I've tried just walking in gas stations hoping to not be ID but it hasn't worked out.

898," Context (My main language is Spanish so sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes): I'm in 11th grade, this has been going on for like 2 years. The school has changed the grading system. Now, instead of being from 0-100%, it is from 1-4. They say ""parents shouldn't care about the numbers (grades), they should care about the learning that is going on"". It seems good spirited but it is really dumb considering the amount of money parents have to pay for us to go to that school and how ""learning"" is supposed to happen. They want us to start at a 1 and grow to a 4, but every teacher has been doing it their own way and it is just confusing. The last grade in a specific skill will NOT AVERAGE, it will REPLACE the other grades for that skill.

I have never really been top of my generation. Even though I have the potential, I do enjoy spending time doing other things that aren't related to school, what is bothering me right now is that I've realized that I'm one of the few people that has refrained from cheating. The people who have been cheating are also top of the generation. Teachers never doubt them or give them any trouble. I'm writing this post today because I'm fed up with how teachers have been treating me. For some reason I'm getting enough homework to not have time to enjoy my hobbies. I've been having to do all the team work assignments (graded) alone because my classmates don't care what they get right now, as they can replace it at the end of the semester by cheating and since we are in corona season, they just ghost my calls and messages. It would take a long time to explain the whole extent of my problem, but to make it short; teachers keep sending emails to my parents about how I am not doing my work, yet no one has really been doing it, everything people hand in is basically copy pasted or a blank document. My parents are mad at me for having my lowest grade at 1.9 (to pass you need at least a 2.2) yet before the stupid system change I was always high 80s or low 90s. I'm tired of acting like it is my fault when it is clearly the amount of cheating that gives teachers the impression that we can handle this workload, and the grading system which is ineffective and interpreted a different way by each teacher. I'm getting low grades on my two AP (chem and physics 2) because I DON'T HAVE TIME TO STUDY. With all the homework other classes send, I would need to either cheat or enjoy suffering in order to succeed.

This situation seems like a really bad joke. What can I even do to fix it? there is very few of us that don't cheat, and even then, some of them got lucky with more relaxed teachers. I really feel alone on this one and I doubt they'll take me seriously if I try to talk to them. Last time I did, my teacher told me that I should've reached out sooner, and that it was too late. I had to do a 3 person project by myself, and she just graded it at a 1, sent an email home, got me in trouble, and never talked to me about it. Recently I've lost all respect for these teachers, they just like they want to watch me suffer. I'm doing my best and it isn't enough. Would cheating be unreasonable at this point?",05Oct2020,1

I meet this guy and we're getting along super well. I ask him whether or not he wants a drink, and he says yes. So I take him back to my accomodation, we talk a lot about music and we just genuinely have a good time. I joked around and we just decided that we'd be each others ""gay best friends"". That's what I introduced him as to my flat, who said hi. We then go into my room and listen to some music and talk about really deep things. i was drunk but I remember most of it, omitting certain details. Honestly, I thought I finally had met a friend. He kisses me and I'm taken back. I say no, he continues. Long story short, he tried things on me and I froze. I just let it happen but kept saying no, whilst he was telling me to ""let go"". i used every single excuse in the book. i think part of him thought i was maybe playing hard to get, but i wasn't.

909,"Very long story, TL:DR at the bottom.

Here is some background:

There are 3 people living here, Me (Male), Tony (M), Winter (F) We are all in our early-mid 20’s. (Obvious no real names used)

Tony and Winter have been together for nearly two years before we all moved in together, I’ve been friends with Tony since our teens and i met Winter through Tony and a bit more before we moved in together. They lived at Tonys parents house (and Tonys room is/was a mess for years)

When i did the dishwasher a couple of months in, Winter had stopped me about 4 times because of me “not putting things in the correct places” or because she “just wanted to do them”, so i thought sure, i didn’t think i was getting them in the wrong places because it is pretty hard to do that when you know where everything goes.

So after a couple more times of doing it, i stopped putting things in and out of the dishwasher because it just seemed like Winter was unhappy with how i was doing it.

Covid happened and Winter and Tony became furloughed (not having to work, and getting paid 80% of their monthly wages), this was rad for them and i was jealous about it because there were a lot of things i would be doing in my time instead of working.

Tony would spend most of his time gaming, Winter would be reading, podcasts, all of that stuff while i worked 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.

Suddenly my dishes were being left on the side, no warning, no indication, so i thought this was an accident so i put my dishes in the dishwasher for the next cycle.

Same thing happens a few days later, my dishes and cutlery is being left to the side, so i knew something was going on, so mid-cycle of dishwasher i had put my bits in (there was loads of room, i fit the cutlery in easy as moved 1 or 2 things and got all my dishes in, job done).

This happened one more time and i then confronted Winter to let me know when she is next doing the dishes so i can put my stuff in (as i know that Tony either doesn’t clean the place because we joke about him not knowing how to use a vacuum or he just does it whenever I’m not home, which is strange as we’ve lived together for nearly a year).

She apologised and said she was distracted on a phone call, so i thought no biggie, could have been an accident but i was still suspicious because i was in the other room when this happened, but mistakes happen.

This happened a couple more times and more often when i was out at work, so if i saw the washer was on and my stuff was out, i would either put it in or restart the wash and throw my things in. One time i had clearly just done it before she walked in and she said that she was going to put my stuff in for the next wash because there wasn’t a lot of room (again all of my cutlery had a tonne of room and dishes fit with 1 or two movements).

This eventually led me to just helping out with the dishes (she has not confronted me to do this but there was a clear element that she had had enough), i put their things away perfectly where they go, i find all my cutlery in one slot just dumped there (this still continues).

My friend Luke (not real name) visits every now or then and Winter has also befriended him and they sometimes talk in a different room together, 9/10 their conversation includes with Winter telling Luke that I’m messy, i don’t clean up and my stuff is everywhere.

Every time Luke tells me this, i feel a betray of trust from Winter because she hasn’t confronted or mentioned anything to me and i show Luke all the things Tony or Winter have left around the house (i.e my tools they used and then left on the floor (even though they haven’t asked to use them and they were originally on my shelf), bags of random things and empty cardboard packages left in places that are considered to be used by guests like the living-room and such).

Today I’ve had enough because as of recent i have been doing the dishes frequently and especially as my gf had come to stay for a couple of days during the week, we had cleaned up after ourselves and the one thing i have left is a full bin in the living room which i will be sorting out soon when i have time.

I don’t believe Tony cleans up much as when Winter left for holiday, he wanted to do his own dishes separate to mine and we agreed and did the “chore list” Winter had given us to do before she came back in 2 weeks time, so we cleaned everything up in two hours before she was back.

TL:DR

Girl in a couple didn’t want me to do dishes, i stopped, she stopped doing my dishes during her furlough so i started doing them again and now my stuff is dumped in my slots, her bf doesn’t clean up (from what I’ve seen of living here for a year), Girl slags me off to my friend that i dont clean, my friend tells me and it’s infuriating and i can’t say anything to Girl without breaking my friends trust with her. Guy with girl hasn’t made any comments at all.
I will admit i don’t mop floors and vacuum but i don’t see the need to do it as frequently as girl does it but she hasn’t asked or let me know that she wants me to do it, she just does it, and i haven’t seen guy (girls bf) do it.. at all)

What do i do? Advice please?

913,"I learned a horrifying family secret a few months ago that shook me to my core. My mother told me that her father (my grandfather) had sexually abused her as a child, which included her being raped by him. My grandmother knew about this and did nothing to report it. He apparently sought ""religious counseling"" for this later in life, but it was always a closely guarded family secret.

Despite moving far away from home, my mother has continued to keep a close relationship with both her parents, including annual trips to see them and daily or weekly phone calls. Throughout my childhood, she encouraged me to be close to my grandparents and I developed a close friendship with my grandfather as a result, mainly through letters. I never thought they were anything other than normal grandparents for over 23 years.

It was devastating to find out that my grandfather had committed what I regard to be an unforgivable act. It was just as unthinkable to me that my mother would encourage me to have a friendly close relationship with the man who raped his own daughter. My mother is a complicated woman who is deeply tied to her Christian faith. She believes that God has changed her father and that she has forgiven him for what he did to her. She also believes that he has never repeated his ""sin.""

Since she told me this, I have not written nor communicated with my grandfather. I have refused to open his letters and even answer the phone. He doesn't know that I know, so for him it is as if I have just abruptly gone silent for several months. A few days ago, he sent me a letter expressing confusion and sadness about why I suddenly went radio silent. He asked me to tell him why, that he deserved an explanation. I drafted a letter explaining why and that I found his past sins to be unforgivable and could not maintain any relationship with him in the future. I did not send this letter, though.

My grandfather's health is declining and we believe his illness is terminal. My mother is planning on visiting him in the next few weeks to take care of him with my grandmother. He is in great pain and at multiple times in the last few years he has expressed a desire to commit suicide. I worry that if I sent that letter, it might push him over the edge to know his previously ""favorite granddaughter"" regards him as a monster. I do not know if I could live with the thought that I pushed another human being into suicide. Moreover, I do not want to add to my mother's trauma in causing her to face the suicide of a parent, regardless of how remote the possibility is.

Yet I know that my silence is causing him pain now. A part of me believes our past closeness merits an explanation, that he deserves to know why. My mother wants me to forgive him like she did and pretend it never happened. I feel like that is impossible. I cannot turn a blind eye to something that horrible. I have currently opted to do nothing. I feel like continuing the silence would bring less pain to my entire family than sending the letter while also acknowledging the horror of the past.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I just want to know what my moral obligation is. What is the ethical thing to do? Do I tell the truth, even if it tears apart an entire family and possibly harms my mother even further? Or do I practice ""Christian forgiveness"" and bring comfort to someone who is dying? Or do I keep silent as a compromise?

919,"I (24f) just started working with someone new (45f) a few months ago. We work right next to each other and pretty much talk all day. She is fairly nice, but she tends to say things that make me feel really bad about myself. I am fully aware that this is a me problem and, yes, I am in therapy. 

She basically has this “shtick” when any semi-attractive man that comes into the office where she has to make a somewhat pervy comment. I totally understand that this is a joke, but after the first 100 times it starts to get old. It’s just superficial and shallow. 

She will always comment on my other coworkers appearances and tell them how pretty they are (even if they aren’t). She has never said anything nice about me, appearance or otherwise. Today, one of my other coworkers was showing us a picture of her younger sister and she decided to say “oh you’re way prettier than her” (they were bother equally as pretty). I told her that she shouldn’t say things like that and she said it was a compliment to our other coworker. I just thought that comment was out of line, and these are the kind of things she says on a daily basis. 

I know that everyone is entitled to say what they want, but for me, spending all day long with someone who is so shallow really hurts me. I am trying hard to overcome my insecurities and I feel like this is not helpful for me.

But she told me she had issues finding working due to her not having work experience. But she's fine with me being that in situation that she was in. 

I don't know why she's doing this to me, why she won't let me work and why she's going out of her way to convince me otherwise. 

She gets into my head so quickly I feel guilt even looking for work and I end up giving. I am university I have student loans and savings from my gran gran.

923,"My little brother has been playing a certain video game for years, and recently got scammed out of everything he’d earned. His friends (in-game) told him to put his login information into an external website so he could get free stuff, which he then did. He woke up this morning to every one of his items gone, and was understandably distraught. His items included both things he’d spent real money on (~$150) and stuff he’d worked for over the years he’d played the game.

I know it’s something stupid that doesn’t matter in the long run, but I’d listened to him talk about this game enthusiastically for many many hours over the years, and it fucking breaks my heart to see him so depressed over something. Is there anything I can do to help him feel better?",05Oct2020,1

To add on my mother got very angry at me saying “it’s not just my universe and I need to help out, I have no idea what hats going on and how bad things are and I should want to help.” I told her I will but the deal was I was going to save up and buy my own car..I can’t do that if I’m paying for other things for them...

925,So my story is kind of strange but I'm going to put a disclaimer if it makes you uncomfortable (It's about minors having sex) I was 6 years old and I was at one of my mother's friend's house they were babysitting me and my sister until our dad came back to pick us up. The person they had a son and that son had a friend. This friend went up to me and somehow convinced me to do something that 6-year-olds shouldn't even know about. The thing is I said yes to it because I thought it was normal. I didn't know that it was wrong. So every day I'm stuck reliving the whole experience in my brain and wondering is it my fault? I said yes and I agreed to do it. I just can't help but feel dirty whenever I think about it. I'm 14 now and honestly it's something that I keep bottled up because I have no one to talk to about it. Was it really my fault? Help me please.,05Oct2020,1

I generally just feel awful always. No energy everything is a huge effort from brushing my teeth to going to school. I dread going to school even though i try to pretend like i dont. I hang out with my fam a lot but i feel like im not super close with them and i put a wall up. I just feel fake and like i dont know myself. I just try to appear cool to people to make up for the fact that i cant talk to anyone idk. I don’t really have friends but i dont even think i want any because i get so scared to talk to someone i cant do it. I basically just gave up and now im lonely but im kind of used to it.

I used to look forward to having a bf but had a bad experience now im sad and bitter and i feel like i cant talk to a guy again. Also i would prob be a bad gf anyway. I also see all this stuff about myself that i want to improve like selfishness and being self absorbed but idk what to do. I cant even talk to my own cousins who i think are awesome and we could be good friends and then id have someone to hang out with. Its not all bad im super grateful for the good things in my life i just feel terrible all the time mostly physically and emotionally i guess but otherwise things are ok.

Also theres this super big thing hanging over me that I have to do but cant make myself do so that really brings me down the most i would say.

Basically i just hate being alive. I know that sounds bad but i didnt even ask to be born and now i have to struggle and try to not be a garbage person.

Also i never really got over being uncomfortable in my own body its pretty constant and sucks and i just always feel gross and uncomfortable so thats great.

Also im taking 18 credits at school and its really a lot but i cant drop anything because i need all the classes.

933,"This year is my freshmen year in high school, we only recently started schooling again I think it's our 4th or 5th week back now, and I already am being buried in a mountain of homework and I can't do anything anymore but homework or scouting and its already caused multiple mental breakdowns and I feel like whenever I try to talk about it no-one listens or adds anything of the positive note to the situation. in the next few paragraphs I'm going to try and summarize what I have been going through so I can get more effective advice.  


First I should probably tell you about myself as well as I can, I'm very extroverted, I usually try to help others out before myself, I enjoy swimming, spending time with fam, gaming, computers, game development, Vr,  I don't like writing much but from what I have heard I'm good at it, and I'm a male. My dad is the scoutmaster of my troop which can cause issues with our relationship at times but generally, I get along with him well and he's a good dad. My mom and I get along well also.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the problem, school. Usually, I do well in school and this year I decided I was going to push myself harder and get all A's. Everything was going well until the third week when I found out that the people who made my schedule screwed up for the second time. The first time wasn't an issue because that happened before school started so I thought everything was fixed. The second time was three weeks in and they messed up and gave me finance instead of bio by accident. I thought this would be fine until I found out they also switched my ELA teacher as well which messed literally everything up for me. I now have to redo assignments I already did and have to write a 10-page essay by the 12th which is as late as It can get in. This would not be an issue but every other class has given me HW that is a 1hr+ per class, every day I've been working from 7:45 am to about 9 pm every day, on top of that I have campouts almost every other weekend, and chores. I have been trying to talk to people for about two weeks now and no one seems to listen or I'm doing a bad job explaining my situation. I always get responses that either doesn't help much, people saying to do my work (even though I am), told to get back to it when I take 15-minute breaks, or people saying it only gets worse and nothing that actually helps, or at the least makes me feel better. Sorry if it got ranty.

934,"I came here to ask for advice regarding my mental state. I’m currently in my junior year of highschool and I can’t recognise myself anymore. When I was in middle school, I was at the top of my class, I would always get tons of praises on my memory and I was even known to be able do memorise things quickly (I was in the drama club, so maybe learning lots of lines everyday helped keeping my memory trained). I’m from Italy, after middle school we are supposed to choose whether we want to pursue a more intense course of study, which means you’d then have to go to to university, or enroll in a specific school that prepares you for a specific job, so that when you graduate, at 19, you can start working right away. I chose to attend a school centered around humanities (subjects such as ancient greek and latin) and I embarked on what soon revealed itself to be a very rocky journey. Right from the beginning I had problems adjusting to the new environment of competition, which, prior to that, I hadn’t really encountered at all. I started getting lower grades than what I used to get in middle school, and I started feeling more and more demoralised. As the years went by, I started being more and more distracted, soon losing my skill to memorise everything fairly quickly. For example, if I am reading an extract, I’ll probably forget 80% of what I read as soon as the last word comes by. To study, I need to write everything over and over and over again until I can remember most of the topic, whilst before I could just read a couple times what I had to memorise and I would have it all perfectly clear in my mind. During a lecture, I have to take notes of absolutely everything the lecturer says, otherwise I’m not going to remember anything they said, when I’ll eventually have to study that specific topic. Even when I talk to others, if someone tells me something that I need to remember or maybe an interesting fact that I would probably love to add to my current knowledge, I’m not going to remember anything that I don’t write down. I really don’t understand what’s wrong with my brain, and quite honestly it has affected my self-esteem as well. I’m not as smart as I used to be, and that is making me realise that I don’t recognise myself anymore. 
Thanks to everyone who took the time to read my help request. I truly hope someone can relate to my story and -maybe- have some piece of advice to give me.",05Oct2020,1

Also, he has never wanted to go anywhere so I'm certain it has nothing to do with COVID either.

I have asked numerous times, and he always just pushes it forward, or passes. If I thought I was being pushed away, I'd have given up but we talk a lot, and we're best friends. I'm guessing that if I ask too much, he'll say yes, but not really want to.

He is one of the nicest guys I know, and we're really good friends. All I ever wanted was a good friend and he's lovely, but I wish we'd go out and do stuff. I can't tell what is wrong, and I just wish I had someone just as eager to see me, as I am to see them. It's night right now, but yesterday I was going to go and surprise him at the college (because I know he's going for a project), which is a 2 hour train ride away, and pass it off as me going in to study.

949," I have a college degree but I've only ever worked in restaurants, some management experience but mostly just as waitstaff.

I hate my current city, New York and August marked the 11th year Ive lived here.

Since COVID Ive been unemployed from restaurants. And living on unemployment. With the lack of available waiting jobs Ive been trying to break into the corporate world. Ive been applying to jobs since April. In July I decided I hated New York (I do) and I would leave and go to California. Partly this decision was made because I know inevitably unemployment will run out just as winter (and covid) will be raging. 

I also just love SoCal so despite my unemployed, single status I was optimistic about my future when I decided to move when my lease runs out November 1st. 

On October 1st I did a hail mary. I even thought as I applied for the job that \*this\* would be the one I got a call back on. So of course I got a call back my first one since March. Then I got the call back for the second interview, then I got the job.

It feels good to be in a corporate setting, dressed professionally, using my education but something about this job seems off. The 'corporate setting' Im talking about is more like a warehouse with graffiti art on the wall. The job isn't even in New York its in Hoboken. That was fine I thought because well I lived in Hoboken for years, with my ex. 

For those who dont know Hoboken is a horribly densely packed neighborhood across the water from NYC filled with lots of unsavory characters - think Chads. its almost impossible to not run into everyone I know when in Hoboken. 

That was one red flag that is purely an emotional one, I cant stop crying since the interviews began because being in Hoboken brings up so much. 

Other red flags 

\- the interviewer asked me to define 'outsourcing' I believe its because its actually an outsourced sales job. 

\- they call themselves a 'marketing firm' but its 'business to business sales' 

\- they claim to represent fortune 100 companies in their offices, they only have 3 offices, my ""perspective"" office only represents an online company that sells discount office supplies.",05Oct2020,1

I pay for all of my expenses except insurance and phone bill and have been fairly responsible with my money so far. The thing is I don’t really make a profit each month. I always have enough to pay my rent and usually about $500-$700 extra. I have a few grand in savings that I haven’t been adding to. My parents are divorced and are in good positions in life they’ve agreed to help me if I ever need help paying for anything but that’s never really the case. They also talked about gifting me money every month but they haven’t done it since my first month on my own (which I don’t mind at all I really don’t need them to do this). I feel bad even thinking about this when I don’t really need the money. I’m in a position though where I can’t make much more money until I make a job transition in November. However, I want to buy a few things without having to worry about possibly digging into my savings. Is this a little bit entitled of me or should I ask them for money?",05Oct2020,1

959,"I (M) met my best friend (F) in college back in 2013. She had a boyfriend, I had a girlfriend, so our relationship was purely friendship. Both of us broke up with our respective significant others in 2018, and through 2019 our friendship became much closer, and I started to develop feelings for her.

Halfway through 2019, in September, she moved to another city to study a masters degree. She came back in August this year, and since then I've spent a hell lot of time with her, roadtrip included. And spending so much time together has confirmed what I already knew: that I am indeed in love with her. She makes me feel special and brings out the best version of myself.

Buuuuuut... I don't find the courage to ask her out.

Everything I do in my life, I do it with absolute confidence. But when it comes to her, I feel like a coward. An absolute and total coward. And my inability to confess my feelings for her stresses me more than it should. I feel useless, I feel like I'm failing myself. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's starting to affect me psychologically.

So... While she brings out my best ""me"", my feelings for her bring out my worst ""me"". I either find the courage to tell her how much I love her or I'm gonna have to let our friendship go before I go deeper into this hole.

Obviously, option B is total bullshit, so how do I find a way to overcome those psychological barriers that won't let me tell her that I love her?",05Oct2020,1

I have been doing the very minimum. I am trying to get back to it before it is too late, but I can’t concentrate, and when I do get myself to read my own project and what I had done before, it’s like someone else wrote it and I just don’t like it. It's not like I can just change it since it's been already approved by my academic committee, and the field work is halfway.

I feel so guilty for not being able to be more productive… I have a full scholarship in the best private University in my country plus a grant to maintain myself and my family -I am not the main provider though… and I also feel like I am not delivering the best care and education for my kid. He’s been so irritable lately, and I know he only want my husband and I to be with him and pay attention to him.

My husband is nothing but understanding. I know he’s doing his best to be around and be involved while working from home… we’ve tried different schedules, and nothing seems to work for me to get writing again.

 I've gone in my garden before to hang up my laundry to dry and 3 of my neighbours had their phones out filming me and my home and yes it was pointed dead at me I've also had one of my neighbours threaten my dog i hate it here and I feel trapped in my own home the area and neighbours are just awful but my home itself is nice and big for a first time home. One of my neighbours even tried to jump out of a window to off himself infort of my nieces age 8 and 11 and I had to call the cops and comfort 2 crying girls, needless to say this neighbourhood is pretty bad.

Anyway one of my neighbours let's call her Karen ( she's  self entitled enough to be one -_-).

so since I've first moved Karen has been selling the hard stuff and her buyers are 14 to 70 and it's all the time she sells and deals from her window and isn't decreet about it whatsoever tonight i told her and her buyer to shut up as my niece is sleeping and they just woke her up and they had a go at me telling my TV is always to loud (that's untrue but whatever) I said that I'm sick of her selling her crap and having her loud af buyers screaming and shooting up right outside my window/ on my doorstep and than closed my curtains ignoring them. 

anyway its been 1 to 2 hours and the guy is still screaming this time he's throwing rocks and yelling at another seller's house for more stuff and than when the seller didn't give him stuff he went back to Karen I'm so sick of this  and scared I'm autistic with brain damage so idk what to do I want to call the cops but I doubt they'd do anything as they have never helped me with anything else I've had problems with",05Oct2020,1

963,"Backstory:
I was living in Texas at the time (this is in 2013) and I created a Facebook trying to reconnect with friends I knew since elementary school and middle school. I decided it wanted to move back because I was rebuilding connections and I had most of my family there. So I posted an ad on Craigslist looking for a roommate. 
I found one and I didn’t care about who the person was as I just liked the listing and all I could think about was being back “home” so I told the guy I wanted to live there until I find another place. He agreed.
Well this was the worst idea ever. The first week I caught him staring at me while I was sleeping after work one day. I confronted him about it and I asked are you sexually attracted to me or something!? I do not appreciate you staring at me while I sleep he said “about that I have demons in me that take over my body and I didn’t realize I was doing it” at that moment I thought “I’m going to die at this mans hands! I had told everyone I knew about the situation they obviously told me to get out of there so I took their advice and planned my move out. Well as I’m moving I was in the living room collecting a few items of mine and saw a dvd on the shelf. It looked like one of those burned disk type things and on the front of it were posted images of people having sex with animals! It was straight beastiality porn. The man had two dogs he kept in his room too!!! I ran out and never returned! To this day I feel like it was illegal and I should have reported it. So I’m asking for advice on what I should do.

I think I first realized I like girls was in my freshman year when I was suddenly attracted to a friend of mine. Since then I’ve realized that Im pretty sure I’m bisexual because I’ve been interested in both men and women. My only problem is the fact that I’ve never been in a real relationship. I’ve only had one boyfriend who I considered more of a beat friend than my boyfriend.

My family has always been really supportive of my sibling and I but I’m just so nervous to come out. When I tried to talk about my feelings in my freshman year my mom told me that it was ok to figure things out but that I maybe was just too young to really have any interest in dating. I haven’t brought the subject up again. A couple years ago my cousin came out as bi and my extended family seemed really supportive of him, but they make jokes about it that really rubs me the wrong way. I know my parents don’t agree with the jokes but they never say anything against them. I want to come out to my family but I’m insecure that they will think I’m just going through a phase since I’ve never really been in a relationship.

I’m also having a hard time coming out to my best friend. She’s the only friend I haven’t come out to. I know that she’s supportive of gay rights but I don’t want her to think the wrong impression of me. We’ve always been close and there are times where we cuddle during movies but I’ve never been attracted to her. But from an outside perspective I think it can give that impression.

Second off, I’m a teenager, so if this is normal someone please tell me.
Ok.
So ever since I can remember, my family has been bad to me. They used to hit me when I was bad. I developed (what I think is) bad anxiety. If there’s a problem, wether I caused it or no, I will run away. I’m a pathological liar because I just didn’t want to be hit when I was litte, I’d do anything to not make them mad. They’d call me stupid, yell at me, tell me I was a “surprise” (I’m the only reason they got married, my mom had told me that my dad is not the love of her life). 
I lie and I hit my brothers. I smack them I punch them. I’m just so angry. I will hit my autistic cousin (more on this later). I’m mad at everyone.
The only people/things I will be nice to are the animals, but recently the oldest chihuahua, the one That used to belong to grandpa before he died, passed away. She was around 17-18. I cried so much. She passed the day after my birthday. 

I feel like the quarantine is making this even worse. A few days into April (around 3 weeks after the start of quarantine here) I had left my books in my locker and hadn’t been doing homework. My mom found out, yelled at me really bad. She said that she didn’t want me anymore and to send me away. My dad did tell her to stop yelling but he’s a real doormat. I’ve always hated my mom.

I have no energy, all I want to do is sleep and listen to music and cry. Just lay down with my cat. I have one coping mechanism, and it’s just a personification of my good thoughts trying to motivate me. I used to feel butterflies listening to songs and reading. Now I just feel like I’m missing something. I don’t do homework, I know I should be. I’m in AP classes and I’m going to fail them all. I’ve tried to run away but stopped because of my friends.

984,"I (21m) went to school for two years to become an electrician. Just last month after I got my drivers license, I finally started looking to begin my apprenticeship and learn the actual trade, (because in school 90% of what I learned was just theory) and pretty quickly got hired at a small company in the town I live in.

It's a really small company, just me, my boss, the journeyman electrician, and the receptionist.

The two reasons I like this job are: it's close to home, the journeyman electrician I work with is very cool, and the pay is fair.

However, there is one problem: My boss very rarely has me actually working with the journeyman electrician. 90% of the time, he has me doing menial grunt work that has nothing to do with electricity, such as cleaning out his aircraft hangar, assembling ikea furniture for the office, repairing the steps of the deck in his backyard...

Now bear in mind, during the job interview, he did ask me if I was okay doing a little non-electrical, and I said that was fine because I assumed it would just be the odd job here and there. But it's the vast majority of what I'm doing at this job. I have only gotten to do actual electrician stuff twice, and I'm in my third week of working here.

In addition, these menial tasks he assigns me pile up, and I end up working on them for two or three hours past when my shift was supposed to end. He is also very rude about it. He's in his 80s, so a little grumpiness is understandable, but he is constantly saying demeaning things to me. He also gets very upset if I ask for more than a little clarification on the extremely vague instructions he gives me, then pins me with endless blame if I do it wrong.

On the one hand I want to quit and find other work; my current job feels demeaning, and I'm not improving as an electrician ***at all***. But on the other hand, the journeyman electrician I'm working under is really cool and great at teaching the trade, (on the off-chance I actually get to work with him) it's really close to my house, the pay is nice, and I feel the obligation to stick it out a bit longer, as I'm only in my third week with this company.

Theres a lot of things the left wants that im against to the extremes they want it but theres a lot of left policies im starting to agree with. Ive greatly relaxed my views on lgbqt and support their rights now, illegal immigration, and to an extent socialized Healthcare, and legalizing drugs. I still won't budge though as a 2nd amendment advocate. I prefer smaller government etc etc. Im 150% against racism but I will not start conflict with those who are and support free speech no matter how terrible it is. I think theres a massive problem with the police but do not think they should be defunded. You get the idea.

My conflict comes with im starting to find conservative politicians that represent some of the things I believe.....well I dont know how to say it in any other way without being insulting but....kinda dumb....I know this doesn't represent all conservatives but im finding it harder and harder to find educated conservatives even on things like social media who are willing to be a little reasonable. The conspiracy theories....I just cant...

I am someone that is easily affected by my environment.
For example, when I was a child and would walk through a department store, I remember feeling very euphoric. Clothes looked better, everyone was in thier own little world. 
Now when I walk through the same store I feel so empty. Interior aesthetics are more minimalistic, products or signs usually say something about social media. It's hard to put into words but that takes away mystery for me. 
I feel like I would have gotten along with people back then too. I don't like how everyone is so self aware and politically inclined nowadays. And whenever I meet someone I just assume they would have been better and less corrupted if they never used a smartphone.
