0," I(23F) live with my mom and stepdad. I never moved out and have tried to get myself together, but covid has put a stop to that. I am now living in the garage of the new house my parents bought recently, they pay for everything. Recently my mom decided to give me $200 a month for work around the house and child care.(Half goes into a savings account so I can have a good start when I feel ready to leave.) I have always done chores and looked after my brothers(one is severely specials needs), as well as chores here and there when asked. I can't work outside the home because i'm a caretaker for my brother.

 I was in my first semester in college and looking for work part time right as covid hit, and with my dyslexia I can't do so online. I have depression, anxiety, and other health issues, this has made motivation almost non existent, and I know I could be doing more. My mom also has mental and physical health problems, so she has told me to remind her every 2 weeks to give me the money. But I feel so guilty asking, so many people would wish to have it even half as good as I do, does anyone have an idea on who I can try to make it up to my parents and do more? I don't want to be entitled or greedy, so any advice would help, my therapist and I have tried things but i'm out of ideas.

 If anyone has more questions, please ask. I may be slow to answer, typing this out took 45 minutes and excessive spell check. But I will do my best to answer. Thanks to anyone reading.",20Dec2020,1
1,I had a thing for this girl in my school (would not go so far as to call it a crush) almost a year ago. Never talked to her once because Im an awkward f\*ck with a bad reputation at my school (had some mental health issues freshman year and acted out in strange ways). I eventually just forgot about it but for several months following that I have been finding myself randomly glancing around the room and without realizing it just looking at her. I don't do it consciously and as soon as I realize what I am doing I look away and get a weird feeling. I swear I do not do it on purpose. She has to have noticed and I feel bad that I am probably making her uncomfortable. Is there any point in trying to recover this situation or should I just leave it?,20Dec2020,1
2,"I’ve been living in a small town of about 1,000 people for pretty much my entire life. I’m not entirely sure why, but I honestly cannot imagine spending the rest of my life in this town. I just want some kind of change, I guess. I am about to graduate college, and I have enjoyed living in a big town and having access to all these stores, restaurants, and people. I know my parents and everyone I know in my town are going to be offended if I tell them I want to move to a city, especially considering that I am probably not going to be making much money even if I do move, and the cost of living in cities is way higher than it is here. So I will definitely be suffering trying to make it in a city compared with if I were to stay here. Would anyone happen to have any advice as to what I should do?",20Dec2020,1
3,My son has gotten detectives at our house a few times in the past when he was in his mid teens when he converted to the islamic religion and became radicalized. He had him undergo therapy and everything and it seemed to have went well. He later later on left the religion as a whole but went a c complete different direction. My son is quite a successful entrepreneur and he recently moved out a few months ago and he is on his own. A year ago he got into nazi ideology and he has purchased lots of white supremacist merchandise. His instagram page is quite scary and he has a large following. He posts pictures doing nazi salute wearing skull masks and army clothes. I really really dont know what to do anymore. Hes 19 and hes on his own. He has a girlfriend with the same mentality as him as well. I feel like i failed as a mother. Any advice would help dearly,20Dec2020,1

6,"My work history is basically:

2018 onwards - current industry job, part time so I’m trying to find full time positions in time for when I graduate in May

2017-2018 - first industry job (company closed hence why I worked there for a short amount of time)

2016-2018 - retail job while I finished high school

2014-2016 - first retail job as I started high school

When I’m applying for new industry jobs should I bother including this other work history? I feel like it’s good to show that I’ve been working for a long time but many of the relevant skills from my retail jobs (eg working with customers, checking invoices, being trusted with money) became skills in my industry job (working with clients, checking kit lists, being trusted with equipment).",20Dec2020,1
7,"Help, please! My county is on complete lockdown as are surrounding ones. Going to a hairdresser is not an option right now. 

Anyway, my 9 year old daughter mentioned needing a haircut. I'm not the best but, well, it's not like there's another option right now. And I think we're all going a bit stir crazy. 

So we get started, and she mentions wanting it longer in the front and short in the back. Kinda the kid version of the ""talk to the manager"" style. Ok. Things are going well, but then I do something, I'm not really sure, and the top layer is cut practically to her scalp and the whole thing is just jagged and horrible looking. 

She's not really mad at me, but she's upset and crying. I called some hair salons to see if maybe they weren't under the lockdown order, but they all are.

She is a good work friend and we get along well but she talks to me and other people in the store about her sex life too much and in far too much detail.

I unintentionally lost and ended things with said person because I thought I was being ghosted, when in fact they were being hospitalized due to attempted suicide.

13,"Unfortunately, my mom was diagnosed with cancer a few days back. The family tried to keep it a secret from me, but they didn't do a good job. To be frank, I have a lot of mixed emotions about this situation. Some background, I did not get along with her. Growing up, she was emotionally not there for me and was kinda abusive. She'd constantly compared me to my brother and threatened to kill me when I was a child. A lot of times, she'd say ""I wish your brother was here instead!"" or ""I should've gave you to your father."" Those were just the less painful ones, but it was really bad. She'd never consider my opinions and constantly yelled at me. She'd physically, verbally and emotionally abused me.

Now, she's gotten a lot nicer. At first, I thought this was one of her whims (she had so many ups and downs, it was very mentally draining). But it continued and I grew more suspicious. She'd started constantly calling me, and started to cook food for me (I live in a college dorm now, but my family visits). Her tempter used to flare a lot when we were in public, but now its gone. 

I don't know how to feel about this at all. I didn't expect her to be a perfect mother, but a decent one at least. I feel as if she only changed because she's scared of dying. I don't really know if I can forgive her for anything yet, but I'm really worried. This is similar to my father's situation.

When I was very young, my father was very warm and nice when sober, but different when drunk. He went into rehab for the best, but one night I chose to not stay by his side when he needed it the most. He went back to drinking, and soon later, he left permanently. I don't want to not be there for my mom, and her feeling so alone (i know how that feels). But, I can't bring myself to move on from the things she'd done.",20Dec2020,1

self-harm and suicidal thoughts



hi Reddit. I hate that I had to come here but I've been wracking my brain about it for a while. 

sorry for the format im on mobile. 

TL;DR: my internet friend is seriously worrying me and I don't know if I should seek help or stop being friends with them all together. this is a throwaway account and its very long so read if you want



my online friend is not just my friend, I've known them since I was about 12 now f(15) and we've been through a lot together. we lost contact with each other about two years ago but miraculously found each other again about 1 year ago.
I know this sounds weird but I'm starting to get worried for them again. when we first met we were both kids and we got along really well so we started to “online date” a few months after dating we lost contact and haven’t spoken to each other since. when we spoke back then, it seemed that he had some sort of split personality. some other background information is that we both had abusive childhoods and pretty sure we had some untreated trauma. when we spoke he would tell me that he would cut his wrists and suck the blood. this was very scary and traumatizing for me since I was still a kid but I never told him that. he would have these personas that would come out at random times. I know he wasn’t kidding because they would tell me how loud they would whisper and what they would tell him to do. afterward, he would have no recollection of it and continue the cycle. he would tell me how he would eat a human if he had the chance and what parts he would eat first. but the sad thing is that he was my only friend, and I liked him. he was there for me when I got home from school and he was there for me when I was finished getting screamed at. I loved his support but I don't know if it hurt me or affected me negatively. talking to him now he still hears the voices and I feel like he still has those personas. I don't want to leave him because I know he's a good person and maybe he needs me? if he does then I don't want to hurt him in any way. I think he's a great sweet person but I wouldn’t know if I would feel safe if I went to see him in IRL. I don't know if this is normal since it was my first relationship and one of my first friendships. what do I do? I cherish our friendship but I don't know if I should take it anymore.",20Dec2020,1
19,"Am i falling out of love??

i’ve been dating my boyfriend for about 8 months,, were both teenagers, although he’s turning 20 soon. i’m a bit younger but nothing illegal in my country/province. In the beginning it was so magical like the whole “crush/talking” stage, we would call every night, i was so obsessed with him, all the butterflies yknow. But even after the 3rd or 4th month it was wearing off and i started feeling REALLY nostalgic and wanting those times back so so badly. I thought it would go away, but it hasn’t. I really don’t want to break up with him, he’s amazing, and my first for almost everything. He’s great. But i just don’t feel the same spark. I’d really like to know if it’s possible to bring that feeling back, i wanna feel those butterflies and that feeling of being afraid of what to say, or the anxious pit when we kiss. Is this possible? ( i’d also like to mention i started taking antidepressants about 5 or so months in, if that could have anything to do with it considering they really changed my way of thinking/ emotions)",20Dec2020,1

As stated. I've been in a 3 year long relationship and at times I doubt that they truly love me. When I ask for basic things they are constantly shut down by calling me needy. 

There is another person that has been around for about a year now. They are madly in love with me. I wish I could reciprocate the feelings but I just can't. I've stated this to them already but they are still around and def stroke my ego.

24,"Hi :) Throwaway account since brothers know my account, I made this account to specifically seek help/advice. Idk how it affects formatting but I'm on tablet. I'm sorry if it's too much to read.

Some info(to understand situation and limitations): I(17F) have two brothers. We are Bangladeshi citizens and UAE expats. They are uni students in Australia. I want to go abroad for uni in the US.

My parents(M &amp; F) are **very** religious. My faith in religion is fairly low as to why we never got along well. They believe in afterlife, heaven, hell etc and live their life based on it. M says I don't need to work/go outside when I grow up, stay at home and take care of my husband and kids like she does while he supports me financially, cover up my body as god will love me if I do so. 

I've cried over this countless times as I'm passionate about wanting to earn and live by myself, which has made me feel resentful towards them and the religion. I am part of the LGBT community, which is illegal in this country and the punishment is death penalty, I've always know it but kept it to myself. My family is also strongly homophobic. M is the type of person that doesn't take no for an answer, so growing up I could never ""argue"" back, even on basic things like not being hungry or what to wear. I dread living like this and I'm afraid they'll marry me off.

The reason I'm afraid is because when I was 13/14, I overheard them talking about a marriage proposal that came for me from a 20y/o guy. F was actually considering it but in the end they came to a decision that I was still not of legal age so they'll wait until I am. The whole time I couldn't stop shaking and crying as it was so horrific to me, I actually thought they would accept the proposal.

F is my visa sponsor and when I turn 18 he will still be my sponsor because I'm not male, I have no legal rights being a non-citizen. Jobs in this country need work permit and being a student I cannot have one. I'm scared to rely or ask for advice in anyone irl. I knew that I won't be allowed to go abroad as ""women aren't allowed to travel by themselves"" I haven't applied but I still looked into unis in the US, as well as scholarships provided by the unis and external scholarships if I get lucky. Maybe being accepted into one and getting scholarships would convince them?

I'm in my final year, M told me to look into unis in the country and things I need in order to get accepted. I never replied on that with anything. Instead I purposely didn't take exams required to study in UAE. I took AP &amp; SAT that unis in US require from international students. I was talking to her, I didn't say it directly but I asked her if I do good at school will she let me choose a uni. She asked what I meant, I replied somewhere abroad maybe. She said ""no, girls need to be close to their male kin"". I knew the answer would be something like this but it still broke my heart. I didn't cry because whenever I cry around her she says ""Why are you crying, did I hit you?"" which makes me cry even more.

Some people suggested I look for women's advocate groups that can help me with funding and planning but there are none within the country so I'm looking for help online. Even now I'm terrified of someone from here finding this post and reporting it to legal authorities in the country, but at this point I have no choice.",20Dec2020,1
25,"I’m 15 turning 16 next week, my brother [18] and I were comin home after getting Dons we were walking up my driveway and outta nowhere he said “I’m having a kid” and kinda looked at me, I then asked him who and he told me it was  a female[18]. The female was a low-life living on welfare, My brother has known for a long time. My parents told him specifically that she was going to do that.

27,"Cross posted from the pregnancy sub. I’m expecting my first baby in March. 

Context: Yesterday (Friday), I get a TEXT from my financial manager (who takes care of my IRA and personal stocks--and happens to be a very old family friend and extremely close with my mother) addressed to myself, and my spouse (who does not have their personal money in any way linked to said financial advisor) stating: ""Congratulations on the upcoming birth of your little one. I want to schedule a time to speak with you in regards to family planning matters that are important. BTW-  there may be some concern that I have and will discuss personal financial information with members of your family. Please know I uphold the highest level of confidentiality in the same way a doctor or lawyer would."" End text. Now, I found the text to be inappropriate for a few reasons. 

1) If I wanted to discuss financial planning matters, it should be *my* decision to reach out to *her.* However, when it comes to financial planning matters, we've actually decided to use a different bank, and go a different route. 

2) I know the only reason she reached out to me, was because my mother told her to. My mom has the tendency to be extremely over bearing and controlling over me. I'm an only child, and she seems to be struggling with this transition from parent and child, to me now becoming a mother to my own daughter in 3 months. My spouse and I have mentioned to my mother in the past that we're a little hesitant to do any more business (than what's already been done) with said financial planner because she actually does not withhold the highest level of confidentiality. She has shared with my mother my father's personal financial decisions on more than one occasion, so her verbiage at the end of her message insinuates to me, that my mom obviously said ""She \[me\] probably hasn't come to you for financial planning because she's worried you'll share it with me."" 

3) If my mom was curious, or concerned about how and what we're deciding to do about savings and college funds for our baby, then she can ask me- even though it's actually really none of her business. No need to go behind my back, have the financial planner reach out on the Friday before Christmas to try and schedule a meeting to discuss matters that should only be discussed if, and when I want them to be discussed.

This was a lot I unloaded. Deep breath. There's more. 

I sent my mom a message asking if she reached out to (we will call the financial planner Annie).

My mom texts me back saying: ""I spoke to her the other day about my account. She mentioned she hasn't spoken to you in a while. I told her to reach out. It's more important now than ever to ensure your financial position is strong as parents. Hate to say this but if anything were to happen to you or \[spouse\], you need a life insurance policy. Grown up stuff, not fun to think about, but needs to be done!""

I then told her that I know she has the best intentions, but at the end of the day, I am the parent to my daughter, and anything involving 'family planning' whether its finances, medical, school, WHATEVER, will be made by myself, and my spouse. No one else. I reiterated again that I knew it came from a good place, but we were moving forward with a different bank as opposed to using Annie for family matters.  She would have known that had she just asked me. 

Her response: ""Put the brakes on! I want to assure you that Annie never discusses you, or your finances. As your mom and your parent it is my responsibility to secure my future as well as make decisions that benefit my only beneficiary (you). As per your wishes, I won't discuss this again. In closing, maybe, just maybe, I know a little more than you and \[spouse\] do regarding this topic. I won't bother you again. Reach out to me when you want to share something. I want bother you guys again anymore.""

Every time I try to have a constructive conversation with my mother about setting (what I feel are) healthy boundaries, I'm met with this type of knee jerk reaction that somehow is twisted into *her* financial decisions, that she knows more than me, and that she's bothering me. None of those things were ever mentioned in my initial message to her, not even on a 'read between the lines' level. 

So, to echo the question in my subject line: Am I overreacting here? I'm pretty furious.",20Dec2020,1
28,"Does anyone know what the hell this is that I am dealing with? So for about 10 years now I have been dealing with something I’d describe as throat gas. Basically I get this horrible belching that lasts for hours and is so fucking horrible. It feels like there is a huge lump in my throat, it gets all tight, and makes and audible sound as it forces itself out of my throat. I have no control over it other than being able to help force it out but it doesn’t help and still lasts for hours. As you can imagine this feeling and throat gas began to drive me insane, and I have horrible anxiety from it because it always feels like it is killing me by suffocating me or closing my throat. It happens every day no matter what I do and lasts so damn long. Lately it’s been so horrible that I get panic attacks every day, because it makes my throat so tight and feel like I can’t breathe. Of course I still can breathe but the feeling it gives me drives me insane. Does anyone know what this is? And if not is there a better subreddit to ask (besides this one?) thanks and sorry if I sound overly dramatic but this shit is ruining my life and nothing I do whether it’s diet changes or over the counter medicine seems to stop it, it only makes it worse, especially tums and milk of magnesia just seem to make it so much worse it’s awful. In the past others(not a doctor) have said it could be caused by swallowing too much air when eating, or by stomach acid. When this gas isn’t very severe I can deal with it but when it gets intense like it is now it is very hard to deal with. My parents are trying to help me but they seem to think I am over reacting and can just get over it. I am not angry at them but I wish they would see it if more as a serious thing because it affects me so badly; even when I take my mind off of it that doesn’t make it go away nor does it make it feel any better. This constant throat benching or throat gas is torture, and I’d do anything possible to make it stop. Any help is appreciated thanks.",20Dec2020,1
29,"I guess this is just imposter syndrome, in short, but this week I was accepted to Tufts University under Early Decision. My family can afford it, with some lifestyle changes. I should be thrilled, this has been my top school for a while. But at this point, I mostly feel guilty. Like I took someone more deserving's spot, or I'm making my family spend too much money.

41,"I have no idea if this is the correct subreddit, so I apologize if it isn’t. Also, I apologize for how long this is going to be. Basically, I’m really struggling and I don’t know how to get past this. I broke up with my boyfriend in July and I thought I was finally past everything and over him. We were together for almost 2 years. Recently, I talked to his mom a bit about how he is and I feel like I made a mistake breaking up with him. He absolutely despises me now and has me blocked on everything, and I really want to apologize for a lot. I will admit, I was not perfect and obviously I made mistakes, but I did my very best to be as selfless and caring towards him as I could, communicate, and learn from my mistakes. There were so many reasons for the breakup, but he’s the only boyfriend I’ve ever had and I loved him with everything in me. The main reason was that he was a month away from being 18 and had just no motivation to do anything, nor cared about trying to do basic adult tasks such as cooking or cleaning. Dude couldn’t even use an oven. He was content with sitting around and playing video games all day every day and didn’t care about anything else. I was working my ass off around the clock, which I didn’t expect him to do, but I wanted him to do at least something like get a job, cook/clean for himself, etc. I even sat him down and told him how I felt. Am I an asshole for that? His parents did everything for him and he was basically completely pampered and did absolutely nothing. He even got mad when his parents asked him to walk the dog, and then he’d be in a bad mood the rest of the night. I believe he did have depression, but he knew that and did absolutely nothing about it. I supported him as much as I could and encouraged him to switch meds when his weren’t working, but he just didn’t care. He was content with how everything was because he was using me as his safety shield and used COVID as an excuse for everything. I got a new job in June, so he was perfectly capable of getting a job if he really wanted to.  There were several other smaller reasons for the breakup, but that was the main one. 

When I talked to his mom, I learned that the break up led to him getting a job and learning to drive. I feel like if I had just stayed or if I had just nagged a little more, he would have built up his motivation and we could still be together. Logically I know that the fact I had to nag for over a year in the first place showed where his priorities were, but I can’t help thinking “if I had just tried a little more and helped him get past his lack of motivation...” Are my feelings of making a mistake normal? Will this and my feelings of regret and me missing him subside? 

In addition, I have bipolar 2 disorder and I’ve fallen into a horrible depression. It’s like my meds have completely stopped working. I hate myself, I hate my body and I freak out over my weight, and I genuinally just don’t want to be here. I did my best to hide my mental health issues with my ex, but sometimes they came out and they took a toll on him. So I know the breakup was for the best, it just hurts a lot now. I talk to a psychiatrist and I’m going to get past my issues. I guess I just want someone to tell me it’s going to be ok, because my parents don’t care. I’m so unhappy in my household and they’re the main source of my depression. When I tried to move out, my parents told me they’d take me off their health insurance (I’m 18). The only way I could afford moving out was by staying on their health insurance, so I’m stuck in this hell home of a house. Obviously I understand why they’d take me off it, but it just upset me a lot. 

Anyway, I apologize for how long this is, but I genuinally have no one to talk to about this besides strangers on here and I really hope someone can give me a little advice. Am I an asshole for reacting to his lack of motivation for years as I did? Thank you for taking the time to read this.",20Dec2020,1
42,"I'm a 17 year old M and I just started driving classes and I am absolutely horrible.

 I think I broke every law and rule of driving today, I turned left/right multiple times even though my instructor told me to go the other way. I showed the wrong blinker multiple times, my car turned off at a traffic light. A police car almost hit us because I for some reason hit the brakes too early when parking. I constantly kept messing up at turns, shifting wrong gear etc. I constantly kept missing and not seeing signs/marks on the road. Overall I think I pretty much messed up every possible aspect of driving except for steering.

This is kind of a vent post because I don't know what to do or what kind of advice to ask for. Nobody in my family drives and I have this constant nervousness when driving in more populated areas. I still slightly mess up when driving in low population areas but this was insane today. I guess I'm just horrible at multitasking. It's so hard to focus on the road, steering, signs, marks on the road, my blinker, everyone else on the road and I just can't explain it.

 It's only my 5th lesson and I know It's normal to mess up when you're a beginner but I seriously couldn't go five minutes without messing up today and I feel extremely clumsy. I was just praying the whole time for the class to end so I don't accidently hurt someone or myself. I passed my test easy enough and I know the rules but learning them and using them are two different things to me, it just doesn't come naturally.

Like I don't know what to do, I know It's normal for beginners but I seriously couldn't go 5 minutes without messing up or my instructor having to stop the car. I guess it might be how scared I am? No one in my family drives so I have no experience or knowledge prior to this and seeing all the things online and on media about car accidents just makes me nervous with how much it's throw at us how dangerous it is.

I seriously don't know how to feel or what to do.",20Dec2020,1

A few days ago though, I found her Tw account and the last three or four tweets she made were all ranting about how annoying I am (I know she was talking about me because she specifically talked about things that had happened that day). So I decided to not make a big fuss out of it and just avoid talking to her. I actually stopped talking in our group chat for a few days. What's throwing me off is that she's been super attentive?? She's asked me a few times privately if I'm alright bc I haven't been active and she went to the extent of texting a friend of mine to check if I was ok?

46,"Apologies is this gets a little out of pocket, this is my first time doing anything like this. 

For context, the girl I was with was extremely manipulative when we first started dating but she was one of my first “serious” girlfriends and the first one I had a real connection to. That connection was not immediately reciprocated as she was incapable of getting over her ex, so we worked at it. Or I did, stupidly, but I was in an emotionally vulnerable state in my life and the companionship outweighed every red flag I was taught to catch. 

Having time to think about how everything I can plainly see how much was my fault for not sticking up for myself more and I ended up causing as much damage to the relationship by the end of it. I slipped into a deep depression, stopped taking care of myself, stoped going to work.. I saw no light at the end because of a combination of sunken cost fallacy and the feelings I still harbored for her. I was never able to look at leaving her as doing something healthy for myself. I could only see it as hurting another person, despite the fact this person had already devastated me. 

We never challenged each other or motivated each other. Eventually we fed into each others’ laziness and we were doing nothing but going to work, playing games, watching tv, and the occasional date when we felt like going out. Being with her killed my self esteem in ways I can barely describe. I stopped hanging out with my friends because she would always suggest I was doing something else. She would look through my phone and find nothing yet still find a reason to justify her actions. It was mental gymnastics keeping up with her compulsive lying as well.  It got to the point where instead of calling her out(which always did nothing) I just started treating her the same way. With a lack of trust and respect. Maybe I wanted HER to break up with ME? I don’t know. I’m getting way off topic with the context. Tl;dr it was no way to live. I made my bed and was sleeping in it. 

Eventually, we came to an agreement for a month long break and during that time I had many epiphanies about myself and her which has led me to this post. 

I broke up with her officially the day before my birthday at the end of August and already have made numerous healthy changes in my life. Coming to where I’m asking for advice.. like I said earlier in the post. She ruined my self esteem. Any meager ability I had to socialize dried up when I was around her.  I’m doing extremely well, but covid has limited my options with socializing. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions on where to go from here. 

I’ve attempted reconnecting on social media but I’m truly not a fan. I used to love being around people and am rediscovering a lot about myself and maybe it’s seasonal depression compelling me to make this post. 

I’ve moved in with my parents to help them fix up the house in exchange for the room. They’re hoping to retire in the next five years and I would rather not bring covid home to them. 

As it is I’m focusing on growth and self improvement, so if your advice is to keep on keeping on, I understand! That’s the plan right now! I’ve been wanting to brainstorm some ideas that I can get behind while waiting on society to reach a level of relative normalcy again.

48,"I’m 21 and have an incurable brain disease that has limited my functionality and cognitive abilities. Of my symptoms, light sensitivity, neck pain, and migraines are the worst that usually take out all of my energy for the day. Even just bending down to do the dishes triggers my pain, and I’m usually done for the day. Plus, the sun hasn’t been helpful with my light sensitivity. None of the light sensitivity glasses have worked for me either. In January, I had the only treatment for my disease which is brain surgery to remove my first vertebrae and a portion of my lower skull. It relieved some symptoms, but I still experience a substantial amount of chronic pain. The only thing that helps me are edibles, specifically the ones made for medical marijuana patients. I want to believe in myself and my abilities, but I’m so worried that my disease will prevent me from living life. I’m in college, thankfully a full-ride, and even now I’m struggling to get through my undergraduate degree with disability accommodations and a lot of extensions on assignments. I want to be able to work full-time, but I’m extremely scared of being fired due to my disability taking a toll on deadlines, discriminatory managers and/or exploitation. I also want to work full-time as I don’t have the finances or monetary support from family to experiment between different jobs/industries. I really don’t want to be on SSI/SSDI either, of course due to the financial limitations that comes with it.

Several years ago I was at an autograph event but because of the poor coordination of the event they capped before I got to get an autograph. I was so distressed because I had driven hours and spent a night in a hotel, and an entire day in line just to get K’s autograph. So I snuck back stage and actually managed to find K. 

What I wanted K to sign was my own artwork I made of them. K seemed amused by it but when I asked them to sign it they refused. One of workers grabbed the artwork away and pushed me out from backstage. It happened all so quickly that I didn’t have time to explain that I wanted my artwork back.

I was completely mortified, sad and angry. since one, I know I did something really dumb and reckless. What I did was very disrespectful and I know I shouldn’t have done that. Two, I never wanted K to keep my artwork nor do I know if they even did keep it. Three, a part of me is still pretty upset that they couldn’t just sign it real quick and be done with it. 

What I found really ironic is that the content K creates is about giving fans happiness and hope and I just found that so hypocritical. 

Anyway, I still really enjoy their work but it’s harder now because I have such a bad memory with the creator. And I feel bad because I know I’m to blame for that bad memory.

53,"Friend and I were texting and sending each other gifs. He said he was going to send me a gift for Christmas but wouldn't give me hints as to what the gift was, so I jokingly told my friend that hated him very much, but then I stupidly followed that comment up with, ""I actually didn't like you at all when we first met. I found you annoying because you asked me a lot of personal questions and said I looked good in glasses, lmao."" 

We've talked almost every day since we met in August during an online class, so I obviously do not hate him. Also, though I did find him slightly annoying when we first met, I soon realized he was super sweet and funny. I thought he'd feel happy that I changed my mind about him and admit that I was wrong to judge him before getting to know him. Unfortunately, he hasn't messaged me in almost a week. I asked him again to give me a hint as to my gift, but he left me on read. 

Background: We met in our online class. We were grouped together with another guy, so my friend started a group chat with us on Whatsapp. Once I realized how sweet and funny he was, I initiated a private conversation with him. I don't have friends irl, so I was excited to have met him. We began talking almost evey day and helped each other pass the course. During the course, I wondered if he liked me so I asked him straight up. He said he only saw me as a friend. I accepted this. Later, he sent me a pic of his younger self with a beard and I told him I liked him (meaning his face), but he thought I was confessing I had a crush on him. Things were cleared up that day, so all was cool. He expressed his gratefulness for meeting me after the course ended, so we have continued to talk. We've disclosed some personal stuff to each other and have expressed our thoughts on topics like religion, science, family, relationships, etc. We differ on things, but we remain friendly with each other. I honestly was not expecting him to send me anything for Christmas, though. Clearly, he's very kind and I enjoy his friendship.

Since tone is not clear through text, I understand I very likely screwed up and made him feel bad. I am posting here to confirm my hypothesis and perhaps gain some help as to how to word an apology. However, I don't know if he's actually upset with me or not, so if nobody is the asshole here, what should I do? Should I let him ghost me or should I ask him if he's upset with me?",20Dec2020,1
54,"This advice for me, not my sibling, so I will keep this vague so because my family browses too.  They are an adult (even though they act like a child) and are not likely to change.

In my opinion my younger sibling was constantly spoiled and never told no and do it on your own.  They are selfish, lazy, and expect the world to rotate around them.  

With that being said, I worry for them to a degree but my mainly my parents.  I worry they’re driven to an early grave because my sibling is such an incompetent man-child.  This worry for the future of them makes me physically ill with stress and ruins my day.

I hate to say it but whenever I even hear the word family I don’t think about a place of people who care for you but rather a place that revolves around the shortcomings of a screw up.  I love my family but I can’t stand how selfish and lazy my sibling can be and ruin everything around them.

Should I just quit worrying about them and just worry about me?  I feel guilty about doing that because they’re family but it’s now taking a toll on me worrying about they’re future when they don’t even seem to care.

She replied to mine like "" oh yes, it looks interesting and aI got interested in the comic, where can I read it?"" And I told her meanwhile she replied to my wife with a ""oh, that's good"".

I do very, very well in STEM related fields like math and computer science, but through taking those classes I've realized I absolutely despise it. The thought of having to take more of those classes sounds awful, but at the same time, it does come fairly naturally to me and I exceed in those courses.


Meanwhile, I've realized I love humanities, instead of dreading my classes like I do in STEM related courses, my English class is the highlight of my day. I love writing and reading and analyzing texts. The problem is that I only do okay in those classes. I'm not doing awful, but I'm certainly not a prodigy.


The advice I heard from my parents was to simply pursue the humanities as a hobby or minor since I'm not talented enough to pursue them as my main focus, which hurt but is probably true. Besides, the job prospects for a computer science major are a lot better than an English major. I dread computer science right now, but I'm hoping if I do follow their advice, I can reduce it to a minor dislike. I just don't know what to choose because even if I'm not doing the best in English, that's where my passion is and I am totally content with life.

I've recently been struggling to come out with my religion and I don't really know why I feel like I made a lot of sins by cussing a lot and arguing with my parents, I haven't done any bad sins like murder or abuse anyone but I feel like its too late for me, I can't do things because of my religion and it's stressing me out I don't wanna do bad things like murder but like every time I want to explore something new like crystals or shifting realities I always have to look up ""is this against Christianity"" and I don't wanna feel like that and its really stressing me out, and personally I don't wanna wait until marriage and even if I don't wait until marriage I'm gonna feel guilt both ways like ( if I do wait I'm gonna feel bad and if I don't wait I'm gonna regret that because I don't wanna wait until I'm in my 20s or whenever I get married who even knows when I'm gonna get married?) This type of stuff is stopping me from being Christian.

I've also been thinking about my sexuality and I don't really know what I am now, I used to say I was pansexual which means I liked all genders, but now I don't think that I'm pansexual I feel like I'm straight and I don't even know what's keeping me from that maybe it's because of my religion? What I go to hell because I like the opposite gender like I don't wanna feel like that anymore, I don't wanna be afraid to be myself, but I'm feeling like being Christian is keeping me from being myself or maybe I'm just confused on my sexuality.

My whole family is Christian so I don't know how to deal with this either. ( I forgot to mention)

I'm also scared to not believe in God because of the universe, and I haven't seen valid proof that God was real, but what if he is real, and when I die I'm gonna go to hell because I don't believe?

67,"Hello! I'm gonna do my best to summarize this. Please bear with me 😊 I don't have anyone to talk to, so I thought I'd open this up here. :(

To give you a background story, I am an only child and my parents separated when I was a little kid. Growing up, my father made me think that my mom left me and didn't have any financial contribution in my life, except for when she was only in the country, but when she was abroad, my dad and my aunts were covering every finances for me. 

Or so I thought.

I was a daddy's girl. It was always me and my dad against the world, and my mom was practically out of the picture half of my life since she's working abroad. We didn't have Facebook, Messenger, heck we didn't even have WiFi that time, so I didn't have anything I could use to keep in touch with my mom. She would come home, if I'm not mistaken, every 2-3 years to visit me and my dad. When she's in the country, we'd bond and she'd shoulder my school expenses. She could only stay for 1 month because she had to go back to work. 

Fast forward to when I was around 7 or 8 years old, my dad had a stroke. He told me that since then, my aunts have been shouldering my school expenses and my allowance. He said that he covered my entire school needs since kindergarten and only stopped when he got sick, which is understandable considering how expensive hospital bills and medicines are.

My aunts were acting so supportive of me when they realized that I am the only overachiever and the only talented one in the family. 

I got close with my aunts. They were practically my second mom. 

In school, I may have been an overachiever and a talented student, but those didn't stop me from getting bullied. My entire Elementary school year, I was always bullied and I'd always come home crying. Because of this, I moved to a different school when I was in High School, but the bullying didn't stop. It just got worse. Especially when my classmates realized that not only do I do well in classes, I also actively participate in curricular activities. So, I told my aunts about this. I was hoping maybe they'd talk to the faculty or do what an adult would do if their niece, or someone who they say they treated as a daughter, gets bullied constantly. Instead, what they told me is that it was my fault. It was my fault I was getting bullied, because I was being arrogant about my skills and my talents. It was my fault I was getting bullied, because I was being over confident. I told my dad this and showed him the messages my aunts were sending me (we finally had FB this time) and he said he'd talk to them.

Finally, I got into College. I was given a 100% Academic Scholarship because of my performance in High School. I was ecstatic and couldn't wait to start a new journey. My excitement only lasted for a couple of weeks, because the bullying started again. Damn, even in College. My bullies would sabotage my papers and my works, causing me to lose my scholarship. I tried to talk to the faculty, but they ended up siding with the bullies. So, I told my aunts once again, because they were the only motherly figures I have in life and I didn't want my dad to stress about this. Once again, they said it was my fault. It was my fault, because I was being arrogant about my skills and my talents. It was my fault, because I was being over confident. I couldn't handle it! So, I showed my aunts' messages to my dad, and he said he'd talk to them.

When I was in my 3rd year of College, my priorities changed. I wanted to start making my own money so I don't have to rely anymore on my aunts. I told my dad about this and he was supportive. I told him not to tell my aunts, because I don't want them to ruin my plan. 

I would do several side hustles. I would do singing gigs every night for an hour, I applied as a Student Assistant and I grew quite a following online which caused me to get brand deals. I was so happy! When my dad realized that my plans were working, he asked me if he could take my school allowance instead because I have all these side hustles. Since I love him, I said yes.

So, for 3 years, he would take 100% of my allowance, I would work nonstop and I would treat my dad every weekend to unwind and bond. But then, my health started to decline from overworking. I told my dad I needed my allowance back and he said no. He said we could only split it. So, I agreed. 

Fast forward to my graduation! I finally got out of the bullying and the stress in school. I told my aunts how grateful I am for all they've done for me to reach this far, and they were like ""finally! Someone is gonna give me allowance in return."" Um, I haven't even walked down the isle yet. What? But whatever, I was still very grateful. Also, I was slowly getting back in touch with my mom this time and have been catching her up with what she's missed. She's been trying to get in contact with me since I was in High School, but I was still very hesitant. We finally reconciled when I graduated.

Now that I have graduated and started working, this is where things are starting to unfold.

My dad insisted that I give him allowance and that I pay some bills for the house. I said I wanted to save money, but he was like, ""No! After everything I've done for you. I took care of you! You owe me."" He also mentioned that I was being arrogant when I kept saying that I wanted to earn money for my future. 

One of my aunts came home, and that's when my dad really started to change. He would make a big deal out of me not smiling when going down the stairs, for taking a long bath, for going out and not buying them anything when I get home, for not wanting to open up to my aunt and many more. At this time, I decided to try a different industry. I quit my 9 to 5 to try to be an entrepreneur. I had no idea how expensive, time consuming and tough being an entrepreneur was. I figured I'd take the risk since I'm still young and I just got out of College. Since I was slowly losing money, I told my dad that I had to stop the allowance and some of the house bills. He told me how dare I do such thing. 

That I was being arrogant. 

That I was being selfish. 

He told me I can shove my money up my ass. 

And that I needed to get a 9 to 5 job again to help in the house.

Funny thing is, one of my cousins is working, but they never asked him for a penny. Not once! Only me.

Now he is threatening to kick me out of the house.

This is when I also realized that my dad never paid for anything in my school. One of my aunts, the nice one, said that it was my mom who paid for my entire Kindergarten and Elementary school expenses. It just happened that she lost means of communication with my dad in High School since he changed his number and when she found me on Facebook on my 4th year of High School, she reached out immediately. All my life, dad only got me snacks. I'm not saying that my basis for love and care is the amount that you put into my life, but why did he feel the need to lie?

He said that my aunts paid for everything after he got sick, now he wants me to pay them back. He even wants me to give him some money even though my aunts were already giving him money. He would always coerce me into giving him and them money to the point where I'm almost out. This is when I also realized that in College, while we was taking 100% of my allowance, he was also being given money by my relatives.

Now, we are about to move to a different house in a few weeks, and he's planning to kick me out of the house if I don't get a job ASAP. But it's very risky to go outside due to COVID and I'm still not in the right head space because of all the revelations and the constant fights we have over money. 

My mom started giving me money again to help me out (but not enough to live on my own) and I promised myself I won't tell my dad, because for sure he'd ask me to give him some.

I don't know what to do at this point. What advice do you have? What do you think I should do?",20Dec2020,1

69,"I am a university student and almost at the end of my degree. The finish line is in sight. 
But 3 months ago I moved out from home and started a part time job (2-3 times a week). It was fine for a while. After working for 1 month suddenly all of my assignments and projects started at the same time that I totally neglected all of my lectures and only had the projects and the work going. 

Now the exams are near (6-7 weeks are left) and I still have to start studying. I tried to go through my lectures but I could only get a little done. 
Throughout the past semesters I only worked in my holidays and never in the semester. I don't know how to study and concentrate completely on my exams when I know I still have to work. Every semester during exam time, I did nothing else than study. That's how I study! I am almost finished with my degree and I don't wanna ruin it for myself just because I couldn't quit my job today! 
I had everything ready and also initiated the conversation with my boss that I have a lot going on with uni and little time. But he cut me off and said that we could reduce the time I work and left for his break. When he came back and continued talking, we weren't alone in his office anymore and I couldn't bring it up. Now I have to work once every week. And I  know that's almost nothing but it still annoys me. It annoys me that I couldn't quit! I am stupid for that. 
I took the job in the first place so I could afford moving out. Now I don't need the job anymore. But the boss said he doesn't have anyone else for that one day I have to work. That's why he couldn't give me that day off. 

I am really angry at myself and desperate at the same time. I really improved the last semesters and I don't want everything to go to waste now! This is disturbing my peace.

I remember specifically being hit to the floor by my angry dad over bad grades as an 8 year old, and that memory just keeps coming back. Transformers was one of my favorite movies at that time, and it just came on earlier. I had to leave the room and go let some tears out so that I didn't just implode in front of my family.

73,"So about my situation; I'm 25, I'm gay and I work behind the bar in a local pub. One of my co-workers, let's call him Stan, is a good mate of mine and I really value his friendship. Stan's dad regularly comes to the pub which Stan thinks is great, but unbeknownst to him, when he's not around his dad hits on me. This is extremely awkward and although I've made my feelings clear he doesn't seem to get the point. Naturally Stan doesn't know his dad is gay, so I can't say anything about it to him.

However about a week ago things escalated from awkward to nasty. It was late on a weeknight and I was working on my own. There was nobody else in the pub so I was getting ready to close when Stan's dad came in already drunk and had the shits on because I'd been rejecting his advances.
I told him to leave immediately or I'll file a barring order against him. Eventually he left but not before firing a tirade of homophobic slurs at me (I know, the irony here is palpable).

I had hoped that this would be the end of this unpleasant saga, however, he's now talking shit about me to Stan and trying to break up our friendship. So now Stan is mad at me and I can't say anything in my defence without revealing his dad's advances towards me.

(For clarification’s sake we’ll call them A and B)

A left about a week ago to go home for Christmas so it was just me and person B who is leaving tomorrow. I’ve been talking on the phone to person A pretty frequently over the time they haven’t been here as has person B. We’ve all shared some pretty deep personal stuff with each other especially B, who has been going through some really really tough stuff this past month. 
I have pretty severe OCD and anxiety plus I’m on the spectrum (allegedly) and it’s been really nice for me to be able to socialise and share things with people that I have no one else to talk to about.

But then today, person B asked me if I’d seen the message that person A put in our group chat and this is where I feel that I am being too dramatic. I opened the message and for some reason, it made my heart drop.
A basically said that they feel like they’ve been giving people “too much access to them” and that, and I quote (sort of) “I’ve been letting YOU PEOPLE get to close to me so I’m going to detach from you”.

I really don’t know why but that hurt like hell. I don’t know if I’m just being too over dramatic or if it’s just the way my brain is wired but I’m really hurt at that and so is person B. We both understand that maybe person A is going through something but it was just so out of the blue. Plus, person B has had it really really tough this month as they went through something pretty horrific but never once did they say anything like that to me or person A.

82,"Hello reddit, this is my first post in a long while so bear with me. I'm also posting from mobile.

I am taking engineering at university and I am in my 4th year out of 5. Classes have been online all semester, and its been overbearing to say the least. I have not adjusted well, and it has added a lot of extra pressure.

The exam in question was closed-book, on canvas (not a lockdown browser), and invigilated via zoom. I have two monitors, one with zoom open on it and one with the exam. There was a short answer section with factual based knowledge type questions and a section for calculations. 

I always start with calculations because they take the most time and I usually cant b.s. my way through them if time becomes tight. The part where my cheating comes in is in the factual based questions. I'm not so good at remembering word for word facts, even when I've rigorously studied them over and over again. 

I decided to open up a pdf I had with some notes and look for an answer quickly. Then for another problem. I then ""accidentally"" opened the class page for canvas. I am aware that instructors can see who is accessing their page at certain times and I believe I will be caught. 

The reason I want to come forward is because my moral compass has got the best of me, and I havent eaten more than a few bites of food in the last few days, and dont even begin to ask if I slept at all. I am very aware that cheating in any form is absolutely unacceptable and I have no idea what came over me. I have never regretted a decision so much in my life. I never would have dreamt of doing such a thing during an in person exam, ever. 

There is always the possibility I dont get caught. If I do get caught, I could fail the class, be suspended, or even be expelled. I am hoping that by coming forward, they will see that as I am aware that I was wrong, and that I'm willing to learn from it and maybe have some mercy on me. 

What do you think?

88,"For the last few years, Ive lived in limbo. Following high-school, a lot of traumatic events happened, and it really turned my world upside down. I found a job that, while soul-crushing, paid the bills and mostly stopped living. 

I had a very small social circle, that got smaller each year. I started gaining weight, lost a lot of energy to do much else but watch some TV after work, do basic things like chores and groceries, and go for the occasional run. 

I have an animal, who I care a lot for, but he makes my life a lot harder. He has aggression, problems with territorial marking, and I feel so much more tired from him.

A few months ago, it was like I woke up. I decided that was not the life I wanted to live, got a gym membership, started some hobbies, and got better clothes. I was feeling more energetic, I was in better shape, and I was developing a friend group. Then the shutdown happened near me. 

The gyms closed, and a lot of my friends moved into the city. I gained back a lot of weight, and actually feel in worse shape than I was. Things got more stressful at work, the tiredness came back and I felt trapped again, knowing it didn't have to be like this. 

I think I need to get out of where I'm living. I feel like I can see where I want to be next, too. I want to move into the city, closer to my friends. I want to rejoin a gym, when it opens, and hope that being in a bigger place opens more opportunity for friends and better jobs. I'll find new hobbies, and take some classes or certificates.

Here is a transcript of the INITIAL Instagram message I was sent.

Weird dude -""(Quote of something I said on facebook, not gonna repeat it here""

me - ""Lmao whos this""

weird dude - ""I think it's funny your messing with him""

me - ""ah""

weird dude - ""He know it's you?"" ""That's funny"" ""You message his cell phone lol?"" ""How do I message and mess with him? Don't want him to know it's me""

I found this really weird cause there is no way I would have this dudes phone number, I just got in a facebook argument.

92,"Hello - I have anxiety, depression and panic disorder and am in the process of getting a diagnosis for ADHD or autism, maybe both. I don't do so well with bright flashing lights, beeping noises, and loud noises in general. They sometimes cause panic attacks and they just generally make me feel terrible. Not sure how to it explain it more than that, sorry. I'm okay with smells almost 100% of the time apart from spearmint gum for some reason. And the chewing that goes with it - I have never been nor currently am a particularly angry person but that combination of smell and noise together makes me absolutely livid.

The reason why I'm asking for advice on what to do now is because I just nearly had a panic attack because of the smell of crisps. I am aware this sounds completely ridiculous, but that's why I need advice. My mum was just eating some god-awful beef flavoured crisps. We've never had these ones before, but they smelled like old blood. No one else mentioned anything even though the smell was so strong. I tried to hold out but I had to run from the room in the end. I think everyone is pretty concerned right now. I sometimes get like this when I'm experiencing some form of overstimulation (too much noise, very bright lights, etc) but it hasn't quite happened like this before. 

It's been half an hour since this happened and I'm still struggling to breathe. I cannot really describe how disgusting the smell is. Imagining it is making me cringe. If anyone has any advice at all - seriously anything - on how to deal with smells like that or why that might have happened I would be so grateful. I need help right now. It's going to take months to get help for autism/ADHD - I think this might be related to that - and I still might be dismissed as another anxious woman who's giving names to things that aren't there, so if anyone has anything to say at all I'd be thrilled.

It feels like a burning/chaffing feeling and it will hurt for a couple days after I stop working even. I tried a pad, didn’t help.

94,"So I (M27) have come to a weird crossroads with some old friends of mine. I moved back to my hometown a couple months ago, but before that I moved out at the age of 18 and have been living all around The States.

To keep things short, the issue I'm having is sometimes when women come up I feel like my friends really just don't talk about them in the best way and it irks me. Today I watched some fights with a good friend and after that we met up with another two friends to hang out. At one point the fights came up, and we both agreed that the women put in a good show and overall put out the best fights. Someone commented on how maybe it's because you can see their ass' and such. Everyone agreed, and it annoyed the fuck out of me. One because I have trained martial arts since I was young and still do, and to just put women in that area when the fighters put so much work and effort into their craft is disrespectful. Two, because it just feels dirty. I don't know, I used to be like this but dating some women in my life got me to see how demeaning and unnecessary it is to put women in a sexual box and I try my best not to comment on stuff like that. I kind of grilled them a bit, but the conversation moved paths after.

I've had a lot of experiences like this, and have left dinners and told everyone to go on without me so I could go home because it makes me annoyed/a bit upset. I'm just looking for some viewpoints from people. This isn't coming from a place of I'm better or anything, but sometimes I just feel like I may be too sensitive/annoying when I always feel the urge to question/challenge these kind of talks. Sometimes I just want to fit in with the boys too, because ever since moving back I definitely feel a big rift and living by myself during a pandemic only amplifies the lack of social health.

Thank you and stay safe.",20Dec2020,1
95,"Hi y'all, I'm a senior in high school who just started his winter break. I'm currently filling out my many college applications, and that seems to dominate majority of time in my life. 

Don't get me wrong, I understand this is supposed to be a normal process, but it's just that other than applying to college, I don't have any motivation to do anything whatsoever. Sometimes I'd take a break and don't know what to do with time. 

I gave up many of my hobbies in exchange for time to use for writing college applications, but now even those don't seem to really matter anymore.

They say to ""pick up the hardest burden you can find,"" but as of now, it seems to me that college applications is the heaviest burden I can find, but I feel so empty while doing it.

Frankly I find this horribly rude and disgusting. It made me very uncomfortable. So I left the chat. Now everyone is begging me to come back saying they’re sorry. I’m refusing to and they are saying I’m overreacting.

99,"Seems to b super difficult for me to make friends online and it would b most appreciated if someone could help me out.

What I'm looking for

Guys or girls age 18-32 I'm aware people tell me I should try to b friends with people older than 32 but I'd like there to b some sort of mutual interests in hobbies. I'm not looking for a hookups I'm straight I just need a new friend group in 2021 that isn't addicted to drugs. I am willing to hangout with 33+ year olds but from past experiences that never seems to go over well.

What I want out of friendship

To start off chatting through text u know get through the usual ""whats up?"" How's your day going?"" Exc... and progressively getting more in depth topics with substance like ""today at college so and so was mean to me."" Exc.... then eventually the friendship hopefully progresses to face chatting getting to actually know each other. Than friendship develops even more and we actually have cool road trips together doing fun activities 😀 

Is all of this to weird to expect?

Currently I get guys hitting on me even though I tell them I'm straight which leads to being blocked 🚫  Other guys try to talk about football or sports and I politely let them know I'm a full-time nerd that enjoys anime, researching random topics finding credible resources and reading fantasy books and then I get ghosted.

Woman usually give me the two to ten worded reply three times a day while I carry on the conversation for the both of us. Or I get the other woman that want my PayPal account to do naughty things which leaves me with only one choice and that is to 🚫 them. 


Any advice on how to meet friends online is much appreciated. Anyone here wants to take a go at becoming my friend is welcomed to and I will do my dead level best to find a mutual interest between the two of us.

For those that r interested in giving it a go heres things about me 

I'm 25 and I sale stocks for a living 

My grammar sucks but I am working on it but ironically I write for a hobby and have small following and I just let grammarly fix all my mistakes.

What I like
First law book series (extremely bloody and amazing writer give it a go if u haven't)

Fantasy novels that are R rated not interested on Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter its way to PG13 for my taste.

I enjoy metal detecting for silver and gold. My best finds in one year was 2 silver rings, 5 silver coins and 2 gold ring and a 1800s belt buckle.

I love studying interesting topics like insects and oceanic life forms. 


My dislikes

Sports, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, Star Wars, Drinking Alcohol 🍸 but I occasionally will smoke weed when I feel like it but honestly don't usually enjoy the side effects.

100,"So, I (21f) am about to start my last semester of undergrad. I technically finished my degree last year (my third year of college), but added on a minor because I was too afraid to officially graduate. Now, I'm having the same dilemma.

 Here's the thing, I truly want to graduate and just be done but the back of my head is telling me I can't do that. The back of my head is filled with self-doubt because I did not choose a major that has a direct path to something like engineering, business, teaching, social work, nursing, etc. My major is justice studies. I was 17 when I chose it, and I didn't really know better. I went in with the idea of going to law school. Now, I don't really think that's what I want to do. I did my freshman and sophomore year, and then my junior year I was set to graduate but I felt horrible about graduating as a justice studies student. I added on a social work minor (doesn't get me my BSW, but my line of thinking was that I'm gonna add it as a minor first to see if I like it and then will add on more time if I do want to pursue the full BSW). I don't know if I want to be a social worker either.

My main career goal is to be involved with bringing on positive change in a macro manner. I know that's cliche and stupid, but I can't imagine basing a career on anything else. Of course financial stability matters, but at the end of my life, I'm not going to take the money with me to the grave. I am going to be far more fulfilled knowing I left the world better than when I entered it. Of course, it can be argued that change can be brought about in any career and that you can even work toward change in your free time. I think those are valid arguments, but for some reason I want my career to be dedicated to this because it's going to be 40+ hours of my life every week. This is a whole tangent to say that social work is to one-on-one for me I feel. There is however the advocacy/lobbying route but i don't know how common careers in that are to find. 

I think what I truly would like to be involved in is public policy. But, I am not even sure what that looks like or what careers are available (i know like policy analysts but that's pretty much it). 

However, I think my main dilemma at this point is that although this wouldn't necessarily align with my ""passion"" should I choose stability and make the probably smarter choice of switching to another major like engineering, teaching, business, nursing or social work last minute and add on another possibly 2 years to my time in undergrad. This would allow me for to have a sense of direction after graduation. And I would prefer to shift gears in undergrad cause it's far far cheaper to pursue a different bachelor's degree than it is to go back for a master's degree (although for social work, you'd have to get your MSW anyway, a BSW would make it one year shorter). It would be cheaper because financial aid will still be available to me for two more years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or should I stick with my vague degree, graduate, work, and figure it out? This option is probably the easier, less stressful one to pursue. A note about this option is that I am also in the process of getting my paralegal certification (though i don't really like it, it at least gives me a better chance of working post-grad). I can possibly work as a paralegal for a few years, save up, go get my masters in either another field or public policy? (I feel that to really get a job in public policy, it wouldn't matter if I change my undergrad major, I would still probably have a better chance in the field with my masters). 

I know this post is confusing, and trust me this jumble of words is far worse in my head. But I would love to get some thoughts about this.",20Dec2020,1

104,"Some personal info to explain why I'm asking this:

Living in NC, currently 20, mother was killed when I was 16 &amp; I moved in with my father, nothin against  him but to say he wasn't that great at being a parent would be an understatement. Had to drop out of school to work help pay bills, and by the time I was 18 he kicked me out and I was pretty much on my own. 

At this point i barely knew anything about being an adult, I was having trouble with finances to begin with but on top of that all i had was my ID, a couple hundred I had saved and some personal belongings. Eventually found a room mate and things have been steady since then, I'd be lying if I  said I learned stuff about being an adult however. I don't have a license or anything, we're both kind of man children and to top it off he screwed me over on rent for these past 3 months, as well as being told he'd stop paying earlier, so now I'm broke working at a restaurant about to lose where I live in less than 2 weeks. I'm lost.

Having never gotten my diploma let alone GED, and being pretty much slap broke without any transportation (relatively close to where I work so I just walk to and from it everyday), I've been looking toward joining a branch of the military however I'm clueless. I for damn sure know I'm not going to be able to get my GED (or even afford it in that matter) in less than two weeks, and I know there's usually a waiting period between when you join. I don't have any family and besides a couple people at work I consider acquaintances I don't really have any close friends who'd be willing to let me move in with them for the time being. 

So to more correctly convey my question - are there any programs I could sign up for/thing's I'd  be capable of doing between now and the time I lose where I love that'd make it to where I could join a branch?

I also get hungry after working out but I don’t want to risk eating right before bed and basically undoing all the hard work. Any advice on how to tackle this issue?

108,"I want to talk to the girl I liked for years, we went to the same school like 5 years ago and we used to sit next to each other. She was the first person I had an actual crush on. I really liked this girl but I never told her how I felt as I was too nervous. Her friends would always tell me that she liked me but to this day I don't know if that was true or not since she never told me although it's probably for the best because we were too young for a relationship.

This girl is so beautiful but I'm really unsure if I should talk to her. I don't have her number or anything but we both follow each other on Instagram, we've never actually talked but we've liked each others pictures and stuff although that doesn't mean anything.

The first reason why I'm unsure is because I lost contact with this girl when we left our school then moved to different ones. I started talking to a girl a few months ago but it didn't go well and we stopped talking. This girl is friends with the girl I want to talk to and I'm worried that she might have made up bad things about me and tell the girl I like not to talk to me if she mentions me.

The 2nd is because I'm really worried that I'll just get hurt again. I've tried to find love a few times but it has always ending up hurting me really badly. I get depressed for a long time whenever it ends up badly and it's such an awful feeling. The last time I got hurt was when I finally found a girl who seemed to be interested in me and genuinely cared about me but it turns out she had a boyfriend. I respected their relationship and decided not to talk to her also she started becoming distant so it was for the best. I now have a way to contact the girl I always liked originally but if something goes wrong then I'm going to feel extremely down.

If it's genuinely a good idea to talk to her, I was wondering what my first message to her should be as I'm not a very good texter? Any advice is appreciated",20Dec2020,1
109,"My mom and I (23F) have been close ever since I was around 15. We've always had a pretty open relationship and she tells me everything, while I do have my secrets, I tell her nearly everything too. My mom is extroverted and thrives off of social interaction while I'm quite introverted and love my space. Me and my mom have been through a lot with each other from being very close to poverty with no car to moving from state to state, and many other things that have brought us closer. My parents are divorced and my dad isn't in my life, though we talk occasionally.

In the last 2 years it's been rough. Like I said at one point we had no car, we were living with my grandparents, and things were hard. Now we live in income based apartments, we have a car but up until recently we were both jobless and struggling. My mom is in her 50s and it's hard for her to find work and she's discriminated against because of her age, so she's given up on trying to go and find a job. She's had 2 jobs in the 2 last years and both lasted less than 5 months. For the majority of the time, even more than 3 years ago, I've been working to support us both.

I feel like with my mom my wants and desires maybe even dreams aren't necessarily priority unless it involves her in some kind of way. I feel like she's waiting for me to succeed, without giving me any kind of help, and continue to profit from it. When my parents were married my dad spoiled her and paid for everything while she took care of the house and children. In the last 6 months since we're both jobless I've noticed the difference when I have money and when she does. When I have it she wants to be spoiled. When she has it she's stingy and says ""we shouldn't be eating out all the time"" And ""i don't want to waste my money."" That's just when it comes to food because its sometimes all we can afford.

In April I started seeing a new guy, he's been the best bf and longest relationship I've been in. He's inspired me to change in positive ways. My mentality before him, because of my mom, was to expect a rich man to come and save me from my situation and contribute nothing but being a caregiver and I guess sex. It was silly, I realized that thanks to my bf. We're serious about each other and want to build a life together in the future. For a while I was stressing because I knew getting a job meant all the financial responsibility would be pushed onto me and my mom would try and get me to save for what she thinks is best. (We share the same bank as well and can see each other's accounts and transfer money, etc.) I didn't want to have her getting in the way of me trying to get an apartment and start a life with my bf and 99% possible future husband. I finally bucked up and recently got a job and the tools to budget and spend responsibly when I get my first check.

Lately my mom and I have been butting heads a lot more than normal and I'm kind of overwhelmed by my feelings towards her. I don't want to resent her because we talk so much and she tells me her stories and past and I understand why she's the way she is but I don't agree with her mindset and I just want to leave. I feel like she's been using me somewhat this entire time since I've worked. Of course I would never let my mom starve or go without essentials, but when I think about this going on, even if my bf and I break up, I just hate the idea of living with her. Is it wrong to feel this way? I'm so overwhelmed by a feeling of resentment towards her. Anytime I want to be separate from her in most aspects she claims that she doesn't feel in her spirit that she should leave me by myself. She says I'm her rock and best friend/daughter. I've been her therapist, friend, and bank for a while now. And if I'm not her bank, she'll call up my dad and ask him for what little money he can spare at times. I feel like I've become the mother and she's the child at this point. It's unfair and I don't know what the best course of action is, any advice helps!",20Dec2020,1

- My kids’ dad he doesn’t help out. He says he cares and loves our kids. But doesn’t come around to help, doesn’t ask to get them, doesn’t even ask about them. So is me telling him he doesn’t care or that he’s selfish or takes things for granted, abusive? Is that me attacking him? I feel when I tell him he doesn’t care it’s because he doesn’t show it or that he’s selfish for not being around for the kids. I’m bringing awareness to his behavior to hopefully get him to see it and take some accountability but is that me putting him down?

- Is it controlling to want someone to communicate with you on issues you guys are having? 

- is it abusive to give someone an ultimatum? For instance, my kids’ dad I’ll let him know hey if you can’t be consistent with the kids and in their lives you can’t see them and just pop in and out of their lives when you feel. 
Or saying if we can’t be mature enough to talk about our issues about the kids and come to an understanding then I can’t trust you with the kids.

113,"As the title says, I felt like an outcast because the adults had planned a scavenger hunt where you were divided into teams. I wasn't chosen for a team, and my friend (let's call her Tree, the birthday girl), chose friends she hadn't seen since halloween over me, the overemotional little shit. Hell, she didn't even choose, her parents kinda pressured her into it.

Tree's stepdad, (let's call him Horn), got angry at my Mom that she was trying to take me back to our house because I was upset.

Horn said ""It's not all about you and your daughter,""  
And kept talking over my Mom.

I'm in this situation where I kind of have to live at her Trans-Mom's house, or else I'd be on the street. 

So, her birthday ""party"" happened at around 12pm EST. The time came for the scavenger hunt to begin. Tree's friend's Mom (M) didn't want a bunch of people during covid piled up in her car.

I didn't either.

But did Horn and his wife (Crown)? Apparently so.

So Tree and her friends ran off before I really started crying. Tree's sister, let's call her Rose, tried to offer to let me join what team she was in.   
But the damage was already done.  
I had already ruined Tree's birthday with my bullshit.

My Mom herds me back to the car and drives me back to the house I'm staying at (it's now about 1pm). I left all discord servers, unfriended all my friends, left any and all group chats, blocked Tree for a few hours, at least until shit settled down, and sat there reading fanfics on my laptop until I stopped crying.

So come to 5pm, I go on discord, ask a mutual friend of ours (Opal), for advice. And for her to also get Tree's side of the story.

Opal told me to either wait until tomorrow (safer route) to talk it over with Tree, or do it now and get it over with.  
I decided to get it over with.

Everything was fine, we reached peace. For only a few hours.

9pm, I ask if I ruined Tree's party.

Hell slowly broke loose. 

I get it's Tree's birthday. I get that she deserves to hang out with friends she hasn't seen in months. But being shoved aside hurt, and she doesn't really seem to understand that from what I gather.  
Everytime she's at this house, and we all can play with this friend I'll call Dolphin, I ask Tree if she wants to play with us.  
But I didn't want to burden her and her friends with my emotional bullshit. Because it was her day. I wasn't trying to make it about me.

What should I do? How do I make this better? I can't afford to get therapy to help me control how I deal with my emotions, I'm lucky to even have food to eat and a roof over my head. I don't have insurance or healthcare right now, and I have to share a room with Tree on weekends.",20Dec2020,1
114,"I’ve posted on here before about my friend whose cutting herself. I personally understand the feelings of depression, having no motivation,looking back at minor wrong doings I did when I was like 10 and hating myself for it, feeling like I should die, feeling like everyone hates me for no reason. I think it’s great when people are depressed and are able to talk to their friends about it and be open to getting support. I personally don’t really open up like this to friends but support my friends and am always there for them. I don’t at all mind a friend coming to me needing someone there for them even though I personally don’t do that myself. I don’t believe that someone opening up to a friend makes their depression “attention seeking” but in this case it kind of this. My friend is the type of person who romanticized mental illness, takes videos in a bathtub saying “u kmow ur depressed when you do this”, who texts me right after cutting and does not seem to want real help for it but seems to want me to just support her. It kind of bothers me bc ive been depressed and I think it’s fine to reach out to friends for support but with her it just feels like she wants everyone to see her as “poor her” and pitty her and thinks she has the hardest life. The other thing that really gets to me is this- I feel like she really is seeking attention from cutting and although I will always be there for her when she tells me about it and support her and make her feel better.. a part of me thinks I’m actually hurting her more. I think I’m giving her what she wants and don’t think she’s ever going to try to change. I think she knows she can come to me for attention, pitty, and to make her feel good about herself. But what she really needs is help. She’s been through a lot in life and I don’t think she’s had it easy- but I don’t think the minder of thinking you have the hardest life ever and wanting people to feel for you always is healthy. Having friends who are there for you is great but having friends who just wanna complain about their horrible lives it bad. I think she needs someone to help her understand her roof problem.  

I’ve also noticed she seems to ditch people at the slitest sign that they have another friend who they’re slightly closer with. I think she’s really insecure and needs a ton of validation and attention for what she’s been through.. but what she really needs is help on how to cope healthy.

117,"sorry about how long this will be, i’m kinda just venting. im a girl, but guys with this problem feel free to share your experiences/advice as well.

i’m a 20 year old female (and a sophomore in college) who has always looked WAY younger than i actually am. at 10, i looked 7. at 14, i looked 10. at 20, i look 14. and it is actively ruining my life.

my entire life i’ve been told “i’ll love it when i’m 40 and look 25” yeah awesome for future me i guess but i’m not a “hot mom” yet. i’m a 20 year old girl who actively hates herself for looking like a middle schooler. 

i’ll be minding my own business at the gas station when people will come up to me and make unwanted comments about how i look “way too young to have a license”. i am literally 20. i’ve had my license for years now. wtf was gained from that comment?

i’ve had guys come up to me on the street and say (yes, they’d actually say this) “yo you’re kinda hot, but you look like you’re 12. how old are you??” i’ll tell them i’m 20 as i walk away (bc 1.) so rude and 2.) creepy) and they are in complete disbelief as to my real age. i’ll comment on a tiktok, and someone will reply to my comment saying “omg don’t take this the wrong way but i looked at your account how are you 20 you look like you’re 14 or 15” like, what other way am i supposed to take that???

i’m a bartender/waitress. i’m obviously the youngest one there, but i despise how my coworkers think i’m 12 instead of 20. always saying how “cute” i am. i get that they’re just trying to be nice, but they’re only like 5-7 years my senior. stop talking to me like i’m a lost little kid. 

it sucks how ppl say that shit to me when it’s completely unwarranted. checking out at the grocery store, getting dinner with my friends. some of my friends are 21, so they’ll be ordering drinks with dinner. the waiter will look at me and say “you look 14 so if you even try to order a drink i’m gonna just assume your ID is fake so don’t even try” 

do these ppl not realize these “harmless   comments” are extremely bad for my already-nonexistent self esteem? i’m sorry to throw myself a pity party, but it sucks. my entire life i’ve been told how young i look, how “baby faced” i am, the likes. i have fair skin and freckles, tiny lips and big blue eyes, so i understand i look somewhat childlike and young. i have known this since i was an actual child. every little comment like that just makes me feel worse about myself. and telling me that i’ll “love it” TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW does not erase the damage done to my self esteem for being teased throughout my entire adolescence for not looking my age. i’m just sick of never being taken seriously, and always being patronized for something i can’t control.",20Dec2020,1
118,"Hello everyone! 
For context, I am a 23F and I have been having issues lately getting a grip on my paranoia and I feel like I’ve exhausted all my options. 
I feel like I’m doing everything in my power to not suffer from this but maybe I’m missing something? I’m currently taking prescribed medications to counteract these feelings and I’ve been telehealthing my counselor continuously to help get my feelings out. I’ve also been working with a health coach to see if a healthier lifestyle would help me also, which I know will. 
Do you know if there’s anything else I can do to help myself? Pre pandemic, I had more control over my emotions and had most of my hypochondriac tendencies managed but since March, I’ve lost most of that control. ( But like, who hasn’t?) 
I am in constant fear that I’m either going to get my family or I sick, even though we all follow the CDC guidelines to the T. ( Except for my college aged brother who we make wear a mask in the house since he’s going in and out more constantly and being more exposed to people.) When I’m at work, I resanitize everything right after my coworkers do because I don’t trust them to clean everything as well as I can, which I know is pretty irrational and drives them crazy, but I cannot stop myself from doing it. I’m sure this all stems from me feeling like I’m losing control over my surroundings but I’m not coping. Does anyone have any suggestions? I just want to feel relaxed again and less on edge.
I’m so frustrated and I feel like I’m actually crazy. I appreciate any suggestions or advice. I feel pretty alone in this situation because my family members don’t have the same mindset as me, thank God.

I asked her why and she said that it didn’t work so I suggested that she give it to me instead. She agreed and now i have a train set. The problem is, i got it to work but the train tracks are only straight. There are no curved ones. Is this the way the normal train toys are supposed to be like? How do I order some curved ones if I need to ?

Also, she didn’t give it to me with a box but on the sides of the train it says, “North Pole Express Railroad Company” and “Holiday Express”

120,"I've been dating tis girl for about two weeks now and I feel like shes trying to play games with me, our first date went really well, we had a really great time and we decided that next weekend we would go to the zoo. So on Tuesday I bought the tickets, that night she told me that she was already at the zoo with her friend. This made me super pissed obviously. She explained that it was her friend, and it was a total surprise. I said it was okay since we just started dating I shouldn't be jealous already. Today we went to the zoo and surprise surprise she wants to leave early so we can meet her friends at the mall, she hadn't seen them in forever due to covid and i've been wanting to meet them so I said okay. 

We get there and I immediately feel like a third wheel, so me and a few of her friends go shopping for a while. A few hours later and I get a text message saying that shes getting a ride home from her friend. I was immediately pissed so I left the shop i was in to go home, on my way out I accidentally ran into her, she kissed me and said that she was going home. 

I used to have a crush on one of her friends a long time ago, so when literally everyone in the friend group ditched, me and this girl literally walked around and finished up christmas shopping for about 30 minutes and I asked her for advice about the girl I'm dating and she actually helped me out. 

When I get home I get a text message from my girl scolding me for hanging out with one of her friends I had literally NO history with. Now shes mad. 

My position is that she literally went on a friend date parodying our real date just to antagonize me and then dragged me to the mall with her friends, made me feel like a third wheel and then decided to ditch me there, only saying goodbye in a fucking text message, she only said bye in person ON ACCIDENT.

However, my sister and I are vegan and we do not like nor want to cook with meat or any other animal products but that's apparently all my mum wants to eat lately. To make things easier for her, I have been making her things she would usually eat but I replace the meat with vegan meats. I try to make it as good as possible so she will like it, but everytime she makes up a fuss about it. It's like fighting with a toddler. Then she starts complaining that we're starving her or that we don't care about her. I honestly don't know what to do.

125,"For a few days I noticed my laptop an Alienware 17 r4, was getting to almost 100c on the cpu so I decided I needed to take it somewhere to get it looked at. I've had the laptop for 2 years and had no prior issues to it. I went with a local business place that had tons of really good reviews and thought that would be the way to go. When I brought it in they told me they will run diagnostics on it and will clean/ replace the thermal paste. I got a call that night that everything was working correctly but my VGA fan should be replaced because it wasn't working that great. I agreed and for 2 weeks heard nothing so I decided to call and see what was going on. I was told after they installed the fan the laptop would turn on but screen was staying black, they tried hdmi to another monitor and nothing. So they decided that they are going to send it to another city to have someone else look at it to see what's going on.

This is where I'm confused on what to expect because I was told that it will probably be a motherboard issue and it will be a lot more expensive of a repair than what we agreed about. This was also never an issue before bringing it in, not once did i have any issues like this. I have not paid for anything yet, they sent my laptop to a different city without contacting me, and I have signed no contracts for a work order.

137,"So last night my best friend well call her Lilo told me that I had made her friend uncomfortable due to me making a move on her the night before last. We’ll call her friend Jess. So Jess and I had chatted away on this night after drinking with all my friends at my place, we made some food together and when we were done making food I decided to go ahead and go in for the the kiss. Jess had asked me for my snap and asked if I wanted to hang out the next day which I said yes this is what made me decide to go in and make my move. After I made my move she decided to leave because her ride had ride came for her.


The next day she told my friend Lilo she felt had left due to her being uncomfortable at my place because it’s a new environment for her. Jess ended up calling me early afternoon which I declined due to me being busy at the time and decided I’d go ahead and call her back once I was free. I saw nothing wrong with doing so. Later in the day she texted my friend Lilo that “I made a move on her.” My best friend decided to go ahead and tell me I made her uncomfortable because I made the move on her. I admitted to Lilo I did and showed her Jess even called me that same day after the night.



After this I pondered for a bit about weather I should talk to Jess about the situation. I felt disrespected in the sense that she told my friend I made a move and made her uncomfortable with doing so but yet she still added me back on snap and called me. 


I eventually texted Jess and told her I felt disrespected by the way she texted my friend. We ended up getting into a argument for a bit. She ended up showing me her messages with Lilo. In these messages go and behold it stated she felt uncomfortable at my house due to it being a new environment nothing to do with me making a move on her. She did text Lilo that I made a move but nothing with making her uncomfortable. Jess was sending me voice messages of her yelling basically telling me she doesn’t like me and that she felt uncomfortable at my place not with me which I wasn’t trying to have a full blown argument which I told Jess this. I then explained that there was a miscommunication between us and that it’s understandable that she felt uncomfortable at my place. I then told her I’m not upset at her for not liking me and that I don’t care.  That
 basically I’m upset at the fact that I was told some different then what she said. 

Jess ended up apologizing to me after this happened and basically told me she didn’t mean she didn’t like me and that she was angry at my friend for making the story way different.



What I’m wondering is why my friend Lilo would go and say some way different and mess the story up? She basically caused some drama between this girl I had a shot with. It made me feel embarrassed in way because I didn’t think I made her uncomfortable at all. 


A little backstory about Lilo she is a lesbian, I’ve asked her if she likes guys at all and she’s told me no. I’ve even talked to her about Jess before meeting her and she’s told me she doesn’t like her at all. She’s stated that Jess has made moves on her in the past and she doesn’t like her that way and that Jess makes her uncomfortable when she’s made moves. So with Lilo telling me this I saw nothing wrong with hitting on her friend.


Basically my questions are 

Why would Lilo tell me some way different?

Could she low key like Jess and by me hitting on Jess is made her jealous?

Also what are y’alls opinions about the whole situation in general?",20Dec2020,1

140,"TL/DR; My boyfriend met someone at his nee job. He thought he liked her, but apparently is over it. But he said to a friend it felt like love at first sight. I found this out by looking through his phone. 

My boyfriend (M23) of over a year and a half and I (F22) have been having some issues, but things have gotten better- or at least I thought they have been. 

Thursday he was acting off and when I asked him what’s wrong, he gave me some things he was doubtful about and I gave him my piece. Things were better and we moved on. I still felt weird this morning, so even though I know I shouldn’t have, when I woke up before him I looked through his phone. I had a bad gut feeling, that’s why I did it, and it was right. 

He got a new job at a middle school, my old middle school. A new teacher is starting. He added her on Instagram. I saw him messaging her and he just told me they were talking about what she missed when she left. But this morning when I looked, he asked her if she wanted Dunkin one morning. And offered to help her decorate her classroom when it comes to that point. Way more than what he told me. Then, I saw a message his sent to his friend referring to this girl. His words were to him, “I met someone. It wasn’t just an oh she’s cute, it felt like love at first sight.” This message was on Wednesday. 

My heart SUNK. He had plenty of opportunity to come to me and be honest. I was pissed and wasn’t good at hiding it. Later on today I confronted him. He was honest, he explained that it wasn’t necessarily her, it was more the insecurity of us. Which I guess makes sense. He said he doesn’t feel that way about her anymore. 

I don’t know how to get passed this. My dad is a cheater. He lied to me. He hid things from me. I don’t know how I can forgive him. I need to live with him going to the same job as her five days a week. Should I forgive him? Does he deserve my forgiveness?",20Dec2020,1
141,"Please strap in this is a crazy story that I’m going to keep short cuz I’m on mobile and will probably be deleting after I get a good consensus. 

So to keep it all short without leaving out any critical details; in 2016, I joined Twitter (hell site, I know) as a 16 y/o. This person, that I’ll call M, started messaging me. She was weird but idk. Only recently has she been becoming a problem.

I got a boyfriend last year who I love very much, and M is VERY jealous about this despite saying she’s not. Before we got together I sent her a fucking cat meme that said “you are my girlfriend” on it. I can understand this might cause confusion to her, but she turns around and claims this incident gave her PTSD, as well as the mocking my boyfriend did to her when she threw a hissy fit about it all. It wasn’t insults or direct harm, it was screenshots of her acc which was blocked by him with the text “LOL.” His friends joined in on laughing about it but they don’t know anything about it.

So anyway, obviously this sets off MASSIVE red flags in my brain. I stop talking to her. She starts talking to my brother. And this is where this gets nuts: 
She starts subtweeting me on her account saying REALLY sensitive stuff I entrusted with her because I thought we were friends. 

She claims she has taken screenshots of every text ive ever sent her since the beginning, annotated like a fucking book to my brother. Even sends the mega drive folder to him, and lo and behold, it’s true. Brags about how easy it would be to dox me. OBVIOUSLY I fucking block her ass. Things are quiet for a while. 

Fast forward a couple of hiccups. she sends me a “love note” through one of those twitter bots begging me to unblock her, to which I have to tell the bot owner to please delete it. I keep her blocked. My brother keeps talking to her, and she keeps revealing a LOT of uncomfortable and vaguely threatening information. She has commissioned me and my brother so she knows our last name through PayPal, and she uses it a LOT like it’s some sort of mini-brag. Months pass and she gets increasingly frustrated that I’m trying to avoid her like the plague. 

I’m skipping over some other get-back-togethers Cuz theyre not as important.

She threatens suicide and sends my brother a suicide note which she insists was NOT a suicide note but also claims she tried to drown herself that night. 
I unblock her after I’m literally forced to by an entire google doc she made threatening black mail from screenshots. I tell her I’m sorry I hurt her feelings, but she can’t keep obsessing over me like this in the span of MONTHS of not speaking over a cat meme. 

We talk a little every now and then but I make it clear i don’t want to be friends. Her former-friend contacts me and says M wanted to put my name in big letters on her website for Valentine’s Day. Lol. 

She keeps mentioning how nobody cares about me except my brother and my boyfriend, how I’m just a kid (I’m 18), and now I’m “focusing on one M&amp;M instead of the whole bowl” (her words). She genuinely thinks she’s what’s best for me. 

Recently I haven’t been speaking to her at all because she upsets me a lot just by existing and being generally threatening. This of course is pissing her off because she can’t take a hint and leave me alone. 

She messages my boyfriend after weeks of messaging him, me and my brother only to get exactly 0 responses and tells him me ignoring her is making her mad and she’s mad I drew gift art for someone whose best friend died from a gunshot in the same month her boyfriend’s mom got diagnosed with the big C instead of drawing gift art for her. I’m getting fucking fed up. She can’t let me go and it’s been a whole 2 years and no matter how long I ignore her or keep her blocked she just gets crazier and crazier and I don’t know what to do. If I block her she could dox me or put out screenshots or something. She genuinely thinks she’s “saving” me from something. She has this army of friends she cries wolf to whenever I block her and they come and harass me. 

Would I be the asshole if I blocked her? Am I the asshole? She’s neurodivergent if that helps but so am I. I’m sorry if the story is unclear, my head is a mess and so is this story. 

Big points, TLDR:

- she keeps a folder of screenshots of every text message I’ve ever sent her, annotated

- she threatened to kill herself because I wouldn’t unblock her 

- she has expressed the desire to “impregnate” me with her friend and to me in private messages (she is trans)

- she blackmailed me into unblocking her 

- she claims she has severe PTSD because my boyfriend made fun of her over the internet (this one is especially insulting) 

- every time I block her for months on end she doesn’t let up. She is obsessed with me and won’t let go.",20Dec2020,1
142,"My grad school degree is in English with Creative Writing, so my thesis was the beginning of a fiction novel. Since my advisor told me to “write what I know,” doing this caused me a few issues. 

The mother in the story: she likes Spotify, like my real mother does, but she dies outside the plot line. My real mother is very much alive and well. 

The father in the story: he’s a cop and drank a little too much a few times. My real dad has had experience with these in life. 


These were creative choices I made. The characters themselves aren't real, but I had to make them feel real. In essence, I related to the characters
too hard. Now I'm scared of what my parents are going to say once they read the story. 

I told my mom I was hesitant to check on how my thesis is being delivered to our house, and she got mad because she said I should care and the thesis is an expensive document. So now, I'm waiting on the inevitability to show them this thesis, the hole I seemed to have dug for myself. I don't want them to think I'm ungrateful or wish them ill, because I don't. I made my characters flawed; it's how they are.

144,"Hi guys. I just moved into a house with my boyfriend. My stepmom gave me her old nativity set (with no manger) and my dad gave me my deceased mom’s nativity set (with a manger). I don’t think my stepmom knows my dad gave me my mom’s nativity set. I set up my mom’s manger and realized I have nowhere to put my stepmom’s nativity set. They don’t really match the set I have up currently, so mixing them in might look a little strange. Think large, colorful figurines mixed in small, neutral colored figurines. If I had another manger, I’d just set my stepmom’s up somewhere else. I might just buy another manger so I can do this. But I wouldn’t know where to put it because we’re limited on flat surfaces. I feel like even setting up my mom’s manger is going to upset my stepmom. When I still lived with my parents, I liked to visit my mom’s grave around the holidays and every time I did, it put my stepmom in a bad mood. I hate that I’m even worried about her reaction, but I don’t want to cause any problems when they’re visiting on Christmas. What would you guys do if you were in this position?

She’s fine towards my sisters who are 10 and 12, but acts really mean towards me for no reason. She’s told me she hates me, wishes that I was old enough to move out, called me a mistake, has called me stupid for not getting A’s in my classes, etc. she has also said that she can’t stand to look at me sometimes because I look like my dad (he left us a few years ago) and she’ll refuse to look at or acknowledge me sometimes.

The worst part of it that’s starting to happen is that she got a new boyfriend of six months, and he treats me like shit. But my mom doesn’t even care. He swears at me, makes me get him things all the time because he’s too lazy, shoves me out of the way when he walks by, backhands me if I “talk back”. I have to walk his dog every day, clean his car every week, clean up after him, and I’m getting fed up with it.

I usually try to stay at my best friend’s house as much as possible but he just left for vacation so now I’m going to be stuck at home all winter break and my mom already yelled at me for like twenty minutes today for not doing very well on my finals and grounded me and her boyfriend hit me a few times again. I don’t know what I did to make her hate me so much but I don’t want it to be like this for the next few weeks. What can I do to not get on her or her boyfriend’s bad sides anymore?

Any advice would be appreciated",20Dec2020,1
146,"About a month and a half ago, me and my friend of four years started dating in secrecy. Yesterday, he sent me a text message saying he was confused about his gender because h doesn't like being masculine but he doesn't feel female either. I was born a boy and I feel comfortable being a man, so I didn't know how to help him. I told him I supported him and would always continue to in the future and told him to maybe try talking to our transgender female friend. We can't talk to our parents about this because my parents would make fun of me for being bi and having my friend my first partner. S/O's parents think his bisexuality is a phase and would tell him that he was a boy and still is. How else can I try to help him?

147,"So two weeks ago on a date with my girlfriend I basically told her I loved for the first time. I wasn’t actually planning to say it so soon, like we’re barely two months into exclusivity. It pretty much just came out of me and I didn’t even realize I said it until she had a surprised face. She then said to me “I’ll tell you when I’m ready”. Then like not even a minute later she said “Yeah I mean I love you too”. I’m thinking maybe she said that just to make it less awkward? Regardless I didn’t get upset when she didn’t say it back and just remained calm. 

Since then we haven’t said it. But like yesterday on our date I wanted to say it to her, but I don’t know I just don’t want to be clingy or something, and since we’re not even two months in to exclusivity. Like is it wrong for me to say it at this stage? Should I wait for her to bring it up this time?

Side question: The last date was yesterday, and I’m planning to call her up Monday if she doesn’t reach out. Does that work or is that too soon? I do want to give some space after the date.",20Dec2020,1

150,"It hit me in the middle of the night that I’m doing the same song as a friend I had a huge falling out with did last year for the SAME competition. (She verbally attacked me so badly at a rehearsal, and I’ve been avoiding her for half a year because no one has ever freaked out at me like that) 

It’s also the same KIND of dance. 
Like for reference, imagine she did an acoustic version of “sex and candy” on pointe and that’s exactly the same thing that I’m doing, just by a different artist. (That’s not the song or style, I’m just trying to maintain some anonymity because I am that scared of her lol) 

This is NOT good. I already purchased my entire costume which was expensive and wouldn’t really work for another song… I also choreographed almost all of it. It’s going to be in a month, so I think I’m stuck with this… I also really like my concept and the only thing that’s similar is the style of dance and of course the song. 

I am genuinely scared of this girl, and if it wasn’t being live streamed instead of having an audience, I feel like she would try to sabotage me or something. To make it worse, the only person that can help me with this particular style is her best friend. If I book a session with her best friend, she would obviously know ahead of time… But maybe she would be able to talk her down. Idfk. It was a huge and incredibly stupid oversight on my part, but I feel like that’s going to be pretty hard to believe because her routine was very good and very memorable. I literally remember her choreography but for some reason I thought it was to a different song. I’m dumb. 

I know she’s going to talk a lot of shit about how much better she is, and honestly that’s true. Anything negative she could say I would probably agree with. I have a lot of confidence in myself as a dancer, she is just far more seasoned. I know my routine will be good and still unique, because our styles are night and day. 

But I feel like the whole thing is being brought down because of the song choice, and I feel really shady about it. Honestly, I would be pretty pissed or at least feel weird if one of my friends did the same exact song I did last year too. And she HATES ME. There are so many songs to choose from, I probably wouldn’t tell anyone it upset me but I would definitely be a bit bothered... I think artists are just weird like that and overly sensitive about our work. I honestly think it might be too late to change it, even if I wanted to. It would piss of the person coordinating it at the very least. I already know what she would say if I told her the situation. I know she would tell me not to care and do my thing. 

I obviously meant no harm, and I’m having gut wrenching anxiety about this. I have even considered dropping out, but that would be letting a lot of people down and I don’t think it’s fair. This year has been really hard for everyone, and the fact I have an opportunity to dance again in a well thought out situation safety wise has been saving my mental health...but I haven’t worked on it since I realized it was her song. I am completely uninspired now, and only feel anxious about it. I feel like I lose either way… Advice? 

TLDR: I am doing the same dance in the same style (apparatus) as a friend I had a huge falling out with, I already made my costume and choreographed it before I realized. I’m not even sure if I could change the song if I wanted to. It’s really messing with me and I don’t know what to do.",20Dec2020,1
151,"I used to be best friends with my cousin's boyfriend. For about 3 years, we did everything together, and hung out pretty much every day. He was the first friend I felt I could actually open up to about real shit too, not just bullshit about common interests. But she cheated on him in April, and they immediately broke up. He didn't move on initially, and was still trying to win her back, constantly texting her. However we both seemed interested in still being friends. Because of covid, we barely saw each other, but we would text each other now and then, and we did meet up a few times.

However I hadn't heard from him in months. I had heard that he's not cut off all contact from my cousin, deleted her off social media. So I texted him yesterday to ask how his exams went. And he never responded. I understand how it might be hard for him to be friends with me if I remind him of my cousin, but the worst part is I don't even like my cousin! She's a stupid narcissistic stoner airhead with very little redeeming personality traits. I barely see her outside of family events, and I never text her.

I live in a decently large suburban area in the midwestern US and thanks to that there are plenty of options around (grocery stores, video games shops, car washes, and so on). I’m close to finally getting around to getting my driver’s license, so transportation shouldn’t be a problem as I’ll have access to a vehicle. All that is beside the point though. 

What things could I do to prepare myself mentally (and maybe physically if need be) before I start applying in a few months? I am usually very quiet and can be a bit awkward around other people if I can’t relate to them very well. What might be something that I could work on to get over that? 

From your own experiences, what did/do you do if there were shifts you thought were boring? 
What types of people might I expect to work with? (I understand that that might be a difficult question to answer as there are many types of people, but anything helps.) 

I mentioned that I don’t do well around other people sometimes. Redditors who were/still are that way, what job has either worked for you or helped you to get over that (if that makes sense at all)? 


How did/do you deal with “bad” customers?

Is there anything you think I should know that wasn’t something I asked?

153,"Hey all! So I’ll just start off by ripping off the bandaid, in my(F19) last relationship my ex was (unintentionally) emotionally and sexually abusive towards me. I honestly can’t say the last sentence is 100% true because I have no idea, the lines are really blurry between “he manipulated me” and “I didn’t show any signs anything was wrong”, but regardless, mentally I was scared from it.

My biggest thing was I have a lot of anxiety around sex and touching my partner or being able to be turned on to the point I thought I might be asexual. I met a guy in March of this year (9 months after ex) and we started talking, making it official by July. It took us until this December to actually touch each other in those ways. We did a lot of stuff over the phone (we were long distance from august-December) and we’ve now done everything except actual sex. I think I’ve improved greatly. 

When we got together in July I started seeing a therapist but I did not like her and quit after two sessions. I want to say that my insurance does not allow me to do specialized therapy so I can’t see a sex therapist, only a general therapist. After that I went through phases of thinking everything is okay to downward spirals. In October I reached out to get help again. The new therapist I only saw once, I really liked her and opened up a lot more than I did with the first, but at the end of our session she told me I was experiencing something completely normal and I did not need therapy, which made me feel invalidated and after we hung up I had a massive meltdown where I told my boyfriend I couldn’t do it anymore and I didn’t want to try anymore. We took a week break from talking about anything sexual, and it helped greatly. I began seeing another general therapist through my school who I like a lot, I’ve met with her twice now but the thing is now that I can see my boyfriend regularly I’ve overcome everything I was concerned about. Sure I have some small anxieties, like that he hasn’t made me finish yet(not his fault, the situation was out of his control), or that when I get turned on I’m very easily turned back off randomly, but I think that stuff is normal and you will always have a little bit of worries.

She gave me a few tasks last time I saw her 3 weeks ago (one of which was keeping a journal) and I admit I did none of them, which is another reason I don’t want to see her Monday. I also just don’t know what I would talk to her about, because everything is going fine now, although when school starts again in late January we go back to long distance so I suppose it could come back then idk.

I honestly really want to just cancel, but I know my bf would be disappointed even if he doesn’t express it openly to me. I’m not sure what I should do, I really don’t want to go on Monday though.",20Dec2020,1
154,"
He’s been on my mind lately which is weird because I broke up with him in October because of how he made me feel very insecure about myself (wouldn’t stand up for me when his friend would make fun of me/would join his friend in those “jokes”. Cheated on me with my ex friend and I felt like he would subconsciously compare me to her). When I broke up with him I tried to stay as friends (Ik dumb but I did have some “good memories” with him idk ) but that didn’t work out, just being around him made me feel uncomfortable so I cut all contact with him. SO WHY DO I HAVE THE URGE TO TALK TO HIM AGAIN UGHHH.
Is it wise to speak to him again? (Maybe not actually....) but please help me. How do I get over this urge? He still follows me on all my social media/still likes my posts/watched my stories a minute after I post. I know I should block him but ughh.",20Dec2020,1
155,"I am confused if i should apologise to my ex after 2-3 months of the break-up.. she had already gotten over the break-up (within 2-3 weeks) and now idk if an apology would be correct on my part?

So I'm confused that saying sorry to my ex now would be a good idea or not, considering she had (or has idk) anxiety disorder and I don't want to unnecessarily bring up the past to hurt them or myself anymore. I have this fear that even if i apologise and they say some nasty stuff that throws me off my balance as I'm handling this break-up all by myself without any friend (but one, to occasionally talk to about) and not going out anywhere either due to work and I don't want to hamper my progress because of that as I am still very emotional about it all and can't bear anymore hatred from them. I talked to my friend about this and he said that it's always good to let them know that you realised your mistake so idk.. I'm pretty confused..like is an apology even necessary now? Am I just holding onto the past when everyone else has moved on?

156," My fiance thought it was a good idea to take ALL of the presents that I got for our kids that were going to be from ""Santa"" and put them under the tree. I asked her why, and she told me that her parents thought that it was a waste of money to pretend there was a santa every year and so they never believed.    

One, I completely understand where they're coming from saying that it is a waste of money, but, I grew up with Santa like 90% of kids do. That's a sacrifice you take for your children, its christmas its what you do!!!  I dont care what she didnt grow up with. Two, she could've told me or even talked to me about it. The last 5 years, my son has had presents from Santa because we lived at my moms and she didn't complain then because shes scared of my mom. Now that we live together, shes going to do this? My 5 year old has even talked about Santa lately, he remembers santa from past years and now just because she didn't have Santa presents growing up our kids can't either? Yeah no. 

 I went out and bought $387 worth of gifts to put out on Christmas day from Santa, and she goes, grabs them from the hiding spot, and puts them under the tree for the kids to see. So, I did what any man in this position would do, I went out and bought more presents to put under the tree but this time, they're going under there when they're supposed to. 

I just want her to celebrate Christmas like I do, I understand where she's coming from but.. our son already thinks there's a Santa!!! Now on Christmas, if I wasn't to put the new Santa gifts out, he'd think Santa doesn't love him and I dont ever want my sons feeling unloved.",20Dec2020,1

158,"This is really long but I felt I had to paint as best of a picture as I could.

I'm 33 and earlier this year I moved in with my mom and grandma so I could save up for a house. I lived an hour away beforehand but during visits with my mom I started noticing things starting about 5-6yrs ago. She wasn't going up to her bedroom much and was just sleeping on the couch in our living room. She said it felt good on her back. This eventually turned into her sleeping on the couch every night. She also sleeps in her clothes and wears the same thing multiple days in a row. Then I noticed she has a musk all the time. It's not super strong but it's kind of like a person who just worked out and is going to shower... except my mom doesn't shower. She washes her hair but she doesn't shower. She also has bad breath. I never see her brush her teeth. All the time I see her in the mornings before I go to work, no teeth brushing. I see her at night before she goes to bed, no teeth brushing. 

My mom lies on the couch all day and watches tv. That's her life. Earlier this year every time I walked by I'd ask what she was watching and it was the same movie. Over like 2-3 months she watched the same movie about 16x. She watches hours and hours, day after day of tv. I kept track once and for several days whenever I left for work she'd be in bed (aka the couch). If I came home for lunch she'd be in bed. When I came home she's still on the couch. She really only gets up to get something to eat or to use the bathroom. My mom does watch my sibling's kids on occasion and it's probably the most she moves around. She often comes home saying she's physically exhausted and this can sometimes go on for more than a day. ""Oh my back is still hurting from watching the kids..."" When my mom cooks she will complain about how much her feet hurt. There have been times I've brought up that if she exercised this might not be an issue and sometimes she'll say I'm right and other times she'll say she hurt her foot recently. She'll also do things like if we're running errands together she'll ask me to drop her off in front of the store instead of having to walk from the parking spot. She also never walks upstairs in the house. She'll ask other people to do things for her that would otherwise require her to walk upstairs.

My mom is overweight. She's always been a bit overweight but not bad. She's tried to lose weight over the years but she'll go about a week then stop. Then she really stopped taking care of herself and this has gotten worse. My dad divorced my mom and one of the reasons was that she wasn't taking care of herself and he didn't want to care for the health issues that would probably arise later in life. To give her some credit because she deserves it, my dad cheated on her their entire relationship and he wanted to go be with his current girlfriend. This was about 11yrs ago. My mom and grandma (who's lived with us my entire life) raised my 4 siblings and myself for the most part. My mom lugged all us kids around, made it to 99% of all the games and plays between us all. My dad was not a good husband. My siblings and I knew this even when we were in elementary school. We knew our parents didn't love each other.

My mom's speech has also gotten lazier. She says ""literally"" and ""you know"" all the time. That second one bothers me the most to the point that I've had to ask her to stop and slow down. We have a word that I can say to let her know that she's saying ""you know"" too much. But now when I say that word my mom gets mad at me. She says she's not free to speak. But I kid you not, when she speaks it sounds like this: ""So *you know*, Dom came over yesterday to, *you know*, get her present and *you know* how she said she was feeling stuffed up, *you know*? Well she's now feeling sick and *you know* she talked to her doc and, *you know*, needs to get a covid test. So... *you know* I just thought you should know, *you know*?"" This isn't an exaggeration. It pains me to hear. It makes it so hard to listen to her. I can barely get past this and the overuse of ""literally"". I have OCD and this type of repetitive behavior makes my blood pressure sore and stresses me out. 

Earlier this year I sat down with my mom and asked her if she's depressed. She said no and to be honest, I think I believe her. She does not seem depressed at all. I asked if she was not depressed why she does these things? I asked if it was laziness because I can't think of what else it would be. My mom almost acted like I was coming out of left field. She kind of acted amused almost. My mom used to be so involved with church functions and she had close friends. Now she just has her kids and she says we're her best friends. For me, one of the worst parts is that her behavior has led to her lying. There have been times I've asked if she's showered and she says she has when I no without a doubt she hasn't. For a while she kept saying she was going to order a new mattress and when I'd come to visit I'd ask where the mattress was. After 3 months I asked again and she snapped and told me she lied because I was always on her about the mattress and she'd actually never ordered it. She's told me she brushes her teeth but there's no evidence. 

I love my mom and I'm deeply disturbed by the things I've mentioned here. Please be kind when mentioning her in any comments. I really want to help her. I just don't know what's going on and what I can even do. I've talked with her, nothing. I've offered to exercise and eat healthy with her, nothing.",20Dec2020,1

Over the course of a week, someone has ordering pizzas using my friend’s phone # and address. Whoever is doing it, they’re doing through every single pizza place possible. What are his options?",20Dec2020,1
160,"Hey Reddit! 

I’m at the point where I’m not sure whether a girl will like me back more than just a friend. She’s mentioned that she enjoys being around me because she’s able to be herself and that she knows that I have her back. 

We met last year and hung out a couple times before quarantine and didn’t start hanging out on a regular basis till about August of this year after I saw that it was her bday on Snapchat and wished her a happy birthday. She was in a relationship at the time when I first met her and was in a different one when we started hanging out more.

About 3/4 weeks ago, she broke up with her ex and told me about it as she was waiting for her ex’s friend to leave so she could do it. It was described as a toxic relationship because it seemed to her that the guy wouldn’t want to listen and make things work out between them when they got into arguments. 

When we started seeing each other more in August, we would make dinner plans together and have them at the house that I’m renting with a few friends. 

Before her breakup, we would only see each other every other week or so. I have dropped off food for her a few times and usually would cook the meals. She also didn’t talk much about her ex at the time and I only found out by asking her if she was seeing anyone. 

Post breakup, we’ve seen each other about once a week now and I have indirectly expressed interest in her by still making food, tempered chocolate to dip strawberries in, told her good night a couple times, and got her a small Christmas gift even though I’m not in the greatest financial situation after being let go from my job, which happened in the same weekend as her break up. I haven’t wanted to bring up the conversation about it cause the break up is still pretty fresh IMO nor do I want to make the friendship awkward if she’s not into me. 

She usually would come over by herself, but she invited a couple of her friends over the last time we hung out. I was able to ask one of her friends if she was interested in me, but friend wasn’t sure about it and suggested I should stick around still to see. I do get mentioned in conversations, but it seems that it’s usually about when we hang out and what we do, but not much more than that. I know that it’s a basic girl thing to do so that her friends know where’s she’s at just in case if anything happens to her. 

Also the first time we took a selfie together, which she hopped into while I was trying to take a photo of me and my roommate in the background mixing music, so it turned into a close up of me and her. 

Since I’m the one who usually initiates the plans, my roommates suggested that I should let her spark the next time we hang out. 

I started getting really anxious about it a day or two after and send her the selfie we took, which she saved, plus one of those Christmas lights drive thru events that’s going on nearby to see if she wanted to go with me. We’re going on the Sunday after New Years, but I think I’m going to see if she notices if I don’t initiate anything else before that, but still reply to her ofc. 

I’ve told her that I’ve been more content with myself over the last month because she’s been around more in my life as well that I miss her every time she leaves. And yes, I do realize I shouldn’t be relying on her like that completely. 

I’m hoping y’all can weight in your opinions about it! 

TL:DR - Not sure if this girl will ever like me more than just a friend and want to see if she would miss me too if I don’t initiate contact for the two weeks before we have plans together again.",20Dec2020,1

164,"Throwaway account. This might be a long one. Everything I know about their relationship comes from word of mouth from my husband, certain of his friends and my MIL, and my observations of their communication and his interaction with his daughters.

My husband (H) met his ex-wife (EW) when he was in his early twenties. Their relationship was normal enough for the several years that they dated, and eventually they married. They both became attorneys. A while into their marriage, some problems arose... I want to preface this by saying I don't necessarily believe sex is a physical *need (*as in, you won't die if you don't have it, and you're not automatically entitled to it with anybody)*,* but I do believe it is extremely important for the sexual desires of both partners to be met, and are normally naturally met, in a healthy relationship. Sexual desires are often coupled with the need for physical intimacy.

Anyway,  EW stopped having sex with H, except on rare occasions. H believes this is because she suffered from sexual assault as a teenager, which is understandable. However, she often laughed at him when he tried to initiate. She would hold sex over his head, falsely insinuating that it would happen more often if he did more of the chores or certain favors for her. When they did have sex, she would make comments like ""Let's get this over with,"" and ""Are you almost done?"" It was after they decided to have a child that they began having sex once a month, when she was ovulating. They didn't have it at all once she got pregnant, and then about 9 months after the birth of their first daughter, she stopped taking her birth control without informing H and had sex long enough to get pregnant with their second. Again, no sex during pregnancy, and irregular, infrequent intercourse afterwards. Additionally, there were rarely moments of non-sexual physical intimacy, like hand-holding, cuddling, hugs, caresses, etc. He tried doing nice things for her, and even got into really good shape, but nothing improved their relationship.  

They argued a lot- long, screaming arguments that resulted in lots of damaged household objects- often in front of their children. She rarely considered what he wanted in any matter that should have been discussed or a joint decision (just for one example, the kids were raised Jewish, even though he is Christian. He's not bothered by it, but he wishes there was more of a discussion instead of her just *deciding*). Almost everything had to be the way she wanted it. Things got so bad that he got into the habit of shutting down when they disagreed and just going along with whatever she said, just to temporarily maintain the peace. (He used to do that a lot in our relationship, too, before I told him how abnormal it is and how much I disliked it.) They started having casual conversations less and less; they rarely asked one another how their days went and such. An example of the way she viewed herself as expressive of ""love,"" as revealed in later marriage counseling, was occasionally bringing him home a kombucha from the grocery store. 

Eventually, he resorted to seeking intimacy with someone else- that someone was me. I will interject here that I don't condone cheating or dishonesty, even in such an unfulfilling relationship. I was younger then, and often dated older men who were cheating on their wives. I was not in the best of mental health, and I used sex to fill a hole in my life, and men to get things I wanted. I'm not proud of that era of my life, and there are certainly things I would have done much differently. The guilt of participating in the hurting and betrayal of other women haunts me. However, every day that I wake up next to my husband, I feel such profound gratitude that I met him, that he wouldn't sleep with me on the first couple of dates, that we fell in love, and that he helped me to begin healing. I like to think that I helped him heal a bit too, as everyone close to him says he's been so much happier and vibrant since he met me. I try my best to take really good care of him, because he deserves it. 

EW found out about the affair through looking through his phone and hacking into his email. As you can imagine, much hurt and fighting ensued. He moved out, leaving her the house, despite continuing to pay the mortgage. She changed all of the locks and forbid the children from telling their father the code, despite him never entering or wanting to enter the house after moving out. Their divorce, while civil, financially f\*\*\*ed H over, and he now pays her 4k a month, despite the fact that she has more assets. He agreed to this so that she can continue to make the mortgage payments and so his kids can remain in the house they grew up in. 

She has been saying nasty things to the girls about H and I ever since she found out about the affair. We believe this has been a huge factor in the poor way his elder teenage daughter (ED) has reacted to her parents eventual divorce, and to me when we were eventually introduced. We don't think she is coping well, and EW has not been supportive in our efforts to get ED to therapy. 

We all live together now, and it's been nearly 3 years since my introduction. I've always been polite and helpful to his daughters; I've never done anything deserving of hatred to them- although I'm sure I've made some minor social blunders here and there. While his younger daughter (YD) and I have a great relationship, ED refuses to interact with me. She will leave the room if I walk into it, or the dinner table if I sit down to eat with the rest of the family. She is often angry, stomps or slams things, and speaks curtly or sometimes even blatantly disrespectfully to her father. This has been a great source of stress for him and has wreaked havoc on their relationship; I'm sure it has taken years off of his life, the pain of the situation gnawing at and slowly killing him. We've tried being patient and alternatively stern with her. We don't know how to fix it. He worries that he is a bad father. He absolutely lost his s\*\*\* tonight over her attitude, and had to spend time in the basement screaming out his frustration, hitting the punching bag we have down there, and eventually going for a drive just to cry in privacy. (They've since made up, but man was that stressful. I was worried he was going to have a heart attack or aneurysm, or get into a car wreck.) 

I am second-trimester pregnant with my first child (H's third.) H has been overjoyed; he is looking forward to not being working as much and being able to be there more often than he was with his first two daughters. Obviously ED didn't take it well when she found out about the pregnancy, and I don't imagine EW took kindly to the news either. Since we've told the girls (and we assume they told her), she's been particularly difficult to deal with. She's stopped communicating with H about appointments and weekly drop-off and pick up times, choosing to only inform the girls who then tell H. She's been scheduling things so that the time spent with H is being interfered with, and of course it would be awkward to tell his children they're not permitted to go with their mother when decides to pick them up. It's also not great when they have to spend their precious time here panic-packing their things because EW says she's coming in an hour. The only time she concedes additional time with the girls is when she has a date scheduled on one of the days she's supposed to have them.

I've wanted so badly to meet with EW and just have a talk. Firstly, to apologize and acknowledge the affair and her feelings about it. I'd let her rage at me and cuss me out, if that would make her feel better. Secondly, so that she finally meets the person whom she s\*\*\*talks and whom her daughters are living with half the time. I feel like in her mind, I'm still the young whore who wrecked her home and is just mooching off H, instead of the wife who loves him dearly and is now trying to model a happy and healthy relationship for their children. Thirdly, I want to tell her that what she's doing- using their daughter to disrupt our home, sour our pregnancy, and  continue to hurt my husband after previously abusing him for over 20 years- is just f\*\*\*ing *wrong*. That even though he wronged her years ago, that he's still a good man, a good father who would do anything for his kids, who's working his a\*\* off to provide for *all* of us. That we deserve all deserve peace and happiness, and that nobody can have that until she lets it go... She doesn't even have to forgive him, just move on, you know? But my MIL says she can't even stand to hear my name brought up in conversation, so I doubt she would agree to meet with me. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel so helpless in this situation. I don't even feel like I can offer enough emotional support, when H's distress is so extreme. My step daughters are dear to me, and I don't want either of them to have to deal with this mess. I don't know who to turn to for help, either.",20Dec2020,1

167,"Hello fellow Redditors,

Things got really messed up for me the last couple of days (made another post a few days ago if you are interested in what happened).

Long story short: a girl (18), which I (m,19) never intended to have a romantic relationship to, gave me some signs that she wants one. Now my mind got all mixed up and I cant stop thinking about her.

Things even get worse when I think about the fact that we have the same friends and hang around most of the time while being in school.
Additionally, a friend (m,16) started ghosting me, (likely) because he saw her approaching me.

What should I do now?",20Dec2020,1

He said he'd ground me if I locked the cat door and is propping my window open anytime I leave the house. 

I'm pretty sure he's only doing this to show he can control the house because he's just like that sometimes. He's stubborn and won't listen to me.

170,"This is a bit uncomfortable to write but I really need a 3rd party point of view on this. Honesty would be so appreciated. 

So, I’m a very private person, I’m paranoid with loads of trust issues, and don’t feel close with anyone aside from my cats. 

However, I like new things and meeting people, I just don’t really form deep connections with anyone. Almost everyone I call friends I don’t think about unless I see them or am asked about them.  

Those friends also don’t really know much about me. They know a few of my hobbies, that I love my pets, and maybe what classes I’m taking but I’ve never shared anything from my past or any below the surface feelings with anyone. I haven’t even had the majority of them come to my apartment. Like I said, paranoia and trust issues. 

That’s all good and dandy but I’ve just recently noticed a pattern. A lot of my friends think we are much closer than I feel we are.

If it was just 1 or 2 people saying I was their best friend I’d write it off as people without a lot of other friends or hyperbole. But it’s not. It’s a lot of the friends I’d probably consider acquaintances or work friends at best for really intimate things. 

Like inviting me to join their family for the holidays, talking about their latest therapy session and the side effects of their meds, or being in their wedding party close. 

I feel like shit because I just don’t feel that close. If I was to pick my best friend I’d pick my cats or maybe my mom, not these people asking me to be their kids godmother. 

I feel shitty saying no or that I can’t but I’m lost. 

I’m so confused as to what to do, should I tell these people I don’t feel the same way? Or am I just being dramatic or an ass? Did I do something to make them feel like I was close to them? I treat practically everyone the same, say hello, ask about how they’ve been, hang out if asked but I don’t ever take the first step to make plans or share myself.  

I feel horrible and I just don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t want to hurt anyone but the main reason I’m always trying to see people or try new things is because it usually helps with my depression, keeps me busy and surrounded by positivity.  Now I’m just drowning in anxiety and feeling like a terrible person.",20Dec2020,1

172,"Hey everyone. I [23M] really didn’t know where else to post this but I am 99% sure my step-dad was making fun of me tonight as I was saying goodbye to everyone. I feel a bit crazy because he didn’t joke about it to me, but basically to others in the room you know? I was struggling tonight with my anxiety and so I didn’t talk much and kept to myself so I just wanted to get out of there.

As I was leaving I asked when people are getting together tomorrow and he asked “Well when are you getting up these days?” And I said “I don’t really know.” And he started laughing “Oh Good Ole Uncle [Brad]” in a sort of mocking way and laughing towards the other adults. He knows what I’m dealing with and that I’m struggling... it’s been a problem for years. I’ve struggled for so long and part of the reason is because of him and growing up in that household.

I don’t know how to handle it because I want to see my younger siblings and all that tomorrow but I don’t know if I can be around him anymore. I’m pretty sure it was a joke making fun of me because I certainly wasn’t laughing.

176,"Hello, I am a junior in college and I've been living with my bestfriend/roomate since my freshman year. We have usually always gotten along. But ever since our classes were moved online this semester and we are both in our apartment 24/7, she has started to display very concerning behaviors when it comes to me and I have a huge problem with it. 

First of all, she eats my food. Whenever I cook food she assumes I'm making food for her too and just eats my food, which in my opinion is very rude. She doesn't even ask to eat what I made, she just eats it lol. I take a lot of time out of my day to cook everyday and she doesn't, and also she never pays me back for the cost of ingredients or anything. She just eats my food and rarely offers to do the dishes afterwards. So I have to clean all the pots and pans that I used and she just eats my food and sits on her ass and does nothing. Half the time she throws the food away, which I hate a lot. And it really offends me lol. 

She never vacuums or mops, and I do both. She never washes any of our shared items (e.g. blankets, pillowcases, etc.) and I am always left to do it. The only chore she really does is that she washes her own dishes. Her own room and bathroom are filthy, which I don't really care about, but she also leaves the living room dirty every time she's there and that is my issue with her. 

My main issue is that she's rude to me. She always has some snarky comment to make whenever I'm doing anything. For example, I'll be opening a package and she'll watch me the whole time and say something like ""omg why are you so slow"" and I'll be like ""??? did i ask you??? Why are you watching me open my own package."" And then she'll scoff and walk away. Also, if I get a simple fact wrong, for example, if I say ""I think Leo DiCaprio has brown eyes"" she'll say ""you fucking idiot they're blue. You're so dumb."" Idk why she says this to me. Not to be rude, but we both know I'm way smarter than her but for some reason she always makes comments about how dumb I am and she's incredibly rude about it. I've talked to her before and I've asked her to stop, but she'll always stop for a couple days and then start it back up again. I'm so tired of it. 

She has become increasingly clingy towards me too and it is very very irritating. I have a boyfriend and many friends of my own whereas I am her only friend in town. Any time I want to go anywhere she assumes she has an open invite to come with me and she always tags along. She'll get mad at me if I'm talking to my boyfriend on the phone for ""too long"" because she wants to spend time with me. My best friend from home (also my oldest friend who doesn't know my roommate) and boyfriend visited me at my apartment in the last month and she didn't give me time alone with any of them. She just stayed in the room the entire time and didn't realize that she was intruding. Only when I told her to leave the room, she left, and she got very offended when I did so lol. She also watches me change. Like if we're getting ready to go somewhere and she gets ready before me, she will come into my room and watch me get ready. She has watched me change my clothes on multiple occasions. She just stares. And I've said things like ""what are you doing"" or ""are you really just gonna stare at me while I change"" and ""why are you in my room"" and she doesn't get that she's being really creepy and intrusive. It's so weird. 

She is so incredibly obsessed with me and it makes me uncomfortable and it's really intruding. She's an art major and I'm a biology/spanish major and I have much more work to do than her, and she tries to make me feel bad for studying and doing homework over spending time with her. She has been acting really toxic towards me and I can't handle it anymore. I'm starting to grow a very real and intense hatred towards her and I plan on talking to her when we both return to our apartment in January. I thought that some distance would help me calm down about this issues but it's only made me more angry. 

How can I speak to her and get my thoughts out and preserve our friendship? I should add, she is very very sensitive. She can dish it out but she can't take it lol. If I spoke to her the way she speaks to me she would not want to be friends with me...

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!!",20Dec2020,1

anyone have advice on constantly feeling inferior? i grew up always being undesirable and a loser, and now, all of my insecurities have gone away in the magic that is puberty, and i cant shake the feeling.

180,"She will literally find every single way to make me upset, and then yell at me when I tell her off.

Example: 

Brief backstory: my mom is opening a sandwich place soon and we had planned for me to work there.

Ok so I was sitting in the kitchen, minding my own business, when she decided out of nowhere to tell me that I needed to get a haircut before I stared working at her place. I didn't really see the correlation so I said (in a completely calm and relaxed tone)  ""I don't see the problem"" and she just fucking exploded. She was like ""you see the problem is your shitty attitude towards everything, you think can do whatever you want and you're gonna be a terrible employee if you act like this"" ...... HUH? I was literally so confused on why she was blowing up out of nowhere when I didn't do anything wrong so I said ""I don't have an attitude I just asked why I need to cut my hair"" and then we stared fighting over how I thought I didn't deserve to be yelled at for asking a question and she thought I was being a condescending asshole with a shitty attitude.

I don't even understand why I need to get a haircut. I get that my hair would get in the food but I could just wear a hairnet or something? I don't think a haircut is the only option, and on top of that, I don't want to get one anyways, I mean, I have a pretty common haircut, I highly doubt every single other person with my haircut is changing it for their employers, or maybe I'm just naive. I honestly think this is just a lame excuse for her to get me to cut my hair, because SHE doesn't like it, which I don't care about because it's MY hair.

182,"hi good night, as the title says I need help in a matter with my best friend. 

To summarize my story, our friendship has not been very good since in the middle of this year, due to an event, I was given a continuous paranoia, consequently I basically lost almost everything I had on the internet: friends, my girlfriend, my mental stability and many things that you do not want to hire more so that you do not feel bad after writing this to us. I know that I should ask for psychiatric help and I am waiting for that but I live in Venezuela and the thing with the pandemic has not gone well for me, so it's obvious that I will have to wait to heal.

Now the only thing I could do was get away from her so as not to lose her because she's the person that matters most to me in this world, she has made me have good times and made me a very happy woman in my unhappy life. I went back to her because she wrote me a message saying that she was beginning to miss me and I really missed her too so.

But it was obvious that the thing was not going to last long because of my mental instability, the first weeks everything was fine but she started treating me badly for a few days and I had to leave again so as not to feel even worse.

Tomorrow i was going to write to her again to show her a drawing i made of the two us together and to tell her some things. but today it seems that he has completely ignored me and you know having this fucking paranoia does not help much and gave me a couple hours ago a nervous attack. she began to appear in my tl of twitter as if nothing, as if she had not written anything and well I started to cry because it seems that she's ignoring me for some reason... even when I started writing on whatsapp while having that attack, i was ignored even when she's ""online"".

She loves me very much (not romantic love) but i don't understand why she's doing this damage to my mental stability.

184,"So, this isn’t meant to spark any sort of political debate and please no hate comments- I just want some general opinions.
My fiancé and I just got engaged, we have been dating for 8 years. We moved to Charleston, SC 4 years ago, and have fallen in love with our new city. 

It’s important to note that my fiancé and I are very liberal. We have been extremely outspoken in support of the BLM movement, and believe whole heartedly in compassion and justice for all. We understand our white privilege and stand up against prejudice and the systemic racism that is rampant throughout America.
Although we can never fully understand the oppression non-white people face, our ears and eyes are open and we are continually learning on how to support our neighbors.

All that to say, something I really want for my wedding is to be married under oak trees and Spanish moss, a true Southern/Charleston aesthetic. I have a wedding planner and she suggested a property on Charles Towne Landing, which was a cotton plantation in the 1700-1800s and was the original settlement of Charleston as a city. It’s now a state park. The Avenue of Oaks on the property where we are having our ceremony was planted by a woman named Ferdi who inherited the property in the 1930’s, while also renovating and refurbishing the old overseers house, which is where we are having our reception. We picked this venue because of its beauty, the lush gardens, and the gorgeous row of oak trees that form a canopy over where our ceremony will be held. It’s honestly breathtaking.

One of my fiancé’s good college friends learned of our venue choice, and told us it was tone deaf given the state of 2020 and the BLM movement. She asked if there were any modern venues where we could have our wedding instead in Charleston.

Am I wrong in feeling completely deflated? We fully planned on having signage made to educate our guests on the property and what it was, paying our respects to the history here. The Civil War started in Charleston. Practically all of the land in SC was walked on by slaves. We can’t help that we live here, so I’m just confused and shocked as to why her comment to us is appropriate? I need help understanding someone’s perspective that doesn’t know us. I’ve talked to a bunch of my friends, and they have all said that it’s not her place to tell us where to have our wedding.

I can’t stop thinking about this. We knew the history prior to picking it. It is not recognized as a plantation. I shouldn’t feel like I have to justify my choice for my wedding venue to someone other than my fiancé. Was this a bad choice? Will our black and POC friends feel uncomfortable coming? Please be kind and help me process why I feel so mad and upset at this persons opinion. Is she right? She knows our hearts, so it’s just mind boggling to me that she would insinuate that our venue choice is tone deaf. Please help me understand why this venue choice is offensive due to “today’s current climate”?",20Dec2020,1
185,"I just wanna preface this by saying they are great friends and I truly love them, but I can’t help to feel that way.

So some people in my group of friends are gamer guys and girls and often play with eachother on pc games. I, on the other hand, ain’t much of a gamer unless its Nintendo games (I own a switch) and I do not own a pc.

All i’ve got is a macbook so no running big games on this thing. Buying a pc is absolutely not an option for me financially right now. But even if I wanted to, I don’t really know the games they play all that well. 

So no need to say, I feel left out when they all bond and get to play together while I’m just alone doing nothing at home.

But heres the kicker: where I live, there will soon be a second lockdown. From dec 25 to jan 11, non-essential places will be closed again just like the first lockdown.

I work in a store so at least working made me do something with my life and occupied my days so that I’d be alone less often, but now I’ll soon be jobless and homebound for two weeks. I have a feeling that my gamer friends will easily pass their days gaming with each other and getting some social interaction together whilst I’ll be alone again. 

The first lockdown was very hard for me mentally. I would try to sleep off my days as much as possible because I was bored and depressed from the whole situation. I could barely get out of bed and do anything constructive with my days because I had absolutely no energy or willpower to do so.

I know this is very much a me problem, but I really don’t know what to do. Like, I can’t just tell them they can’t game because I don’t. That would be totally stupid and selfish. But I also don’t know what to do about my feelings of solitude. 

Any help?
Thank you",20Dec2020,1
186,"heads up, I got carried away and it’s a long one!! Thank you in advance to anything tho &lt;3

TL/DR: oops I’ve been in school for 4 years now, I’m one semester from my degree, but now I’ve decided I wanna do a completely different career that would require another 2 years ish of school and I’m terrified to tell my family that! How tf do I do it!!!!! :)

soooo some background to flesh this out. I’m 21 now. I went straight out of highschool to a 4 year university. I had a scholarship and stuff. But. I went right from HS &amp; living w my family to living 3 hours away on my own. I was the first in my family to ever go to uni (2 older siblings 1 younger I’m the only girl also) and I felt like I had a lot of expectations both from those around and from myself personally. Some things happened, aaaand I got kicked out due to failing grades and mental instability. I moved back home and felt utterly. Lost. I had just gotten diagnosed with severe ADHD, severe depressive disorder, anxiety, paranoia, and just. A lump of stuff. I’m also the first in my family to get psychiatric help. So I was feeling even more confused about my own existence and where to go from there. 
I knew I wanted to stay in school and earn a degree but I couldn’t go anywhere (from failing transcripts) and I just. Didn’t see myself existing for another 2 years if you catch my drift. 
My parents convinced me to go to a local community college. So I did. Aaaaand long story short going there was one of the best decisions of my life. With some speed bumps. So. I’m working to my Associates degree (in Graphic Design&amp;Print). It’s taken me longer than the usual 2 years, and there are classes I just can’t seem to pass for the life of me. (3 specifically, 4 classes left to graduate.) online schooling does NOT suit me as a person either w the rona happening. 
My parents ARE paying for my associates degree (since after aid it isn’t much) and I’m SO SOSOSO thankful for them doing that. But they also are just like. “Can’t you just get these last few classes and be done?” Which like holy fuck I want to so bad. But. That brings me to where we are today. 

It’s Christmas break. I failed my online math class (I knew I would but my mom pressured me into doing it even tho me only having one class and it being online was a recipe for disaster). I only have 4 measly classes left to take. 2 are degree specific. 2 are gen ed (math &amp; eng2). not much. I’m literally on the last leg of earning that fancy paper I want so bad to be able to prove myself that I can do something. 
Since I didn’t really have much of a school semester, I got a job at a beauty supply shop. It’s local, and we sell wigs/hairpieces and a ton of beauty supplies like color, perms, hair care, you name it. Normally we call into salons we have the info for, see what they need, and pull their order and ship it to them. Simple. So I’ve been around just. Cosmetologists. And... working there. And being so close to finishing my degree. I keep getting questions of. “So what’s next after school?” And.... I don’t have an answer. Don’t get me wrong my job isn’t bad at all, it’s awesome, but I do NOT wanna stay there forever. And... I’ve just. I don’t know how to put it. 
I’m missing something I’ve never had. And I know what I want. I... want to go to cosmetology school. I already have the exact one, the course, the licensing specialty, all of that chosen. I want this so bad. Because 1/2 my job is sitting at a desk (accounting type stuff). And... the thought of sitting at a desk. 9-5. Monday through Friday. For the rest of my life. Terrifies me like nothing else. And being near the hairdressers, manicurists, aestheticians, barbers, all that, it’s made me so. So envious and yearning. I’ve always loved things like that. Makeup hair nails the works. I love helping other people look and feel good. And. 

I’m one semester away from a degree. At my second college. A year behind schedule. And... now I want a whole different career path and trade. 

Understandable yeah? Except. Where I mentioned I live with my parents still, and how they pay for my tuition. I... am so petrified. Of coming to them and saying. “Hey. These last like 3, 3 1/2 years I’ve spent tapping your pockets for this goal yeah so I wanna totally reroute that plan once I get that fancy paper and do another 2-ish years of school for a completely unrelated program thats actually a licensing trade.” 
Because. I just. I don’t have the money for it. I wanna move out soon with my gf and I especially won’t then. They don’t even know I have a gf THAYS a can of worms but. 

How.... do I tell them? What do I say? How do I approach that? I feel so.... guilty. And just like.... like I’d be letting everyone down and all this stuff. The thought of me even subtly mentioning the idea of it makes me sick to my stomach and my head ache. 

I know this is what I wanna do now with my life but I don’t know how to admit that to them. The idea of disappointing their standards for me again, even in just a change of path, horrifies me to my core. 

So like. How da FUCK do I even start that conversation with them?!?!?!",20Dec2020,1

TW// suicide, eating disorder, and depression. 


For 2 years I was sort of in love with a guy, but I always assumed that he’d eventually ask me out. I didn’t know how to tell him about my feeling so I just continued talking to him. He always told me that he was single and he always made sure that I was staying single as well. This lead me to believe that he would ask me out and that he was just waiting for the right time. Out of nowhere, he announced his engagement on 29th Feb. I was devastated and I felt used, but I didn’t want to confuse him or ruin his life so I simply congratulated him for it. I became depressed. Meanwhile, covid hit and we went in lockdown. Also, I was suffering with severe anorexia and his engagement made it worse. I called my friend and cried to her about what had happened and how ugly and unloved I felt after his engagement. She told me my feeling weren’t even “legit” and that I should just “get over it”. When I explained her that I was more hurt by the fact that no guy has ever asked me out. She said “your feelings are not even real”. I was sobbing on the phone and was shocked at how she was reacting because I was there when she had relationship issues and I have always been there for her even if it meant skipping school or not sleeping at night to talking her. Also, this was the first time I had ever complained about any of my relationship problems and she was almost yelling on the phone. 

After that call, I became very preoccupied with loads of uni assignments, suicidal thoughts, and anorexic behaviour. I didn’t  talk to anyone during those first weeks of March and neither did my friend ever check on me. After a month, my doctor was kind enough to get me into an eating disorder treatment centre where I wasn’t allowed to use my phone a lot because they had other activities planned for us. At the hospital, I was given a few hours to talk to anyone I wanted on the phone because of covid but I felt like no one could understand so I would never text anyone. I wrote in my journal instead. I couldn’t stop comparing myself to others so for the sake of recovery I deleted most of my social media accounts. 

Recently, another mutual friend asked me why I wasn’t talking to anyone and I explained her everything but she’s convinced that I was wrong and she wants me to apologize to that friend. 

Now, it has been 10 months and I often wonder if I was wrong for shutting out everyone without giving an explanation and becoming depressed. I just wanted to focus on my mental health and reconnect with myself. I felt completely lost after his engagement.",20Dec2020,1

192,"hi everyone ^_^ basically my friend is acting differently and it’s bothering me and i have no idea what to do.

we first met and started playing games online together a few months ago. there was a couple weeks where I would go online and they would instantly start playing and invite me. it was really nice, cause I’ve never really had anyone that invited me to do things before. there were a few times where we called randomly on discord at 3 am to talk about random stuff, which always left me with a smile on my face. i could just talk to this person for ages! 
but suddenly the last few weeks they’ve been pretty distant. they haven’t been on discord much, but when they are, they don’t reply to me. every few ish days we still play that game together, but i have messaged them within the game every time, and today i didn’t even get a response. when we do play together, things still feel really normal, and we have laughs and good conversation. 
im just really lost and confused on why they’re closed off all of a sudden. ive tried really hard to be a good friend. i know it’s probably not me, but with them not even replying to me today i can’t help but feel like i did something. i honestly don’t have that much experience with friends because i didn’t have that many in high school, so this last year has been me learning how to make &amp; have friends. I guess this is just something I haven’t learned how to deal with yet. 
if anyone could give advice on what I should do, or maybe has any ideas as to why they might be backing off, i would love to hear it.",20Dec2020,1
193,"My dad died a few years ago and my family has never been the same since. His death broke my heart and he was my best friend and it caused a distance between my family. We never really talked about it, that's not something that we do. Before my two older brothers moved out, they started to get really angry at me all the time even at points telling me that no one cares about me anymore. Now that they've moved out, I feel like I can barely hold a conversation with them when they come back. I still love them but I just don't feel like I even know them anymore. On the other hand, my mom, after a few years after the death of my dad, started dating this guy. Now she is constantly out with him, she is forgetting me places, leaving me alone throughout the days and is never concerned of where I am, if i've been eating or anything really. Once again the lack of seeing her just makes me unable to hold any sort of conversations with her, some days I probably say three words to her. But the worst part is that she has told me several times that she notices the way she has been treating me, the way she has been forgetting about me and would promise to have a good night but then forgets again. I don't feel like she cares that much anymore and more about her boyfriend. I don't really know if there is any advice for this but it was good to finally type it out.",20Dec2020,1

204,"I work full-time at a Highschool as a Janitor in a district that takes very good care of its employees. My job requirements are the standard 8 hours a day, 2 paid breaks, and a 30-minute unpaid lunch. These are very loose rules. I am required to carry a work phone with me, I am on-call 24/7, and I am required to clear out snow whenever necessary. My shift is from 2 pm to 10:30 pm, most days. Yesterday was also the beginning of a 2 week Christmas break that will last until the 4th of January.   


To preface this, yes. I fucking get it that I'm supposed to work the full 8 hours, never stopping, and everything I do outside of work is my own problem and shouldn't affect my quality of work.  


Yesterday I was called in after 2 hours of sleep to remove snow that had fallen the night before. It was just a shitty night and I couldn't get comfortable and couldn't stay asleep. I woke up to a call from my Boss around 6:45 am to be in soon. I also felt super dizzy and nauseous, more than what is normal when you wake up. This ended up persisting throughout the day.  


I helped remove snow and throw down salt, then went and plopped down in the break room for, granted, longer than allowed. My boss also went and plopped down in his office to start ""work"". ""Work"" meaning he probably pulled up a sports game and started reading articles, because all he had to do was sit in 2 meetings, and according to my coworkers, that's just what he does. After sitting there feeling hazy and sick for about an hour I was just about to get up when he came in and asked me wtf I was doing and that I needed to start work. So work I did. I put a whole ton more effort than I normally do in the area I'm supposed to keep clean because I wanted it to be fresh and stellar for the kids when they get back. But I still felt dizzy and nauseous the entire time. I went above and beyond what was expected of me.   


Come noon my coworkers had arrived and they were working too, me taking short breaks to talk with them and stop my feet and legs from killing me and to make the room stop trying to fall over. My boss? Still hadn't moved from his office, still on his computer. This is a very physical job by the way. I'm still on my feet working after he left where I made the fatal error of, sitting down at a desk and laying my head down so I wouldn't fall over from how the room was lurching. Apparently, someone assumed I had fallen asleep.  


Now today, my boss texts me that we're going to have a ""strong discussion"" about my timecard with the principal and how ""sitting in the break room and taking a nap isn't working time"". Yeah, I get it. He's right. But this is the same guy who sits in his FUCKING OFFICE all day, calls me on school days to come in and cover his shift with an hours notice (6:00 am) after I stagger home around 11 pm to shower (because corona), cook something for dinner and eat before passing the fuck out at around 1 or 2 am, if I'm lucky enough to fall asleep. I'm on my feet for a whole fuckin lot longer than he is, walking a hell of a lot more than he is. And I can work my job at my own goddamn pace too, I'm not on a time limit, and I get everything required of me done quickly and efficiently. There's barely even 8 hours of work for me to do when I'm on pace. I was under NO pressure to finish yesterday even with my ""negligence"". It's also the day before Christmas break and half the teachers didn't have to come into work, meaning less work for me.   


I'm so frustrated about this because every time I don't do enough he drags me when he's not innocent of shit either. I absolutely love everyone else I work with, everyone else makes me feel so appreciated and my coworkers absolutely love me since I actually give a shit and work way harder than any of my predecessors have. Except for my boss.   


I guess this long-winded explanation ends with a question. Do I raise these issues and frustrations to the Principal, because this isn't the first time my boss has been a massive hardass and put me and others on the spot for non-issues? (*i was almost written up because he didn't like filling toilet paper dispensers when they ran out when HE WAS ON THE CLOCK)* Do I tell my boss how sick I was feeling, or will that seem like whiny excuses to get out of trouble? Am I in the right or the wrong for believing that maybe he should chill the fuck out a little bit since it's the day before Christmas break and it was a super relaxed day anyway?",20Dec2020,1

Let me preface by saying about 8 years ago I went to a therapist to help me readjust into society after prison. I have no objection to seeing a therapist but i work 12's six days a week and money is still tight. But 12 hours of watching the clock tick by because you can put new thoughts in your head is unbearable.

I struggled for a long time to get over her and i did in the sense that i could go weeks without thinking about her. i recently got out of a 4 year relationship that was very serious, she had kids and i moved all of us into a house. Playing the Step-Dad and really trying to be a father figure for her just as much as her kids really helped. But i still thought of my ex during intimate moments and randomly when a song came on... 

So I just got out of that relationship because it turned toxic and i can see the path she needs to take to be happy in life... AND i decided to add my ex on social media... *big F'ing sigh* she accepts and replied to my message. Stupid i know, I'm kicking myself and i know i need to stop talking to her but its a challenge i just keep putting off.

She's moved on and she's happy, and I'm glad for her. I'm not trying to whoo her or give her any inclination that i still have feelings for her. Its like the back of my mind pulling a string. I really just want the best for her, and this isn't even the issue I'm looking for help with.

I said that I am concerned about it due to virus. They are all planning to be in the same house and singing karaoke, I am being cautious about the virus. The thing is, if I lived by myself - I don’t care, I would get a virus, and either die or not, most likely will be fine so idc.

She got really pissed at me, started yelling, calling me an overdramatic liberal (I am not even a liberal, I am a centrist), saying I will give her depression and that she will do whatever she wants. 

I said that I believe in science, and that I have to take the precautions because I have a promise to my dad (I did say that I will be cautious about the virus), I am a man of my word, and I need to own up to it. In my opinion, hosting a birthday party with 10 people (7 girls + the parents and a brother of a birthday girl) during pandemic is highly ridiculous, and just because her parents allow it, it doesn’t mean it’s right.

219,"Hello, im a 20 year old male, 177cm 74kg. For the past 5 years I've been struggling with constant worry about my health, before you brush this off as hypochondria hear me out. So it all started with chest pains when i was 15, ive visited my gp and he didnt tell me much or help out much, gave me some simple medicine for growing pains or whatever and said it was muscular pain. So it didn't end, ive went back had been referred to a cardiologist they ran ecg and echo and both came clear, echo showed a mild aortic valve regurgitation but i was told it was fine and nothing out of normal. As time went by ive been feeling worse, emotionally and physically. Been experiencing episodes of panic and totally closed off from the world, just me and the internet i guess. So i went back, this time which was recently i had ecg, echo, stress test (bycicle), 24h holter monitor, blood tests. So again nothing new was found, after the holter monitor I've been told that throughout the day they detected skipped beats but they werent serious whatsoever. Well as much as it sounds reassuring and should put me at ease, it doesnt as i experience physical pain... For example when i eat a heavy meal my left arm aches, i also vape (ik its not good for me or my heart especially, but if my heart is fine, nicotine shouldnt cause symptoms) that too sometimes brings on the arm pain. The pain usually runs through my elbow into my fingers sometimes down from my shoulder. If i get into a stressful situation my chest gets heavy, heart pounds i feel like shit. So idk what to do now, I've tried getting help from doctos but they dont seem to help me out much, is it mental? I dont know what anymore, I dont look far into the future no more because i dont feel like i have one, im in constant thinking that i dont have much left. I do admit i exaggerate my body sensations but this particular problem is just breaking me down. If it helps i do have GERD and ive read that theres some vagus nerve that can cause pain? Idk how true that is. Anyway, can someone please help me out or give me an advice, jt would be much appreciated. Thank you.",20Dec2020,1
220,"this paragraph is off topic but i’m just really stressed so i wanna say this (it’s a bit related to this question). ever since i was a child i always had to move countries and/or cities. so i never really had a lot of friends. for example : canada to england, back to canada, again, canada but a different city, canada but the same city i used to live in, canada with a different city. so basically back and forth. that was because of my mums phd or something (i can’t remember). also i’ll be using the england canada example so i can make this easier to understand. so i moved back to canada. let’s say i originally lived in vancouver then moved to toronto. back and forth. now i’ll actually ask my question 

i met my best friends in vancouver but moved to toronto then came back a year and half later. and met another girl who is now one of my best friends. i remember in class we sat in the same group and would go to the field and play games. we’d sneak out and go to the kindergarten playground. race eachother to run down the ramp and stairs. and have fun all day long. i moved back to toronto (the real city is a city i’ve hated for some reason). thanks to my mums job and the virus. i miss my friends. i really really really want to see them and act like 9 year old us. i want to watch scary movies and sneak out. i wish to see them. i’ve been through enough drama this year, and i really really really want to see them. they’re all having fun and meeting up every time they’re free, they also really miss me. what should i do?",20Dec2020,1
221,"I'm not sure if this belongs more on r/mentalhealth but it's going here because I just. Want a bit of guidance on what to do. By the way, I in no way think my life is the hardest, some people out there have much worse.

For context: 13-14 years old and I don't think gender is really important in this. I live in a kinda small townhouse that has 7 people (including me) living in it when everyone is here (4 adults, 3 minors, although one of the adults just turned 18 this year), and 4 pets (two kittens, a rat, and a small/medium dog). Besides me (since im still pretty young) everyone is carrying some sort of trauma on their back, although I still have anxiety/moderate depression.

My entire life we've struggled financially. My parents are in pretty bad debt (they might be able to file bankruptcy, it'll be their second time), and we have to decide what bills we're going to pay since we can't afford to pay the other ones. My mom has been carrying the family for almost 14 years, and has always provided for us, both for things like food and clothes, but also was just there as a caring parent, despite having chronic mental and physical health issues. My dad has only recently been helping support the family.

It's a loving household, and my family is supportive. I just want to know what I can actually do to help. I know it's something that'd be better to ask my parents. But if there is literally any way I can help, even if it's just recommending small things that might help our financial situation and with mental health. Are there any good online counselors?(I do know about 7 cups and might see if I can get it if I'm old enough.) Honestly anything helps.

And, if there isn't anything I can really do right now, that's okay. There's a LOT more than just this, but since I'm mainly focusing on what I can do around the house/to put less stress on my parents, I'll leave it here for now. I might put more information on everything in the comments if anyone asks.

I feel really excited to date girls and to experience the world as a baby gay, as I have never had these experiences before. However, there are a few things I'm afraid of. 

I'm afraid of getting into a relationship with a girl and there being drama because we are both female/emotional, or the line between being best friends and lovers being blurred. 

My parents aren't homophobic but I think it'd be a shock to them and I'm afraid of telling my family. 

The dating pool is so fucking small and I am afraid I'll never find love because there aren't a lot of lesbians, and who is to say which one will be my type. 

I can't really articulate my feelings any more than that, but overall I am just really nervous about being gay and this is such new, uncharted territory. I feel really spent and tired. If anyone could help me out or shed some light on the subject that would be great. Thanks!",20Dec2020,1

227,"I hardly use reddit so i apologize for my stupidness、but i have a question that i have no idea what to do 

heres the situation 

im a 19 year old male (youngest in the family out of 3 total) who all three (including me) are living still at my mothers house (single mother) in a town in the middle of nowhere。i dont have many friends here(maybe like 2-3 work friends and thats about it)、but have about maybe 15 or so trusted good friends who all live in washington 

a couple of months ago i had told my mother i wanted to move out、moving in with a friend who ive known and trust who so happens to live in washington、
(before you say anything about the weather、i love cold and rainy weather so yeah i know www) 

my mother however is COMPLETELY against it and really doesnt want me to do it。the last time i talked about it to her she broke out into tears and was talking a bunch about how i「want to leave bc i hate her」or asking me「how did i fail soo much to make you want to leave me alone」(though she wont be alone)。ive told her several times amongts my own tears and cross yelling that im not doing it bc i hate her or bc she 「failed」and had said im doing it for me、that infact this has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with her in the first place。

now i know that regardless when children leave from their parents、its hard and extremely hurtful i get that。it was even harder for me to say any of this being a person who HATES hurting others(im a healer main ffs ww) 

but no matter what i said、she kept turning back to herself talking about HER feelings and nothing about mine、how i felt、how lonley ive been (tho i know im not completely lonley bc i have all of those same friends online) but i mean lonley as physically、(do you know how long its been since i had a whole hearted hug？ hell i dont think ive really had one other than with my grandmother who died a couple of years ago) also not to mention that she doesnt even know anything about me or have even tried TO  know

but even so after that all happened i agreed to delay the move、that conversation went as followed

me「im willing to wait till january but i want to do this」

mother「so youll wait till youre 20？」
(my birthdays in october)

me「thats not what i said、and i cannot wait that long」

mother「i cant do this、i cant take this」

and out of that pain、i didnt know how to reply and so dropped the conversation 

after a couple of weeks it seemed like everything went back to normal、she wasnt even sad or gloomy and we talked like normal。tho i have every intent of continuing this move

i have enough money to do so、infact ive already bought the suitcases needed and the plane ticket without mentioning anything to her。i know its an asshole thing but idk what else to do、my mother doesnt want anyone to leave period。she thinks that the second i leave that shes「losing me」and that「im going to die」(and yes i asked specifically about the dying part and her reply was 「it could happen you dont know」) 

when telling her i would even keep contact like call、text、hell even video her reply was「its not enough」

so basically she wants me to wait till she dies before i leave which i cannot do (shes like in her early 50’s)

but as said、despite all the pain and fear of this im feeling、im going through with this move、all my friends agree、coworkers agree、but none the less i am scared

the day im supposed to leave is january 12th

ticket bought、hell even got to pick my seat

but here comes the hard part

my mother asked me what i wanted for christmas、and said she was going to give me like a spending budget。yesterday after work、i shakingly told her「you can just split up the money and give more to the other two、i dont really want anything you can buy for christmas」
to her reply asking why 

「to be honest、all i want for christmas is for you to trust me、and support me on this move。another friend of mine who lives there、his dad even owns a restaurant so theres a job right there」
is what i had said

she quickly and without thought declined
this time without any tears stating a complete different reason 

saying「moving to a different state i cannot support、you dont even know whats going on in the world。you really dont

more people this year have been buying guns and more ammo than ever bought and when the presidental election gets changed and biden isnt actaully president and trump is、things will go to hell」
(shes also a trump supporter)

and upon my own research、people im this country sure HAVE been buying guns and ammo・・・・・since MARCH
and bc of COVID and NOT the election 

so despite that im STILL going through with this as i was asking for support NOT permission 

my two weeks at my job have already been put in and im ready、all a matter of time now

and THUS if youre still reading for whatever reason、comes the question i need help with

so my mother (if you couldnt already tell) is a VERY controlling person and will do anything to get me to stay (which is what im afraid of)

on the day before i move、what im planning is to just pack up and go while theyre asleep

the question is what is okay to take

all im PLANNING to take is 

clothes

phone

any personal belonging I BOUGHT

and my nintendo switch 

the problem is the switch 

she technically bought that but as a GIFT for me (and she definitely does not have the recipt) 

could that be technically an item she could claim as stolen as an attempt to get me to stay if it were bought as a gift？

its the same for my console、i was planning to bring my xbox console with me too but think taking both the console and switch would seem too much like i truly did 「steal」it even though that also was a gift given about 5-6 years ago that she also doesnt have the receipt for

but none the less、could the gifted switch be an item she could claim as stolen？

my other question is

do you think after reading this that im doing the right this？

bc ive been so afraid and torn up but i know i cant just sit and cry out of fear as that wont solve anything (no matter how badly i want to) 

and i also want to say、despite all of this。i actually dont hate her、does that make me fucked？

i just dont know what to do

229,"My boyfriend and I are both students and have lived in an apartment together for the past few months, and I spent the summer with him and his family. We did distance for 3 months of quarantine, but it wasn’t really noticeable because neither of us had like anything to do at the time so we were just FaceTiming for huge portions of the day. 

Now, we just went home for break and I’m already feeling the huge impact of being apart after only a week. Where he lives, there’s a 6-hour time difference from me, and he’s busy throughout the day so we only really get to speak for about 15 minutes or so. I’m used to spending full days and nights with him, and I’m a very extroverted person - I love having someone else to talk to all the time about anything and everything. At home, I’m an only child, making things even more lonely. I have friends to text and hang out with, but I keep getting creeping thoughts that he’s the person I want to be with. 

He’s considering extending his time at home past our university’s winter break and into February. He’s asked me if I wanted to come and spend that time with him and his family, even offered to buy the ticket, but COVID restrictions make the travel difficult (bordering on impossible), I need to pay rent on our apartment (his parents pay his so he doesn’t worry about it), and I still haven’t found a job for the upcoming semester to do so, so I told him no. I know his career field will probably end up with him interning in a different city from me this upcoming summer too. 

How can I distract myself better? It seems like this is just distracting me from everything I should be distracting myself with - I’m still finishing up finals and I’m thinking about missing him instead. How can I make distance less lonely? I felt like we did it really well from March-June, but it worked because we were able to spend unrealistic amounts of time with each other on the phone/watching Netflix together. If neither of us have a lot of availability, what can we do to make the time count?",20Dec2020,1
231,"My friend/coworker committed suicide in March. We worked at a small deli and beer/wine store together and opened together in the mornings. I had started there last fall and he's the one who trained me. It was right before spring break so I had to focus on classes so I shoved it deep down and didn't cope with it. Even worse, I couldn't go to his memorial because I was sick and that was right when covid hit. 

 It's kinda funny because we both have (had?) very strong personalities so he hated me at first. We didn't get along all the time but we ended up becoming friends. I loved opening with him because we'd just talk while setting up and play whatever music we wanted. He advocated for me to get new responsibilities and a raise, and he always listened to my stupid stories.

Almost every night I think of him and cry. I don't know how to cope with this. Especially now with the holidays. I broke down on Thanksgiving because we were actually the only 2 people working that day and it was just the best work day. I should've paid better attention and seen the signs. Now his family won't have him there for the holidays.

I can’t remember what I said when I came over but there was a silence that lasted for about 10 seconds afterwards and then my friend just got up and walked away.

233,"I'm 36. Had to move back home for financial reasons. It's been a nightmare ever since. I live with my mother and step-father.

My mother is chronically depressed and sits on the couch, 12 hours a day. (Never leaves the house.) - She is on her best behavior when my Sister and neices come around. When they leave, she gets hammered and dysfunctional. 

She has a drunken, dysfunctional episode every 2-3 months. She did get a DUI about 5 years ago, so, I guess the only difference is that she doesn't drive anymore as, I think it took her about 5 years to pay off the court fees. Anyway..

Wasn't too long ago, I recall, she fell down the stares and slid back into the wall. I said ""ARE YOU OK"" had to pick her up. A few months ago, she slipped and fell and cracked her head open in the pool. Went to the hospital. 

Tonight, I heard her and my step-father getting into a drunken shout match. Figured nothing out of the ordinary (business as usual) - except I started to hear physical slap / punching sounds. I guess my mom started punching / hitting my step father so I had to jump in and break it up. My step father went to his other property, and I had to calm my mom down. 

Honestly, I can't wait to get the fuck out of here. I've already been planning my move for months, but it's been quite a struggle. I have to remain calm, and keep my eyes on the prize. THe only thing is that, I know that when I leave, I am 99% certain this place is going to fall apart even more. I know she will sink deeper into her depression, drunkenness, only, hthis time most likely she will be competely alone.

Most of the family have alienated from her, which leaves her desperately inviting other dysfunctional alcoholics to the house. Once and a while, someone will show up and get hammered here. Just ""Friends"" of the family. Other people with DUI's, drinking habits, drug problems, etc. That's usually when she gets REALLY desperate. I've actually become a wizard at ignoring my surroundings, considering I am completley sober and never smoke, drink, or even do drugs.

234,"I (M 39) have been with my wife (F 32) for 12 years now, 4 of those married. We love and care for each other very much. 

It started approximately 6 years ago when sexual intimacy of any kind started to be less and less. I was somewhat oblivious to what was happening with my wife but knew our sex life was in trouble. We didn’t really talk about it but as time went on she opened up. She said she rarely felt horny and often when we had sex it was to not disappoint me. I wasn’t surprised due to her, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm or passion during sex. I was surprised by how often she felt this way. As it all started to seep in, I began to feel gross and disappointed in myself for not being more in-tune to what was happening. We both feel bad for letting it go as long as it did without talking about it, without pausing and getting help. 

Unfortunately, since being more open with each other, things haven’t gotten much better. We’ve put a stop to all sexual intimacy unless she’s truly into it (very rare), and when we do have sex, it’s done her way or she fears she’ll lose the feeling (which happens half the time).
When my frustration boils up, I want to talk about it but the mention of sex makes her anxious and we both leave the conversation more frustrated, tired and in tears. 

We’ve seen a couples therapist, we’ve tried being more playful, getaways, etc. and she’s been trying everything under the sun to boost or reclaim her libido. She tells me it’s something deeper that she has to fix (and worries she can’t) which leaves me feeling helpless, frustrated, and at times, despite reassurances, very insecure. I feel pressure from myself to get fit, to be more attractive and maybe she’ll want me. I want her to want me. I should note that she’s told me nothing/no one makes her horny - she’s not sexually attracted to other men (or women).

I want passion or a positive intensity in our relationship instead of a stressful intensity (we both have stressful jobs - shes’s a psych nurse and I manage a foster home for adult males). She understands and wants the same. 
I’m needing more than just a fuck. She’s brought up the idea of me finding sex somewhere else but we both feel weird about it. I want it to be with my wife, with someone I love and really connect with. I get these waves of feeling stuck, depressed, and I’m embarrassed to say I sometimes feel resentful toward her. I’m worried about our future. I don’t want it to all hang on this “deficiency” but I understand that many couples don’t last when this element is missing. It scares the shit out of me.

I’m looking for all and any kinds of advice (for us both) whether you’re someone who is going or have gone thru the same with your partner, have or still suffer from no/low libido, or you’re a professional when it comes to this stuff. I appreciate your help in advance. Thank you.",20Dec2020,1

241,"So I'm 1-2 months into a new job. I'm still getting the hang of things, asking questions, asking teammates to check over things, but I think my co-workers have been pretty patient with me. so I want to send something nice for the holidays to everyone on the team I'm in.

I have this $50 online gift card that I probably wouldn't use on myself anyways so I'm thinking of maxing it out it to buy each of my co-workers (4 in total within US) a scarf with a cute puppy design on it and one co-worker based outside the US a bag of fudge b/c the scarf doesn't ship outside the US. In total it goes above 50 just a little so it's reasonable. Everyone would get something with $15 value at least and in total nothing about $25. Is that too much for a co-workers you just worked with for a month? idk...

I'm planning on getting one of my co-workers dog treats in addition to the scarf since he's been especially helpful over the past few weeks and he once brought his dog out on a virtual team happy hour. btw I was thinking of choosing puppy designs on the scarves since everyone on the team seemed to enjoy looking a pictures of a co-worker's poodle. or maybe they were just being polite, who knows. Is this puppy pattern scarf thing even a good idea?? it seemed sweet when I first thought of it but now I'm beginning to have second thoughts, maybe it's too childish/unprofessional....:\\

I exchanged addresses with that co-worker so once I've decided what I'll get for them I'll order it tomorrow. I'm thinking of ask the rest of my co-workers their address and let them know it's for holiday-related stuff by Monday. I really don't know if I can ask my manager for her address b/c idk if anyone does that and idk if giving my manager something would look bad on me, like I'm being a suck-up which is the total opposite of who I am.

I've made some mistakes at work so far so actually idk if this is all a good idea. Some mistakes came from not totally understanding the company culture and processes, being a little slow at turning work in (I never turn in work by the next day...I just send it in a little later in the evening b/c the expectation is same day. But I get that I'm slow b/c everyone's already logged out by then.) Another mistake came from forgetting what a certain expression meant and my manager getting pissed at me for forgetting and doubting that I even did my training. (I did do my training. I'm just a dumbass who forgot what that turn of phrase meant.) Maybe my co-workers will think I'm the kind of incompetent person who wastes time on getting presents for people when I should just concentrate on getting my work done quicker and assimilating faster. 

idk people this gift giving thing to co-workers is starting to get uncertain. is giving scarves with puppy designs to my co-workers a good idea?? is not including the manager in this a good idea?? if this all sounds completely idiotic what the hell should I get them?? or should I scrap all this together and not get anyone anything except the one co-worker who's actually doing this holiday stuff too (idk how, maybe he's doing cards instead)? giving presents has never given me anxiety like this before, I've always loved giving out stuff but now I'm getting stressed about this. like I don't give with the thought of some ""gift exchange"" in mind, I just like giving stuff to people.

While I was healing from the wounds I come to discover they been dating behind my back. we always have negative views about each others ideals and philosophy example I am believe in the law and government, however she hates cops is anti cops and despises the government. So for the past year my befriend started to rent a house with her and ever since he has became distant and doesn't want to interact. I believe she has changed him so much it feels as if we don't even get along anymore. When I would try to hangout he would always say he's busy due to helping her with her tasks. In the past year we rarely talked when I finally got the opportunity to hang out with him he just told me that he's moving to Arizona where she lives. I told him that isn't a wise decision due to his circumstances but he told me that everybody needs to grow up. After that conversation I didn't see him for a long time.

247,"I’m (m15) having a hard time being at home all the time now that school is online, mainly because of my mom. I’ve never really gotten along with her but this past year with quarantine has made it so much worse. She drinks most of the time and usually stays in her room. So when she does come out to talk to me, she’s drunk and automatically is yelling at me/finding something to argue about. 

I’ve started doing all the chores really early in the morning just so she won’t have something to yell at me about, but it doesn’t really help. She’s fine towards my sisters who are 10 and 12, but acts really mean towards me for no reason. She’s told me she hates me, wishes that I was old enough to move out, called me a mistake, has called me stupid for not getting A’s in my classes, etc. she has also said that she can’t stand to look at me sometimes because I look like my dad (he left us a few years ago) and she’ll refuse to look at or acknowledge me sometimes.

The worst part of it that’s starting to happen is that she got a new boyfriend of six months, and he treats me like shit. But my mom doesn’t even care. He swears at me, makes me get him things all the time because he’s too lazy, shoves me out of the way when he walks by, backhands me if I “talk back”. I have to walk his dog every day, clean his car every week, clean up after him, and I’m getting fed up with it.

I usually try to stay at my best friend’s house as much as possible but he just left for vacation so now I’m going to be stuck at home all winter break and my mom already yelled at me for like twenty minutes today for not doing very well on my finals and grounded me and her boyfriend hit me a few times again. I don’t know what I did to make her hate me so much but I don’t want it to be like this for the next few weeks. What can I do to not get on her or her boyfriend’s bad sides anymore?

251,"Have never felt this lost and zoned out

Hey all, I know we are all going through hard times due to the current world situation. I had a huge meltdown in September and have not felt right ever since. I’ve always had a history of severe anxiety/paranoia since I was a kid(also dealt with a lot of childhood trauma but the anxiety began before the trauma itself which intensified it with age.) I kind of  chilled out for the most part when I got into my early 20’s, but turned 30 recently and I’ve now done a compete 360. I’ve had issues with alcohol for the last 10 years, and I don’t know if this has now caught up to me or what. I have these moments when I feel like I am losing my mind and am going insane.                                I constantly am paranoid that nothing is real and that I’m making things up in my head, along with having intrusive thoughts and my brain will not shut off. I repeat sayings out loud over and over again to calm down. What scares me the most is that I do this without even thinking(but not around people, only when I’m alone).                                                             The things I am saying lately are, “I cannot do this anymore”. I begin to get teary (and I never cry normally) and lately have been sort of making plans to leave. I’m not suicidal to the point where I would ever act on it. I have never felt this bad and in these moments I just do not think I can go on like this. I am physically ill over the anxiety and paranoia and get so nauseated, along with all of my muscles getting tense with no relief. I recently cut back on drinking a lot, but sometimes I have to go on a nightly bender just to chill the F out and feel good for once. Then the following day it accelerates the awful anxiety episodes for hours until I have to take a Xanax, or just hope to eventually sleep it off. I don’t have any friends or anyone I can talk to. I did start therapy not too long ago which helped a little, but does nothing currently. Everyday feels like Groundhog Day and I constantly daydream and am so zoned out. I could really use some support, and perhaps insight as to wtf is wrong with me. Obviously if I had health insurance I would see a psychiatrist, but I’m poor and USA is a joke for healthcare. Anyways thanks for reading &lt;3",20Dec2020,1
252,"This is gonna be a long post. Please bear with me, I really need advice.

So, first of all, my mom always treated me and my brothers like adults, not in a bad way. But growing up she would always affirm that I wasn't just a child who shouldn't have opinions. My mom was my best friend and I loved her my whole childhood. My dad too. He was a bit more absent since my mom stayed at home and my dad worked. But he took me and my brothers out on weekends and was never in any way a bad father. When I was 9 they had problems and wanted to split but agreed be amicable and live together and finish raising the kids.

My mom decided to pursue a relationship with her high school sweetheart. He had two sons, and my biological dad agreed to let my new step dad and his sons live with us. We didn't have a super big house but we were all pretty happy.

When I was 13 I got my first boyfriend. I met him online. He was 17. (I know.) I told my mom and she agreed to let him visit when I was 14 but I wasn't allowed to go anywhere alone with him. After two years of dating, my mom agreed to let him move in with us. She even drove me across the country with our family truck and helped him move.

He lived with us for the next two years, and my mom was always nice but, she was still a mom, she still had to make sure I was okay, she would freak out when I stayed out late because she was worried. She was being a parent.

My boyfriend, on the other hand. Constantly talked about how controlling she was, and how living in a crowded house with my brothers was like being in hell. Every day he would get up and tell me how much he hated living there. I didn't know what to do. I told him as soon as I was 18 we could get a place together. 

One day he grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me telling me that living in my household was making him not love me anymore. And I thought this was true. I thought my mom was controlling and insane and didn't let me have any freedom. I thought I was depressed I was gonna lose my boyfriend and be stuck in a horrible house that I suddenly started hating.

My boyfriend asked me to talk to my dad, who wasn't really involved with my life much but still lived in our house. I went to my dads room and told him how horrible my mom was, and how I was depressed and suicidal and I had to get out. My dad could legally move out with me since I had just turned 17 that week and I could choose my custodial parent since my parents were still legally married.

Since my dad wanted to help me, and he also wasn't particularly thrilled about amount of people we lived with, or my mom dating another man. He got us an apartment almost immediately, got everything ready, and while my mom was out of town seeing an old friend who's wife passed away, we packed up and moved out in the middle of the night.

For a while, there was nothing but rage from my mom, every day, 2-5 hour phone calls, sobbing, begging me to come home, yelling about how terrible my dad was for taking me away, I didn't know what to say, I honestly just sat silently on those calls, because it wasn't her fault. I knew that deep down.

My two step brothers and step dad moved out about a week after me, since my step dads relationship with my mom was pretty much over.

Three months into living in our new apartment I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me, and he quickly moved out over a weekend and went back home. I didn't know what to do. My dad tried his best to comfort me but I really missed my mom. But any time I talked to her she yelled, she screamed and told me how heartbroken she was.

About a year and a half of seeing my mom every week or two, lots of fights, her crying mostly and me sitting silently not sure what to say, we finally started having a good time like we used to. I would go to her house and see my brothers, and her and her new husband. I missed it so much, a lot of our nights ended in her talking about how horrible my dad was and asking me why I left and I would just leave, but one night I broke down and cried and told her how much I missed her, I didn't know how to verbalize anything I'd been feeling really. I just told her I missed her so much and I love her and I just cried and she cried, and things got SO much better.

Fast forward to now, it's been exactly two years since I moved out. I just turned 19. I miss living with my mom so much. I miss seeing her and my brothers every day. I regret being stupid and not loving my family when they were all together. I loved every damn minute in that household and broke the whole thing apart because of some stupid boy who cheated on me. I just came home from visiting with her all day. Her and my brothers have said multiple times I am always welcome to move back in. 

Here's the thing though. They all hate my dad for ""Stealing me away"", and abandoning my brothers. My dad never had a good relationship with my brothers and he did, in fact leave without so much as a word to them. It's a horrible thing and I don't agree with it but my brothers are over it, they just hate my dad. So does my mom.

My dad over time has grown bitter to my mom, he genuinely believes she's controlling and manipulative, I can't convince him otherwise, and I know it's my fault because until things got better I would always come home upset when I went to see my mom.

I do love my dad. I also love my step family. I visit them on holidays and I grew up with them, but everyone hates each other. I'm the only one who loves all of them, my mom and brothers hate my dad and step family, my step family and dad hate my mom and brothers. 

I'm scared if I move back in with my mom, my dad will maybe think all the work of moving me out will have been for nothing, I know my mom would never stop me from seeing my dad or step family but she would probably be upset.

All sides of my family broke apart and I feel like I was the catalyst and it's all my fault. I don't know what to do, I want to live with my mom. I miss her. But my dad is old. He's in his mid 60's and I don't want him living alone into old age. Not after everything he's done for me. I want to be there for him too.

254,"Okay I'm gonna try typing this again but I'll start by listing things about me

I'm 17, kinda poor, have a girlfriend living about 2 hours away, I mainly live with my mom. Recently we've moved from a house that a guy let us stay in (it was a fixer upper project so I think it was gonna be reduced rent or something if we fix it, but he also didn't give us things like air, proper insulation, a washer and dryer, etc.). But we're in a new place with one of my moms friends. It's pretty big and not much work has to be done on it (just some wall patches and a new paint coat, some windows gotta be replaced). I have the two rooms in the upstairs to myself but theres a fridge up here that I needed to clean out. I was waiting for my friend to come over to help because I like having assistance on things. But one night I went to go downstairs to wash my face, and to get downstairs I have to go through my mom and her boyfriends room. So I did what I did and when I went upstairs I noticed he was getting up out of bed but I didn't think much of it. Well I get back in bed and I'm on call with my girlfriend then he comes up here, yells about me not cleaning the fridge, about almost being an adult, and about me going down to see 'that girl'. Yeah so anyways I cried from having a fucking mental psychotic breakdown or something I don't even know, then I told my mom while they were out yesterday and she got on his ass. Also before we moved in my mom said that if he fucks up one more time (things have happened in the past) that he's out of here. I'm going to my girlfriend's house tomorrow with like $17 in my wallet and I can talk more about the old house because some like, illegal stuff happened there recently. I also think I need to get opinions about Christmas but I really don't wanna type out all of this without anyone caring so if you want me to keep going please tell me I have a lot to spill",20Dec2020,1

I thought I wanted friends but I've made some new friends and still realize this is not my issue. My issue is I feel absolutely no drive or purpose in life, yet have a highly ambitious and hard working personality. It fucking blows. In-turn I live a bit sour, like an old man.

I'm 23 and so desperate to move out or do something new. I'm not necessarily looking for job advice in and of itself; I'd love to move to somewhere like Europe, even if for a month, and have some purpose. Maybe some job, some experience, something. 

I feel like I desperately have to find myself and my calling. At times my life is so painful, it seriously hurts. I have an ambitious soul with a missing ambition. 

Of course I could try to get some local Criminal Justice job for the time being but it fucking feels miserable. I hate it.

262,"some backstory:  
Back in 2018 i had a relationship for about 6 months with someone I still hold dearly to my heart, We had known eachother since 2013. Because of her dad's job she had to move around a lot. In 2015 she moved to The Netherlands and we finally got to meet in real life along with some other friends from our friend group back then.I have autism and it is hard for me to pick up other people's emotions but I do have my own guidelines to tell how someone is feeling. I was horrible at picking up clue's and never realised that we had a mutual interest for eachother until back in 2018. We started dating in april and we spent a lot of time together playing games, watching shows or even having conversations about what anime we thought were the best and why.   


In october she broke the news to me that she didn't have too long to live anymore because she had lungcancer. She told me back then that she had around 4 months left according to the doctor. After processing what she told me we started planning things to do in the time she had left and we started doing some of them such as going outside to a hil to stare up to the nightsky together and visiting some of her favorite locations together and take some pictures. In november I had a total of 10 exams/tests packed into 1 week. At the start of this week i told her that I was going to spend barely any time gaming because i had to make sure to pass the exams or I would fail my schoolyear. Before it started she told me ""focus on your exams so that you can do something you like in the future"".

 At the end of the examweek I messaged her telling her I finished the exams and we could spend more time together. This was november 8th. Two days later she called me sounding weak or exhausted telling me that she moved with her family to canada in the period my examweek was going on. At the time i thought she was exhausted because of jetlag or something like that. She had told me that they would be moving but I didn't know when they would move. After recieving no contact for 5 days I recieved a letter on the 15th that was in her handwriting. It was a letter explaining exactly what was going on and why she didn't have any contact with me for those 5 days. She sadly passed away and there were some matters that had to be resolved by her parents in the end.  


Now for whats been going on ever since:  
Ever since her death I have spent about 1,5 years in a deep depression and went down bad. I don't even remember the majority of things that happened in that period as i was basically going on autopilot. At first i started hating myself for not being there when she passed away, but i processed everything in my own way and came to accept that whast i couldn't do and what is now part of the past. This doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt when i think about it.  


 I've been getting more of her handwritten letters that she wrote for me way before she passed away.  Her parents send them to me at random intervals and up until now they have also sent them during the holidays. I basically regress towards the state I was in for 1,5 years after reading the letters and then spend some time processing things again. I don't know what to do. Do I stop reading them, do I ask for the parents to stop sending them?   
I would understand it if they sent all the letters at once but sending them one by one?  


TL;DR  
My ex passed away and her parent's send her old handwritten letters to me at random over the span of 2 years. What should I do?",20Dec2020,1

267,"I know this might sound ridiculous, but for the longest time it seems like getting a year older on my birthday is really taking a toll on me mentally. I turn 22 in April next year, and for some reason it feels like I’m getting way too old. 

For some reason it’s been an emotional weight. Getting older makes me feel like everything’s boring, that I can’t enjoy things as I used to and that everything has to be too serious. 

It’s not even a matter of not being responsible. I love to have healthy habits: I exercise regularly, play the piano, learn Japanese, study for school, meditate, etc. But for some reason my self identity is more closely tied to being younger, I guess. I sometimes feel like I’d like to be 16 again. I get weirded out when I find other people my age that are planning on getting married or having kids - or even the fact that they’re getting too caught up in a serious relationship as if they think they are mature enough to take important life decisions. I don’t wanna pretend like I’m this overgrown dude with a beard that already settled his life beliefs for good and won’t open his mind to new things. 

I just don’t see myself getting married or settling down until way way later.

I worked at a mall location that a week prior had an associate test positive. An associate at my main store tested positive as  well, My  manager left a terribly rude answer when I asked if we were  delivering  to fedex or usps, our hours are stretched so thin we can't  enforce the 5  in store rule that my location has, they instructed us to  wipe pin  pads down after every transaction but that hasn't happened  because  we're running 200 transactions a day or more and then I have  some  customer lean around the sneaze guard to ask me if we have PS5s  while  the phone ringing drowns out her question to ask the same thing as  her.

I  don't understand why I  should have to deal with all of these pains and  risks and then threaten  the life of my elderly father and mother and  asthmatic brother and  girlfriend and baby niece and cancer diagnosed  uncle and fresh out of  back surgery aunt.

What I fucking hate myself for is that one of the girls I matched with was 17 and I ended up exchanging nudes with her. I knew she was 17 but I just went with it. I have NEVER sexted before this app, let alone do it with a 17 year old, and I haven't done it at all since. I've since deleted the app, deleted the pictures, cut contact, all of that. I didn't do this because she was 17, but rather in spite of that. I have no contact with her at all because it was just a random match on the app

Since then I've just been absolutely sick to my stomach about my actions. Most days I just feel like a fucking predator because of what I did, and I feel like this will be a mental ""scarlet letter"" I'll have to carry to my grave.

275,"I (21F) am having a hard time trying to answer this question.  I guess another way to ask this is, do I even qualify for unemployment?

I am a student, although I dropped out of the online semester because of major mental health problems.  Before the pandemic, I was working part time at a pet resort, which got shut down for a while, but in July, invited me back to work.  I went back for a couple of weeks, but I abruptly took an emergency leave of absence because of my mental health issues that my work was causing me.  I live with my parents, and my co-workers almost never wore their masks at work, only to interact with customers.  They we're all very nonchalant about the pandemic too, making fun of people who wore their masks, and always teasing me for putting mine on for my 8 hour shifts.  I'm a very anxious person, and working there was kind of a breaking point for me, in that I was so scared that I would bring home Covid-19 to my parents, that I felt on edge every single day.  I have suicidal ideations, and one of the only reasons I fight to stay alive is for my mom.  So if anything happened to her, if she got Covid and died, I would be completely unable to deal with that kind of grief.

So I took a leave in August, and didn't say when I was coming back.  A lot has happened in my personal life since then, but I have still not returned to working.  Numbers are especially high right now, and it feels so dangerous to step outside the house, I can't in good conscious go back to work.

Now I'm at a point where my bank account is running a bit low, and I've been avoiding applying for unemployment because I feel bad receiving money when I am perfectly able to go out and find work part time (I live in Virginia and they are not on a serious lockdown, so I could go back to work or even fi d a different job) but I really can't live with the anxiety of possibly giving my mom Covid for my work.  

I am a dependent on my parents, and not currently a student, and am only part time for all past work.  I don't even know if I am qualified for unemployment.  But I've been helping a small amount with my parents mortgage since I've lived with them, and my bank account is gonna go dry soon, so I'm going to need to do something soon.

So should I file for unemployment?",20Dec2020,1
276,"I'm 20 years old and I'm stuck at home due to COVID. My 12 year old sister lives here too and tbh she can be really mean. My family is super dysfunctional and I think the general tension in the house makes everyone sorta snappy. But I feel like even when I try to have positive interactions and be kind she's still like this. 

If I play some music and ask if she wants to sing with me she'll be like ""no your music sounds awful"", or she'll laugh at stuff like my music taste or clothes without me even asking for her opinion. If I try to start a convo by asking what sort of music/clothes she likes she just dodges the question, like she assumes I'm gonna make fun of her. 

Additionally if I express concern she always gets mad at me bc she thinks I'm just being condescending. Like if I remind her not to leave the milk out too long she'll literally hit me over it (and I'm the runt of the litter so she's actually bigger and can do some damage). 

I know she's just a kid and I shouldn't let it get to me, but when my immediate family is the only social interaction I'm getting for months on end it does start to sting a bit. As someone who grew up in this household I know how shitty it is and how just being here can bring out your worst traits, but I'm not a child psychologist and I can't sort out this kid's problems for her while I'm still dealing with my own.

this guy, today tells my other friend, that I refused to take him to my room which is false. and WHEN I TRY TO CONFRONT HIM, HE FROM behind my friend's back, he says that he just told it for fun. I got annoyed as he told something that I never said. I don't like it. 

and on the way to my home, this other friend wanted to come to my room and play for a while.I said that ok to him . he then asked this guy, and he says that he won't come bcoz I did not invite him. I am like bro I did not even invite the other guy. 

he manipulates and twists his words that hit your ego and which makes you act in his preferred manner which I realized today.

285,"I was hoping for some advice as I'm having a tough time making a decision and not sure who to ask.

My girlfriend of 8 years and I separated a few months ago. We had lived together for most of that time and for the last 5 years have had a dog.

Originally when we broke up I moved out to stay with a friend while she stayed at the house we had been renting until our notice period was up. During this period we discussed what to do about the dog and she wasn't confident she'd be able to find or afford somewhere that would accept pets. Unfortunately both of our family situations are not pretty so moving in with parents was not an option for either of us. 

This was partly the reason that we decided I should have him which I was really happy about, if slightly nervous - I work 10 hours a day so put careful thought and consideration into what I could do and how much it would cost for me to keep him appropriately, using a mixture of dog walkers, dog creches and also trying to find a house or flat as close as possible to work so I could go home for lunch every day.

While I was looking for a place to live she made plans to move in with her godmother, at least for a while, who was more than happy for her to bring the dog with her. She then said that she'd like to have him, partly because she wasn't confident I'd be able to care for him properly, but said that I could have him during some weekends if I wanted, or if I had some time off work. 

This seemed to work well so I happily agreed - after all the house she was moving to was in the country with plenty of nice spaces to walk and as she worked from home it seemed like the best option for the dog.

After we handed the keys back for the house it took me 6 weeks or so to find a place and get moved in. I then text her asking if I could have him for an upcoming weekend as I had taken a few days off and planned to use this to settle in at the new house and wanted to spend some time with the dog. Her response was that the arrangement of us essentially sharing custody of him wasn't going to work for her, saying that it was unfair on the dog and not healthy for us to have to keep seeing each other, so I could have him that weekend but that would be the last time.

I didn't take him that weekend, I felt like if I did it would be me agreeing to her terms of never seeing him again, and I said that we should see how it goes before making a decision like that. She said that she needed some space so we agreed a period of no contact until the new year. She also asked for me to sign the documents for our pet insurance citing her as the owner (I was the owner according to the insurance company as I had set up the policy) which I did because logistically it made sense if she was going to have him for the majority of the time.

We agreed to leave it until the end of the year and catch up in the new year to discuss this again, however at the end of November we had a text conversation about some outstanding bills that we needed to pay from the old house. During this time she got angry that I hadn't been keeping her in the loop regarding these bills etc and again brought up the dog saying I needed to decide who was going to have him permanently because this arrangement wasn't working for her. She calmed down a little and we talked about me having him for Christmas and also that she was planning to go on holiday in March for a few weeks so it would be good for me to have him then too, which obviously I was more than happy to do. This conversation ended fairly positively.

This weekend I was due to get him for the Christmas period so I messaged her yesterday to make sure we were still good and asked when I could come and get him. She again got very angry and said that this arrangement wasn't working for her and that I hadn't confirmed I was having him over Christmas so she had made plans to have him including a trip away with him.

She is very certain of herself and has always had razor-sharp recollection of conversations, whereas I have always doubted myself when it comes to previous conversations so throughout our relationship if there was a disagreement based on a previous conversation I would usually assume I had either misheard or misunderstood. At every stage since we broke up I have made sure to stay polite, courteous and have accepted at every point that any disagreement is likely to be down to my own misinterpretation or misunderstanding of a conversation.

The issue at the moment is that because she doesn't want to share the dog she is insisting that one of us have him permanently and the other can no longer see him. She has left the decision to me as to who that should be but I feel as though it's a slightly loaded question because we both know that it makes more logical sense for her to have him and overall she’ll probably be able to offer him a slightly better quality of life because of her living and working arrangements - although who knows if and for how long that will remain the same.

I still want to try and share him but her argument is that he should (hopefully) live for at least another 5 years, hopefully a fair bit longer, and it's unreasonable to expect us to keep seeing each other every few weeks etc when we move on with our lives. 

It seems I therefore need to make a decision. The thought of never seeing him again is really tough - it's been about 3 months now since I last saw him and I was so excited to have him over Christmas. On the other hand I know that although I could have him - using dog walking services and dog creches etc for when I'm at work - the best situataion for the dog right now is to be with her working from home.

I'm really torn and don't know what to do. I can't bear to give him up but likewise want what's best for him and also I know that she must feel the same way so I wouldn't want to put her through the pain of giving him up either.

Any advice or feedback would be much appreciated.",20Dec2020,1
286,"I reached rock bottom of my 22 years of life. So I haven’t experienced much outside of my room in my 21 years of life until I joined the military. I’m generally hard on myself with certain rules and have insecurities. I am an over thinker, I think way too much and I’ve been called uptight, strict and sensitive about certain things(and they’re right). I’ve only been into the military for about a year(hit a year back in may). Currently 22 of age and before tonight I never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl. Been rejected each time I tried my hand at love even though I generally get the “you’re too good of a guy to be in a situation you’re in.” I grew without a father so that implies lack of confidence. I’m just learning how to be confident and what it means to me since this pass October. I struggle with porn/affectionate addiction so I’m masturbating daily. 

Well tonight, at 31 years old, this married woman of 10 years  who I’ve known since March of 2020 who I  treated as my big sis, tried to have sex with me. According to her, her husband, who is the second person closest with me and knows almost all of my secrets and insecurities who I consider a brother, is absolutely cool with it and is fine with an open relationship. (I don’t know if it’s true or not since alcohol was involved and something like this has serious consequences within the military) When the intercourse began between her and I, I was extremely confused and uncomfortable. I didn’t know what to do. She tried her best to get an erection out of me but to avail. I couldn’t stop thinking about my life and the situation I’m in. So after 30 minutes of failure I eventually ended it and went home. At least I can finally say I kissed a girl heh lol. 

I don’t know what to do. I dreamed of having sex or being in a relationship. I’m a very affectionate guy so I thought my first would be with someone I’m interested in or at least within my age group within my own terms. Tonight felt forced and uncomfortable for me.

292,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to come on here because after spending more time around my 25-year-old brother. I never was around him too much because I was in college. Still, after returning and looking up his behavior on google, I can say that he has exhibited sociopathic tendencies. He lives at home with my mom, and he mentally and emotionally abused her every day. He manipulated me into giving him some money while acting like he was struggling a lot while he wasn’t and spent the money that I gave to him to buy Xanax. I had helped him because I was in an ideal financial situation and thought I could help him to get stuff ready for his baby since it wasn’t too much.

He got a girl pregnant who my whole family calls the devil, and she’s been making him more and more toxic. My older brother stole my second younger brothers Xbox, told me that he took away my gaming tv from my younger brother because he was getting food all over it, and since I was so caught up in my school work, I told him to keep it in his room and take care of it. Today, I came to find out that my younger brother was wiping my TV down every two days or making sure that the screen was very clean and that that was a lie by my older brother to bring my gaming TV in his room.

To add on to show how much of a low life he is, he stole twenty dollars from my twenty-year-old brother. I stay at school all the time because whenever I go home, the people back home, especially my older brother and my younger sister (who’s very similar to him), try to destroy my happiness. I’m anxious, though, because he keeps abusing my mom financially, emotionally, and mentally. I also told him that he could borrow my gaming monitor until March, but now that I’ve wanted to take up gaming again, I’m afraid to ask him back for it because he’s been looking like a psychopath whenever someone deals with him. He screams at people, threatens to abuse people and everything physically. I wonder what I should do if he threatens to break my gaming tv or try to start problems with me. I wanted to ask if anyone has dealt with a similar situation and could give me some advice about this situation.

His gaze is vicious, and I’m starting to think that he’s starting to lose it. I don’t know what to do. Should I try to get in contact with DFYS?",20Dec2020,1

Im needing advice on if I should contact the authorities cause A: this domicile is nowhere near suitable for a adult, much less a child. B I have DEEP CLEANED this apartment countless times and have finally given up.C the brown things on the ground is animal feces. 

Backstory. 

I moved to a friend's state that was suitable for me to join with my old company to wildland fire fight. Sadly I got here at the near end of the season so was unable to save much money. I pay her 500 a month for rent. Then pay utilities/food. I've given her in excess 4,000 dollars in monies she needed. Electricity got cut off, she needs things, etc. (Come to find she's a non stop liar and has blown the money on trivial things including clothes that is in a mound on her floor) not rent money but her giving puppy dog eyes She has abrupt mood swings and is a nuisance to be around. Due to covid I have found myself unemployed so moving into a new place is not an option right now. I either have to wait till March when I get placed in a base, or rough it in a homeless shelter in boise till then. The reason I post this is because she has a daughter. The daughter was staying with my roommate more than her father. My roommate got ""sick"" (abuses pain medication) and so the courts granted her father more custody. Which im actually happy for because she keeps this house a utter disgusting mess. 

Long story short, I cannot continue to live here and do not think her daughter should be subjected to be here(here every other weekend) in such filth. If I had known she lived this way I would have never roomed with her and would have found someone else. Should I send these images, and more to the authorities? She has a dog and a cat whom she barely takes care of. I get woken up to her cat and dog barking/scratching on my door to feed them. Which I dont mind and keep doing. But somethings got to give!!

I have gotten advice and suggestions on how to deal with this fear, and the most common thing people suggest is for me to make friends with a few men. Trouble is... the thought of doing that is very difficult for me. I have trouble relating to them and often, they have ended up trying to get something from me. Do any of you have advice on interacting with and making friends with straight cis men? Any ideas on how to do this (online or offline)?",20Dec2020,1
300,"Honestly not as bad as it sounds.

1. I am an international student
2. Second born in a family of 5
3. First to go to the US

Hi, so my (20F) dad (54M) gives me anxiety. This is probably because he pays for my university tuition and expects a 3. something gpa. I currently have a 2.66 gpa and I'm entering my final year. I am honestly scared of talking to him because I feel like I am disappointing him. He did not actively say he expects this but I know and also my mum said this is how he feels. My mum knows/understands my father more than anyone in our family. I don't have a bad or good relationship with my father (he feels more like an acquaintance than a father to me). 

I need help, how  do I build our relationship ?
Also how do I tell him my current gpa. I'm scared.",20Dec2020,1
301,"Ok so I'm 16m and I'm currently writing on mobile so sorry for any errors. This happened a few weeks ago and it makes me a bit mad.

So I 16m grew up in an very abusive household I had an absent father and we would always move. And what I mean by abused here's some examples if I did anything my mother didn't like such as come home with a disappointing grade i would get beat with an extension cord or a very heavy black belt. 

My mother 34F was one of my main abusers she has a very short temper and drinks and smokes in front of her kids a lot. I grew up knowing that cigarettes and alcohol was bad for you even if no one told me that. My mom hasn't had a job for years I honestly couldn't tell you the last time she had one. She would take us to aunt's and uncles houses and get drunk with them completely forgetting the fact she has children. I would watch my little brother and sister and prevent them from the treatment I got. 

My mom would abandon us, punch and slap us, beat us till we physically couldn't go to school the next morning. She always said we're not allowed to tell anyone not teachers, not counselors, absolutely anyone and if we did we'd get beat, if we flinched in public around her we'd get beat when we got home.

So this year I made a friend Emily (fake name of course) 16f and we became best friend cause we have similar backgrounds. She has always been there for me and vice versa. So me and Emily got a job together this summer and made new friends, I've always wanted a job to make money and move out. So a few months into my job me and one of my coworkers were talking in her car cause she offered to drive me home and we chatted about our childhoods and I had a breakdown and talked about me getting abused. She offered to me an opportunity to live with her I thought about it and said I couldn't cause I didn't want to get her in trouble nor did I want to leave my siblings alone with my mother. She said think about it and dropped me off so I did.

I forgot to add my mother in the past year has started to cool down and stopped beating us that much but she still did time from time or got my stepdad to beat me up. So one day I texted the coworker and asked if I could stay at her place cause my mom said she was gonna beat me cause I came home an hour late. She said absolutely so I packed up and Emily offered to help me run away so I got most of my clothes and important papers and went to her house. That day was so scary. So we went to a thrift store and bought me some cheap clothes cause I didn't have much and we finally were finished with day one. (I never said my coworker24F was married to another one of my coworker 46F and had two kiddos )

So I had school the next day and I thanked them for helping me out so I did online school I cleaned the kitchen and their living room cause those were the places I was at. And when they came home the coworker24F snapped she got really mad at me for CLEANING the kitchen I didn't use anything extra and I didn't put anything outta place I just cleaned and she got pissed and told me not to did things without her permission I apologise. The next day I asked if Emily could come over and they said of course she can so Emily hung out at their place with me and we did homework and watched TV together. When they got home it was normal and we just hung out and they asked me to clean my mess and I did. The next day my mother texted me and asked where I was I didn't respond but Emily told me I said so I came up with something my mom told me to come home rn or she was gonna call the police and file a missing person report. I never responded but I told my coworkers about this and they were like it's ok she probably won't. So nothing happened for the rest of the day. In the very next morning I got a text from a detective and he asked simple questions such as ""Are you ok?"" ""Why are you running away?"" Stuff like that so I called and told him my situation and offered to get my therapy I accepted but my mom would have to agree too which she didn't. He asked for me to go home I said I couldn't at least not for today he said something like if I didn't I'd get in trouble. So I told everyone I had to go home and they were bummed out and told me to be careful that night I went home. My mom wasn't there but my stepdad was he looked disappointed and shook his head and walked away. I waited in the living room for my mom to come back and when she did and saw me... She was FLIPPING livid she cursed and bitched and moaned about missing and worrying about me, then she was like why did you run away and she said use choice words cause she doesn't want to send me to the hospital so I was conflicted and told her I just ran away just cause. She was even more livid and started crying and being really loud. (I live in a black house hold so it's weirdly accepted that we're loud people) she walked away and told me to go upstairs she'll talk to me In the morning. By talk she meant beat me till I bled in multiple parts of my body I had bruises on my face, back, arms just all over I was a mess and still. I know I fucked up by running away cause of my past trauma cause she hasn't hit me before that for months so.",20Dec2020,1
302,"Hey all, before is start thanks for listening. Ima 26 year old cook that’s kind of lost. I’ve never had any education after high school. But once I started in a kitchen I knew it was something I enjoyed and could do for at least my time as a “young adult”. I excelled pretty quick and was running my own kitchen with in about 7 years in the industry. Since covid, my future in the industry looks, well really bad. I want to look into something new and I’m always keen to learn something new, but I don’t really know how. Would I have to go to school for 2 years to start a new career? Would anyone hire a 26 years old with no experience in another industry? How do people even start new careers in industry’s that don’t hire high school kids? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",20Dec2020,1
303,"**Post is kind of long, so I've highlighted the Tl;dr summary of the points in bold. Anyway, here's my life story...**

   


**• Raised in Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints with deep-rooted faith**  
Both of my parents are church members, I’ve been a member since I was a child. Despite things listed later, I do seem to have a very firm faith in the Church. I even *tried* to stop believing when I was in my teens and it just didn’t work out. 

**• Spent a** ***long*** **time indulging in NSFW content, only having really tried to quit in the last few (3-5?) years.**   
I was introduced to graphic porn at a young age by my elder sibling’s friends and it slowly spiraled out of control from there. \~6 months “PMO free” to use no-fap language. Was over a year previously before falling off. 

**• I’ve spent most of my life invested in the anime and gaming communities, which are quickly becoming more and more NSFW**  
I’m a boring person. If someone were to ask my interests back in high school, I would say “art, anime, video games.” Unfortunately, outside of a few SFW art groups, I don’t really feel welcome in any of these communities anymore. 

*If you’re not aware, the internet has a tendency of making pornographic art of any attractive character that exists and then posting it (often without NSFW tags) everywhere.*   
People on the internet are becoming more and more addicted to porn. Idk what else to say.

**• More and more I’m having to isolate myself from my interests because of the increasingly inappropriate content.**  
Since I’ve taken to *avoiding* NSFW content on the internet, I’ve quit using pretty much every social media platform outside of facebook and reddit (where I can somewhat reasonably control what appears on my feed). 

I watch anime, but I don’t consider myself to be, or even want to be, part of that community.  
Similar situation for gaming. I pretty much fly solo because most discord groups either don't have or don’t really enforce a no-NSFW rule. 

**• Feelings of isolation are obviously worsened by COVID-19**  
I’d considered taking up new hobbies and/or getting into new social groups, but, you know.

**• I feel an increasing amount of disdain toward** ***people*** **in general every time I view the media, but since my religion and my political views generally go against the grain, I just have to bottle it up.**  
This is another aspect of the feeling of being isolated. The very conservative views of the church tend to be “out of fashion” as far as the rest of the world is concerned. People look at us like we’re crazy. But from the inside, I feel like I’m watching a world on fire. Elected officials are normalizing drugs, sex, and violence and it’s *maddening* to watch. 

**• I have a really hard time with cognitive dissonance between religion and science.**   
Just to clarify, I’m not going out and searching for these things. When I read the scriptures, there are occasionally things that catch my eye, and I think to myself, “wait… how?”   
I’m not going to list any of them because I don’t want to be somebody that sews seeds of doubt in others, but I have a *really,* ***really,*** hard time dealing with them when they pop up. I’ve spent days thinking about the smallest things, trying to reconcile some of these problems.

**• Even if I want to get help, I can’t talk to anyone because, 1: No in person appointments because of COVID, and 2: There’s no such thing as privacy in my house.**  
Small household, five people, and I live in one of the places where the government is still super strict about regulations. The lack of privacy in the household is the reason I’m posting this late at night before I sleep.

**• I’m constantly questioning everything when it comes to religion. I’m not sure if the things I do are genuine, or if I’m acting out of a sense or fear/obligation.**  
My depression has led me to a feeling of “spiritual distance.” While I don’t have trouble identifying things I think I’m doing *wrong,* I never feel like I can tell if I’m doing something right. When I try to repent for mistakes, or seek consultation for help, I find myself wondering if I’m doing so because I’m genuinely sorry for my mistakes, or just because I’m *supposed to* or, worse, for self-gratification. 

**• I have horrible existential dread.**   
This is probably the root of a lot of my problems. It causes me to question whether I’m religious out of faith or out of fear. At the same time, I’m chained to religion because, ultimately, my thoughts become much darker if I try to reject it, things along the lines of “If this is all there is, what reason do I have to act in anything but self interest?” 

**I feel like everything I do is wrong.**  
I feel like I’m either feeling guilty or doubting every decision I make. How do I get back to normal?",20Dec2020,1
304,"Just a little background so everything makes sense... I’m a 17 year old who suffers from major anxiety and depression.

I’ve been working at my job for 6 months now. During the past 6 months I have been treated like shit. They always make me take orders in the freezing cold/rain. I never get praised for the 2 jobs I do at once (take orders and charge... sometimes I do all 3 by myself) while others get praised for handing out a drink in 20 seconds. I put so much work and effort because I actually believe in hard work and no one sees that.

What sent me over the edge of was today when I didn’t take the order because I had to put my vest on (it’s bright so I don’t get hit by cars when I’m taking orders outside) and getting ready to go outside. The other 2 people who were with me were mixing coffee and the other was filling up napkins. When my supervisor yelled at me I told her I don’t think I should be punished Bc they were basically free. She tells me it’s my job to take orders and it was their job to do that. 

This is where my anxiety kicked in and I had a mini panic attack. I was trying so hard not to cry that I turned red. I don’t know how but I managed to get through my shift...

So Reddit what do you think I should do ?",20Dec2020,1
305,"My troubles began nearing the end of 2018 to present day. I gradually started gaining weight from 145 to 168. I went to a Christian school for my high school years, and I started straying away from my morals and standards. I wanted to hold strong to my faith to prove to myself and my peers I could become a success story because it wasn’t uncommon for graduates to turn away from their faith. I guess I was wrong about myself after all. I started using profanity and doing everything I stood against. I hated myself, the way I looked, and the hurtful comments sent my way. I was disgusted with who I had become, I still am. I graduated in May and immediately did nothing with myself. I wasted so much time instead of applying for college, getting my drivers license, and keeping my old job. I still have yet to do those things. Procrastination really got the best of me and I let myself go. This year, I was on the verge of losing my relatives after having lost people already. I write this to tell the reader that I have never felt so low in my life. For nearly two years, I still haven’t able to pick myself up let alone be a better person than I was 2-3 years ago. My failures make it harder to try again and again because I see no point when I’m making no progress for 2 years now. My efforts seem in vain, and I beat myself up about it and say that my attempts are pathetic and to stop trying. I’ve talk to many people about my mental health, but it seems like no one is truly listening. I’ve cried myself to sleep many nights trying so hard to mask what I’m going through so no one feels uncomfortable around me. I don’t know how much longer I can keep living like this. I have more problems, but they wouldn’t fit in this text. If you took the time to hear me out, thank you from the bottom of my heart. It’s more than what a lot of people around me have done.",20Dec2020,1
306,"I (f21) have been seeing my boyfriend since April and we became “official” in September. I am quite an anxious, shy and hesitant person hence why it a) took so so long before I was comfortable calling him my boyfriend and meeting his friends, and b) has taken so long to meet his parents. He is caring and VERY patient of me and has not once crossed my boundaries. I am very lucky to be with him. 

I am meeting his parents in a few days, they are hosting dinner at their place. It had to happen at some point but am beyond nervous to the point that thinking about it too much gives me symptoms leading up to a panic attack. I have ADHD and am on the spectrum which I think I’m most nervous about - that they won’t like me or I’ll say something stupid or that I’ll be too shy.

307,"I hate my brother. He's 26 and a deadbeat with our enabler parents. Never does anything in the house, never helps out. He's an entitled manchild who spends the entire day eating, playing video games and watching anime. He never listens to anyone, it's impossible to sit him down for a proper talk or anything. I can't move out yet due to multiple reasons to get away. Our house is pretty small so it's impossible to avoid him entirely. Everytime I see him, when I hear him talk, when I hear him breathe, whenever he comes close me, I get so close to losing my shit.

308,"So my sister and i get into fights occasionally.

Today,because my mum told us to do chores, she got mad and started complaining. I wanted her to stop because she was affecting the family mood but she got mad at me and started saying im nosy. She said if she can't complain, her feelings will worsen and she will get more mad. She said i was worsening her feelings and hence she gave me a cold shoulder.

Every time she gives me a cold shoulder, i feel like crying and my heart hurts. However ,as always, she just seems fine, like nothing has happened. There was once in public where we fought and i keep going to the toilet to cry, but she just seemed fine and was playing a fool with my cousins, beaming brightly. My heart broke even more seeing how i meant so little to her as compared to how she is to me. Maybe she enjoys seeing me fell sad for her or what , i don't know. Maybe she already has so many friends and my cousins' adore , so I don't mean much to her. Maybe I'm just too sensitive. Sometimes i even wonder if i should distant myself from her so that i don't have to feel like that anymore.

309,"So I live in a pretty big house but its in bad shape and way too far gone for me to think about trying to fix. This is only a temporary situation until I can save up enough to live in a nicer place.

Anyways, the house has no working heating system, so I rely on a space heater to warm my room at night. It works pretty well and I've had no problems normally until now. 

I have an 8 month old kitten named King who likes to cuddle me at night, so he normally sleeps with me with my door closed at night. However, I've lately been waking up to notice hes had to poo in the middle of the night and has decided to do it in my closet. Not fun. 

I dont want to leave him out of my room at night for many reasons, one being the temperatures get below freezing and with no heat in other parts of the house I worry he will get cold. Also, he has recently learned he can literally jump on the door with a force hard enough to open it so he can open the door while I'm sleeping. 

I tried leaving my door open at night, but the heat literally escapes into the rest of the house and negates it because I am still freezing. I dont know what to do. My room is not large enough for the litter box to be in and also its carpeted and I'd rather have the litter on a hard floor surface. Is there any way I can fix this situation? I am running out of ideas.",20Dec2020,1
310,"As you can probably tell, this is a throwaway account. I’m going to try and make this short because I can usually go on and on about things.

So, basically I don’t have many friends in real life, and I’m very lonely and depressed majority of the time. I have a few online friends that have helped me get through everything and I really, really rely on them. My mom is really against any social interaction with people i don’t know in real life, as most parents are. I don’t send anything sexual, or inappropriate and everyone i talk to is my age give or take 2 years. These people I talk to don’t know my personal information, and have good intentions- I understand I’m 16 and “young and dumb” but i’m really not a fucking idiot and I can make my own choices. I bought discord nitro one month ago because I thought the emotes were cute, and basically I didn’t realize my mom checks my purchases. A few weeks ago, my mom randomly comes in my room and asks if I have discord because she read some “bad articles” about it online, and says it’s for gamers (she doesn’t want me playing games who knows why). To which i replied that i had a group message on there with school friends. She said not to talk to people online and continued with her day.

So.. the purchase for discord nitro comes through tomorrow as it’s the last day of my nitro. I have made a fake discord with some people I know at school so that when she asks to go through my shit I can have a plan. Regardless, I am so so anxious. What if the purchase comes through with my username and it doesn’t match my fake account? what if she somehow finds out? I’m just really nervous because she has found messages with online people on my phone before and she took my electronics away for months and made me do everything in front of her.

i am really mentally unstable for a multitude of reasons right now, and if what happened last time happens again I think i will break in front of her. I don’t think i could handle that, It’d be the last straw. I really wish she would just respect that I’m an actual human being and not just her child and that I deserve privacy just like everyone else. I understand her concern, but at this age whatever I’m doing now, I’ll continue doing when I move out in one year. I’m not doing anything bad and she gets so upset over nothing. Does anyone have advice on how to deal with my nerves? how to cover up this situation from her? This whole thing is really ass and I have so many other things to worry about...",20Dec2020,1

I feel as if I’ve betrayed myself, my professor, and my classmates.

315,"I'm (F19) in my first year of university and it's been online cause... ya know. I started making friends online and I started talking to this guy (M20) from my university who I really like. At this point we've both admitted that we like eachother and sort of have a cute little banter going on. There are also times where it gets decently sexual, but not overly often. I always get confused as to whether or not he likes me and what he actually expects or wants from this. I've made multiple comments about us meeting and going on a (Covid safe) date, which I am actually very interested in doing.

The issue comes with his actions towards me. Everytime I make a comment about a date and he seems to be okay with it, I kinda take it a bit further to try and actually make plans, but that is usually met without a response, or him somehow changing the subject, or a generally unclear answer. We do talk on voice chat most nights and play games and such together, cameras on sometimes, off others, but idk why he avoids the idea of a date. I know he has issues with being anxious, and BPD, but idk if these play factors in this.

To top it off, the other night we were playing a game and he left pretty abruptly, saying he'd be back, then ended up saying he had to go. I tried asking what was wrong cause I'd assumed that something happened and he just said something like ""everything is fine I think"" and I was like ""you think??""... cut to about a half hour later he says he has to go and he Hope's I sleep well. I figured I'd leave it cause he didnt seem okay and well... even the next morning he avoided talking about it, and wouldnt tell me what was wrong. All day today he's seemed kinda cold and distant, minus a few bursts of him seeming decent, but most of my messages were ignored. In the past he has liked other girls at the same time as me (we've been talking online since late september) so it could be that but I'm not too sure... any idea what all this could mean? Aside from these things he's usually cute and flirty and interested, but I'm not sure.

It was just the three of us out here and I had to keep and eye on them even tho I was also practically wasted at this point. Bob started to get a little handsy with jessie so I separated them to the best of my ability and poured out the rest of the alcohol so they couldnt get it. It all went even further downhill from there. Bob kept getting worse and worse, at one point he even pulled his dick out and tried to force it on jessie. I had to hold her in my arms and pin bob down with my foot. This went on for hours until we all went home. I cut bob off as a friend and I talked to jessie about the situation and she says shes fine and it's ok but I cant help but blame myself for what happened.  It was my idea to go drink, and it was my idea to invite bob. I also feel like I could've realized what was going on faster if I wasnt drunk as well.

318,"(M13) I don’t get serious anxiety and are unable to speak due to that but instead I think it’s unnecessary, it’s also probably a mix of a little anxiety. The only time I really get anxiety is when my teacher asks me a question in class. (I don’t answer) and when they try to talk to me alone I also ignore them along with the other students. It’s made me a loner at school but I don’t really care. I think that school is only a place for learning you don’t need to talk to people. All the teachers should care about is your grades, well with social skills they shouldn’t care. Outside of school I try to attract least amount of attention. The only time I really talk to people outside of school is when my mom brings someone to the house. When she makes me meet them I only shake their hand and say a very quiet “Hello” then hide until they leave.

319,"just fyi.. I was born in the states, but our family left the country after a few years and came back during middle school, so i don't know anything about college and stuff also im first gen and my english is bad.

So, I'm really interested in arts, mainly pop music and character design and I really wanted to go to an art school. But obviously my parents didn't know how to prepare for it nor did they support my dream, so Im a junior already and I haven't even taken the SAT yet or take any art class during high school. Obviously they want me to be a lawyer or an engineer or stuff like that, but I feel like there's seriously no point of pursuing a career which i'm not interested... but they won't understand and it's just stressing me out cause whenever I talk this issue to my friends they tell me to follow my dream and shit like that but honestly it's so hard. 

I did persuade them about being a teacher, or a school counselor which isn't my no.1 goal, but since I would get to work with so many other teachers in school about art and music. I told them that it would be fine if I go to a community college near our house and transfer to another college after it, then they got so furious. 

Im struggling so much in school cause my english sucks, and it takes me more than an hour to do an assignment which other kids only take 30 minutes to do. my psat score this year was worse than last year, and I honestly don't understand how Im even passing my classes cause I know nothing. I didnt even dare for colleges in ivy league, nor the famous colleges in our state either, but my parents are pushing me towards them and I honestly don't even understand. I would be happy if I graduate from a non-famous college and be a high school teacher. People say that the income is low, and you'll struggle, but I just can't imagine a life doing something that you're not even interested. Giving up on arts are already so stressful for me and I just don't even understand why I'm like this, but I just need advice on this.

Is graduating from a good college that significant? And since i'm a first gen immigrant... I wonder what it's like for other first gens or immigrants. lastly pursuing in arts or secondary education.. I feel like I went on a tangent but I really need advice..",20Dec2020,1
321,"I am in the process of moving. So far, I have been hit with a surprise 250 tenant removal fee (was told that there was a fee to re-lease a place when terminating the entire lease, not to remove just one tenant, but I digress), and am moving into a new place next month. Will be very glad to do so. 

However, I think there's another hitch. I was going through getting the electric disconnected and reconnected. I started to think about how my roommate offered to pay her current sublease's electric when they move in from January-may.  I said we can offer to pay $35, as that is how much mine is. I then suggested if she wanted to offer more than that, that she could offer the other half. In my mind, I'll only be paying $17, as I said we will pay 35, not I. But, going through our text messages, I think she took that to mean that I'll pay 35, and she pays 35. Should I pay the $35 as I didn't make sure that she understand that I was only paying half of one portion of 35, or should I just tell her now?",20Dec2020,1

Usually I ask for very little but my sister convinced my mom to buy it for me because she knew I was interested in it. I should feel ecstatic and greatful but all I'm feeling rn is anxiety and shame.

Here's the thing, I'd say 90% of the time mom is pretty nice, but the rest of the time she risks flying into a rage and dumping all her anger and frustrations on me. It could start with anything really. Like someone forgot to turn off a light then suddenly she's screaming at me that I'm a good for nothing daughter and that I'm lazy and useless.

While I do love video games, during the lock down I haven't really played any. Most of the time I'm doing some other kind of hobby because I feel ashamed every time I boot one up. I even tell her that I play video games often but when she's mad that fact doesn't matter. It's like simply having an interest in them is enough ammo for her. This morning she was screaming at me that ""all I do is play video games"" which isn't true at all like I said. 

Idk it's late at night rn and I can't help thinking that getting that gift from her is just gonna cause more problems and I don't deserve to enjoy it. I almost feel like it would better if I had saved up to get the system myself and kept it a secret instead of having it hung over my head like this, which makes me feel even worse. but just thinking about accepting the gift is making me feel nausious.

I'm 13 years old, a trans male, and live in Ohio. I learned to steal and hide all of the important things from my parents (food, water, deodorant, clothes, etc) and am planning to make a secret backpack full of everything just in case something were to happen. Before you ask, I am not overreacting, I wouldn't do that if it were a small simple fight, it's been going on for years, I'm very much depressed and have been since I was around 5. If it gets worse one day, they will break all of my things, even things I paid for or helped pay for, if they find out I told anyone who knows what will happen to me.

I'm not sure how to get my shoes without anyone noticing and I have no idea where to hide the backpack, neither do I know how to safely climb out of my 2nd story window with my mom's van right in front of it. I tried calling CPS once but they didn't listen or seem to even care. It's gotten to the point where I want to self-harm again and commit, I even take a few pills to get high sometimes, I don't know what to do anymore, I know that if I do run one day they will look for me and go through all of my things.

Maybe even my laptop. I have no money to bring with me. However, they'll notice everything that I take is missing, they'll never give up searching for me and I might not be able to get my shoes or sneak unnoticed.

I told her no because her and her wife are my friends and I couldn’t do that, also it’s just not right. She claimed it was a test after I denied her and she was happy that I passed.

336,"I am a male, and my bestfriend is a female. Our ages done really matter but we are in late high school. My bestfriend is pretty pure of a person. She hasn’t smoke,drank,vaped and she’s a virgin. Now I just found out that shes sent pictures to her now bf, who I am really good friends with. Now she’s been my best friend for a couple of years and every few months or so, we will get super close, to the point of hanging out all day every day, even tho we already hangout every other day or two. But during those times I tend to develop feelings and I never make them known so they don’t really go anywhere and I lose them after a week or two. Now I’ve always had the vision of me ending up with her in the long run and even our friends and my parents think so but she’s never heard anyone say it so I don’t think the idea has ever gone through her head. Now I’m just adding that but in there to let you know that this could be based off of my feelings. But After I found out about the pics, I started to get worried and it’s weird seeing someone that I thought wouldn’t do something bad or atleast for a couple more years, do something bad now. And I’ve had a couple comments on previous posts saying that I look at her as less of a person or less of a future partner. I do not. Her doing anything bad doesn’t make me look at her any differently morally. Everything she hasn’t done, I have done myself but seeing someone like her do it is just offsetting to me. Another comment ive gotten is that I can’t control her and it is creepy. I do not act on anything I think of and don’t plan to. I’ve never told her what she can and can’t do and don’t plan on it. This is all just mental advice for me because It was just a feeling I got when hearing about it. Am I too overprotective of her? Is there another word that would be better used than overprotective?

340,"I lived in an apartment for 7 yrs, then my roommate last year exhibited psychopathic tendencies and I left in a rush to get away, and rented an apartment that was available asap. It was a traumatic period, I was afraid for my pet's life.

The apartment was available asap - but the landlord was in the paper in 2018 as a ""notorious slumlord"" who gaslit his tenants- he's known by name at court. I mentioned this concern to the management company when I moved in and they disliked me ever since. They are not the sensitive types,  which is fine, but It's a bit intimidating and sometimes they've singled me out in a way that feels gasligty. 

2 people at the new apartment were initially very kind. They hung out together a lot. A guy my age and a middle-aged woman. I was kind back. I haven't dated for about 7 years due to a personal choice to try to manage poverty, bullying, and my career instead. I've had only one friend pretty consistent for 10 yrs - a quadriplegic guy. 

So I responded to FB messages from this guy thinking he was a genuinely nice person and wanted to befriend me like he had my middle-aged woman neighbor. I'm a bit rusty in deciphering this stuff. I began to wonder if he wanted more and was trying to steer it to friendship... and stumbled on an article online one day that explained to me that it's being an ""asshole"" to not tell a guy if you don't want to date, so I told him.

 I asked if he wanted to be friends and he told me "" I already have enough friends"". well if I were actually dating right now and not trying to get out of a poverty cycle, he'd have disqualified himself right there as kindness and friendliness are my top qualities, and I want to be valued as a person. 

When I asked why he hung out with my neighbor, he denied that he ever did, even though they are frequently coming in together. His behavior changed from a very nice kind person to just like i didn't exist unless I wanted to date. Like no decency no interest, no friendly hi, wouldn't lift a finger if i needed a hand ect. 

It also became clear to me from his comments that he is aligned with the trump and anti- mask sentiment to some degree, and I'm not so It wouldn't have worked out for us. 

Months passed, and the initial jolt of his change wore off, and his lady friend who used to be sugar sweet nice to me, has begun to passively-aggressively harass me as I come in the apartment about mask-wearing. She always says things like I know how important mask-wearing is to you, or she'll walk to the other side of the yard when I come in, or say "" oh no I forgot my mask, I didn't think I'd see anybody ... ( all in sarcasm). I don't comment that she doesn't wear a mask. 

Then I come out the other day, the night before I had finished lyft driving till around midnight and there are a lot of carjackings in my area right now, and I was scared to park in the back lot at night(recently purchased parking pass)  and so i squeezed in the last space on the street, my car's butt was right parallel with the edge of the driveway. It was dumb, it was late, I won't do it again. I've seen another car or two do the same thing this week right there but whatever.

The next day I find a sign taped on my car "" TOW THIS CAR"" and in a different pen"" cars should be parked 5 ft from the end of the driveway""  and slimy yellow sauce, rice, shrimp smeared all over my windshield, tape taped all over my mirrors and handles.

So, this triggers my fear that this place is starting it's a downward spiral into bullying me out. There are a few other anti- mask types who seem aware of my ""snowflakeyness"" (I'm on next door and try to care about people). I get the sense they hate how nice I am. 

Today, I couldn't focus all day because my lady neighbor accosted me as I walked in with a passive-aggressive "" I'm not wearing my mask, didn't think I'd see anyone"" I think that's her trying to call me out on my hypocrisy for not always having a mask on if no ones around and I just need to get something from my car. I never comment on whether she wears a mask ( I've never seen her with one on). 

I couldn't focus today, and had a terrible day because of that one comment, because all my fears from past experiences kick in, and I just don't know how to respond. i am going to move this year, but my business is MIA until covid is over and I am vulnerable right now financially. 

The guy accosted me the first day parking in the back lot after this occurred and seemed to relish that this had caused me to use my back parking lot pass for the first time -I was parking right next to him and had to adjust my car to park, and when I got out he said "" just squeeze in there eh?"" with a gleam in his eye. 

I don't even know if he and the lady did it, but it feels likely. If it's someone else in my apartment ( there are a few anti-masker types) Idk- it still just feels scary. 

They say if you are assertive early it can help, and I don't know if that is true or if it will be kicking the hornet's nest. I've tried all approaches in the past. They all end with years lost and debt and poverty increased.  Once I'm assertive with them, I feel like it will go from passive-aggressive to distractingly unpleasant, and may tap into the off vibe of the management company as well. 

This has been putting me in this weird ""fear zone"" where everything feels karmically fated to come after me and I can't focus on my task list, drive the wrong way down a one way, forget things, and sit for hours worrying when I need to make money and work on training in for a new job.  I keep going over should I try this approach or that approach, what will work?

347,"**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A RLY LONG POST IM SORRY.**

we r both 18F and r so so close and literally tell each other everything and talk 24/7. its the hardest thing ive ever had to live with cos ive been pretty sure she doesnt feel the same way (unless shes a pro at hiding it)... until now...

ive only ever heard her talk about male celebrity crushes and bcos we go to an all girls school, neither of us hv any male friends and about 2-3 yrs back, she did say she was straight. recently tho, ive had this thought that she might be bi but is hiding it or doesn't know she is after looking back on certain occasions.

**some of the signs ive noticed:**

she did once say to me while we were on the train ""ppl r going to think we r girlfriends"" cos of how close we were standing together but we both just laughed it off so i assumed it was a joke.

a yr ago (i didn't know i was bi then), we were talking about the types of guys we find attractive and she was trying to find out my ""type"" so she was like ""brown guys?"" and i responded ""maybe"", ""white guys?"" i responded ""maybe"" and then she said ""white girls?"" and i looked at her in confusion and she just smirked it off (btw she's half white and half brown which is why i found it quite weird she said ""white girls?"" instead of ""brown girls?"" considering im brown and literally the majority of my friends r brown. maybe she suspected that im into girls idek) But i think all of this is just wishful thinking on my part tho :(

A while ago on her 18th bday, she insisted that id stand right next to her while she was about to cut her cake and didn't ask any of our other best friends (this kinda surprised me as she's not usually the type to choose between our friends right in front of the others cos she wouldn't want the others to feel they aren't as important of a friend even if it's for the tiniest matter). She started play fighting with me about how i made it so obvious that we were going to surprise her with a cake while i fought back saying i did not make it obvious at all and she got all up in my face while we were both in the heat of the moment and then i realised that we were literally inches away from each other’s faces before i awkwardly pulled away realising that a whole audience of my best friends were just watching us quietly ... if im gna be honest it felt like there was a weird sexual tension which is why my friends just watched quietly, not knowing what to do/say and idk i just sorta backed away from the situation in panic lol.

i feel like she treats me slightly differently from her other best friends (who r also my best friends - we r all in the same friend group). she openly told me that im her bestest friend out of all her friends so the special treatment might just be bcos I'm her ""favourite"" bestie and not cos shes into me.

However one thing thats been rly bugging me tho is the fact that she sometimes calls me her ""bro"" or ""sister"" which caused me to completely throw away the idea that she might like me cos i feel like it confirms to me that her love for me is just most likely platonic...so i feel wrong for liking her when i seem to be family to her. thing is i call her ""bro"" as well sometimes on text but only cos shes my best friend and obvs i need to act like one so she doesnt get suspicious.

And its the little things she does that i dont see her do for her other close friends such as doing things for me without me having to ask, sending ""love you"" on snapchat randomly (only happened twice tho), remembering very specific details of memories we had from yrs ago, trusting me with very personal things etc.

idk most of these r most likely how besties normally act but maybe im sensing something else bcos of how much im in love with her, i cant tell - its probs just all wishful thinking:(

any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",20Dec2020,1
348,"So there’s this girl that I’ve known since high school, I’ve had a crush on her for years. I only started speaking to her this year during quarantine.

About 2 weeks ago we started talking again, things were going well until she suddenly stopped replying to my messages. I am scared to message her again because I sent her 5 texts, by 5 texts I don’t mean 5 messages over different times. I mean sending her lots of messages within 1 minute. She didn’t respond to any of those messages. Not gonna lie I kinda panicked when she stopped responding, I thought I said some wrong. I messed by sending another asking her out even though she did not respond to my previous messages. I haven’t spoken to her in over 2 weeks.

350,"throwaway because i’m not super comfortable putting so much detail on my main acc - also sorry about poor formatting, i’m on mobile :) 

So essentially; I’ve been through a few traumatic experiences. Nothing hugely awful, and I’m very lucky in that regard, but I was raped when I was 14, have attempted suicide twice and have a very bad guilt complex surrounding the events of my past, as well as a few mental illnesses that I’m usually good at handling but can be intense at times, like most things. All of this together means that stressful situations for me can be stressful x10 and can put me in a very bad place sometimes. 

My sister is going through the same things I went through around her age- poor body image, self harm and depression/anxiety. She has pretty much no one to talk to about this so i’m generally her go to because she doesn’t get along with my parents. She used to see a therapist but that got too expensive and we’re on the waiting list for a different service that is free where I live. 

She talks to me about this often, and to be entirely honest, it’s really stressful. She actively self harms, and while my parents know, it’s hard to stop her from doing it because she’d have to be under constant surveillance. She has no therapist so asks me for advice on all of this (or just vents to me) and while I really want to be there for her, it’s really worrying for me to know all of this. It’s also just a bad time of year as it comes to the anniversary of a few things so I’m not feeling great generally. I’m trying to keep myself afloat and can’t take care of her without disregarding my own needs. 

I know she’s not my responsibility; but she has no one else, and if she doesn’t have anyone she’ll just internalise it and probably do even more harm to herself. I love her and I really want her to get better. A sidenote; i’m aware I should probably be in therapy as well, but again we can’t afford it right now and my parents don’t think I need it as much as my sister (which is a bad stance to take, but they’ve taken it). 

Honestly, I just don’t really know what to do. I have no one I can talk to candidly about this, and I’ve tried to on helplines but due to their responsibility to report certain things i often have to censor stuff which makes the advice I get much less relevant. I want to be there for her so much but I can’t be a stand in therapist anymore- it’s starting to really affect me. 

if you’ve read all of this, thank you. I’d really appreciate any words of wisdom or advice anyone has on the situation, and have a good day or night whoever you are &lt;3",20Dec2020,1

self-harm and suicidal thoughts



hi Reddit. I hate that I had to come here but I've been wracking my brain about it for a while. 

sorry for the format im on mobile. 

TL;DR: my internet friend is seriously worrying me and I don't know if I should seek help or stop being friends with them all together. this is a throwaway account and its very long so read if you want



my online friend is not just my friend, I've known them since I was about 12 now f(15) and we've been through a lot together. we lost contact with each other about two years ago but miraculously found each other again about 1 year ago.
I know this sounds weird but I'm starting to get worried for them again. when we first met we were both kids and we got along really well so we started to “online date” a few months after dating we lost contact and haven’t spoken to each other since. when we spoke back then, it seemed that he had some sort of split personality. some other background information is that we both had abusive childhoods and pretty sure we had some untreated trauma. when we spoke he would tell me that he would cut his wrists and suck the blood. this was very scary and traumatizing for me since I was still a kid but I never told him that. he would have these personas that would come out at random times. I know he wasn’t kidding because they would tell me how loud they would whisper and what they would tell him to do. afterward, he would have no recollection of it and continue the cycle. he would tell me how he would eat a human if he had the chance and what parts he would eat first. but the sad thing is that he was my only friend, and I liked him. he was there for me when I got home from school and he was there for me when I was finished getting screamed at. I loved his support but I don't know if it hurt me or affected me negatively. talking to him now he still hears the voices and I feel like he still has those personas. I don't want to leave him because I know he's a good person and maybe he needs me? if he does then I don't want to hurt him in any way. I think he's a great sweet person but I wouldn’t know if I would feel safe if I went to see him in IRL. I don't know if this is normal since it was my first relationship and one of my first friendships. what do I do? I cherish our friendship but I don't know if I should take it anymore.",20Dec2020,1
354," I feel really uncomfortable being shirtless / in my boxers around my parents and my sister, to the extent that I wear pajamas to bed even though I want to sleep in my underwear.

355,I have been with my boyfriend for a few years now. Things were going fine but covid hit making it harder for us to spend time together. For the last half of the year he has been working almost everyday for the whole day. Most days I barely get the chance to talk to him / one sided conservations. I’ve spoken to him previously about lack of communication and he promises to try harder. It’s been a month and the cycle continues. Somewhere along the way I noticed I started developing feelings for a co worker. I have never acted on it or expressed my feelings to my co worker. I’m just hoping it’s the lack of attention causing me to misinterpret my feelings. I don’t know what to do. My boyfriend has a lot on his plate and it’s feels as if he expects me to always be there even if he doesn’t acknowledge or speak to me for weeks...,20Dec2020,1
356," 

Last  night was our work Christmas party. I am a dentist and this party was  attended by the dentists and support staff (managers/reception/dental  assistant). The incident in question happened at the afterparty for  which I and one other dentist supplied the alcohol. The company is not  officially aware that the after party took place and gatherings of this  type (possibly due to covid) were discouraged.

I  got waaaay too drunk and passed out in the living room. While I was out  an individual or a group of people drew a large penis on my face. I had  no idea about this except that this morning I had awoken and one of the  dental had posted a picture of me in this state into our work group  chat (which has everyone in the surgery in it). I feel totally outraged  and humiliated by this behaviour, that it grossly violates my boundaries  and and be construed as a mixture of sexual harassment and cyber  bullying.

Other people either  don't care, have mild pity or have told me to laugh it off and get over  it.  I have threatened to complain about the picture taker to HR. One  person outright said that if I complain then the entire surgery will get  in trouble including the manager (who I absolutely have no problem  with). The picture taker has seemingly shared my message to her  threatening to make a formal written complaint because the manager  called me and left a voicemail reminding that it was not a work function  but a private event. I interpret this as being very defensive and just  pisses me off more, frankly. But yes, the manager and others are  obviously worried and would not be happy with me if I took the matter  further.

I'm still very angry  about this so I decided I should have some objective opinions before I  do anything rash. Am I the ass hole for threatening to complain about  the incident? Should I not take it too serious? Or is everyone else in  my surgery ass holes for thinking this is funny and basically trying to  put me in my place and not speak out about it?",20Dec2020,1
357,"It’s been almost a year. On my way home after the Valentine’s Day, I came home and three guys popped on me inside the building where I live. They put pressure on me to get my money and all my belongings. I fought hard and only got my wallet robbed. After that I moved out. Recently someone tried to rob the phone of my Gf, put didn’t succeed. 
All these events are very troubling me, to the point that I don’t want to go outside, especially by nighttime. I once came back late from a friend’s party, and I was hella scared in the street. I don’t want to go outside if it’s to feel so anxious and to look behind me every 10sec. Most of all, I’m afraid my girlfriend runs into trouble. Now when she’s not answering on her phone I’m starting to worry. I don’t feel safe anymore, and fear taking common transportation such as subway or bus (I live in a big city without a car)

I asked if she would show she didn’t show her boobs and she only showed half of her face which is cool because I didn’t show mine. Could she maybe post the video",20Dec2020,1
359,"Could it be poor body language or poor posture or not speaking clearly or avoiding contact or it could be anything else and something that I am missing? I feel like even if I do all of the right things-straight posture. I have always had the problem in school of people ganging up on me, watching everything that I do, stalking me, ruin my personal property, and people give these shitty advices about being likeable, making jokes, adapting, like I have tried and I can't do that, and I see that some people can't do it too. People form groups and they either like you or dislike you. I received another moronic advice on my earlier question asking how to make people stop messing with me and seem threatening even if  I am a small female and I do not want people to think it in a way that I am going to beat them up but just generally not harass me and leave me alone, I do not want to set up an example by beating someone up since usually the bad people have good support systems all through out the cities. 

 I am bitter and s\*\*\*\*\*\*\* and just want people to stop harassing me and stop looking at everything that I do and even more harassing me for it, I remember asking a question how to deal with bullies on the school computer and the school bullies, who like always were watching every movement that I do, made fun of me for that too. I want to live my life to the fullest and stop depending on friends to deal with bullies, but it gets lonely and hard and bullies manipulate everyone's perception of me and act nice and people can't actually believe that I am bullied. Now about the police, where I live the police doesn't help at all, so if you are going this shitty adivce, just shut up. The teachers only did so much and I went through a lot of abuse but kept my smile since I had no one to save me or help me with the bullies at school. I am just tired and to the point where I actively self harm, am ashamed and hate the whole male gender, it actually hurts me how people call me autistic yet it is somehow okay if people in real life tell me to go die r\*\*\*\* and that I will never find a boyfriend cause I am so ugly, but IF I experess my pain online- im a b\*tch, I am autistic, I will never find a man with this attitude and so on,

 I may delete reddit since I encounter many trolls and morons who don't help me at all. They give horrible and shitty advices, like if kindness and ignoring actually worked against toxic people I wouldn't have asked 10 different questions about it already. Also beating up someone is impossible, I am tired of pretending to be strong and be strong and be on my own all the time, it gets lonely. I am full with regrets and just want this to end but I do not want to die, but I am not sure if I can continue to live either, I just want a calm life with a few friends that doesn't involve harassment by the male gender in the form of bullying where some random people I do not even talk to but share school/work or house with just randomly gang up on me, insult me, attack me, throw things at me and degrade me and make me cry and do not stop until I cry or start to hurt my self or stop washing or do something even more self destructive. 

Is there a possible way to find out, to do inner work and find out what in me makes people think it is okay to abuse me? Like I have went to a psycholgist but he didn't help me much and I am already ashamed of going to one, since there is a huge stigma against them and I am already called names like crazy, defective and being blamed for the abuse I endured. I do not want to hate the male gender but it is not my fault that most of them do not like me romantically and can't keep basic respect, I am usually quiet, draw, and keep to my self, I don't really bother anyone and could be descrbied as shy. I do not want to be loud since if I ever am, people just put me down and tell me to stop to pretend to be interesting. So how can I make people scared of me and not approach me. I wear dark colours but if they are okay with abusing me since I don't defend my self then it is no use. 

Also I do not understand why am I not likeable, not everyomne is good at making jokes, I sure never was good at making jokes and even though I shared a lot in common with my classmates through out middle and high school i was never part of their groups and just stood there like an outsider and they rarely invited me anywhere and didn't care about me. I hate how the bullies live rent free in my mind while they don't give two \*\*\*\*\* about me and do not even remember half of the things they did to me. When giving advice give it to someone who is not a man, who is traumatized and who is not from america(stop with your f police, it is annoying and useless) so like all of this- beat them up karate kid style crap, won't work for me since my country has different laws and my body is small and fragile, I can't beat anyone but I am tired of depending on people for friendship and strengths is in numbers bullshit cause alone I am somehow vulnerable and always get attacked, can't I be alone and enjoy my own company without being bullied by classmates, hell even strangers on the street started bullying me after 10th grade or so. Is there a way to not attract machiavelists, narcissists, old creeps, children who make cruel jokes on me on the street, what is wrong with me and why do these people go to me? Is it because I wanted to ''fix'' everyone and became codependent since that is all I knew all of my life? Is that why people don't talk much to me and do not want me in their group and seem annoyed by my presence when all I wanted was one friend, good grades and to get along with everyone? Could it also be my overempathy? i don't know, If you have an effective strategy for dealing with this, that is not ignoring it or beating the other person up, please tell me, I would love to hear anything that is not those two black and white strategies that only make problems worse.

I tried to deescalate the situation, by talking to the gentleman with a gun. After a while my friend went inside and I just talked to the gentleman with a gun for a LONG time. We talked about life and how things were up until that point. Eventually the cops showed up but they didn’t really bother doing anything. I told the gentleman that I was sorry for the way my friend acted and made sure every thing was okay between us all. I told him to get out of there before things got worse. I don’t know how to feel about the whole situation that just happened. Was I in the right to deescalate the situation? Right now I feel pretty stupid. But everything seems to be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit brave for posting this on my main, but here it goes.

My 'attachment' to people is a big issue. It has definitely led to heart ache, sadness, and disappointment. 

So - I got this great job a couple of months ago, every day was a challenge and something new. My colleagues are great people - I genuinely love speaking to them, and just overall having a good time.

But - I have an issue of getting too attached to people and not interpreting signals correctly. This eventually leads to the other party to not dealing with me anymore (I don't really blame them to be honest) and just... cutting me off.

This has eventually developed into me not opening up - or being personable with people as I am simply too scared of this attachment growing. Sometimes they message me out of work (We all have each other on social media, big mistake on my end!) and I just leave on seen or reply blandly, or sometimes in the middle of a conversation I just never reply, simply because I feel like this will go down the same road as before, just being too attached.

Every day I struggle keeping myself composed (I take photos just to get my head off things, this is the only thing that gets me going through the weekend). 

Should I tell this to my colleagues? Should I keep it a secret? I really don't know. At the end I'm just not happy with how I am. I get suicidal ideations every single night and just remembering the relationships/friendships that I have fucked up literally gives me anxiety and it has definitely caused some sort of trauma.

I don't go through with suicide because I just think of my parents on how sad they will be. But - once my parents pass away I am planning to fully commit as I really don't want to live this crippling anxiety with every single relationship/friendship.",20Dec2020,1

Gemini: the people who are meant to love you won't have to be fought for. I know how badly you want to love and be loved in return. You yearn for that closeness, but sometimes, you just try to hard for people who really don't deserve you. Be yourself, the right people will come along.

385,"I am a teenager (16f) and I have a sister (13f) that I am no longer supporting.  My sister was becoming unfriendly a while ago, but I said: oh, okay, she is like this because she is becoming a teenager!  He'll get over it.  But that did not happen.  Now we spend all day arguing over nonsense and that does not stop irritating me.  She does not want to help with the housework, she does not pay attention to her mother (and she has some reason there, but it does not mean that she has the right to speak bad of our mother or not speak to her), if someone reproaches her, she will ask that person a lot of questions, she will keeps giving nonsensical answers, She DOESN'T SHUT UP, damn it.  And an infinity of other things: like that she does not stop arguing with our little brother on the cell phone or that she spends a lot of time in the bathroom ""BRUSHING her hair"" and looking in the mirror.  Please, any advice?  I just want my relationship with her to improve.  It irritates me a lot when I say something to her and she ignores me.

So I have this iPhone, one without the earphone jack- I hate wireless earphones so I use an adapter/dongle to plug in my earphones to the phone and listen to music or whatever else- only problem is, these adapters are shit. It connects and disconnects or sometimes doesn’t connect at all. I get crap ones from eBay but mostly because I don’t want to spend £20 on one but I’m starting to think that might solve my problem.

So, any recommendations for a new dongle that won’t interrupt my shows etc?

389,"I dont know what to do. He flirts with me [23F] at work. Ive told him a few times that hes too young for me. I live in a state where legal age of consent is 16, and my state doesnt have any laws on ""dating"" a 16 yr old just some regarding penetrative sexual activity. He brought that up to me. I checked he was right. Ive told him that i wouldnt feel comfortable dating him. Ive even reported him to my managers, well another person did. Hes super forward around me and talking about kissing me and all of that. He's kind of obsessed and always super nice to me. Literally does whatever i ask him to. 

Our first day of working together he asked how old i was and seemed shocked by my response and asked to see my ID (i look like im 17). 

The second day he asked me about my sex life and i told him i wasnt comfortable talking to a minor about that. 

Hes continued to flirt with me since and has even taken a write up for sexual harassment. I dont know what to do. Its a really good paying job and i dont really want to leave my job because i really like what i do. i cant go zero contact because hes still in school he can only work evenings and im the main closer. My manager already said that i cant be transfered. 

He a decent looking guy and doesnt look like hes 16, i thought he was older than me when i first met him. He's funny, but i always find myself being passive agressive/sarcastic towards him. 

My coworkers all know he has a thing for me. Theyve all told me/hes told me. 
A few of them hyped him up to offically make a move. He winked at me.
He puts ice down my shirt on occasion.  
One told me to let him have a chance. 
One of them asked for details. 
One said tell him that our GM wouldnt be okay with us dating because we work the same shifts. 

Im at my end. I dont know if i should, i dont know how to tell him no to make him stop, i dont know if i might be attracted to him or if im just tired of telling him to leave me alone and im caving.",20Dec2020,1

393,"Hi, I’m 20. I met this guy, who is 16, and we hit it off fairly well. Being friends w/ benefits is up in the air for the both of us. The guy really wants to. 

I haven’t had sex in two years (since my last serious relationship), and I usually have sex to make love. I’m not a casual sex type of person. He is younger than me, and I usually go for older guys. I was skeptical of the age at first, but it is literally a 4 year age difference. People have larger age gaps. The sexual consent where I live is 16, so I think I’m good? I don’t know. I feel bad for even considering having sex. It feels wrong, but I like him a lot. 

Initially, I turned the idea down and rejected him. 
However, I’ve been thinking about this fwb concept lately. I am sex-deprived, not going to lie. I miss it so much, but I refuse to have sex with just anyone, though  I vibe with the guy well. He even said he wouldn’t just hit it and be gone. We could “have sex, cuddle, have sex again...” It’s whatever I am comfortable with. He even said that he just doesn’t want me to do something I regret. 

I’m just concerned that our fwb relationship could potentially turn into a real relationship (because we like each other a lot), and I honestly don’t mind it. However, he is young, and I just think that when he gets older, he will get tired of me or something. I don’t want to feel that someone is falling out of love with me. That’s why I’m scared to pursue any kind of relationship with him— I’m scared to get hurt. 

What do I do?",20Dec2020,1
395,"My (24M) dad often calls me ""love"" and ""my darling"" which is beyond cringe and makes me very uncomfortable.

In my opinion, these terms of endearment shouldn't be used by fathers to refer to their sons, especially when they're adults! My mother or grandmother doesn't even call me ""my darling"", and I've never heard another father refer to his sons in this way past infancy...

Over the past 10+ years I've told him to stop calling me these names and made it very clear that I don't like it. However, for some reason he just won't stop... Admittedly, as I've got older it happens less than it used to, but it still slips on occasionally, despite him knowing I strongly dislike it.

It's as if he relates to me like a little girl rather than an adult man, which I find very disturbing and not what I want my relationship with my father to be like. Phrases like ""my darling"" shouldn't be on the tip of his tongue when talking to me; its just weird.

How can I get him to stop saying things like this?!? Unfortunately, simply telling him to stop clearly hasn't worked in past...",20Dec2020,1
396,"My bf (21M)and I(21F)are in a LDR. We have been in it for about a year and a half and the distance it's been tough. 
I am studying a double degree in my country and it's 6/7 years long. 
I don't really enjoy it and I don't like my university. If it was up to I would had quit a long time ago. 
I'm on the 4th year and I have a lot failed subjects from the previous years. 
I tried sticking to just one of the two degrees this year, so that I finished everything next year including my failed subjects. 
I study Law and Philosophy, so Law was the obvious degree to choose because of the job options. 

But my parents made me switch back into the double degree again, I felt miserable. 
My bf is finishing his degree this year, he wanted to study a Master's degree but instead he is trying to find a job in my country, so that we could move on together. His parents are saying that he is not going to make it, and even though his whole family lives in my country  they don't let him stay at his grandma's for more than a month , so it's difficult to get a job that way. 

His degree is really not common in my country and he would be able to find job much easier in his country, including the fact that is really difficult to find whatever job in my country. 
I would prefer to live in his country and I wouldn't mind moving at all, so I am thinking about finishing my double degree in online school , so that I could do it in his country. But I don't know how to proceed or how to tell my parents, because they are not going to be supportive at all. 
They want my bf to come here and that's it.",20Dec2020,1
397,"My girlfriend of 2 years has diagnosed BDD (body dysmorphic disorder) and depression.

 This makes her daily life a struggle.  triggers include seeing inappropriate things of women on tv for e.g if she sees a woman in underwear and a bra, even on a 20 second advert she immediately has to leave the room, where this then can lead to palpitations. Her mind will then race with a hundred thoughts and questions. 
""Why can't I look like that?!"" ""Why is he with me?!"" ""I need surgery"" ""i am so ugly"" and in the meanwhile she will cry to herself.

She will think that I'm going to leave her at any moment because she believes she is not attractive at all, and that I cant wait to leave. I always reassure her but anyone who knows anyone with bdd will know its not as easy as that. 
She eventually became sick of this pain and seeked help after some encouragement. 
 The doctor sent her to a therapist, who said that she believes past relationships have caused her this self hate. Past boyfriends would constantly put her down and tell her things like ""you would look better if you were skinnier"" and ""you're ugly when you cry""  and many more. 
Also all these boyfriends would end up cheating on her.. which in turn fuelled the self hate. One of them were physically abusive too. She had all this by the time she was 24.

This has left her with this and other ongoing mental health conditions that makes normal day to day life hard.
With the BDD, I have to imdb films before we watch them just incase there is nude scenes or sex scenes of women or even if there is a 'this film may contain sex or nudity', Thats a definate cant watch that film. We can't watch TV shows together because of the same reason. 

She will go through my social media friends list and then ask why I am friends with certain women ""is it because they are hot and I am not?""
She will ask me everyday ""do you love me?"" And when I reply ofcourse I do, she follows with ""are you sure?"" 

It is painful and I really do feel for her and how hard it must be. I have been through the wars with her and dealt with many arguments because she wanted reassurance all the time.. and at times after work I would get annoyed , regretfully might I add because the day to day when she asked ""whats a matter?"" ""Have I done something?"" Over and over.. when my reply im just tired, is not believed. And that it must be that she has done something or that i must just want to leave.
It does get to you. So we end up arguing because she says I should be more reassuring and following all these rules. 
To the point on a normal circumstance I would say some behaviours feel controlling but I know that she's not trying to do that. She is just not coping with her bdd and depression. We had an argument one night a few months ago, I was horrified to find that in the morning when I woke up.. she had self harmed all up her legs and arms. 
 She tells me on multiple occasions that if she didn't have her kids she would be gone.
I have guided her on the right path to get help and speak to people.. which she is finally doing but they have even said her mental health is so complex she will probably need a psychiatrist.

 When I try and speak calm about anything I feel she is doing that is affecting me.. she takes it personally and it turns to how I think she's an awful person and that her exs must of been right.  
We end up in blazing rows over the silliest of things..
This relationship has pushed me to the limit . Its come to the point that I feel we are going to break up. Because I am weak and can't handle all this stress anymore. And just see that single life looks likes stress free bliss compared to all this. But in turn I cant imagine how it would affect her. I would feel almost to afraid to leave because of what she does or how it would hurt her. 
I just don't know what to do anymore . I actually finish work and dread coming home because of all this. I have sat in my car for a couple of hours because I knew everything that she said would be negative as soon as I get through the door. 
 I walked in and told her I had worked overtime. All just to get a couple of hours to myself with peace.

 A relationship is ment to be love, fun, laughter. Happy memories.

Instead its arguing, stress and pain. 

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a year ago. And so it is like when a tornado meets volcano (ref. Eminem  - love the way you lie)

398,"Hey! Long post ahead. Im 13M, in 8th grade, everyone in my class is also 13. As every teenager, we have a group chat on insta. A while back I posted this image ( [https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fpyrocynical%2Fcomments%2Fjq66bc%2Fdo\_it\_repost%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw1neskjqSSnevyelM8Hc-LR&amp;ust=1608546850808000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLjurp2u3O0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fpyrocynical%2Fcomments%2Fjq66bc%2Fdo_it_repost%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw1neskjqSSnevyelM8Hc-LR&amp;ust=1608546850808000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLjurp2u3O0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD) ) Its a ninjago meme that says ""repost for ninjago, ignore for womens rights). Im guessing since you posted it in group chat, i technically reposted it. Either way, there are these three girls at our school who will be R, M and J. M goes ahead, and calls me out, starting with ""what the f\*ck OP"" and I just said it was a meme. Either way, 30 minutes of convo, she says it obviously wasnt meant as a joke, that im a sexist, and that it isnt a meme, and that the word behind it means more. During this, i just kept saying it was a meme, etc. J said KAM multiple times addressed to me, when I called her out, she said she was joking. It ended with me being outed as an AH, a sexist who doesnt appreciate women, and (somewhat) of a r\*pe influential.

Come today, R is talking about something, then P (13M, one of my friends) Says the F-slur in a message explaining something along the lines of; ""If your a squeaker, you will be d called a f\*g left and right"".  R took at as offense towards herself, and M started posting screenshot saying that, "" P is okay with saying the F slur"" etc. (He says nothing during this whole convo). J, R and M all start talking about how bad he is, and that P called R the f-slur. Even when from the Screen shot, it wasnt addressed towards her, but more used to explain something. They talk about it, and decide to send an email to the principal, who is gay... They all wrote paragraphs to send to him, talking about it, with ss proof, etc. (They havent sent it yet, as of today). They go of on a tangent about how its out of their hands, how they are fighiting for justice, and how they want an apology. 2 people jump to his defense, instantly get shut down, since, from their words, ""defending a homophobe"". 

And even know, ive just read all of it, and dont even know what to say. My friend can get expelled, my parents, their parents will be emailed, this will be suck a huge fucking issue.

We talked quite a bit and then one day I said I may ask her out and she said she might even say yes and was also pretty impressed because I'm quite a shy guy and something like that coming from me is kinda big? Now that happens and yeah I was quite into her at that time but that's when actual realsation starts hitting me, I don't want to get distracted from my studies, a whole bunch of other stuff I have to do, and another main thing may (emphasis on may) be that I'm not THAT into her. And the scene here is that we've both never dated and shes looking for that one perfect guy, lost hope in love and all before bc of this one other weird ass guy. Now we havent met irl and I dont even know when we will but I dont really feel that I'm in for a relationship or something, I feel miserable when she sends me songs and how shes probably feeling and how I'm feeling NOT the same way. Now I know the top advice I'm gonna be getting from here is just to say it to her but if by chance theres something else, some other way of telling her indirectly that I may not exactly be in for a relationship and all, please please tell it to me, I don't want to ruin our friendship, shes a great girl and all...

My family , along with family friends, were having an early Christmas get together party and I had too much to drink. So I went upstairs to lay down. I don't know how much longer later, I woke up to a... *sensation* on my groin area. 

Long story short , it was my older sister umm.. performing oral sex in me until I pushed her off and away. I guess she was embarassed or came to her senses because she almost immediately got up and left the room while mumbling some shit about how ""covid made her do it"" because of the isolation , therefore lack of sex and /or human contact..?

403,"About a month ago I told my friend that I wanted to hook up, no strings attcahed, with them because I felt like I trusted them, was honestly a little too desperate to lose my v card, and was drunk when I texted them suggesting that we hook up. So we arranged to meet a week after I texted them, we were both pretty nervous going into it, but like, ya'll know how quarantine is, at some point I think we were both hornier than we were afraid. 

Before I knew it, the day came, we met up and went into this secluded spot in the woods to do it. I have clinical depression and generalized/social anxiety my symptoms had been acting up lately because I'd been forgetting to take my medication so I took a melatonin pill before I got there to calm my nerves (it'll be a more important later). Anyway, we get to the spot in the woods and at this point I can feel my anxiety spiking, but try to push it aside as we try to just get into the mood and shit. We only manage to get to making out before I admit that I'm really scared and don't think I can hook up with my friend. I end up laying in their lap nervously apologizing, my friend keeps saying it's okay and that they understand, but keep trying to hold and kiss me. I don't remember every detail super well (my memory tends to be kinda spotty because my meds make me a derealize a lot of the time). At this point, I'm kind of a nervous wreck and am starting to get kind of sleepy from the melatonin I'd taken earlier. I continue to say that I'm sorry for not being ready to hook up and my friend keeps nudging me to kiss them. I don't feel good about it, but I kiss them back because I felt bad for letting them down, until eventually I suggest that we leave the spot we're in because I was falling asleep and that was that evening. 

About a week later my friend tells me that they've actually liked me for a while and suggests we date. I turn them down because I felt uncomfortable with them after what happened and I felt kind of used because they said they didn't like me before but now it felt like they'd either had an ulterior motive the night we met up or was just saying they liked now me so I'd hook up with them again. 

I tried to push it aside, and give them the benefit of the doubt and give our friendship a 'second chance' of sorts. We hang out again with two of our other friends the week after (I don't feel comfortable being alone with my friend after what happened) they I turn my friend down, but the thing is our other friends are a couple and are very open about PDA. Basically, we go out onto a field to just chill and watch the stars and the couple decides to do a lil extra (if you catch my drift) and I guess my friend saw that as a sign we should do something. I told him no again and he settles for cuddling and turning the other way to give our other friends from privacy. Throughout the rest of the evening, my friend continues to kiss and hold me, but in all fairness, I guess I never directly said no to that, but I dunno, I thought that changing my mind about hooking up and then rejecting them would be enough. 

Regardless, I feel into a bit of a depressive episode after all of that, and I'm recovering now, but after some reflection, I'm beginning to believe that what happened wasn't okay, but I'm not sure if that's true or if I'm just tripping. One part of me wants to confront my friend and let them know that their actions make me uncomfortable, but another part feels like I'm not justified because I never directly told them no to certain actions. I don't exactly know how to feel, can anyone give me advice or insight into what I should do?

tl;dr: my friend keeps approaching me sexually even after I told them I wasn't interested, but I don't know if I'm justified in feeling used/uncomfortable",20Dec2020,1
404,"Hi, as the title says, I'm in a pretty rough situation. First a little background: 3 years agoI started a small scale soft drinks bussines, and a year ago things were really looking good. I needed help with the bottling operation, so my gf moved to my house, further formalizing our relationship. Things were going great, however, the covid-19 pandemic did really hit us hard. Bussiness was really low, and, to make things worse, I got infected, apparently during a delivery, and infected my gf.

We had to stop bottling, so we lost our income, and had to spend a month in quarantine. Fortunately, we made it alive even tough we lost taste for a few weeks. Unfortunately, our bussiness was doomed as no one wanted to buy from us and our regular costumers didnt have money. 

We had the money we were saving for our wedding and honeymoon, so we are not broke yet. However, we might run out in a few months, and there arent exactly many jobs avaible. We talked about it and it even crossed our minds to move to a small plot of land I have in the countryside to live off the land and start raising chickens, mealworms, goats or whatever for our own consumption and to make a profit.

So, what would you do in our situation? How could I use the money we still have to get us out of this rough spot?",20Dec2020,1
405,"My brother was the smartest, most charming person I've ever seen. He was funny, a great chef, he learns everything so quickly and he was so kind. But he also had a bad habit of taking short cuts. He would cheat his way through college and drop out when he was only 1 year till graduation to start-up. He had a lot of great ideas but well, none of them was successful. He's very creative and great at arts but he never seems to be able to put his talents into something useful. A few years ago his girlfriend became pregnant, he promised to change but he went into debt and became addicted since he was so stuck. Now, I've always found myself to have the same personality as him. I've always looked up to him and admired him so much. I also like the arts and kinda-creative, quick at learning stuffs but also, quick at giving up. I find myself starting to take short-cuts, just like him. COVID's online learning hit me so hard, and it always came to my mind as - if I don't have to study and still get a passing mark, why would I study? I've been learning absolutely no knowledge, I don't even know how the heck I'd continue my study in more challenging courses next year. I've already dropped one of my degrees (I was double degree) since I found it too ""challenging"", yet useless. I'm so scared, but yet I can't stop myself from taking short-cuts like him.

I am literally her only mechanic I do all the maintenance and repairs on it. I go and fix her up a glass of her favorite soda every day and also I get her favorite coconut ice cream from the fridge for her everyday. While she’s at work I’ll text her sweet messages so that she has a great start to her day... I can keep the list going and going. I’m no angel or perfect at all but some how everything I do/am is never enough for her. My whole life shes always made me seem and feel like a bad son and a bad person even when I make small tiny mistakes which could be as simple as only locking the door knob and not the dead bolt to the door which is a real thing. She’s always compared me to other mothers and their son’s and would say things like “I envy that mother and her sons relationship” or “Jennifer(my sister) has always loved me more than you have and always will”. Almost everyday she tells me that she wishes I could love her more or care about her more. She puts me down a lot and tells me that I don’t care about her at all. I do everything in my will to be a good son and make sure that she doesn’t feel alone. My older sister molested me when I was 2-3 years old and when I told my mom about this a few months ago she got mad and said Im not honest with her and that I should’ve told her a long time ago. After I told her my sister molested me she just left me and took off I’m her car because was mad at me..... just today I heard her on the phone with my sister and they were both talking about me in a not good way. Today was when I really felt choked up and felt like I was drowning and I something in my heart told me that shooting myself in the head would solve these problem and that thought kinda made me feel better. I’m tired.... I don’t want to feel like a bad person anymore and I don’t want to be told that everyday anymore... I’m tired of being afraid to come home because I already know what’s going to happen when I walk through the door..... how am I not a good son? How do I not care about her about my own mother?

407,"Once again. I heard the girl yelling at him to stop, that he is killing her. I heard loud thuds and her crying.

I'm really scared of him honestly.

I hit the wall between us few times so he could hear me. He stopped and started cussing at me and my family.

First of all, we are the only neighbors who can hear him and he knows that. If I call the police he will know it's me. 

And also I'm sorry to say that the police won't do nothing. Nothing, I'm serious. I'm very sure that they would show up and tell him to make up with his wife and calm down then shake hands with him and leave.

And then he would take revenge on us. What the hell do I do? I can't just stay here and hear how his wife cries and begs him to stop hitting her. And dammit she won't leave him. And I can never talk to her, she barely gets out the house, and when she does it is always with her husband.

411,"About 2 months ago, I (14 f) found out that one of my bestfriends (15 m) is in a group with other guys where they send photos and videos of girls asses and shit like this. I also found out that he brags to his guy friends that he's ""hanging out with a girl"" everytime he hangs out with me. 

He's been one of my bestfriends for 7 years. My biggest fear is being sexualised (mostly due to being sexually harrased by someone I trusted) and this is very scary for me.

I've been avoiding him for the past 2 months and I don't know how long I can avoid him for. I cannot confront him about this but I'm not sure what to do.

412,"Hey all,

Not sure if this is the most appropriate place to post this, but basically my boyfriend got a chicken sandwich from a fast food joint on his way to see me and was eating it in his dark car, took a good few bites before realizing the inside was REALLY raw. He took pictures, a bit of it was cooked but A LOT was entirely raw. He then got home and kissed me and told me what happened, and later on we exchanged more saliva. I got to thinking, if he had contracted salmonella or something from the chicken, could he have passed it to me? I'm really paranoid about this kinda stuff. Is there anything you guys suggest we do to mitigate any effects this situation might have?

Thanks in advance",20Dec2020,1

I’ve had countless talks with her over the years and I’ve explained the best I can,that not everyone that messages you asking if you’ll buy something from them Is trustworthy,but it feels like she’s not listening to me. I don’t want her to put herself in a dangerous situation like she has before,but It feels like she isn’t taking in a word of what I tell her on an almost monthly basis,I feel like I’m going round in circles sometimes with her,explaining the same thing,but differently worded. She’s in her late teens so she can technically now do what she wants ,but I have to know how else I can help her. Do I tell her parents? Do I get her off social media until she’s ready?

415,"Hey,

I have been growing apart from one of my good childhood friends lately and i need some advice on what i should do.

My friend and I moved countries and now live in the same city. Ever since we moved we started to grow apart (he started to get new friends and hung out with them a lot).  He's extroverted while I am kind of introvert and struggle to make new friends (I have not told him directly but its pretty obvious imo). He purposely tries to keep the 2 friend groups apart (which i dont really think i have a problem with) even though the other friend groups wants to meet me)

He is, what i would call, a simp. He puts girls not only in front of his guy friends but more importantly, he puts them over himself. For example: When we moved here, we just turned 18 and i asked him to drink together, but he denied and said: he doesn't want to drink at all and will never do it (Which is I understand). After that, multiple times he drank because girls told him to and still denies to drink with his guy friends. The point here is that he constantly puts female friends above his guy friends and himself. Lately me and some other guy friends are his last option to hang out when everyone else is busy.

&amp;#x200B;

My second problem im having, is that when he hangs out with us, a lot of what he says is him complaining. He's looking for a girlfriend and complains that no girl likes him even though he asked 1 girl out in the past 6 months. He got rejected and keeps on complaning how he should not of asked her out,how he would still be friends with her and how no girl likes him. He also complains on how broke he is, even though he has the extra time to get a job, he won't take it because it takes too much time (10-12h a week) and would rather have free time.

&amp;#x200B;

We (me and some guy friends) keep on trying to help him but to me it just seems like a lost cause.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really like to hear your guys opinion, am i just being petty? What should i do? Do i just need to make new friends? Do i just break bread with him?",20Dec2020,1

421,"We are both 22, but I finished college 2 years ago and make around 6 figures and she is still in school and struggling with 2 jobs to keep things rolling. She's been my best friend since 7th grade so we're very open with things, but money is a tough subject of course. I am sending her a christmas gift but want to also include a monetary gift. 2 years ago I sent her around $250 to help her meet rent for the month. We've never discussed it since and although she said she'd pay me back, she hasn't. I don't expect her to pay the money back as I know things are tough for her and am not pushing for it- but I bring it up because contact ceased a little after that time and I'm afraid she felt awkward accepting the money and didn't know how to say she couldn't pay me back, even though I told her it was absolutely fine. After that time I felt a little stupid for intertwining friends with money, although I've had friends (in a better financial situation) borrow much larger sums from me and pay me back within hours so I had thought nothing of it.

So the question is now do I just send her the gift and leave it at that, include $50 and have it feel like a little slap in the face, or include $100 and make her feel awkward, or am I just overthinking this whole situation? I want to ease her money stresses without making her feel like she owes me something. Any advice appreciated.",20Dec2020,1

425,"So, I was with a man for ten years.  We were married for two and a half years before he filed for divorce because he didn’t want kids, his family hated me, and he said I wasn’t high enough in my career/didn’t make enough money.  I waited eight months before I started a new relationship.  Things seemed to be going well until one night, after we hadn’t seen each other for a week because his employer overworked him, we were supposed to have a date but he accidentally slept through it.  He didn’t text me until around 11 the next morning. I said mistakes happen and I wasn’t mad at him.  But, then he didn’t suggest we reschedule and he didn’t text me back for the rest of the day.  At this point in the relationship, I had fallen in love with him.  He was everything I was looking for in a partner.  The next day, after he still hadn’t texted me back, I accused him of cheating on me.  It was a stupid thing to say but, I was just mad.  He ignored me for another day and would read my texts but, not answer.  Then he said he never wanted to see me again because it was too early in the relationship for cheating allegations and his ex’s would accuse him of cheating, when they were the ones that were cheating.  I apologized but, he would just read the texts and never answer.  A week of me texting and him just reading them went by and finally I told him he clearly didn’t want a relationship, he just wanted sex.  Then he blocked my number (you can find this out easily with iMessage).  A couple of weeks go by and I see his profile on a dating site and my stomach lurched.  I didn’t add him, obviously but, it hurt.  I wanted to do the psychological process of sharing my feelings without actually sending it to the person.  So, I texted his number, assuming I was still blocked and he wouldn’t receive it anyway.  It turns out, I wasn’t blocked anymore and he read my response but, did not answer.  Every couple of days I would send him texts and he would read and not respond.  I sent him some texts this weekend but, he hasn’t read them.  I assume it’s because he’s with someone new and it breaks my heart.  I have a hard time sleeping and I still cry sometimes.  A month after the breakup and my heart is still broken.  It feels like I will never be close to anyone ever again.  I have no idea what to do.  I want him back so badly.  Why would he unblock me if he never planned on responding to my texts?

Now I went to college and the asshole part of me is carrying on. I tried to make new friends and am I really big dumbass, met this friend group who I hung out with occasionally. I met a guy in it who was also a dumbass too. I thought we would hit it off. I got drunk and was even more of an asshole. The next Saturday night one of the guys was kind of a dick to me and I think it was just because I was an asshole when I was drunk.

The other guy who I thought I’d get along with unfollowed me on Instagram, and “forgot” to invite me to his plans. It is eating me up inside; I feel suicidal. I want to leave the group chat; I’m sure everyone hates me im such a fucking asshole. I will never have real friends. I will learn to accept that about myself.

Should I confront the guy who I thought we were hitting it off at the very beginning but now I’m certain doesn’t like me?

434,"I (20M) have wanted to make games since I was 5. I never doubted my career path, and always knew what I wanted. That drive and goal helped me live through an extremely abusive childhood, becoming temporarily homeless at 18, and a variety of mental struggles, which are still ongoing.

Over the course of 9 years, I taught myself how to program and make games, and have become very skilled in my field. I went to college for two semesters, but dropped out due to my inability to afford further schooling. Going back is not an option, now or ever. My grandmother took me in after being homeless for a few months and I've lived with her since.

I've lived with her for two years now. I have a good and detailed resume, a portfolio, demo reels, code samples, the works. These past years have been nothing but applications, interviews, recruiters reaching out to me, and they all end up falling through at the end somehow. The best job I've been able to get was Target, and they fired me when Covid hit. I've done commission work, but never consistently enough for it to count.

The last interview I had really broke me. It's made me reconsider everything. Even if I get the job I'm looking for, I'll likely need to move to the complete opposite side of the US, where even then, who knows how long they'll keep me? I have someone here that I have a good relationship with right now, and I'm the only person she really has. I don't want to lose her or for her to lose me.

I am afraid of my bathroom because I always imagine that the girl from the ring (or whatever the movie is called I haven't actually seen it) is peering over the shower curtains watching me. I am afraid of my closet because it's so dark. I am afraid of the darkness that's outside of my window at night. To a degree, I'm even afraid of silence, especially at night. I write this post because this has been exemplified recently.

443,"I know this sounds like bullshit but it’s not. I can move things with my mind. I have video footage but I’m not choosing not to share it for safety reasons. Right now I have nothing to gain by proving my abilities to strangers on the internet, and I think any evidence would only put me at risk. I’ve talked to some people online who’ve informed me that a surprising percent of the population has telekinesis, but opinion seems to be divided on whether I should keep this as a secret or share it with the world, and whether the ability is a spiritual gift, a magical ability, or a superpower. 

My short term plans are to keep this a secret to everyone I know in real life, and practice my skills until I have stronger and more accurate control over the objects I am able to manipulate. If anyone has any ideas for experiments I could try then I would love to hear them. I am currently learning to levitate objects, press switches and buttons, turn handles and keys, and move objects from one location to another. 

However I don’t know what I’m going to do in the long term. I recently found out that there is a lot of prize money to be won in being able to prove that paranormal abilities exist, but I’m wary of going down this route as I’m afraid that governments or authorities will try to get involved and monitor me. I believe this is the reason why nobody else has come forward to claim these prizes, despite telekinesis apparently being widespread. 

So if it’s dangerous for the whole world to know that I have this ability, what’s the best way to live my life while taking advantage of the fact that I have a tremendous gift? I’m tempted to use it for purely selfish reasons but I’m also worried about it bringing bad luck into my life. Currently I can’t use it for anything useful as it’s too exhausting and drains me completely, but I am noticing that it is slowly but steadily getting easier with practice. I want to show someone in real life but I’m afraid that they’ll freak out and either report me to the authorities, shun me, or try to convince me to do dangerous things. 

I don’t expect everyone who reads this to believe me, as I am also a rational person who believes seeing is believing, but in this case it doesn’t even matter. I won’t waste my time trying to convince people who demand proof, as it won’t help me in any way.

447,"My dad got Corona around maybe 2-3 weeks ago and he still got symptoms (coughing, tiredness and feeling pressure on his chest). He said it’s not that bad and wants to go back to work next week. He has been quarantining since we knew he was positive, which was this week. As far as we know he’s still positive. 

So apparently he has called a health care counseling line and they said he could go back to work because he can no longer infect other people. I’m kinda calling bs on it but I’m not sure. It’s the first time I hear something like this and my friends agree that it doesn’t make sense. I don’t want to call the same line because I will probably get the same response. I don’t know if what they said is true or not and if it’s not true, how do I convince my dad to stay at home and not go to work or at least take the COVID test?",20Dec2020,1

449,"So a little backstory, me and my friend went to university together, same major and all, but we actually became close while interning at the same company. We graduated together 6 months ago and we’ve been unemployed ever since, until we both got an offer from the same company a couple days ago, in the same department. We will start 4th of January. I live in this city with my parents, she will move in from another city. If I stay with my parents I will have to drive to work which will cost me a lot of gas money. OR I can just move in with her and practically pay the rent with the gas money, spend less time on the road and be more free from my parents (Living with your parents is very normal in my culture btw). I’m just worried that if I spend so much time with her at home and at work we might get sick of each other soon. But I’m also dreading the long drive everyday and I want more freedom. I can’t get my own apartment because that would cost too much. My friend is also confused as to what we should do, because splitting the rent will be a relief to her. Any advice?",20Dec2020,1

454,"I have been friends with this kid since about 7th grade and sometimes he can be kind of a dick about certain things (weirdly calls me out about shit infront of other people, is vaguely unsupportive or just straight up rude) now we're older and a lot has changed since we were younger but some things always rubbed me the wrong way. 

I've always been the ""funny guy"" which really boiled down to me just trying to make others feel more comfortable in situations where i would be uncomfortable. (talking to people in groups, being ""outgoing"") and he was is definitely more quiet although i dont consider myself to be extroverted. because of that i think a lot of people think i like to joke a lot or things roll off my back? well there's been times where like i said before he would joking just call me out or be a dick for no reason in particular. i always chalked it up to guys being guy like? idk ive been around dudes and they can be dicks to each other for fun but im not like that? i dont find being rude to coincide with being friends? well its always kinda been like that. one of my earliest memories was when we were younger another friend who he had since elementary school actually told me to be careful because he tended to talk shit about his friends. at the time i took it with a grain of salt but did notice it to be true when we got closer with another friend the next year and we became a little group for much of highschool, i remember us going to each other after and it would be like oh he said this about you? and it was never overtly negative but always along the lines of him not believing in certain things we had going on or goals we had. 


well fast forward a lot im 21 now we've finished HS forever ago but a lot of the stuff still happens, the call outs, the being a dick, but it's never enough for me to justify calling it out but it's definitely accumulated overtime in my head obviously. we have a good friend who i essentially introduced them and he's visiting from the Navy and since he's been gone for what's now been 9 mos and i always noticed me and the friend always became closest when he didnt have much going on. in HS we would hang most when he was single or didnt have his other friends to hang with and i remember they essentially left me and i found a new friend group in HS but he would always just say ""we just stopped hanging it was nbd"" natural flow of relationships kinda thing but what it really was, was he didnt like me being around his ex because her and i had a thing before they dated and then she pursued him and he told me way after that made him jealous even though he knew i wasnt that kinda person. well now that Navy friend is back it's nice because he doesnt shit on or shut down shit i say, he's genuinely one of my closest friends and getting closer ahain with the other guy and not really having many other friends (i worked from home for a while+covid) it went over my head how all that creeped in again and that it did/does bother me. 

I guess my question is should i confront the behavior and be like hey i want to talk youve kinda been a shitty friend or just sorts weave it our. in the grand scheme of things i know i will be okay ultimately and find friends regardless but i want to know if people have experience with this and salvaging relationships like that? thank you (:",20Dec2020,1

I 15m have a friend also 15m who’s dad died unexpectedly at the start of this week which I know especially around this time must be awful. 

He came around to mine a couple days after he got the news and things where understandably off with him. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it and he just started crying, like heavy sobbing and I didn’t have a clue what to say. Like what do I say to that? So it was him crying for a while then he awkwardly leaves and I felt bad because I basically sat in silence and just kind of listened to him. 

We live in walking distance of each other so I’ve been thinking of seeing him again but if it ends up similar to last time idk what to do. I thought about maybe just giving him space but that seem didn’t seem right, as well as the fact my mums really cautious of c19 stuff and basically only let him come round last time because of circumstances and after Christmas there’s new rules coming into place where we live so I doubt id be allowed to see him after that.  

I talked to a friend about it who suggested If I don’t feel like talking to him I should make like a gift bag of even just snacks or something he likes to let him know I’m thinking of him.

466,"First post in here and I'm still a little unsure if I should post this at all.

Anyway. This is about my friend ""Larissa"" (the name has been changed for privacy reasons), 20f. A few days ago she confided in me that she feels unable to ever move out of her less then optimal living situation, and thus she is unable to progress in her life.

Her mom apparently had 6 children in total from different men to not feel lonely since she had a bad upbringing and deals with depression. All her other children except Larissa and her younger sister have moved out and are barely in contact with their mom. Her mom has been doing worse for years, knowing that her final two children will move out soon, dealing with the problem by becoming slightly alcoholic and emotionally manipulative. Larissa received a call more than once when she was planning to go out with friends by her drunk mother, asking Larissa to care for her.

The mother has a twin sister that is unable to work due to her mental problems. Every time Larissa leaves her mom for a prolonged amount of time, her mom decides to hang out with her sister, making her mental state much worse.

If that wasn't bad enough, Larissa's older siblings have children themselves and they use her frequently as an unpaid babysitter whenever they feel like not taking care of their children - sometimes at short notice.

Larissa fears that if she were to move out her mother would kill herself or sometihing like that. She has confided into her older siblings that she can't take the pressure anymore and that she can't deal with this alone and needs their help. But they told her that they were too busy with their own lives. Her younger sister just doesn't care.

Adding to that, the family members fight a lot and they alsways need Larissa to play the mediator and to make everything right again.

As an outsider you can tell that all of this is very messed up. I've tried talking to Larissa and to get her to move out, since I've been in a similar situation and moving out worked for me. She feels like everyone depends on her and she will let everyone down, leading to the family falling apart if she does so. Not to mention that she cared for her mother her whole life and loves her deeply.

I feel so helpless. I want to help, but I just don't know how. No one except her will take responsibilty. How do I help my friend?

I’m autistic and I have a lot of issues, so discerning what is a scam and what is not...is a struggle for me in the highest degree...

I found a place that seems oddly too good to be true? But maybe this is my miracle, my reason to keep living.

Name is ___. I own the house, My mother was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 Cancer Lymphoma, and now i have been transferred 

to (State within USA) Due to the situation. We spent less time in the States so we could not get a hold on any Realtor to handle this rent issue, 

although it was when We knew how long we were going to stay in (State within USA) that was why we decided to rent out the house.  You can drive 

by the house anytime to take a look at the area and surroundings. Don't be surprised when you get to the home and see a for sale sign in the 

home, i had the intention of selling the home once but i thought about it again and  decided to rent out the home.. The Realtor are trying to take 

advantage of me, asking for too much and trying to rip me off and it is a very beautiful home and I will  always love to call it my home. So i will want you not to bother yourself about any sign you see in the home saying it is for sale.. The utilities are included in the  rent such as 

Dishwasher, Dryer, Electric Stove, Fridge, Washer/dryer, Air Condition, Sewage, Trash, because of this reason and more we need a 

responsible person that can take very good care of it as we are not after the money, but want it to be clean and for you to take it as if it were

So I signed up for the army about a month ago, already went to meps the day before thanksgiving, and my ship date is Jan 3 2021. On the 8 of December I started feeling sick and I went to an urgent care and got tested for covid that day. I tested positive and called my recruiter and told him, he felt bad and actually checked up on me everyday(even DoorDashed me soup last week). It’s been 12 days since I tested positive, on the 8th day I tested again and it came back positive(the doctor said that I’m not contagious but it will still show in my system). I went because I was feeling better. The doctor I saw that day told me I should try to push my ship date back to February. The reason was because whenever I get any kind of respiratory illness, I get sick induced asthma. And now that I’m feeling better, and over covid I think I still am getting out of breathe easily which I use to not. I know basic training is pretty intense and I feel like pushing my ship date will help me recover my lost stamina and not be sent to sick call because I can’t keep up. Well I called my recruiter yesterday and he tells me that the renegotiation will require me to go to meps and speak with a counselor and it ends up being the battalion commander who makes the final say. He told me that it’s a 50/50 wether I get it or not. He also said I have another option, that if I go and am not able to keep up because of my stamina that I can be sent to sick call until I recover. My only problem is I don’t wanna end up being at sick call for a month recovering, when I can do it at home. And I won’t get to graduate with the people I go in with :/

479,"Some background on me: (You can skip this if you just want to give me some general advice on my anxieties and worries)

I'm a 22 year old virgin that underwent surgery on my penis because of an uncomfortably curve (60 degrees to the left) in combination with a tight foreskin (phimosis). Normally a circumcision is not always done when operating on the curvature but in my case it was necessary because of the tightness. This was a year ago and things have healed well, penis is straighter and erections don't hurt anymore.

2 months after the operation I met a girl and had my first sexual experiences with her, however I wasn't able to penetrate her because I struggled getting good erections for different reasons (I'll get more into that later). I mainly performed oral on her which she really liked, but I didn't get any action since I told her I wasn't comfortable with that yet. We parted ways after 4 months.

We're now almost half a year further and my penis has healed quite a bit since then. I had some numbness in the right part my glans that went away (still have some very small numb areas along the circumcision scar that might be permanent). Erections don't hurt and my glans isn't uncomfortable rubbing my pants anymore.

My worries and anxieties:

**- I'm afraid sex won't feel pleasurable for me because of my circumcision.** I've been looking up WAY too much information on circumcision, reading all kind of forums, studies, etc... There is so much contradicting stuff on here it makes me unsure what to believe. I know over a billion men are circumcised and have sex just fine but maybe adult circumcision is different/causes more problems?

**- I'm afraid sex won't feel pleasurable for me because of my masturbation technique.** I always masturbate dry, like I did before the surgery, not stimulating my glans with my hand. It works for me and orgasms feel just as good. Problem is that when I try 'simulating' sex by stroking the glans with lube, it doesn't feel as good and reaching orgasm takes WAY longer. I have to go hard and fast at it, something I won't be able to do when having sex. This makes me worried I'll experience no pleasure during sex and possibly also suffer from DE.

**- I'm afraid sex won't feel pleasurable for me because of porn habits.** When trying to have sex with my first and only GF I struggled with getting good erections. A big factor in this was anxiety and stress. But even at times I was seemingly relaxed, my erections weren't that good. Things is that when masturbating alone I have no issues. I used to masturbate once every day and often used porn. I've read things about NOFAP and 'YourBrainOnPorn' and don't know what to think of it.

Bottom line is: I'm afraid I won't have a good sex life.

I'm not in a good place right now mentally, always worrying and overthinking without having the opportunity to try the real thing for myself. Right now my life revolves around thinking about sex, how it is supposed to be amazing for most people, but possible not for me... And that frightens me. Can I get some advice on how to overcome these worries and enjoy life again?

484,"We got in an altercation yesterday evening, it started in the car and continued once we got home.

I went to separate myself from him once our year old son and myself got inside our apartment. I went to his nursery and since it didn’t have a lock on the door I grabbed a chair to wedge it beneath the handle in hopes he’d not come in but he ended up forcing it open therefore broke the door of the hinges. Later my grandma asked me, 

“Well you had to know he’d do that, right?”

After he got into the bedroom he immediately started to belittle me and yell at me, I asked him to please go away. He started yelling and told me no while saying,

 “What are you gonna do about it? Make me. Make me get out! You can’t do shit.”

To try and get past him while he stood in the doorway I tried to shove past him but he shoved me back then he punched out the lamp in our sons room and glass went everywhere around our son. I started sobbing while he stomped off— I heard banging noises and saw he had punched a huge hole in the wall by our front door.

What eventually led me to calling the cops was when I was trying to leave for the night and he scooped up our son and told me I wasn’t taking him anywhere. The whole time I was trying to be calm and kept telling him,

 “I’m not taking him away from you but we need to go somewhere else tonight.”

Eventually I followed him out to the car where he tried to speed off with our son in his lap but I took the keys from him so he just started screaming while thrashing our son around in his lap. I warned him multiple times that I was going to call 911 and he just kept saying,

 “Do it, you think I’m scared?”


I felt like he didn’t leave me much choice, the police came, saw his bloody knuckles from punching the wall, took my statement and also got his before taking him out in handcuffs. I’m at my friends house, I can’t sleep, I don’t know what to do. My grandparents who usually support me most in all the world gas lighted me and hinted at that I must of done something to set him off like that. 


How long will he be in jail for? He takes sleeping medication to sleep as well as mood control pills and he won’t have those. I feel terrible but once he’s out and we get a moment to talk I feel that we should go our separate ways but share custody of our son— as the relationship is toxic and just isn’t healthy. My grandparents want me to really think about this and consider not leaving him.",20Dec2020,1

490,"Hi, I'm a 21yo F, my partner is a 22yo M. This year is the first time he's joining my family for Christmas. We're doing a 'Secret Santa' thing so everyone buys a present (max. €15/$18,50) for someone else anonymously after picking a name.

He picked my sister's name for the 'Secret Santa' thing and I told him she's very easy to buy gifts for, 'cause she's a girly-girl, so scented candles, fluffy socks, tea, bath bombs... you know, the basic girl stuff. I was very excited to know what he got her and so he told me... He got her a reusable water bottle.

I don't wanna be ungrateful or something, but... a water bottle? For max. €15? It does not even have a cute design... And she already has a water bottle! Also, we didn't use wishlists, because we wanted everyone to be creative.

Normally he's a great gift giver, I've received pretty cute 'girly' gifts earlier from him? I'm afraid my sister won't like her gift and I also fear that he's gonna make a bad impression on my family by disappointing my sister.

I don't really like to keep loose threads open if I don't really intend on pursuing those threads any longer. To me that's kind of ghosty and I don't like being ghosty. Whenever I try to leave a message saying that I'm not pursuing the friendship any longer, I would say I get 50/50 a very mature response where they understand and wish me good luck, but the other 50 is them being terribly upset or offended even though I tried my hardest to be nice in the message.  

I mean it's not like I was ending some super strong bond we had. I only stop talking to people if we don't have that good friendship feel, so I guess I don't see what the big deal is and why they're getting so mad.

492,"I'm around 2 months into my first year of medicine and I've been thinking whether or not I wanna actually stick through medicine

I love learning about mental health and how to treat people with mental issues and recognize signs of certain mental disorders, there's something about improving someone's mental health that is much more fulfilling to me than just treating a physical injury.

So I've been rethinking what I want to pursue; going through medicine and then specializing in psychiatry, or dropping out to study psychology; I told this to my parents and they recommended Medicine, but I didn't give their recommendation much weight because they're really old-fashioned, and in their time and place, psychology wasn't a very distinguished field.

I also have pretty strong hemophobia, my parents and my eldest brother(who is in his 5th year of medicine in the same university I will be going to) consoled me on this by telling me that medicine nowadays doesn't involve seeing blood as much anymore.

Another problem is the curriculum, I am studying subjects such as BioPhysics, Anatomy, and Latin, which have nothing to do with psychology in any way; it feels like a repeat of high school where I have to rely on pressure from tests to motivate myself to study these subjects I have very little interest in, and that I feel I will never use.

So what do I do? Do I drop out of medicine and go into psychology? or stick through medicine to become a psychiatrist, despite my lack of interest in many of the subjects of the former?",20Dec2020,1

So I was supposed to go in March but due to Covid, I couldn't but now that Queensland has opened it's boarders to NZ I can finally make the move! Anyway, I had been saving before covid hit but because of it, my savings took a massive hit and I'm quite low on the funds now, and saving is hard to do when you're on casual hours and 90% of my pay already goes to rent/bills, so I was just wondering to any kiwis who moved over there, how much do you recommend I have saved up, in order to get by? 

Also, I heard that I can't work till I get a TFN (Tax file number) how long did it take for you to get yours? I was kinda hoping I could apply for jobs just before I left so that I had one in place when I arrived but I don't think that's going to be possible now + I'd need an address which I can't do until I had a job to pay for the house, so it's very stressful!

503,"I'll keep it short.

I've always wanted to make something out of myself, I guess like most people do. Instead of just trying to be happy I just had to be something big and successful. At the very least have a big career and make a lot of cash and be generally well-rounded in every aspect of life.

I'm making this post so you probably guessed it went sideways.

I started studying marketing and business, there's always people hiring over there and possible promotions. I discovered midway through that a) I hated it. And b) I'm depressed. I went in and out of psych ward several times and have been in therapy for half my life roughly. When it got a bit better, I decided to do something useful for the community and become a physical therapist. It isn't medschool, thanks for that, but I still fell through and was back at square one. 

With no education and no work and no appartment at my name, I went back to my parents and started the exam to become a cop. I got the written exam and the physical one, only left is the presentation and then I'll know if I'm in. They provide housing, ergo, independance so it's a big reason why I decided to try it out. 

I did try to date, but in and out of psych ward and just trying to find a place to fit made it harder and I never had any success there either. I never had someone and I got told several times by women I asked that at over 30 they were past being someone's training wheel and expected their partners to have some experience. I'm still living with my parents at the moment and will be for a while so that makes dating a no-go anyway. 

I wanted to be a writer, have been writing for quite a while. I still am, but I have no particular hope of a manuscript being accepted. 

Now I'm over 30, live with my parents, never held hands and am back where I started 15 years ago. It's not going to be a super successful life, but I hope there is some place for hapiness. 

There, no need to start a woe is me movement, it's negative enough as it is and it doesn't need any more. I'd like to learn how to be happy and content with what little things I have instead of burning myself needlessly. I'd like to know how to make peace with being alone and the prospect of it not changing for a while still.

506,"Alright, here’s the deal. Ive been in a relationship for almost two years. Everything has been great and she’s my ride or die, but I’m having some serious issues that are out of my control (I think?) 

For the first year and a half of our relationship, I was part of a community/hobby that I’ve been a part of for years. It is a safe place for me and makes me really happy.

However, one day out of the blue she told me it made her uncomfortable that I was doing said hobby because when we were just friends (before we dated) I said something about it that “made her uncomfortable” she now does not let me be a part of this community because she says I traumatized her. However, this community is one of my main sources of happiness and acceptance. I want to be in the community again more than anything, and I think about it every day. She says “maybe one day I’ll be okay with it but I don’t know yet.” And I feel like she’s giving me false hope so I don’t break up with her over it. She also belittles my feelings about it and says things like “well I thought you’d choose me over anything and you have other hobbies so it’s really not a big deal. It’s not like you’ll want to be a part of the community for the rest of your life anyway.” (Yes, that actually was the plan because it makes me happy.)


Another issue I’ve been having is that she doesn’t let me have friends on the internet. She also says this is because her abusive ex had internet friends and he often ignored her to play video games with them.
I want to meet new people and have friends so badly, because I feel like she might be subconsciously isolating me so I get all of her attention. No hobby, no community that I’m a part of, no internet friends allowed. 


When I tell the story objectively it sounds a lot worse than I realized at first honestly lol. But I don’t know what to do. Ideally I want to have the relationship, be a part of the community, AND have internet friends to talk to. But I think I might have to pick if this can’t work. What should I do?",20Dec2020,1
507,"Backstory:

I come from a small village in Romania. Superstitions, religious and otherwise, are very popular here.  
Running in to a black cat is widely considered extremely unlucky, and a huge deal.

On new Year's eve, I was at my cousin's house with all of my immediate, and extended family. We were drinking tuica (romanian alcohol similar to cognac), eating, and generally having a good time.

Around 10 minutes before midnight, I felt my stomach rumble. I got a cold sweat on my forehead, and could feel this was no good. I tried to get over it, uneasily moving side to side and trying to forget about my stomach ache.

A couple of minutes before midnight I just couldn't take it anymore. I quietly ran to the bathroom in order to unleash the foul beast that was causing me such pain and torment. It was important that I get it over with as soon as possible, in order to be back for the new-year countdown.

It was not going well (explosive and painful), and I knew this was not going to be a brief ordeal.  I started hearing the countdown ""10,9,8.."" and I started panicking. ""HAPPY NEW YEAR"" everyone shouted. It was at that point that my family started looking around for me. I couldn't leave the bathroom because of my bowel movements; it just wasn't possible to pause and leave.

Next thing I know, there's a knock on the door. ""{My name } are you in there?"". 2 seconds and the door immediately opens. It's my uncle, and he has a look of disgust on his face, the kind of which I had never seen before. He started cursing at me: ""What the fuck are you doing? The new year comes in and it finds you shi\*\*ing on the toilet !? Do you have no respect for your family you mutt?"". I had no reply. I felt vulnerable and sick.

He then ran downstairs shouting and screaming obscenities. My heart was racing and I knew I was f\*\*\*ed. A good 10 minutes later I finished up, and walked down. All my family was looking at me like I was a killer or something. No one said a word, ignored me, and continued on with the festivities. Things were awkward for a few days, but eventually most moved past it.

Fast-forward to the past few months: Everyone thinks that the lockdowns and the corona-virus is my fault because I was on the toilet when the new year came in. My family pretty much hates me, my neighbors don't talk to me, and my friends have stopped all contact with me.

I don't know what to do. I'm lonely and have nowhere to talk to.",20Dec2020,1
508,"So I honestly feel I’ve got the short end of the stick, I feel like nothing will ever work out for me in a romantic point of view. I feel I can’t even get a nice lady to see me on a casual basis, let alone a life long partner or even a one night stand. End goal is a partner for life, one who will love me and have my back till the end. But I see nothing wrong with meeting some nice woman for a bit of fun or having some friends that come with obvious benefits along the way till my new partner is on the scene. But no matter what I do or try it always seems to fall short, and I can’t figure out why. This will take a little explaining so grab some snacks if you need before continuing.

Will start with some background as I feel it will help you understand my situation much better towards the end. I have aspergers, so growing up my maturity level was always several years behind my physical age. Once in my young 20’s however this problem corrected itself as I dedicated time to learning how to be social. These days I’m 34 and recently divorced (more on this later), been flying free since May this year. I’ve put myself in social situations, joined groups for different activities, hit the bars on weekends, gotten into online dating and even had a few brave goes at flirting with some woman I liked while shopping or running everyday errands. This has got me a few first dates and some nice comments but that's about it (again little more later). I know socially I’m quite fine, few nights at the bar got me invited to some after parties, still in a lot of my group activities (EG D&amp;D and Zumba classes) and have been told by quite a few sources that I socially fit in and in no way come of as desperate, they got no reason to lie to me either. 

A little on the past now to help you see where I’m coming from. My first GF was when I was 18. Let’s say she only went out with me to break my values and ended up cheating on me for half of our 8 month relationship with my best friend. This shut me down for about 4 years as I retreated into video games and church life. Before that my school life wasn’t much better, always moving around and never settling in one place made it hard to keep friends, if I made any at all. Was always the social outcast at school, being a little chubby didn’t help. Dropped out of school before finishing grade 10 as I just couldn’t handle it anymore (met first GF at tafe). 

I finally left home around 25 and moved to the city, this is where I finally lost my virginity…… to a dam escort…. Spent the next 6 months unable to get myself any ladies and only settling for escorts. Burned through about 6 or 7K to achieve this, not a part of my life I’m proud of. I finally met my exwife not too long after this and we pretty much skipped the dating phase, engaged within 3 months, both 28 at the time. Looking back I was desperate and she was too in a way, and I know she had some kind of love for me, not too sure now what that was, but something was there. We stayed engaged for 18 months before getting married in 2015. After we got married things started decaying at a very slow speed. She was lazy, didn’t give much affection, double standards, emotionally manipulated me and the list goes on, could do a whole post on just this marriage to be honest. The sex was one of the worst (not the most, but up there). On average once every 6 weeks to 2 months and most of the time she would open her legs, jump on her phone and give me 10 minutes to do what I needed. She never really put any effort into trying to please or pleasure me. Kisses most times had to be bargained for with chores, coffee, a massage and so on… So by this point life wasn’t looking too good, but I stayed determined I could help her while fixing us, and because deep down I thought it would never get any better. I know I’m better off right now but still wonder sometimes. The catalyst for the plunge into darkness was when we lost our one and only baby. We were about 8 weeks in when we lost it, both of us being overweight didn’t really help our chances. 

This was about 2 years before I called it quits. She went into depression and started getting worse. I tried to help her however I could, we went to counselling, I tried to help her join groups to get out more, us to both lose weight and much more. She would either try for a month or so, or outright not even try at all on all these things. Always sliding back into depression. It went from depression to attention seeking but. Always posting on Facebook about how sad things are, or using depression as an excuse on me for getting out of chores, work some days, intimacy with me and the list goes on. Anytime we did things she wanted however, I cook and do the chores, holidays, go to nights out with her friends or family or anytime she got away with staying in bed all day while I did everything she suddenly wasn’t depressed. 9 months before I did leave was my first threat to leave. She picked herself up for about a month and went right back. So May this year I left. Her hanging out with some old friends, including an ex boyfriend was the straw that broke the camel's back. Saying she felt more loved there then with me, I can’t prove it but know she cheated on me as well. 

Moved to a small country town and am currently bunking with my folks for some cheap rent and emotional support, will move out again mid next year when my work on a side project is done. I’ve already lost 30kg, got heaps of work done on my side project, got a job and saved more money in 7 months then me and the ex did in 4 ½ years of marriage. 

As I stated above I’m pretty good socially, still need to lose more weight but I’ve come a long way and now only need 3XL shirts (down from 6 and 7XL, about 120kg right now, but will admit I don’t look half bad. So my weight will play some factor, maybe. But I’ve tried with girls around my size, bigger and smaller, different ages and much more. While I’ve made some nice friends out of this it seems like if I want to break my drought I will need to start seeing escorts again, which I don’t really want to do.

Now I do have one lone exception to this. About 3 months back I met a girl at one of these after parties I went to after meeting some (now) friends at a bar after I flew solo for the night (new to town). We made a date 2 weeks later and I had what I can only describe as the best night of my life as we went for 4 hours doing things I didn’t know were possible. She chased me and led most of the night, I felt so wanted and like a man for once. That was the only oasis in a desert that has been 19 months now, my ex withheld any sex for the last year of our marriage. Now this girl might be on the cards again later, not sure right now (seems this not sure things is a norm for most the girls I’ve got any future chance with, so over the endless limbo). And I’m talking to a few other ladies and seeing what happens. But for the life of me I can’t seem to get past 1 or 2 dates with any nice woman, or so much as secure a friends with benefits arrangement or something more casual with others. 

Now I’d like to point out I’m no creep. I want anything, be it a relationship or something not as serious to be with consent from both sides, and I at least like to meet a woman for coffee before doing anything with her, or maybe meet at the bar before :D. Some of you might say I’m trying too hard, but I’m letting a life long partner come naturally and I have no intention of rushing into any relationship before giving it time and using the knowledge I gained from all my past failures to make sure I do it right this time. But in the meantime it shouldn’t be impossible to have something more casual on the side should it? 

Please feel free to ask whatever questions you like. I’m really looking for some advice on this matter as I either can’t pin what is wrong with me, am I just so damn unlucky or whatever else might be going on.",20Dec2020,1

510,"Iv had the same job advisor let’s call her L for 6 months to help me find a job and I went in to one morning appointment after I passed a job interview for a bar job. I’m male aged 21 look younger and I’m always  very quiet and shy/nervous and she knows this I’m sure.,(appointments are only like 10-15 minutes a week)

 L is mixed she can be nice but can be moody and snobby. 

Anyways this appointment L  was using the mouse of her computer looking at the screen checking something and I was to her left facing her. During this pause I turned to my left to look around the office as normal and then more to the left another job advisor had a short dress on and I didn’t stare but I looked when I noticed her for 2-3 seconds max and turned back forward with my head down quietly. (She was walking away with her back turned so she didn’t see me) 

Then out of nothing L giggled under her breath and said smiling ‘you looking at her there?’ In a smiley/giggly way Whilst looking at her computer screen the whole time still Quietly but I juts heard her enough to made out what she said. I didn’t say anything and kept my head down. I’m always very quite anyway with her.

Is this bad I looked at her?

Also how did L notice when she was looking at the computer screen and not me the whole time? That’s some observation",20Dec2020,1
511,"I (F23) don't have much money, but I like to make my close ones happy and I like giving them gifts. I found my brother a very fitting necklace that's music related, which is something he's VERY interested in. I'm not sure on what to give my fiancé (M22) as the things he has on his wishlist are a bit too expensive for me. If I had an income, I could save up, but right now I don't have an income so I have to limit myself more.

My fiancé's interests are gaming (currently a PC building simulator game and Cyberpunk 2077), watching and following v-tubers from HoloLive and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I was thinking of buying him some HoloLive merch but it's very expensive, even on Amazon (we live in Sweden). I thought about getting him a new set of dice, but he has a few and I got him a set already last year. There's this new book ""Tasha's Cauldron of Everything"" that he's been eyeing since it was announced, but it's expensive and I'm pretty sure his parents are buying it for him.

Then I remembered that I'm an artist, I draw, paint, I do graphics design, I sing and play acoustic guitar and ukulele, I write song lyrics as well as stories... Maybe I should MAKE him something, rather than buy. But what would I make him? I can't record or mix, never done that before and I don't have the equipment to do so. I'm interested in making a short comic for him, but I don't know what it could be about.

(Just FYI, I draw both digitally, and traditionally with promarkers) 

What do you guys think? If i should try making a comic for him, what topics do you think I could have the story be about? Any ideas for any type of characters that would be nice to include? Or should I try doing something else?

If I need to elaborate on or clarify anything, please let me know. Thanks in advance!",20Dec2020,1

My partner's older brother made the campaign for them and to introduce new people to D&amp;D, and my partner loves it and is really excited for me to join. It's been so long since I've met new people (since everything is online and it's the US), and this time they're trying it online so it's a first for everyone.

  I kind of just want to listen for a while to see how they do things but I'm supposed to be introduced pretty early on in game. I'm really worried that maybe I did something with my character wrong and I'm reassured we're a bunch of awkward nerds, I'm still really confused and unsure how to roleplay.? I have a speech impediment and that combined with how my voice can crack so much makes me sort of embarrassed and unsure to go about it. I can control my voice more when I know what to expect but with new people and d&amp;d being surprises I kinda doubt it'll be very good.

514,"I've been surveilling my ex-girlfriends social media accounts for a while (longer than 6 months). She left her FB logged in on one of my computers and after we broke up that cookie stored in the browser resulted in full access to every social platform. 

I'll be the first to admit there is no out-right justification for this kind of behavior. But I'll foolishly paint her to be the bad guy here to make myself feel better. let's say that she left me incredibly hurt by and with intent and willfully, said and did things to hurt me. To this day and to no knowledge of mine she does not even begin to take a shred of personal responsibility or ownership of moral/ethical wrong doing from her. In short, she's a selfish bitch. 

I haven't tampered with any of her data, I haven't used the privileged access to information to materially gain or profit at her expense, I have quite literally just gave myself read-access to the information. I don't write anything. 

The access to the accounts I think has served its purpose. My suspicions have been confirmed that she is in fact a bitch. She's tried sleeping with my friends, my friends\* have tried to sleep with her. I was suspicious that her pattern of abuse was exclusive to me, it's not (thank you for that closure). Anyone that shows her a hint of emotional availability becomes a target dummy of abuse. There are many more things that help me sleep better at night knowing that I'm not subjected to this cunts venom filled personality.  

Now it's time to make my escape. My presence is littered all over the security and privacy settings. How do I detach? The obvious choice is to just stop, maintain innocence if confronted, and plead the 5th and request a lawyer if it gets that far.

I was hoping to see what other creative solutions the world of reddit can give me to fix my fuck up. 

All in all, 

I regret it. Curiosity is my biggest strength and weakness. If I could I would never have done this. The way that she left me, it would have taken the will of a Tibetan monk to recover normally. It feels like doing this was the only way for me to get over her. 

I know it's creepy. I know it's wrong. But with a world filled so deeply with pain and wrong-doing, did I really have any other options?",20Dec2020,1

520,"So my now ex housemate lost his job and couldn’t get a new one as covid came around. To give you background on this character, I’ve known the guy for years and he’s a loser, bouncing from one job to the next (he’s 44, for an idea). So anyway, I was fresh from a breakup and needed a housemate. Knew I was taking a huge risk with him but was in a bad headspace.


During covid, I helped him out in so many ways and even lowered the rent. But as time went on, he became more and more unreliable. Buying new shoes, contact lenses, cocaine, etc and not having enough money to pay full rent.


So enough was enough, gave him a week’s notice and this obviously hit a nerve. He left after 2 weeks and didn’t even have the decency to clean his room or say thank you.


Now I’m chasing him for money or at least an answer as to when and how much he can pay but he ignored my calls and messages. Found out where his latest job was and confronted him about why he was ignoring me. He would barely look me in the eye, kept shrugging his shoulders and didn’t have much to say in his defence. “Didn’t get that job I was hoping for and I’ve been busy, working here part time.” He just kept contradicting himself and ended up telling me to fuck off. To be fair, I did have it out with him at his job but that’s his own fault for letting it come to that.


Now, I don’t have a paper trail, proof, nothing about this whole situation and he also left behind his father’s suitcase and his bank statements and tax letter has arrived at mine. However, I do have his father’s phone number.


I’m not quite sure what to do about this. I mean, yeah, I was a fool for letting him stay with me, given his nature but I’m out of pocket and almost broke as I just had to pay for a surgery which sadly, is the same amount as what he owes, about £3,000.


Do I follow up with his dad or just drop it and move on? He’s such a deadbeat, I don’t think he’ll ever have the money nor would he bother since he probably feels ashamed or pissed at me. I know it seems like I’ve already answered my own question but just looking for other ideas and input on this as financially, I’m not in a good place right now.",20Dec2020,1
522,"Hi all. Sorry if this seems like a lot of information. And I’m sorry if the formatting is bad. I’m based in the UK. 

My mum (60 years old) has been in an emotionally/financially/coercive abusive relationship for 15 years with a man we will call Rodney. It hasnt ever been physical as far as I know. For context she has 5 adult children and is no stranger to abusive relationships. 

Good news is: she finally wants to leave him. Bad news is: she hasn’t really got a penny to her name. 

When they met they both sold their houses to pool together to buy a big house. He forced her not to work, he forced her not to drive (or see friends, family...you get the idea). So she hasn’t had a job for 15 years. She’s nearly 60 and not very employable due to lack of qualifications/skills etc. 

He is an accountant. He made her a partner/employee (not sure which one as she isn’t sure herself) years ago in his accountancy firm (but she never worked there) and acted like she received a wage (she didn’t). I guess she should have questioned this but she is quite a naive person who trusted him. Anyway 4 years ago she receives a letter to their home demanding she pay her unpaid tax bill (80 grand). He hadn’t ever filled out a tax form for her and the debt kept building. He was aware of this and hid it from her. She had to declare bankruptcy and her name had to be taken off the deeds of the house to stop them forcing the sale of the house. 

Now, he said he has paid  back the debt and that her name is back on the deeds of the house. He gave her a letter to confirm this but due to covid lockdown I haven’t been able to visit her to check if it looks legit (I live across the country from her). 

Anyway - she wants to leave, he’s refusing to sell the house. The house has gone up in equity for sure. She can’t afford to hire any legal aid. She is reluctant to call citizens advice or women’s aid as she is ashamed about the abuse. 

What can I do to help? I’ve offered for her to move in with me but she wants to get herself independent. I’ve called women’s charities for her but they won’t give out much help to me personally. They would need to speak to mum but her partner tracks her phone so he would see which calls she had made. She’s not very tech savvy either. 

I’m really sorry if I’ve missed out any info, this has been so messed up for years it’s hard to remember key information. Covid has made this especially hard as we can’t go into her house to see her and she’s too afraid to drive places. Please let me know if you have any advice. Thank you.",20Dec2020,1

526,"I have wanted to audition for LaGuardia high school for a while now. I'd audition for dance and fine art. The thing is, there are some issues that complicate this decision.

My mom is trying to convince me not to audition. She says that it would be unfair for me to do this, since I'm ""basically guaranteed to get in"" and I wouldn't take the seat anyway. I go to a very, *very* good school currently and I need a lot of academic challenge. My mom says that the academics at LaGuardia are not good, and that I would be extremely bored there if I were to go. The thing is, I honestly don't know if I would take the seat or not. Tbh, I might. It's LaGuardia, after all. 

Also, it may just be low self-esteem talking, but I don't feel comfortable just *assuming* that I would automatically get in. I have good grades and a lot of talent, but saying that I'd just breeze right into one of the most prestigious art schools in the world is, frankly, insane.

Another issue is the requirements to apply. I would need to submit my semester grades from the past couple of years, plus standardized test scores - neither of which I have, because my current school doesn't do standardized tests or give letter grades until 8th grade. I would need to convert my unreleased number-based semester grades from years prior (and do something about test scores), which means that I'd have to declare to my current school that I'm applying out. I'm not really sure why this is bad, but the way my mom talked about it made it seem like it is.

Plus, I don't even know what I would major in! I love dance and visual art equally and I'm honestly not willing to sacrifice one for the sake of the other.

- Don’t do something with the intent to destroy or sabotage someone unless that someone is obviously disruptive.
- If what i’m doing is upsetting someone that matters to me then I’ll stop.

535,"A  little about me: I'm 20 living with my parents and studying at technical college. I don't have any friends or people I can really talk  or ask for an advice so here I come.

I  like my mom, if you can call it like this, but when it comes to  politics or some other things (e.g. vaccines). I sometimes don't know what to say. I try to be rational, not get emotional over things like I  mentioned above and I just be chilled out (that's the way I reduce stress).

One of sources of my stress is politics at my home. When I hear usually mom getting emotional over politics etc. (while talking with my dad about it or telling him  sth). She is not screaming, but she is mad I think, she speaks up. Worth to mention at this point that as far as I know she only watches a tv  channel which is sympathetic to the ruling party. About what she reads on the internet, I don't know.

So what I’ve heard from her:

* So where this all started. Once she mentioned that if you are an elder in Belgium your kid can start a trial to euthanize the elder without his will or agreement (and that it's a law). I was surprised to say at least. I did some digging  and...surprise, surprise, I didn't even found anything referred to this. One man euthanized in france after 11years in bed after a car accident and a quote which was saying something like ""we will be  euthanized against our will"" with no context at all, so it’s irrelevant.
* She says that we don't really know what is in vaccines, that vaccines from  west side of Europe (uk, france, germany) may have sth in it (I don't  remember much here very well), that these from east are a bit better. Also asked me if I'm going to take the covid vaccine, after I said idk, she responded that ""me and dad won't do it since we want to live"". She mentioned that bill gates also wants to reduce population, that they want to insert chips, that he was caught saying it. What I doubt a lot. I  can't imagine how internet, media etc. would just fuck him for saying  such a thing, not mentioning that saying such a thing even if you plan it would be such a dumb move, but maybe I miss something. She  doesn't have any medical degree, neither do I, all I can do is read a few articles about it. And I just did and I'm terrified. I saw that legit bill gates video. I closed it after \~20s when I saw a cut. It's just a manipulation. I also read an article addressing many doubts about the vaccine and I have no doubt to take it. It answered all questions I had.
* She  is against lgbt, saying that the politics supporting it are just paid to do so. That her friend has a gay friend who despise lgbt. Rarely she says that someone dresses/looks weird and ""didn't he/she look at the mirror before leaving?"". I don't mind lgb, trans people, I simply don't understand it. No hatred or sympathy towards them, I think I'm neutral about this one. People who look like they look, I may not like it but that's their choice how they want to look. And that gay friend, idk, it  seems like a distraction, ""even a gay said lgbt is bad"", the fact he is gay, doesn't make his opinion superior
* She mentions masons, Bilderberg group and their plan of ""new order"", reducing earth population etc. All I know about these organizations  comes from movies or a few conspiracy theories I heard by an accident.
* Once  we were talking about politics, I don't remember it very well, but she was like always looking for hidden agenda, bribes etc. But when I said  that trump gave an order to hit and kill someone on middle east with a missile she said that maybe she knew something we don't. No any doubts that he made a wrong decision. (I may messed up sth about this one, but  that's not the point, the point is that she didn't doubt in trump's decision while constantly looking for frauds earlier. No I don't live in us) And I pointed it out calmly, but I don't remember what happened after maybe she changed a topic or sth else.

I'm bad at arguing and I feel that any discussion about vaccine for example will end with me saying ""That's my choice to take it, you can do whatever you want."" Whats worse it took me \~1 hour to bust euthanize law, \~20 min to find out about manipulative video of bill gates and chips in vaccines.  
I don't like politics, it makes people argue, divides people and also makes me stress. Even making this post makes me feel like I'm writing a very important test. Maybe I'm the weird one who is terrified by this. But I just need help.",20Dec2020,1

539,"UK based 24F here.  In my teens right up to age 19 I went to church despite my family not being religious.  I just sort of fell into this high energy youth group and everything stemmed from that. I ended up with such an amazing community of friends there, a really broad circle.  

Fast forward, I moved away to Uni, didn’t make so many friends there and I now live with my husband (super grateful for him, he’s wonderful). It’s now been 6 years since I left for university, I’ve not found that magic group of ‘friends for life’ and I never went to another church as the year before I left I had started to question a lot and decided this wasn’t something I believed in.

I don’t understand how to find a similar community of like minded people that isn’t church-based.  How do adults ever make friends?

543,"So bit of back story, I have 3 best friends and we’re all in this nice friend groom it’s me 20m, dude 19m, J 20f, and M 19f. J and M had plans to hangout with each other but J was working so while she was at work M hung out with other people and got distracted and missed their hangout. Me and dude called the group chat to talk about when we’re doing the Christmas party between us 4. J went on to rant about what happened and it seemed one sided to me so after the call I talked to M about it. Here’s where I’m to blame, I shouldn’t have talked to M and I should I had let it be i was just so curious as to what her side of the story is but I just made it worse. She wasn’t mad at me then she was only upset with J.

Here’s where I start upsetting her(I think that is, I don’t really know). So she goes back to her moms to get away from it all. Now we all had plans to go hangout after J got off work that day so I asked her if we were still doing it. She says that she’d rather spend the night with her mom, I get that so I decided to cover for her by lying in the groupchat saying I had forgotten I told my roommates I’d play cards with them but before I did that I needed two questions answered before I did from her. So I asked them after her saying she wanted to relax. So the next day I message her and I asked how she was doing and all I got was “fine” I didn’t really understand what was going on but I knew she didn’t want to talk to me so I was planning on leaving it as that. But dude had come over to hangout with me and he said he needed to head over to M’s place to print something off so I tag along. When we get there she’s just kind of moping around and it looks like she’s on the verge of tears. Now 1 it breaks my heart to see my best friend like that and 2 it breaks it even more knowing this whole thing is my fault. So I text her afterwards and say something like, “ are you sure you’re ok? If you want to talk just lmk, like I can kick dude out if necessary 😂”. She reassured my she was ok, here’s where I really screwed up, I was planning on leaving it as is but I woke up at 4 am feeling nothing but guilt and pain for what I’ve done and so I messaged her a dumb message of basically being honest and saying that I wanted to help her but I don’t know how, I said if you want me to leave you alone I will but I want to know. I woke up regretting that message because it was a bit more romantic than I intended. Anyways she said she was fine but I could tell I upset her and for good reason too, I know I’m at fault. 

Now, here’s where I’m lost, that text was Tuesday morning, it’s not Sunday. I’ve talked to dude and he says he talked to M and that I made her upset and that I shouldn’t text her, that she would text me when she’s ready. Then J talked to her yesterday and said that she needs some space and she will talk to me when she’s ready. They’ve reassured me that she isn’t terminating the friendship but I’ve gotten nothing but silence for the past week almost. Do I have a right to be upset with her? Or do I deserve the silence im receiving?

549,"I'm currently 18 in New England and I'm coming to realize that I'm not the biggest fan of cold weather at all, so I'd like to move a real good bit away from the only city I've ever lived in, away from all my old friends and family. It sounds kinda crazy saying it like that, but I feel like having a complete life wipe and starting absolutely everything over again would be an awesome experience.

After doing some research, it looks like Houston, Texas would be a really nice place to go to, as it's always hot, has a low cost of living, and the comp sci job market seems to be plentiful over there. I also read they have some of the greatest food in America which is definitely a big plus. The only thing I've read that'd be an issue is that I'd have to look for neighborhoods where flooding isn't as big of an issue as other parts.

I'm planning on enlisting in the Marine Corps active duty for four years to stack some money up and for their GI Bill if I can get this pretty hefty medical waiver out of the way. After the four years, I'd come back and buy a reliability tank; something like a Corolla or a Civic where I wouldn't have to spend lots of money or time. I've learned over the years of working on cars that I'm really not as big of a car guy as I thought I was and I have no problem in driving something ""boring.""

I'd probably end up going to a UMass school next to my hometown since the GI Bill will only work on in-state schools, and I'd have to live in Texas for about a year to finally become considered a permanent resident. After completing my bachelor's in comp sci, I'd probably just end up applying to a bunch of jobs in the Houston area, and if I end up getting an offer, moving as close to the job site as possible. I think I'd just load up my car with my important stuff + documents and paperwork and all that good stuff and make the 1,500+ mile drive to there and stay at a hotel or an Airbnb while I look for an apartment to rent close to work

I think I should mention that I'm currently working full-time at the moment while I wait for the O.K. to ship out to Bootcamp hopefully in early 2021. I have a car too, which I'd sell before leaving for about a couple thousand dollars. I feel that with the money I'm saving at my job, the money from selling my current car, selling things I have no use for anymore, and the money I'll be saving while enlisting in the Corps while also having my college paid for me through the GI Bill will make it so that I wouldn't have any debt to pay off and that I'll likely not have to worry about money too much while planning out the big move. I kinda have to do this all by myself, since I come from a pretty low-income family with a single parent. 

I think that about sums up everything I've been wondering about. I'm aware that spending four years in the military, on top of another four years of college in my hometown afterward gives me lots of time to think, and I'll probably change my mind a whole lot before then, but this is what I've come up with so far. 

TL;DR: I'd like some advice about planning a big move to somewhere in the U.S. with hot weather year-round, a relatively low cost of living, and a nice job market for those looking to work as a software engineer. Is Houston, Texas a good place for this? What would I have to look out for? Are there any other places I could consider moving to that share similar qualities? Should I use the GI Bill in my hometown, or should I look to becoming a Texas resident and attending HU with the GI Bill to build up networks all that?

Any advice on anything I wrote would be MASSIVELY appreciated, as there isn't really anyone in real life that I could ask. Thanks for reading all of this!!",20Dec2020,1

I used to work at a covid swab unit in a hospital on the administrative side. I know exactly how the virus and swabbing works as I went to all the meetings throughout the duration of the pandemic. 

I know that I’m not clinical and don’t know everything but I know enough. 

As I’ve been doing teacher training. I’ve been at a school and observing lessons and teaching without a mask. Not ideal but these kids can’t see what I’m saying with a mask on. Anyway, I was alerted that a student in one of the classes tested positive, so of course I went to get a test and followed the isolation rules. 1.5 days later the school closed down due to a flare in cases. 

I emailed asking if I’d been in close proximity of anyone who tested positive. And the response was “you missed the active peak of the flare up” sorry but is that not just stupid. The virus could be there in anyone and they don’t know the approximate date they got it so how can a non clinical member of staff be making the call that I missed the peak and he won’t discuss if I’ve been in close contact. 

I feel like the school are just acting like it’s no big deal and surely I have a right to know? It’s almost like he’s saying you’ll be fine you missed it anyway? 1.5 days earlier there could have been a peak in cases and it only came out 1.5 days later when people got tested?

569,"Can't believe im on reddit for this but I'm just done with this now. I have a friend from uni (he is 24 M, I'm 23 M) who has a very defeatist mindset and doesn't bother finding a job or a new hobby other than just play games and be on the internet all day ever since we graduated a year and a half ago. Let me just be clear a lot of us in my uni were zoomers (Gen Z) so yeah all of us play video games although I don't play nearly as much games as I did before cause I'm caught up with life and many other exciting things.

This friend has Asperger's and to be completely honest I didnt know this until around the 2nd semester of college and I have a sister who also has Asperger's hence why I'm surprised I didn't really see the signs. Not sure if this info matters but it might do.

He messages me and my other friend sometimes about how shit his life is and usually updates his status on discord as being depressed and clearly seeking attention. Thing is, me and this other friend spent periods throughout the entire year to encourage him to try new things. I got him very briefly to make music since thats what he is into but then he stopped very shortly after even though he made something pretty cool. One of my hobbies is video editing and I said I'd help him make a video (I have a YT channel) and he got all excited and then he just completely dropped it the next day and he was back to his miserable self.

When nobody is there to play video games with him he says that he will try video editing and go back to making more music but never does and reverts back to whining about nobody playing with him. 

But when we do find time to play together he is right there the next day wanting to play again. One time he was even annoyed that he couldn't get a hold of me for a multiplayer game cause I was busy that next day (nothing was scheduled) and I had to tell him that he was being toxic and to cut it out. We used to play R6 Siege a little bit but he rage quits and is super negative and a bad teammate and I actually had to stop playing with him because of his attitude.

Sure, covid has made things tougher but thats just no excuse at all to be doing nothing all day he has been at this for 1 year and a half! It got to the point where his antics became the subject of memes made to this day so we can cope with his negative attitude and behaviour. 

But seriously, do I just view him as a lost case or does there need to be some sort of ultimatum? I feel I've done everything I can.

Me (21F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been together for almost two years now. Our parents have met each other and we are getting serious.

However, I’ve never really been invited to his house, I’ve brought it up before and he just says it’s because there’s nothing to do at his house. He lives with his parents, and the one time he invited me over his friends wanted to hang out and he also asked me to come but his mom didn’t like it since his family is super religious. (We’re both Muslim and Pakistani). So I just stayed at his house waiting for him to come home for an hour. When his family first came to our house, my mom gave her a dress just to be nice, then she got me one for eid. But I get fake vibes from her sometimes, it’s just like a feeling you get when you know someone’s fake. When she talks to my mom, she mostly just talks about herself and her kids, but when my mom says something she just ignores her and barely listens. 

My mom brought this up before as she thought it was rude. Also, when she talked to my mom on the phone she mentioned how it wasn’t safe for me to come home late as she doesn’t allow her kids to do the same and she’s saying it cause she considers me as her daughter. She said she has a son so it’s not talked about as much in society. But she told my mom she’s strict with her kids but she’s only strict with her daughter. She’s really chill with my boyfriend coming home at anytime and even let him go  on a trip wit his friends (Vegas - Nevada) 

One time, she also wanted to call my mom and ask about my mental illness (I have really bad anxiety and depression) and my boyfriends’s anxiety and how our relationship would go on if we’re both not healthy. She didn’t end up calling because her husband told her not to. My boyfriend knew about this. Also, my mom invited my boyfriend over on my birthday, but on his bday, he told his mom he was going to meet me outside and she knew about this, while planning a small party for him with his immediate family and cousins but she didn’t ask to invite me. My boyfriend just asked her if I could come and just replied with “ok” 

When I went to her house recently I got a gift for her and she was nice about it and thanked me but she asked me why I didn’t bring anyone cause it was late and I’d have to drive home alone. However she didn’t once asked me if I wanted to stay for a bit.. like if I would want something to eat, or water etc.  (my boyfriend asked in the car but I said it’s okay just to be polite) it was like around 11 pm. One time my bf and I went to my cousin’s wedding with my family and when she found out she kept on blowing up his phone as she was mad that he didn’t tell her and that my family should have asked their family to bring him. After that she didn’t contact us for a while a tried to dodge my mom’s calls.",20Dec2020,1

579,"Typing on mobile, kinda long, so sorry in advance. Any advice appreciated.  

I am terrified about money and a job right now, and am wondering how other moms contributed to the household income with a newborn and two step children, 5 and 7. 

I do not have a college degree,  unfortunately, though I am quite intelligent and have the capability to learn.  I had to drop out of college years ago to take care of my mother full time when she was terminally ill. Since she has passed, I've done mostly bartending/restaurant work, and off and on in home care for geriatrics. 

My husband has two children,  and pays 200 per week in child support. We have a mortgage,  and condo dues that add up to 1500 per month.  We also have the older children over for meals 5 nights out of the week and one sleep over per weekend. Plus other bills, utilities and the like. We currently have one car because his is unreliable. My car payment is 160 a month.  Extraneous stuff, insurance, internet,  cell phone, etc. 

I lost my job in January bartending where I was making good money bc the restaurant shut down,  so I started doing in home care again,  per diem.  Unfortunately that made me miss out on unemployment covid stimulus money and the company I was working for paid decent, 20/hr, so I didn't qualify for insurance funded by the state while I was pregnant.  But it was per diem so some weeks I worked 20 hours, others I worked 40. I did not want to look for something new being pregnant (LO born 11/4) and during the covid crisis finding employment has been difficult.  My company does not offer paid maternity leave or insurance.  

My husband lost his job making 600/week before taxes at the beginning of December,  because his boss decided to retire and disband his company.  My husband was not getting insurance or severance pay through his employer.  

So now, we have all the bills of a five person household but no income, and a massive hospital bill from birth of the baby.  He has a job opportunity after the new year hopefully making slightly more than he was before,  but I do not know what his hours will look like,  i think mostly weekdays, 6/7am to possibly 4pm, but that's just a guess, if he even gets it. It will be a good opportunity for him to learn a trade and has growth and promotions available. He will be using my car however,  and needs the car for driving to pick up and drop off his other 2 children in the evenings, which leaves me with either working from home options,  or finding some job that does over night shifts from like 8/9pm to 5am, so we can switch off and trade the vehicle. 

I am stressed and lost and overwhelmed.  I have a small inheritance from my mother passing away that will provide a buffer until I can figure out something,  but it won't last long at this rate, and I hate not having any income right now. Plus I think the small inheritance is stopping me from being able to get any government help. We cannot afford to live on one person's salary. As it stands,  we cannot afford daycare or a full time nanny. Plus the baby is only 6 wks old. 

I hate the US health insurance and maternity policies... im depressed and overwhelmed and I do not know who to go to for advice. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on work from home jobs (in a rural state) or any resources i can reach out to to be able to get some advice?",20Dec2020,1

583,"(reposting bc last time I posted at like 2am EST and didn't get a lot of attention)

 I'm 20 years old and I'm stuck at home due to COVID. My 12 year old sister lives here too and tbh she can be really mean. My family is super dysfunctional and I think the general tension in the house makes everyone sorta snappy. But I feel like even when I try to have positive interactions and be kind she's still like this.

If I play some music and ask if she wants to sing with me she'll be like ""no your music sounds awful"", or she'll laugh at stuff like my music taste or clothes without me even asking for her opinion. If I try to start a convo by asking what sort of music/clothes she likes she just dodges the question, like she assumes I'm gonna make fun of her.

Additionally if I express concern she always gets mad at me bc she thinks I'm just being condescending. Like if I remind her not to leave the milk out too long she'll literally hit me over it (and I'm the runt of the litter so she's actually bigger and can do some damage).

I know she's just a kid and I shouldn't let it get to me, but when my immediate family is the only social interaction I'm getting for months on end it does start to sting a bit. As someone who grew up in this household I know how shitty it is and how just being here can bring out your worst traits, but I'm not a child psychologist and I can't sort out this kid's problems for her while I'm still dealing with my own.

I want to be on friendly terms with her, but it's just so hard when every interaction she has with me seems primed to hurt as much as possible and leaves me crying in my room.",20Dec2020,1

THANK YOU IN ADVANCE TO ANYONE WHO TAKES THE TIME TO READ THIS. 

A little backstory, I started getting really close with this boy (we will call him Dane) at church when we were around 14/15 years old. As we began hanging out more and went on a church trip together, we instantly developed feelings for each other and we fell for each other pretty damn hard. Of course we were only 15 year olds at the time, and he had a pretty strict household so he was not allowed to date until he turns 17 which I was okay with. We would text every day and flirt and all that but we technically didn’t confess our feelings to each other yet, we just knew we liked each other by hearing it from mutual friends. We’re both pretty reserved and we are very cautious with every our every move. He ended up confessing to me a few days after his 16th birthday, and I was over the moon. He waited to even just confess to me because his parents didn’t want him to move too fast. We just told each other honestly about our feelings without having to pretend we didn’t know we liked each other. It was pretty good after that but around when I turned 17 a couple months later, something felt really off with us. He seemed to avoid me and give me on word responses, I was so scared that I’ve become boring to him and I was sad for a good month or two because of it and I told him about it. He didn’t know what to say when I told him I’ve been feeling sad, so that upset me even more that he just sat there, nodding along even after silence has washed over us. I think he doesn’t really have the emotional intelligence—or rather how to deal with a sad person because he was raised in such a strict household, he doesn’t have a lot of experience with relationships or talking about serious or deeper topics. I was very turned off by that and I remember having to change the subject after he told me he can’t relate to my sadness or feeling sad. I was upset because we had a lot of good things going for us except for emotional connection and communication which are HUGE parts of a successful relationship. I think also the fact I was older than him by almost a year, I was ready for a more serious relationship where he was still like a school boy with a big crush on me. I told myself I will wait for him to turn 17 so we can officially start dating and go on dates and hold hands and all that shit. He ended up “breaking up” with me a few weeks after I told him I’ve been feeling sad. I wasn’t caught off guard because our mutual friend has already told me he lost interest in me after I confided in him about Dane. I was the one who had to even confront him about telling me the truth because he didn’t want to say it, I told him “I already know what you want to tell me” after he kept stalling to break up with me. All he said was he was sorry and that it’s just not the right time for us and he feels as the spark has gone away. We ended it with a hug as we tried not to cry in front of each other. It sounds stupid and honestly maybe it was stupid, but it wasn’t just a little crush, we were basically together without officially labeling us as boyfriend and girlfriend. But what hurt the most was the fact he left me because a girl at his school liked him and confessed to him. And he never told me that. I found out from our mutual friend. Never once did Dane mention another girl and how he got bored of me and excited over this new girl in his life. I was hurt mostly because Dane didn’t have the guts to tell it to me straight that he left me for her. 
After we broke up, I began seeing Dane less and I began seeing my ex again, I confided in him a lot since we remained really good friends after my ex and I broke up. Long story short, he became a rebound and friends with benefits with me (keep in mind he was the one who initiated and encouraged it) and honestly it made me feel better. I was distracted from Dane and it helped me forget about him. My ex and I ended up dating again after a month or two of being fwb, and I have basically forgotten about Dane, but at the same time wanted to rub the fact that I moved on and dating someone else in his face.
Fast forward to when my boyfriend and I break up, I was devastated bc my boyfriend had cheated on me and betrayed not only our relationship but friendship. I was heart broken but I moved on quick, bc I don’t think I ever actually felt love in that relationship but instead more lust. 
I noticed around the time my boyfriend and I broke up, Dane has started texting me again (and this was around when Covid hit and we started to quarantine). I didn’t really think much of it when Dane texted me more regularly bc I was so emotional and angry over my ex. However as time passed by, I realized we started texting like normal again, and I could tell he was being flirty. Our mutual friend told me how much Dane regretted leaving me for that other girl, for the other girl was apparently rude and cocky and dropped Dane real quick. It felt good tbh, that’s what he gets for jumping to another girl so quickly on an impulse. I didn’t see Dane for several months due to Covid but we texted often. When we finally did see each other again, it was awkward. I couldn’t even look him in the eye and we never talked about what happened between us which I felt there were still a lot of things to be said. Our mutual friend told me that he could read Dane like a book, and that he was awkward with me because he knows he fucked up. I felt very satisfied and flattered hearing that but at the same time, all I wanted was a real chance with him. For about two months I started seeing Dane regularly again like before, and I could tell there was something still there between us but we never confronted it. Things were going so well and there was still hope inside me that we would end up together without a doubt, and now that he’s 17, we could start dating for real this time. 
Then I got the news. He’s moving far away.
I found out from my brother and I was devastated, more so than I thought I’d be. I remember breaking down one day in bed, crying after it really hit me that he’s leaving. It came out of nowhere and it took me by surprise. I let myself be sad about it for a week and I tried to just accept it and move on. But I couldn’t and I can’t. And I think it’s because I never got closure from him. Even when we “broke up” the first time, he was very vague with why he lost interest in me or why he’s breaking up with me so I just assumed we would get back together later down the road. Even when I was dating my boyfriend at the time, I don’t think I realized it but there was still this hope deep inside of me that Dane and I would ultimately get back together someday when we’re older and that hope began growing and growing once we started hanging out again. But then suddenly, that hope died in just a matter of seconds when I found out he’s moving away. I have all these emotions and feelings and hope of us being together that I don’t know what to do with them now that he’s moving away. I tried just shoving it back down and praying it would just disappear but it’s getting worse as the days go by. He is actually leaving today, and I feel awful. I was also really upset because when we said our goodbyes, all he said was “it’s been a good run” and we ended our three year friendship (more than a friendship) in a pathetic lousy hug. He later texted me, apologizing that he didn’t properly say good bye to me and how he just didn’t want me to see him cry. I told him I wish he did cry though. He then said sorry again, and told me looking back on it now, he wished he could’ve told me what he’s been meaning to tell me. I felt my heart beat so fast after he texted me that, because I felt that what he wanted to tell me was how he was sorry for leaving me in the first place, and how he still has feelings for me and all that. He told me he would FaceTime me but we never ended up calling which upset me more, but I understood he was very busy packing and stuff. I just wish we got to talk one last time, just to get closure or a conclusion to whatever the fuck we were. He would add love songs to the playlist he has made me a long time ago when we first started liking each other—that’s how we communicated, through songs and lyrics we would add into each other’s playlists instead of actually talking about it. Yeah, lame I know, but that’s how we communicated our thoughts and feelings. And he’s been adding a lot of sad songs about leaving his lover and all that. He texted me last night, that I’m something very special, and that I mean more to him than I may think. That hurt my heart even more and I wish he didn’t tell me that, because now my feelings are more mixed up as ever and I don’t know what to feel about us. Does he want to try long distance? Does he still like me? Or does he just want to remain friends and just leave it at that without ever speaking about what happened between us. That’s all I wanted from him—closure. I just wanted him to be open and honest for once and tell it to me straight without avoiding the obvious. And now, he’s leaving and I’ll never get that closure from him and I’ll be stuck on him for a long time. What do I do?

TLDR: I have a crush (that’s more like a boyfriend to me) and we liked each other for a year, then broke up, and just recently started liking each other again. But now he is moving to another country and I don’t know what to do with all these feelings I have for him and I don’t know what he thinks or feels about me.",20Dec2020,1

I think the Answer is that I don't really want to do anything, the idea that there is something out there that you're destined for and you just need to find your passion is complete bullshit IMO. Maybe for some people there is a clear cut path for them from the start, but for a lot there isn't anything. We're just advanced monkeys on a rock, there is no destiny and we don't know why we're here. My parents are both the same, there is no calling for them; they've just worked to support themselves.

593,"So I’ll just dive right into it, it’s the holiday season as we all know and of course that means it’s the season for giving gifts to those you love. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year (we’re in high school) and we always give gifts to each other when holidays come around. However, I just found out that he doesn’t really get me the gifts... his mom does. It’s not that I’m not appreciative or that I don’t like the gifts, it’s just that I feel like it’s not really from him... and 9/10 it feels like the gifts are just for a person but not really for me. They just aren’t personalized to the type of person I am at all? And I’m not complaining about that... but I used to think he at least paid for all the gifts but recently I found out he doesn’t, his mom does. I found out that his mom plans out the gift, wraps it, and even pays for it, every time. I asked him about his involvement in it and he said that his “Mom gives him the idea, and he picks it out”, but I feel like putting that into context is more like, his mom said to gift a candle, so he picked out which scent... and I just feel like that’s still his mom doing the majority of the work. My boyfriend always says that he’s bad at giving gifts and he always asks his mom for help but... I feel like she does all of it, and so I feel like it’s not that he’s bad at gift giving I just feel like it’s because he’s lazy? He’s like that in other aspects too... honestly his parents do everything for him but drive him. So I asked him about this calmly and he got a bit defensive, I asked him to be the one to do it in the future and he agreed... but I feel like that just means he’s gonna start lying to me about his involvement. Basically to summarize, It seems as though the only effort he puts into it is writing his name on the end product. And honestly... it changes the way I view him. Does this make me unappreciative? Am I crazy for wanting it to just be from him? Please let me know your thoughts!

594,"Im living in a rehabilitation dorm where 1 or 2 of us cook everyday under the week for everyone else. If you cook meat you cook a second pot extra with non meat variant. Im worried about my nutrition plan that i dont get enough protein and amino acids. My problem is that no one cooks meat. we have a few vegetarians and the rest just says they don't eat much meat. The social workers excuse is they don't expect from vegetarians to cook meat if they don't want to. Not even the litte meat eaters want to cook meat. So if you don't want to cook meat you don't have to. I think that sucks because you have to cook for others. And when there is meat its only allowed once a week. Even when i cook i can't choose to cook meat becaue the second cook has already decided. I hate how much im being disregarded. I also hate all the carbs that we get served im overweight i want to only to eat vegetables and meat i don't want a shit ton of carbs what about my choice of wanting to eat little carbs just like the choice of some people wanting less meat. 
the workers say meat once a week is enough that i can eat meat at weekends where everyone cooks for themselves.
I dont wanna hear all these stupid tips that meat is unhealthy that keto isnt good for loosing weight. 

Listen Everything in moderation, ok? I can eat in moderation and i may be fat but i can still choose my diet

597,"At the beginning I made chapters to make this long text easier to read:  
1. Overview on the problem  
2. Backstory, that may or not be helpful  
3. My whole point and final question  
4. Bonus information 

  
**1.** Hi, so I have problem with my younger brother. He is sometimes really aggressive towards me, especially when I give him so advice or reprimand him. Overall he's pretty calm, kind and emphatic kid with good grades in school, but in home everything changes.   
Some backstory to make situation have more sense:  
**2.** I live with my both grandparents since I was born. My mother was too busy to look after me because of work (but right now after her lies I'm not so sure that's true), my biological father was alcoholic who didn't care about me or my basic needs, he passed away three years ago. I'm thankful for being raised by my grandparents because they've teach me good values and other important and useful things (they still teach me now) so I've been raised good.  In 2009 some time after my mother broke out with my alcoholic biological father, she met my current stepfather (loving and caring man who married wrong woman)  whom she married two years later. Then when some things stabilized and they started to have more time for me I've started to live with them. That didn't last long so sometimes I've lived with them and sometimes I've lived with my great-grandmother and uncle at countryside. But anyways in 2013 my younger brother was born. Since my mother started to cheat on my dad and do other bad things involving alcohol or drugs. All those things led up to her voluntary permanent departure to Netherlands in 2019. By the time whole thing with her cheating and lying happened my brother lived in various places, with my other grandparents which are my step-dads parents, with my great-grandmother and uncle at countryside and with my grandparents that I'm living with. But anyways enough of backstory.  
**3.** The whole problem has been going on for around 2/3 years at this point. His aggressivity rarely occurs with other strong emotions like sadness or physical pain. It's just only madness. Today he randomly kicked me in my stomach with full force. Always when those situations occur nobody from grandparents seem to care. Once I've called my mother that lives in other country but she only said something to him about not being angry, she just hasn't even tried to instruct him. I'm always calm when I talk to him and show him my understanding but sometimes it makes things worse. How can I change him? What's the best thing I could do at this point? Continue my meaningless trials to change him or ask someone that doesn't seem to care about it?

she lives in norway, and i live in the uk so there isn’t much chance of us meeting for the next year or so, but that’s okay. if this friendship stays real, we have time.

the problem is that no matter how calmly i address that i’m calling someone they haven’t seen in person, they won’t be convinced that it’s not some high tech robot on the line powered by an old man, even though we facetime.

i don’t know how to introduce her to them, and how to get them to be okay with it.

Ive been with this guy for a little over a year kind of on and off since the summer. I love him to death but he’s so stubborn and has done things in the past that I was not super happy with. The thing is... We just reconnected recently, everything was great and I think he was finally seeing the problem in himself for the first time and was willing to change, be better, etc. There’s more to the story but this is pretty much some context. He also decided though around the same time he wanted to go off his antidepressants. The thing is... he is doing absolutely everything wrong. He didn’t talk to his doctor about it, he’s trying to get off them as quick as he can and i know thats really dangerous. I’m worried its gonna fuck him up more but I’ve talked to him about trying to taper off them slower and he just doesn’t want to. I’ve offered all my support and any help if he needs as well. I texted him a couple days ago asking how he was and all he said was not good today. Its hard to talk to him now even. It’s putting a big strain on me and I don’t even know how to respond to the situation anymore. He told me he’s probably going to want to be alone more when he started and all which im fine with but I havent seen him in a week and I just worry. I guess I’m looking for advice on how to deal with stubbornness or if anyone’s gone through something similar. I don’t know what else I can do and I don’t know what else to say. Thanks for reading.

600,"Hi everyone. 

For pretty much my entire life, I had always wanted to be a veterinarian. I got sidetracked in junior year of high school by the possibility of a graphic designer, due to my love of art and being a devoted painter, but immediately went back to being a veterinarian my senior year. I dismissed any career art related because after a few months of thinking, I realised that I wanted to keep art as a hobby. I didn't want the only thing that seemed to bring me some sort of stress relief to be tarnished by a career out of it.

When I think about being a vet, it makes sense that it is a career that would suit me. I love animals, and I am extremely interested in science, particularly medical areas, anatomy, and physiology. I'm in college getting a degree in Animal Sciences, before I apply for veterinary school. 

Yet sometimes, when I can't sleep late at night, I think about how I know for sure that this is for me. The pieces seem to fit, and it makes sense for me to be a veterinarian, and other times I worry that maybe I'm not smart enough for it (I'm really awful at chemistry. It is probably my worst subject.) or that I won't enjoy it as much as I think I will. 

I don't know if this has something to do with me or not, because I am, in all honesty, an extremely cautious person. I try my best to weigh all the information before coming to a decision or conclusion. I could just be overthinking it. My dad has always told me I need to find a job that makes me happy so I am not dreading waking up everyday, and I am now just worried and stressed out of my mind that I might be making a wrong decision, even if it seems right at the moment.

Is there any advice anyone could give me? I would really appreciate it.",20Dec2020,1

604,"Hello.

I'll give a quick back story, and I just want to say that I don't mean to offend anyone with this post.. I just want an answer :)

Anyway. In 9th grade I met this girl and we started to become friends.( I'm also a girl.) I never really liked her, but we shared a middle friend that kept us together. So this girl (let's call her Ava), had some habits that irritated me. And every time we hung out the atmosphere was just wierd. Anyway I'm in 11th garde now we still talk but I go to a different so school, so we hang out very rearly.

Anyway Yesterday, we hung out. And she started doing another thing that really annoyed me. The reason I still hang out with her is because she's is that kind of person wich is nice to be around once in a while. But if you see her  everyday you can go crazy. Here's what she did.

I Wanted to show er this funny series that pewdiepie has, before I could tell her what the series was she gave that look where "" I can't belive you watch him"". But anyway, I told her about the series and she grew more and more cocky, then I asked her if she wants to watch it or if not. And she said ""Yeah, sure let's watch it"" So we started watching it and I told her that if she gets bored or does not want to watch anymore to tell me.... And well she did kinda tell me, but in the rudest way possible.... I think.

We were watching the video and I could see from the corner of my eye that she was texting someone else and not paying any attention at all, also she was playing games. That annoyed me a bit so I turned it of because obviously she wasn't intrested an asked her what she wants to do and we'll she just told me to wait because she is texting her friend and she can't leave her on read... Yupp.... I think it's strange that she and my other friend ignore an IRL person, to talk with someone on messenger. Anyway i was tired so I went home. (It's like I can't leave this person on read but I can leave you on 'said??'... Bad joke I know haha) obviously I'm done hanging out with her, but I just want to know if:

Am I crazy or am I overreacting? Or is this some serious thing? Because like I had better thing to do, than to watch her text her friends.....

I guess what I am asking is for a bit of advice from the older users of Reddit, how did you decide where you wanted to live, or what career path you took? (Your experiences don't have to be psychology related!)

 So the title pretty much sums it up. I’m a 16 year old guy and my older sister (18) is moving out. And at this point, I’m past the point where I’m too embarrassed to say I’m gonna miss her. 

Her college is far so I’m barely ever going to see her (apart from holidays and stuff). People always tease me when we show affection (because most of my friends have siblings whom hate each other) but I’ve always felt lucky to have a sister who actually takes care/likes their younger brother. 

Eg, I always go to her for advice, if I’m not feeling the most confident (suffered with depression and my parents think mental health is a hoax) she’s very kind and caring and will help. or whether it’s just a boring day where neither of us have anything to do so we talk. 

I just can’t imagine next 2 years without her. It’s gonna be so boring!! When she got accepted I just had to act happy and fake a smile and a ‘well done’. 

I know people are gonna think it’s weird cos from what I’ve heard, no one is very close with their siblings, but I don’t care what they say, she set the older sister bar high! How can I stop feeling like this? I swear at one point I was praying she’d get into a college closer to home. And I’m scared that my mental health is going to get worse. How can I stop feeling these things? Any advice would help!! Please no mean comments or teasing.

She even helped me to get a job where she works.. And ever since, staying with her, we diverged at some point and whatever I told her about my boyfriend she kept his side, making me feel like I am always wrong. They, him and my boyfriend  have become real close friends and whenever I am with these old friends of mine it bothers me, I feel like I am there for nothing. They always saw his side and I have my guilt too for many chikdish reactions. I feel hate when they gang up. My boyfriend would leave everything behind to help them. Even now after we had a fight I picked because of them,jealousy mixed with anger and childish immaturity.
We were supposed to spend a day together for us and his brother to something all three and the instant he called my boyfriend, he needed my bf to drive him outside the city  and drive him back (this happened more than once). I went with them and his gf but I could not be happy for him or with him. With them he can talk, joke, be different, be pleasant, be polite and whatever they ask he is there, he offers himself more. And for me all these are somewhat luxuries. He never argues or says no to them.
And another thing is that my bf always tells me after he talked to them or him. He never asks me  or tells me before. He always puts me in front of the deed done.
I know all these should not bother me, after all they are our friends.. More like his lately. I feel stupid and just there in plus, for a bigger number. But it makes me so mad I become very immature. We fraught because of this many times. I want to understand him but I simply can't. I wish he never gave me all the reasons to be jealous but now I kind of avoid my own friends. I am always tense when I am with them. I can not  and do not want to make him chose. But it is so frustrating to see all he can do for them and not for them. Especially how much he talks when with me all he can say is how was your day what did u eat and how is work. I can not stand to see him happy with them.

My periods are irregular in general, but those unbearable painful episodes happen like every 2 months more or less.

Of course at the time the interest wasn’t mutual and he set a boundary and limited our interactions to only electronic. I respected it and we’ve been gradually heading in a direction where we can rebuild our trust. I don’t see him in that romantic light anymore, for one thing he’s a shitty communicator.

He says he has a lot of trust and anxiety issues in these situations and doesn’t want to hang out for the foreseeable future and wants to continue having texting only talks. I said we could rebuild as slowly as you want, but I would like at some point to revisit the idea of meeting up again. He said he doesn’t know when that’s going to happen. I said I respected it although deep down (I didn’t tell him this) I was disappointed that he couldn’t put this past him.

Problem is I keep thinking I’m a horrible person and he has resentment towards me for expressing that I was interested in potentially something more. He says he doesn’t, and it’s not about me proving that I’m over him that way, it’s just how he feels. Still hurts and I feel that the distancing makes it more painful. I don’t want to tell him he’s being unreasonable because that would come off as disrespectful.

I want to hear that this says more about him than it does about me, but part of me still thinks I suck for attempting to change the dynamic.

We started talking again this year, but since we weren’t able to see each other at all it didn’t include any flirting. We used vent to each other about shit we are experiencing in our lives and it was honestly great. I started catching feelings pretty quickly, idk about her though. 

She’s an open girl, was extremely “open” at 14 especially on valentines week, but i don’t judge people on that. She has admitted she has commitment issues which make my decision even harder-should i go for her? Im not insecure nor do i get jealous easily. But shes the type of person to really get u mad or atleast question the trust in a relationship. She’s hot and funny, but not necessarily bright, and a bit “fake”. Talks hella shit about some people then goes out with them the next day. At some points when we’re talking, i just feel like im getting played. 

My “philosophy” right now for life, is to work on my self as much as possible, that includes: working out, playing guitar, and getting extremely high grades. All of which are going great till now. I don’t need distractions, which includes relationships. Ofcourse i will pursue a relationship when im in college but thats about 2 years from now. 

And what makes my decision even harder is that im leaving to canada next summer. So i wont even be in the country to see her.

He has made me believe that I'm the monster in the house, that I'm the selfish one, I'm the one that's crazy. Until my step siblings came to visit, they thought the same things, they just backed up my ideas about him and made me realize that I'm not the crazy, selfish, monster he tells me i am.

I'm not going into detail about what he has done, although i will if its needed, but he has threatened me with death, he has beaten be that i couldn't walk for 3 days and had to get x-rays to make sure nothing is broken. He has given me countless bruises and has always gotten away with it. Because according to him he has depression (he has been to a therapist and he doesn't, he then insisted on going to a psychiatric hospital witch also confirmed that he doesn't have depression). 

I talked to my parents many many many times about him and what he has been doing they always just answer with ""but he's depressed"" and then dismisses my concerns. The times that i have fought back i was always the one to get into trouble and get punished even if it was clear that he started the fight (we saw him hitting me first on one of the cameras we have around). In the last 3 years i haven't started a single fight but always had the blame and the same idiotic excuse: ""but he's depressed"".

He has been selfish, in this week alone he has refused to clean out a single drawer of his cupboard (he has a cupboard larger than most walk in closets). He made 8 people wait for 2 and a half hours to begin a movie and then had the audacity to tell us not to turn off the light because he's not ready. The following day he made 17 people wait in cars because he was hungry and had to eat, 14 people told him to eat before we go because he'll get hungry on the way, he just refused to eat because he knew my father would buy him fast food (he has our parents wrapped around his finger and can make them do whatever he wants).

He's almost 17 and can barely do the simplest of tasks, like washing dishes, unpacking the dishwasher, mopping the floor, making a bed, make himself food, set the table etc. When the time comes to do any basic task they always ask me. I have talked to my parents about this and they just said they don't have enough energy to teach him how to do things. 

I'm often scared to sleep, i always have a heavy metal water bottle close by because I'm scared he will try and hit me again, I've only ever hit him once with the water bottle and that was after he dislocated my jaw and broke 3 of my fingers, he then convinced my parents that i started the fight and i hurt him more than he hurt me (he had a small bruise on his arm).

While I’m extremely grateful for the friends  I still have, they’re all off doing their own things: being in serious relationships with their significant others, having children (which makes the relationships I have with them even more hard because they have KIDS) or they moved off to another state and have very busy jobs. I understand that this is adulthood, and the fact I’ve been laid off due to the pandemic doesn’t help the fact that I literally spend all day at home.

Last night I did something bad, though it wasn't a crime but they think it's racist. Then some guy said he's in a gang and has killed and it seems like the others were talking about making society better (by killing me it's implied).

Ive been wanting to kill myself because of this. I don't want them to delay my death for days and torture me on and on. That's what I'm scared about.

I was thinking of turning myself into the police for two crimes I've committed but never gotten cought to get protection. I googled their gang and realized they have members in prison. I think those insude are more likely to kill since they already lost their freedom. They have nothing to lose by killing me. The death Penalty isn't carried out in my state. So I think I should stay free.

A few days ago I also got suicidal. One neighbor told me to die and threatened to kill me to someone else over my second crime which damaged him. I think he's in a gang.

I got really paranoid a few days after. I was worried about messing up my suicide and living so I didn't do it.

Yeah. I'm in some deep shit.

I could try to redeem myself for my second crime. But I have no idea what would happen if I try. It's possible they still want me dead.

I think I should just kill myself.

I was thinking they aren't such good people if they kill me. If they kill me, they'll have blood on their hands.

I seriously doubt I could get solitary confinement. That's what I want. Maybe I should just die.

I don't want to die though.

Im going to post this, wait an hour and get my things together to ready for suicide, come back here and see what you guys posted, and do it.

I was thinking of moving to hawaii or some other country. I live in California if that helps. Idk about moving. Idk even know much about gangs.

Honestly it's more like three crimes I've committed. The first crime was downloading and to a much lesser extent redistributing cp from tor. The second was  stealing about $5500. The third one was welfare fraud. I never got cought over these things by the cops but people know.

I've been wanting to return the money but I don't know how. I don't think I can go to the cops and give it to them. I think the police will keep it. It's cuz I stole from hundreds of people small amounts so it'll be hard to return and verify how much someone lost.

Some who got money taken from know I did it. Others have no idea. If I try to return it I'm going to get so much hate in my face.

Yeah. My first crime is why I can't come clean. You know what happens to those sorts of people. I'm a weakling too. There's guys who've had extremely painful deaths in prison for that.

Yeah it's like I'm standing on some tower that i kept building and building. When I was young I could've jumped off and just gotten a bruise. Now it's so big I don't want to jump off.

622,"Sorry in advance, im on mobile and typing this on my break at work. My little brother is 7 and loves to do his nails and wear dresses. He asked for nailpolish for Christmas bc everyone is always doing their nails and my mom won't let him join in. I understand where she's coming from, she used to let him paint his nails with us a few years ago but he got bullied for it from his class and his friends parents kept calling him a q*eer and f*ggot and other things. I've argues with a lot of grown ass men about how they are treating a goddamn 7 year old. It hurt my brother alot so mom keeps trying to force him to be a ""normal little boy"" which i disagree with.  We're quarantined right now and he's not seeing anyone but she still won't let him paint his nails she says its because letting him do it now but making him stop when he goes back to school is mean but he's already said he only wants to paint his toes when he goes to school because of what his friends will think. My mom and I have a few disagreements about how to go about my little brother. He doesn't have very many friends (he has one who likes to force him to do things)  and is bullied in school alot. I've suggested maybe changing schools, or talking to the school about changing his teacher bc his doesn't do anything about it but mom says he needs to tough it out and be a ""real boy"". I feel like her forcing all of this is just going to cause issues in him later in life.

We found an apartment in a city 2 hours from our town so he could get a new start and get back on track. Since then there has been ups and downs for him.

He hasnt got a job because i only wants to play videogames. So he cant afford food so i have to lend him money which he never gives back. He says that is it my job to do so because i have nice job.

I feel like i cant help him anymore and he doesnt want to be helped. Ive tried to talk to him about it many times but he always lies about everything.

629,"I am a 31 year old, who is in an established relationship with someone in the military. We live miles away from home and in an area that we both hate. I have the job of my dreams (physical therapist) but work in a hospital that I hate - possibly because of the general hate for the locality - but in an area of clinical speciality that I love. We are about to go through IVF - which I am over the moon about. 

I am unsettled. I don’t have any friends where I am - all of those who I have become really good friends with have led to us growing apart or huge fallouts. It has left me feeling lonely, isolated and like I’ve lost touch of who I am. I have no self confidence to go out there and do something new, as everything that has happened had led me to have a lot of paranoia that people won’t like me, or will then dislike me because of what others have done to me, and because I am now very self conscious and anxious. I used to be so outgoing, have lots of friends and never struggle to be “me” before I moved here. Now I hate who I am and find it easier to just not get involved. I never had any life problems until I moved to where I am now... it seems to be the same thing happening with one person, then the next and so on. It’s almost like where I live has a certain personality type that lives here... if that makes any sense at all? 

I have no savings yet - my ex left me in £17,000 in debt and I have almost paid it off (couple of payments left) then I will be able to save approximately £1,000 per month with no concerns once it’s paid off. I am not yet a homeowner and my fertility issues are hard to deal with. I feel like I’m having a bit of a mid life crisis. 

Any advice or pointers? Any one who has any experience in this kind of situation? And how did you manage? 

Moving away is not an option - especially is fertility treatment works, I won’t deny my boyfriend the time with his baby ☺️

Any insight or help would be great ❤️

I work a job (not necessarily a bad one) but I hate it. I literally only work 10 hours a week and after each small shift I come home not wanting to do anything but lay around with a nihilistic outlook on life. It feels like I have the lowest tolerance ever for work. 

I try to play the piano and write everyday, but my job makes me feel super exhausted and fucks up my weekly schedule despite such little hours. I have no ambition for college or a job, and my parents don't understand why I'm having such a hard time being a wagie and balancing a job with school and my hobbies. I literally just want to play my piano and write for 7 hours a day than work ever again. 

Both of my parents are hard workers and tough on me about being independent without complete backing from both my parents. I thought maybe their hardworking attitudes would have passed down to me, but I guess not.

648,"I could really use some support right now. I don’t think I have ever felt this way, physically or emotionally. I’m going to give you guys a little bit of backstory about myself so that may be it helps you get into my perspective better. Thank you I had a time for taking the time out of your day to read this and potentially give me some advice on what to do. 

     About 11 years ago my daughters mother began cheating on me right after we had my daughter. I for gave her the first two times and she actually had me believing it was my fault because I should be giving her more attention than our infant daughter. I was so how about I’m not giving our little girl a broken home that I probably would’ve kept forgiving her even after that but she chose to leave me. It was a rough break up she wouldn’t let me see our daughter for a while and it destroyed me and I began using drugs to help cope. Later on that year I was arrested and charged with Possession with intent to deliver because of the amount I had even though it was for personal use.  I did get a light sentence though but unfortunately the felony would stick. Has any of you with a felony know it makes it brutal to find a good job. I did find a job and while it wasn’t the best paying job whenever I need the extra money I can always get extra hours there. 

     Let’s  fast forward to about five years after I got out of jail. Things are going good still working I got off probation without an entire hiccup the whole time. I’m five years clean at that point and I’m pretty happy with my life. I was seeing my daughter during most of this time. About a year after I got out of jail her mother began to let me see her. By this time I had a very close relationship with my little one and I also met somebody else who at the time we didn’t realize it but she would’ve been about a month pregnant. We found out together maybe another month later and when she went to tell her ex-boyfriend about it he made it very clear he did not want anything to do with his child. It crushed me because of what I had been through with my child and how badly I wanted to see her and couldn’t for the longest time. So I made it clear to her that I wasn’t leaving her over something like that. Over the next eight months, we grew incredibly close and I was just as excited as if her child was my own. I have been helping her raise her ever since. As of today I can confidently tell you guys but I have two little girls and I love both of them the same regardless if one is biological and one isn’t.  

     Let us fast forward again to about 4 months ago. My biological child’s mother, for whatever reason, thought that it would be a good time for us to get back together. I don’t know where she got the idea from or what in the world would make her think I would ever leave my fiancé. I politely declined and told her that I am happy where I’m at.

     Now is where all my stress comes in. The job I have I typically work 60 hours a week and it pays my bills, gets groceries, pays child support, and leaves me with a little extra. Now I used to be able to take care of all that with 45 hours a week. My child support went up a little over a year ago and I had to increase my hours to 60. Well after I told her I was happy where I was she told me I wasn’t gonna be happy for long and ended up taking me back for more child support again. They really worked out in her favor this time because she made next to nothing this year. They go by a percentage system and I made like 89% to her 11%. I tried explaining to them that I wasn’t going to be able to do this but I’m already working 60 hours a week and they really didn’t care to hear it. Let me make it clear that I truly do not mind paying child support I’m happy to take care of my child and I’m not here complaining about paying because I was paying more than anyone I knew and literally 8 times more than my fiancé’s ex boyfriend was paying. So for the past three months to continue paying my bills and the enormous increase on my child support I have worked 90 hours a week. I work seven in the morning till 11 at night every day except for Sunday. I am absolutely drained and I think I’m going to have a breakdown. I have never felt so unhealthy. I get chest pains, really bad stomach pains, I am always dehydrated no matter how much I drink. A couple months ago I had to replace the motor to my car so I dropped my medical coverage and I have not renewed yet so I don’t want to go to see a doctor. A few weeks ago my transmission went on the car my girlfriend uses so I used with money I had to take care of that and now I’m in a position where I have not gotten them any sort of Christmas presents. This is all killing me inside I feel like the worst kind of failure. And 11 years ago when I was addicted to drugs and going to jail I thought that would be rock bottom but this is definitely worse than that because at least then it felt like the only person being punished was me. I was supposed to have a job lined up today that would have given me an extra $500 upfront even though it would have required me to work a couple days in the next month or so. However they backed out due to some financial problems of their own. I don’t hold it against them I just really question all the bad things that of happened to me. I could really use a friend or some advice on what you guys would do in my situation because I’m so close to just giving up at this point.",20Dec2020,1

Title is exactly what it says. This is the same friend I was talking about in a previous post. My friend and I got to talking yesterday. We have been best friends for years now. Yesterday we reflected upon our friendship and they told me they felt like a bad friend and a bad girlfriend to their boyfriend. To the point that they felt like they needed to be away from me and also break it off with their SO. I reassured them that they were a good friend to me. They kept saying “I just feel like eventually you’ll see the real me and you’ll leave. I want to be your friend but knowing I’m bad and keeping you, wouldn’t that make me worse? Like not doing what’s best for you?” 

I explained to them I had the intelligence to know if I’m being used or mistreated and never felt that way by them. Have they hurt me? Yes, but through things they can’t control like their depression. I’ve told them it’s stuff I have to work on. Like when they disappear for a month, it’s on me to work through my anxiety about it. 

I explained to them that we have been both good and bad people because we are people—humans make mistakes.

my dad seems to think all people online are pedos and wont let me talk with them, he went through a period of blocking discord on the router so i couldnt message them unless i used my mobile data, as im getting older i want to visit them but my dad still doesnt know about them and im afraid of telling him as i dont want him to stop me from talking with them. even now when i bring it up he tells me that people online just want to use you for their own gain and dont care about you etc

even if im playing an online game like minecraft he thinks im playing with people who i am complete strangers with and threatens to block it if he catches me, i just want to talk and play with my friends in peace, right now im just lying to him and saying im playing with school friends but even then he is sus of me.

ive known the two friends for ages and ive seen their faces and heard them enough to know they arent pedos, they are both around my age by a few months and ive been through shit with them, one of them is planning to come to the same uni as me once we both are old enough

i dont really have any one else to go to because i dont live with my mum and my step mum figure isnt really close enough with me to have any control over my internet usage

should i never tell my dad or tell him when i get older, and if i did, how?",20Dec2020,1
657,"Buckle up people, this is gonna be a long ride.

Ok. So. I'm 19F, a sophomore in college. My family has never been poor, but we have struggled somewhat in the past. I work part-time at an independent bookstore to pitch in towards my college costs. My dad works at a company that specializes in luxury apartment renovations, etc. Eight months ago, he got a windfall in his dead uncle's will (he died of covid) and bought out one of the partners in the company (it's a general partnership thing). So now the three partners are my dad, an older guy who originally formed it with the guy my dad bought out, and a man I'll call Mohammed (35F).

Now, let's back up a bit. My roommate is one of my closest friends. We'll call her Amira. Amira comes from a well-off Arab family. When I first met her, I just dismissed her as a spoiled rich kid. She had maids to help her move into a college dorm room. She wears high heels to class every day, for Christ's sake! But of course, I got to know her, and she's a sweet, awesome person. I have gone to Amira's house, and I get along great with her parents. Now, she has four older brothers and I've only met the brother closest to her in age, because she and that brother (we'll call him Ahmed) are the only ones still living with her parents. She mentioned her other brothers sometimes, and I did know that her oldest brother's name was Mohammed, but I never connected it to my dad's new partner, because it's obviously a common name.

So, after my dad became a partner at the company, things were financially better for us. About a month after he became partner, he suggested that I do some secretarial type work for him. The bookstore I worked at had closed due to coronavirus, so why not?  I also knew he was proud that he finally had like a legacy for my sister and I? But my sister was uninterested, and I knew how much it meant to him, so I started working there on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays after school. My classes had gone virtual, so things were a little more flexible. That's when it all started.

Part of my 'job' was taking notes in meetings. Pretty standard. I had never really gotten to know Mohammed during those meetings, but I found that I was starting to look forward to seeing him. He's quiet and intense, a lot of employees think he's a hard-ass or whatever. But he was always very nice to me, and we had a kind of instant rapport. He's also a total nerd, like me, which doesn't really fit with his uptight businessman persona. I'm studying economics, and he was always eager to hear my viewpoint about certain things. My dad must have noticed, because he asked me if anything was going on between us. I was shocked, and said no, because at that time, there wasn't! I genuinely thought he saw me as a kid. My dad said ok, and warned me that he was too old for me. I kind of laughed it off, but I felt awkward around Mohammed for a little bit after that.

Things were normal for a few months. Then, Amira asked me to go have dinner with her at her parents' house. She said all her brothers would be there. I said ok and thought nothing of it (it was socially distanced and they have an outdoor area). We get to her parents' house, and she introduces Mohammed as her eldest brother. Yeahhh. I had a nice time, but there were some obvious moments of flirtation with him. Amira started to tease me that I had a crush on her brother, and I realized that I was really starting to develop feelings for him. But I shoved the feelings down where the sun don't shine, because the situation wasn't exactly conducive to a relationship.

About two weeks after the dinner, I went out to lunch with Mohammed. My dad was on a work trip (I honestly wouldn't have gone out to lunch if he had been there). The lunch was... well, he ended up kissing me outside the restaurant. I was thrilled, but then everything hit me- Amira, my dad, our age gap. I asked him what he wanted and he said he wanted whatever I was comfortable with. I brought up my concerns to him, and he didn't think any of it was a problem. He admitted that he was worried about what my dad would say, and he'd never want to disrespect him, but he really liked me and said that he could see us together. I said that I had to think about it, and he said he didn't want to rush me. That was three days ago, and I have no idea what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated.",20Dec2020,1
659,"So, I’m gonna make this some what short. I was on Omegle doing some Predator Hunting (I’m 21, Male) and I came across this guy who said Gender, so being the Predator Hunter I am, I said F (For Female) I said I was also 15. He said he will show me his cock then I show him my tit’s. Before I could decline to try a different approach he puts his cock in front of the cam and starts jerking off. I then told him “Why the fuck would you show a 15 year old your dick your sick” (I’m 21 but posed as a 15 year old) He then exited the video. He used his voice not the chat. Is there anyway I can report this as is is absolutely sick. What happens if a actual 15 year old was on their. Any advice would be welcome.

660,"I could really use some support right now. I don’t think I have ever felt this way, physically or emotionally. I’m going to give you guys a little bit of backstory about myself so that may be it helps you get into my perspective better. Thank you I had a time for taking the time out of your day to read this and potentially give me some advice on what to do. 

     About 11 years ago my daughters mother began cheating on me right after we had my daughter. I for gave her the first two times and she actually had me believing it was my fault because I should be giving her more attention than our infant daughter. I was so how about I’m not giving our little girl a broken home that I probably would’ve kept forgiving her even after that but she chose to leave me. It was a rough break up she wouldn’t let me see our daughter for a while and it destroyed me and I began using drugs to help cope. Later on that year I was arrested and charged with Possession with intent to deliver because of the amount I had even though it was for personal use.  I did get a light sentence though but unfortunately the felony would stick. Has any of you with a felony know it makes it brutal to find a good job. I did find a job and while it wasn’t the best paying job whenever I need the extra money I can always get extra hours there. 

     Let’s  fast forward to about five years after I got out of jail. Things are going good still working I got off probation without an entire hiccup the whole time. I’m five years clean at that point and I’m pretty happy with my life. I was seeing my daughter during most of this time. About a year after I got out of jail her mother began to let me see her. By this time I had a very close relationship with my little one and I also met somebody else who at the time we didn’t realize it but she would’ve been about a month pregnant. We found out together maybe another month later and when she went to tell her ex-boyfriend about it he made it very clear he did not want anything to do with his child. It crushed me because of what I had been through with my child and how badly I wanted to see her and couldn’t for the longest time. So I made it clear to her that I wasn’t leaving her over something like that. Over the next eight months, we grew incredibly close and I was just as excited as if her child was my own. I have been helping her raise her ever since. As of today I can confidently tell you guys but I have two little girls and I love both of them the same regardless if one is biological and one isn’t.  

     Let us fast forward again to about 4 months ago. My biological child’s mother, for whatever reason, thought that it would be a good time for us to get back together. I don’t know where she got the idea from or what in the world would make her think I would ever leave my fiancé. I politely declined and told her that I am happy where I’m at.

     Now is where all my stress comes in. The job I have I typically work 60 hours a week and it pays my bills, gets groceries, pays child support, and leaves me with a little extra. Now I used to be able to take care of all that with 45 hours a week. My child support went up a little over a year ago and I had to increase my hours to 60. Well after I told her I was happy where I was she told me I wasn’t gonna be happy for long and ended up taking me back for more child support again. They really worked out in her favor this time because she made next to nothing this year. They go by a percentage system and I made like 89% to her 11%. I tried explaining to them that I wasn’t going to be able to do this but I’m already working 60 hours a week and they really didn’t care to hear it. Let me make it clear that I truly do not mind paying child support I’m happy to take care of my child and I’m not here complaining about paying because I was paying more than anyone I knew and literally 8 times more than my fiancé’s ex boyfriend was paying. So for the past three months to continue paying my bills and the enormous increase on my child support I have worked 90 hours a week. I work seven in the morning till 11 at night every day except for Sunday. I am absolutely drained and I think I’m going to have a breakdown. I have never felt so unhealthy. I get chest pains, really bad stomach pains, I am always dehydrated no matter how much I drink. A couple months ago I had to replace the motor to my car so I dropped my medical coverage and I have not renewed yet so I don’t want to go to see a doctor. A few weeks ago my transmission went on the car my girlfriend uses so I used with money I had to take care of that and now I’m in a position where I have not gotten them any sort of Christmas presents. This is all killing me inside I feel like the worst kind of failure. And 11 years ago when I was addicted to drugs and going to jail I thought that would be rock bottom but this is definitely worse than that because at least then it felt like the only person being punished was me. I was supposed to have a job lined up today that would have given me an extra $500 upfront even though it would have required me to work a couple days in the next month or so. However they backed out due to some financial problems of their own. I don’t hold it against them I just really question all the bad things that of happened to me. I could really use a friend or some advice on what you guys would do in my situation because I’m so close to just giving up at this point.",20Dec2020,1

Background story:

So me and my friends and this one girl all met through the same hobby. I’ve known the boys for 7 years ish, and her for 5. 

This summer she broke up with her bf of 3 years and 3 month after they broke up me and her hit it off. Now idk if she was ever interested in more than fwb, but i told her i enjoyed spending time with her but not as partners because i thought we were bit too different. She Got really sad first but then accepted it i guess?

We continued on having sex etc. But she did all kinda stuff such as asking me if i wanted to eat with her and parents + she gave me a toothbrush and a small place in her closet to have some of my things apparently. She also told me that i was the 2nd guy she have been with and she won’t have sex with anyone else.

Like, to sum up she did so many things i’ve never had a fwb type of thing do to me. I think when she figured out i still slept with other girls (because she asked me directly, and we hadn’t talked about exclusivity) and that we wasn’t exclusive, that she couldn’t change my mind.

Now i don’t say she wanted more or was in love with me... but i highly doubt she wasn’t, because everyone told us to just make it official even though i didn’t want to, but she wasn’t bothered by people saying it *at all*. 

I haven’t talked to her for months and she asked me many times why i wasn’t joining any parties we both was invited to, but i was either always busy or thought i didn’t wanted to meet her, cause she weirded me out (my 3 other friends participated in those parties btw)

—————————————————————————————

So, to the actual post:

She’s hosting a NYE party for ~40 people (i found her immature as Well, because stuff like This... you can’t host parties more than 10 people you’ll get a huge fine in my country, cause rona). Well, i know none of us would probably go, but all 3 guys mentioned it yesterday, and none of us is invited. It doesn’t bother me at all, but it was obvious that They were. A LOT. They were super annoyed by it and blamed me for it. They said that it was my fault. 

I see 2 perspectives of This: she didn’t want to invite me, and couldn’t invite the 3 other dudes without me, and cut us all... then i could accept the blame ig?

Buuuut they’re friends with her as well. If they’d a strong enough friendship with her, wouldn’t they just be invited anyway?

Idk guys, idc about being invited or not to her party, i just want to enjoy the time with the boys instead, but it’s getting annoying, and they’re getting on my nerve. So even tho i don’t Care i suddenly do. Is it ok for Them to be mad at me or are They unreasonable?",20Dec2020,1
663,"So my brother has pretty severe autism and some extra info thats important to the situation is he's technically my half brother and my parents normally only have him every other weekend but he used to live with us all the time and now my parents have him for 6 months straight and I have moved out but I visit every Sunday to take him out somewhere just to get him some kind of stimulation



So my brother has some issues expressing anger or irritation when he gets mad he dosnt rly do anything at first he just has this look on his face and I can tell but my parents can't, and then he just explodes and he either bites himself or gets aggressive. and he has quirks like he dosnt like certain textures or he dosnt like his food to touch and he dosnt like it when u over manage his food over top of him (like cutting his steak) and a bunch of weird things like that 


So today we got olive garden to go and they gave him a breadstick which got butter and crumbs on his fingers and I noticed he had the look so I identified the problem and cleaned his hands then my mom put his broccoli on top of his pasta and strated cutting the pasta up over top of him and he had an outburst and my mom does NOT like it when I point out how much she has forgotten just mentioning his quirks she gets defensive and says I know my son and I believe her but she just isn't listening",20Dec2020,1

I want to text him to ask about returning the game because honestly i just want to see him one last time but i don’t want to come off as weird or clingy seeing as he hasn’t reached out to me at all. Should i just forget about it and keep the game until he asks about it? What if he never asks about it? The thought of never seeing him again makes me kind of sad.,20Dec2020,1
666,"6 years agoI fell in love with a girl who helped me through some of the toughest time of my life, then she broke my heart... took me 3 years of torment to recover from that tail spin... I’m healed and never been this happy since the beginning of my puberty. I’ve been content and satisfied with my life for the past two years now, so I’m sure it’s not a manic episode of depression. I’ve worked with my emotion and picked myself up. I tried to date a couple of girls I was attracted to, but I don’t feel infatuated and I feel like I lost my ability to love. I admit I was numb devoid of any feelings (empathy for ex.) back when she left me but I’m worried about my personality, behavior.

668,"This is complicated but I'll (22F) try to keep it simple.

Mom via messaging app: ""I just deposited some money in your bank account. Merry Christmas! We love you!""

I have four problems with this. The first is that ""we"" refers to her and my father. My father abused me literally my whole life until age 18. He also abuses my mom. I've been NC with him for about 2.5 years.

The second problem is that I have spoken to her very little over the past year or so. In the time since going NC with father, she has almost constantly pressured me to speak to him. I've repeatedly told her I will not. Yet even in this message, she manages to include him. In the past, I replied ""I love you too, Mom."" to emphasize that I don't love my abuser. She has clearly not gotten the hint.

My third problem is that she put $500 in my account after taking me off her health insurance and revoking all financial support in September, after I demonstrated that she could not control me. While I'm grateful for the money, I feel that it demonstrates manipulative intent. She is trying to force me to talk to her.

The fourth problem came to light two days after she put the money in my account. She texted me on a different platform to say: ""I sent you a message in messenger but you haven't looked at it so I figured I would send you a text to prod you lol. I love you!""

Literally saying: *I expect a grateful response from you. I am not giving out of the kindness of my heart. I am doing this to force you to talk to me.*

How do I stop this? What do I say? I need advice please.",20Dec2020,1

Usually when people are having trouble with life/dating/etc...other people might give the advise ""work on yourself"". While I agree this is sound advise what do you do when you've done a ton of leg work and still find yourself not having the social life you feel like you deserve?

Little background, 28 years old, solid career, have my own apartment, eat healthy, work out often, do biofeedback (westernized meditation) everyday, sleep well, keep my house and car clean, dress nice, pretty far into starting my own business, and I'm very good looking (Writing that last one felt so narcissistic but I need to give you an honest background)

On top of this I feel as though I have a great playful personality. I strike up conversations with strangers often as I enjoy it and most the time the other party seems to enjoy the conversation as well. Even at 28 I make friends with other guys that I don't even work with. I don't get nervous approaching women even when sober and actually look forward to it.

Ok so what the malfunction? I almost NEVER anyone's priority. Even though I go on dates, have sex, and even have relationships with woman, I'm never ever ever pursued. I have to carry the conversation. I have to set up every time I get together with someone. I get the ""I'm busy"" or even just straight up ghosted all the time.

Basically for both my guy friends and with woman if i stopped putting in effort today I would never hear from anyone ever again. I have several guy friends who throw my name around as their best friend but only one who actually makes any effort.

I have no way to prove this to you but I swear I'm not just some nice boring guy nor am I socially anxious. Any social event I go to I always look forward to even when I don't know many people there. When I go out with a group of guy friends I'm always the one to cold approach a group of girls, chat them up and the bring them over to our table. I can do this sober no problem.

I live in an area where due to Covid we aren't supposed to gather with anyone outside our immediate households.

BUT because my parents are retired and don't go anywhere but the grocery store I have been going to visit them with my baby on occasion for the sake of my mental health. My sister also goes to my parents house with her kids because she occasionally needs my parents to babysit while she takes one of her daughters to medical appts. 

So we are basically in a ""bubble"" of 10 people who are ""exclusive"". We have shut out visits with my inlaws so that we maintain our small contact circle. Which has caused some tension because they are also not going anywhere and are not seemingly a risk to us. But my sister is uncomfortable with ""outsiders"" in the ""bubble"" so we are not seeing them to respect my sisters wishes.

Also my mom's mom and my dad's mom both passed away this year in Jan and Feb right before Covid hit so this is the first Christmas without their moms. So obviously a bitersweet day.

Cut to Christmas: I have decided to just stay home for Christmas. Even though technically we can go to my parents house (because we have been regularly seeing them so no added risk) I dont want to because it will be unfair to my inlaws. Safer for everyone's feelings to stay home.

My sister is angry with me because she says it's my parents first Christmas without their moms so I should go see them so they aren't alone. When I asked why she wasnt going to their house she said it was because she wants a quiet Christmas at home with her kids because their Christmases are usually very busy with family stuff so they're using Covid as an excuse to stay home.

For one reason or another, I haven't got around to drawing in years; i'm so rusty. Suddenly having the desire again, I pulled out my old sketchbook and while trying to find a blank page, I found myself reminiscing over past drawings. A couple had even won me 3rd place in a high school competition.

I Reported Someone for some blatant sexism, racism and gender bias and now its affecting their health.

Backstory.... Two people whom i work with when they get together are racist (to people who arent male, american speaking only english with no accent), homophobic (to a rather lovely trans woman), and sexist (to a few of the women that come into our place of employment).

Theyve made comments before, but they were overly rude and discriminatory to one person in particular, and when i came forward to both these individuals and asked them to stop, they brushed me off like it didnt matter.

This is a temp job for me until my baby is born and then my life is going to drastically change and i probably wont return (im trying to be anonymous).
So reporting these two individuals to the HR office was a step i thought I had to take.

Now my advice is how do i process seeing the actual responses in one particular person first hand? Hes having some high blood pressure issues and genuinely feels contrite and has apologized (its not hard to know who reported them both) to me several times.

How do i deal with this? The person that has apologized is not the person that was making comments... It was another and he just kind of went along with the narrative.

682,"I’ve been friends with her for about 6 years now. We are both 24. I love her dearly and consider her to be my best friend. 

The issue is that her behavior is out of control. She’s done similar things in the past but it’s been getting consistently worse over the past 3 months or so. I’ve never seen her this bad. 

A month ago she randomly decided to fly across the country to be with her ex, who is a manipulative and emotionally abusive individual. I had advised her against it, warning her that he might seem like a better person now but when she arrives, his behavior will likely change and he will go back to his old ways. She didn’t listen to me. She used up the last bit of money she had to pay her baggage fees. I was worried she would get stuck in an unfamiliar place where she doesn’t know anyone who could help her if she needed it with no way to get back. Sure enough, that’s exactly what happened. Everything I was concerned about came to fruition. 

Once she returned home I thought that situation might be a wake up call for her and cause her to realize she is not living in a healthy way. Nope. She still drinks and abuses street Xanax every night, often mixing the two, which could potentially be life threatening. She can’t hold down a job. She is always going off with strange men she doesn’t know well. Our city is ranked within the top ten in the nation for human trafficking activity and I worry that one day she will get into the wrong car with the wrong person. 

She has no idea what’s going on because she is always intoxicated and is incredibly unaware of her surroundings and the passage of time. I will make plans with her only for her to show up many hours later, intoxicated, driven by a stranger. 

She is such an intellectually gifted person. She is very close to completing her physics degree and works very hard at her classes, but has absolutely zero discipline in the other areas of her life. I don’t understand how someone so intelligent can’t see how they are actively destroying their future. I think in a way she is aware but refuses to accept that she needs to change her ways. It seems like she is constantly trying to convince others (and herself) that her actions are acceptable given her situation and upbringing. She is so completely ruled by her emotions that she can’t see the forest for the trees. 

She does have mental health issues, and I do as well, but she can’t/won’t work on it because coping with drugs and sex is easier than doing the often hard and uncomfortable work of improving one’s mental health. She has seen therapists and psychiatrists, she has been medicated and institutionalized, but nothing seems to take. The doctors aren’t sure what to make of her; some think she has bipolar disorder, others think she has borderline personality disorder or a psychotic disorder. 

I’m not angry with her but I am very frustrated. Everyday I worry that I will get a phone call that she is dead or missing. I’m not sure how to discuss this situation with her in a compassionate yet firm manner. It’s unbearable to witness the bright, kind, and beautiful person I know and love do this to themselves. I worry that I will let my emotions get the best of me and end up offending her. I don’t know what I can do to help her. 

TLDR: my friend has mental health and substance abuse issues and can’t help herself. I’m not sure how to have an honest discussion with her about her lifestyle.",20Dec2020,1
683,"So I'm sure many of you are in a similar situation, but I'm home with my family who I try to avoid because they add to my stress level. They are very verbally abusive and try to make me feel guilty about many things from the guys I have dated in to past to petty things like using too many towels or drinking too much of their bottled water while I'm home. They always look for the smallest things to attack me or find blame. For example, when I'm not home with them, my grandmother calls me every single day, multiple times a day. Even though I live alone and I go to medical school. She use to complain that I stress her out if I don't answer the call and blame me for causing her stress on her heart because I didn't answer the phone. My mother would message me saying that I'm going to give her a heart attack, or that I'm a terrible daughter, or that I do everything wrong. I couldn't even go on dates or be with friends, without having to leave and take the call.  They are both extremely controlling, and try to make it seem like I'm always the one doing everything wrong.  When i try to set boundaries, they get very vindictive and threaten me. 

&amp;#x200B;

This give you some backstory. Now, I've been stressed out with school and my own problems. It's hard being home, and I can't even talk to my family about being anxious/stressed about school, without them using what I say to attack me or call me competent or worthless. Even time I confided in my grandmother about things in my life, she would use it as ammo in an argument to hurt me. Even calling me a  slut because I dated one guy for several years although I stayed very true to my values and we didn't even have sex. They use every single small things against me to make me feel devalued. Even now, my grandmother compares me to my mother who is working a low-paying job, never married,  and lives at home. She says well at least my mother has a job....well I'm working to become a physician, which is a arduous journey. I don't feel like there is even a comparison, and I will have a much brighter future than my mother will ever have.  I never hear that they are proud of me.  All they say is that I will never make it, never get the career I want, never find a man who will loves me. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, I know I should let all this worry me. I'm proud of my accomplishments and of myself.  I'm a very tenacious individual, and I will work very hard for what I want in life. I have values for myself, and I have self-respect. Although it is hard sometimes to just ignore what my family says, because of course I want their support and love. Especially when I'm home with them 24/7, it's hard to ignore everything and pretend that I'm okay.  I'm very strong mentally, but sometimes you just need someone to give you a hug or say something positive.  I know having resentment towards my family will only cause me more grief and depression. I wish things were better, and I know I deserve much better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I try to talk to my friends about this situation, but I don't think they fully understand. They never experienced a truly toxic family. I know no family is perfect, and everyone argues at times. Now that I'm older, I realized that my family is far from normal and abusive.",20Dec2020,1
684,"Sorry, my English isn’t very good since everything is a bit hazy right now.

I will refer to my friend who is 16M, ‘M’.

I was sexually assaulted by another friend in our friend group. I have not confronted them yet and I plan to cut them off once I finish my schooling. During the school camp, I opened up to M about how I was assaulted and he was very sympathetic. I told him to not reveal it to anyone yet without my permission. He agreed.

After the camp, he went on to tell his mother and another friend. It was very upsetting, but I kept my cool about it. I then tried to assure my decision to him the next time we met; I told him that I did not want my situation to be shared and to ask me for permission first and he agreed. 

However, this week M told 2 people about it. I was furious. I explicitly said that I was upset, and I told him many times that I did not want him to tell others about the information that I trusted him with. He apologised deeply, but his excuses were; “I didn’t state your name so they don’t know” and another excuse was “I didn’t exactly say it was sexual assault. I said they touched you inappropriately without consent” which baffles me because he basically told them I was sexually assaulted. 

After calling him out on his behaviour, he left me on read and left every group chat in every platform and I’m worried that my friends will ask if he’s okay, and he’ll vent about it and victimise himself while revealing that I was the one that was assaulted. 

What can I do at this point? It feels like the situation will continue to worsen even more. How can I keep the information in secret without him talking about it more with other people??",20Dec2020,1

688,"We're all 15/16 and I hugely messed up.

Monday:

It's kinda been building up the past few months all the shit I've said and done and on Monday I whispered to my friend something about a girl we'll call M had paint on her fingers while eating. My friend F was feeling ill so she wasn't as happy as she normally is and I kinda felt as if the whole group hated me but they didn't. So that's why I whispered that to E. My friend R asked loudly what I whispered and I just told them and M, R asked why I had to whisper it and I just didn't want to embarrass her in front of the whole group. After school, me and M had a bit of an argument, I went to the shops and I didn't have data anymore so i called A and I kinda trashtalked M to A, and said she overreacted, after the convo, I also talked about Z, a girl I felt judged me and would tell my personal stuff to her closest friend. I told A not to mention this conversation to anybody  I got home and M and myself sorted it out, and I messaged A saying she didn't overreact at all and I was just being stupid. 

Tuesday:  
 the whole day goes great and we're all getting along really well until G tells me A told M what I said to her but M just brushed it off and didn't want another argument so she never brang it up with me, so I wanted to address it but I didn't.

Wednesday:

I told E, M, F that A told M what I said,At the end of Lunch, I asked A if she would come to my homeroom early with me and she said no so i Jokingly said I have to speak with her, F and R assumed it was about her telling M so they came along. I didn't talk about it we just had fun at my homeroom, E, Z, M, G were just sat at the table after we left for homeroom and decided to go to the toilets, which is where E told M that i told her what A did. M was quite upset with me because I kept dragging the situation and came up to me in Homeroom and said it. I stupidly said to A who was infront of me, I told you not to tell her. And everyone else just left homeroom and M and i texted over phone and I just apologised and she just said we're going in circles and this is getting tiring. before my last period, I came up to M and we talked about it and I said see you later. All of my friend group had the same class which is where everything I've pretty much ever said came out. I didn't know this of course and when walking home, I wanted to speak to M but she said we'll all have a conversation tomorrow as a whole group and I said I didn't want that because it'd feel like a ''telling off'' because whenever there is an argument it's always everyone versus me because I'm problematic.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks prior:

. How I said to F that the reason K and I=R get along is because they've been through the same stuff and can relate to each other because they're both, well poor. When I told this to I she took it with a pinch of salt but she was upset about the fact I went and talked about it to F  


. When G wasn't here for 2 weeks self-isolating, M confided in me with her mental health and how she was feeling, I could've just asked G how to respond and stuff but I was on a call with R and i copy and pasted the whole conversation and i said it felt wrong but I still did it - I did it so we would know just to kind of include her more and I didn't have any malice intent.  


. i was on a call with R and I said everyone in our group is naturally pretty but the prettiest are (and i then named the prettiest) - I did this because they also talked about everyone being pretty but the difference was I kind of ranked them and didn't include everyone.   


A few months prior:

. Some other stupid shit i've said like saying F has a funny smile or that I think G is a lesbian, I didn't know E had anxiety and always pointed our her rubbing her leg (not infront of anyone) and I liked F's boyfriend and I jokingly talked about how i'd suck his dick infront of her and I talked to R and F how I've liked every single one of their exes.  


. Saying A and Z aren't true muslims because they don't wear the hijab, they swear, and have boyfriends. I used it as a counter argument because they said they couldn't support homosexuality because of their religion, and said gay people can't be muslims. 

. With the call with A, the reason I said I didn't feel like me and Z were friends was because we never addressed the what I thought was an argument about how I said I didn't like pakistan because gay people have no rights and women aren't treated equally, she took it as me being racist and we kinda argued over it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday;   


I could tell something was up by how everyone acted, they knew everything I said about them but they still acted quite-less-than-normal. I knew the group wanted to have a conversation so when I had a class, I told G I feel really left out today and G said well maybe it's because some stuff you've said and just said that some stuff i've said has been brought up and people know, I went quiet and felt horrible and I had english class and A, E and M sat away from me but E did say hi to make me feel a bit better. Next class, I had geography and I confided to one of my friends outside the friendship group briefly that I chatted shit about everyone and they're not the happiest with me and that IDK what to do, he said I should bring it up at lunchtime so I did. Lunch : I brang it up and most people said their piece and I sat, agreed, and felt remorse about how I acted, I tried to say sorry but I just couldn't get it out of my mouth because it was just so awkward. I went to homeroom and sat and cried and said sorry to M and G.  In my last lesson, in the friendship group chat I typed a long ass apology paragraph about how I made everyone feel and how sorry i am because I didn't know if i was going to see anybody else  and I didn't want to leave it until the last day of semester and I wanted to plan it out, and say what I wanted to say because it was long and i would've felt really awkward doing it in person, it didn't go so well and R and K were really pissed at me so I apologised to K in dms and she said she hopes it was genuine ; which I said it was. R said that she'd rather speak about this in person. So at the end of the day I come with them and I speak to R what happened and she just tells me how pissed of she is and I try to apologise but to no avail. 

Friday: 

&amp;#x200B;

They ignored me all day and I felt so shit, at the end of the day I texted the GC saying have a good break guys and R said fuck off you twat, and I just ignored it cause I didn't want more drama. After school, K gets drunk and brings it up in the GC and everyone's hardcore going at me while I'm just apologising and R and other people say I'm just being manipulative in all of my paragraphs and this isn't the first time this has happened and that I make them feel disgusting, that I'm toxic etc, how shit I've made everyone feel because everyone has confided with me at something for one point and they've worried if i told anyone else ( I didn't ) and K says how I've been friends with her for 10 years and this girl called L which she fell out with over the exact same situation but worse. and I've seen her and everything at her worst and how she attempted...stuff twice and how shit I made her feel, so I just kept apologising but they think I don't care and I'm being manipulative. I don't blame them because of everything I've done. Z and M suggest I just distance myself for a while from the group while R and A blatantly say  they will never speak to me and will not be friends with me again. All of the stuff gets brought up which I'm slandered for and basically like 60% of the boys in my year don't like me because i'm either gay/chat shit about people/ horrible and R and F have had fall outs with people defending me. After I left the GC i felt so bad because of what I done and i thought they were all going to post about me and when I go back to school i'd have a group wanting to beat me up and I'm a coward. But they said they won't be mean/talk or expose my secrets because they wont stoop to my level 

Saturday: 

I saw K took me off her private story and i asked D who was on it to just keep watch if anyone posts about me and I just reminded her throughout the day kinda, and I asked this other girl i'm quite close to if i can chill with their group but I accidentally sent it to D - who i'm not that close with. D later sends a voice note to K about it and K misheard it and thought I made them out to be in the wrong, so I get readded to the GC and this all starts again and they asked me why I told D what happened (i didnt tell her in detail, just how i fucked up and stuff) and I ask can I leave and they say no and then we keep talking and how i'm sociopathic and this, more stuff gets brought up how I said G is a lesbian. it was F's birthday earlier this week and we all went round her house and it turns out they've all been feeling like this for months because F told R she thinks I'd judge her house and think she's lesbian because she listens to girl in red and R wanted to wear eyeliner but apparently i'd call her a lesbian. In the gc i talked about how I knew what I did was wrong but never thought twice about it and I did it to feel more important about myself and try to be funny and get closer to people by talking about others. We all end up on a discord chat and they all say their piece and say they never want to be friends with me again and that i'm disgusting and K talks about how me, K and L grew up together and L did all this to her back in march and she felt so shit and I've done this to her now and I've made everyone insecure and stuff I'm not proud of. R said if i really cared i would've begged to be friends with them but they said they didn't like me so I didn't want to make myself look stupider and beg for forgiveness because everyone just said I'm being manipulative. We then end the call and I remove all of them off discord, and leave every GC i'm in with them. 

Sunday : I've just been trying so hard to get my mind of things but I just can't get away from it, I have this pit feeling in my heart the whole day and I can't get rid of it, I anxiously check my phone every so often to see if anyone else posted about me/removed me off their privs but ( yesterday everyone said I'm worth their privs and K said if she was gonna post about me, she'd put me back on so I can see it, and the reason I asked D to check is because when L and everyone else fell out, K posted about L alot but I didn't know, I only found out during the argument because L kept posting about K, R said if she did post about me, they'd be people wanting to jump me and one of her (boy) friends who hate me sensed something happened and asked her but she didn't go over it in detail luckily and just said she can't believe she defended me and he said yeah I saw how I treated you guys.) nothing's happened and I just feel so anxious, worried and depressed and an hour ago I just sat sobbing because I was so close to everyone and they've all been there for me and were an amazing friendship group and I went and did this. All of my struggles i've told them and now i've lost 7 of the best people in my life. 

I'm hoping this gets better and I don't have to argue anymore but In 2 1/2 weeks I go back to school and I'm so worried and I sit next to them in every lesson and we all have mutual friends and I know they won't go round telling everyone but I am worried they will and i'll be hated by everyone.

I live with my bf and his mom and they’re both extroverted people where they’ll make conversation about anything and constantly have to fill in any silence. They can’t just relax and enjoy the silence and it’s getting exhausting for me. A lot of times they talk about random things and these stupid meaningless conversations about nothing don’t interest me. I find myself just being quiet around them most of the time just cause I don’t know what to say to them or just really don’t wanna participate in any conversation. 

And it’s not just with them it’s with friends and family too. Don’t get me wrong, I still keep in contact with the people I’m really close to and it’s not always where the conversation is exhausting but after a while I’ll start to feel like ok too much talking I’m done. 

Im sure my bf has noticed because at times we literally don’t talk to each other at all and it’s cause sometimes I’m not interested in what he has to say. He only ever talks about weed, or irrelevant things that I really don’t care about and I’ve talked to him about this before how I get bored easily and it’s always the same conversations.

696," Hello reddit,

My   life has had some crazy ups and downs, especially since the covid  pandemic. I'm a fairly decent guy with enough friends to keep me afloat  and a rewarding job, BUT I'm stuck with this feeling that I'm not good  enough, in literally anything, which is ironic since people tell me i'm  interesting, good looking,  wise, etc. Let me explain;

I'm  surrounded by good friends and have a big social circle but i always  feel like the background character - think of the friend who is always  walking behind the group rather than with the group, wants to be there  but is subconsciously not a part of it. I kind of, in a way, feel  jealous that the people around me can bond with each other better than I  can, I try to fit in, and maybe I do, but i just don't feel it. I've  been on and off medicine for mental health; anti-depressants for 2 years  and anti-psychotics for another (If this is even relevant). I'd  consider myself outgoing but who also enjoys ones company

In  social situations I get spoke over a lot, the women I've dated in my  past don't respect me (I know why, but the explanation would look  pathetic), as in I've been broken up with and cheated on so many times I  have given up on relationships entirely, which has made me quite  bitter. Even when it comes to expressing ones  thoughts/ideas, they just  get crapped all over. Just overall I don't seem to garner ""higher""  social approval. Just yesterday I saw a friend who I havn't seen in  about 3 months and I was getting up ready to shake his hand / give the  guy a hug and he just went and walked past me - I have learnt how  to look after myself in terms of hygiene, clothing choices, how I come  across  in social situations and this has taken a couple years to get  right, but my perception of how things are going for me, it all just  feels stagnant and like it's not going anywhere. Even in terms of  career, I have ideas on what i want to do but no solid direction to take  in regards to getting a career

The  silver-lining  of this situation is that I have no problems losing all my friends, as in, i would happily delete myself from everyone life via deactivating ALL social media and start over. I suppose the question would be,  
should I delete everything I have and start again? Or how do I  go about finding a career that I enjoy?",20Dec2020,1
697,"I’m (19F) and I want to drive so I’ve been practicing with my father for 6 months on separate days and all went smoothly and well, so my father decided I could drive in public roads so he can see if I’m can do everything correctly. 
Few weeks went by, my driving was OK didn’t make any accidents but I did make some mistakes, like, driving too fast on the road bumps and wrong positions and such small things like that. But there was days that the last 5 days has been the worst, it’s like I’ve forgotten everything and I almost crushed the car on the wall and I don’t recall seeing the wall any ways! The next thing I know that my body was really hot and my head pounding and my eye sight was blur for seconds and I managed to step on the brakes on time. It was like I went blind, then I went to highway, there was separate roads so father told me to go the 3rd one, I went to 4th road he got mad and yelled at me and told me what’s wrong with me these days like It’s the first time I’m driving.
Then on the same day I almost crushed two cars on different roads and my head was pounding again, I told my father to switch with me so he can drive instead of me but he got mad and said to continue, i didn’t insist so i continued driving feeling stupid and embarrassed until we returned home.
And I’ve been misspell words when I say it out loud or can’t say it at all, can’t focus for too long and I can’t tell what am I saying, like, I’m talking to someone online and they always say they don’t understand me and I forgot what I said so go check what I said and see that I’ve made a mess, a lot with misspellings and wrong grammar and word mispositions,
Should I seek medical help/go to psychiatric or it’s just normal thing everyone have been through it too?

700,"Hello r/Advice

My wife wants to try to start a relationship with her abusive step father as he is finally seeing the consequences of 20 years of domestic abuse and  manipulation.

Short over view is that I do not at all think he is a good person.

He's hit Her, Her two brothers and his now ex(thank fuck) girlfriend.
He stole a bunch of our baby's things and some of my computer stuff. He called the cops on us twice and lied to them both times, tried to get me fired after he couldn't get me to quit my job. He out my wife in the hospital and we could have lost our son (specifying it was due to stress and not because he hit her) 

He put a tracker on his sons car and constantly holds the car and everything else above everyone's heads. 

He tried to separate me from my own car by not letting me sell it and trying to take over and I'm convinced he stole my mail too. 

He more recently has put a hole in the wall of his ex girlfriends apartment and has been lying about me and my wife to the rest of his family he's also had several children with other women and is a master class manipulator who uses love bombing to leverage his outbursts. 


Today He and my wife called and talked and showed off our new baby ( side note he also called her an evil person and told her she doesn't deserve the kid and we very well could have lost him in that hospital room due to complications stress created )

I was absolutely uncomfortable with the situation and am still very upset. I do not trust him at all and I am absolutely certain he will harm our child. He's a raging alcoholic and text book narcissist I've tried getting a restraining order before but it fell through. 


My wife feels sorry that everyone else in his life took our example and left him. His life is falling apart and so is he mentally. I personally do not care. I feel like he's a shitty human being and that this new wave of ""I'm sorry I almost got your son killed and lied to the cops and stole a bunch of your shit because I couldn't control you"" is bullshit. I think he's doing exactly what he's always done and trying to lie and manipulate his way back into our lives just so he can have more people to abuse because this is the fourth time now My wife and him have done some shit like this. 

She keeps saying that things will be different and that she won't have the same relationship with him but I think that it will go that way again cause it has before and I'm very worried that he might put hands on my son. 

What do I do?",20Dec2020,1
701,"Hi there, I'm hoping someone out there has been in a similar situation and can share some advice. On Tuesday I have an interview for a role in a specific field related to healthcare. My two previous roles that I've listed on my resume since graduating college in 2018, which I each had for about a year, were healthcare-related but not in this specific field.  I actually did have one role for about 5 months in this niche field, but I left it off my resume since I quit 5 months after I started, which probably isn't a good look. 

The reason I quit was because this role was at a startup with the typical toxic techbro culture, except with the added layer of being healthcare-related. Basically, I was on the customer team supporting a product that DIDN'T WORK A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE TIME and was routinely required to perform tasks that are HIPAA violations. We were also treated like dirt compared to the engineers; we were allowed one 30 minute lunch break per day while engineers could come to work around 10 if they wanted and frequently took long lunches together. Everyone on the customer support team was unhappy about this once we caught on; we were all hired around the same time, which we later found out was because a large percentage of the support team quit together before we were hired. History repeated itself, and 6 of us on the 10 person team quit within a span of two weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I leave this experience off of my resume because I don't want to have to explain why I left since I feel I would need to bad mouth the terrible healthtech startup, even though it was in a niche industry that I now have this one interview in. Simply saying ""it wasn't a good fit"" or something like that I don't think is good enough since it just makes me look flakey for bailing after 5 months. The person interviewing me doesn't yet have my resume since my former boss (not at the startup) recommended me and it's been an informal process. Should I send him a revised resume with this experience on it, or can I leave it off but somehow still mention this relevant information during the interview?",20Dec2020,1
702,"My[18f] bf[19m] has been going on late night drives and hangouts with a girl friend of his without my knowing. This among other things has made me uncomfortable to the point where I’m not sure what to do anymore in the relationship. 

I’m sorry in advance for the formatting and everything... I’m not too familiar with reddit.
(Please lmk if this should be posted elsewhere) 

In the later years of high school, my bf and I would text before bed, and oftentimes he’d tell me that he was tired and was going to bed, only to be up late texting/calling/FaceTiming his girl friend until the early morning. And the only way I would find out wouldn’t be because he outright told me, but because I’d have to ask him why he slept so late, only to be met with vague responses like “idk I wasn’t doing much” until I pushed for a real answer. They saw each other a lot every day at school and also texted and called frequently, and often went out with just the two of them to study at a cafe or restaurant, almost always at night. 

Then, at some point he started going on late night drives with her without seeing if I was okay with it, before or after. The only reason I’d find out about these night drives wouldn’t be because he’d outright tell me either. 

Whenever these individual things happened, I really tried to talk myself out of feeling uncomfortable about it, but I also decided to be honest and brought up to him how these things made me feel. He said he understood and would feel the same way, and that he’d change and be better about it. 

He didn’t change. 

In the first semester of college, they would call each other ~2-3 times a week for like 1-4 hours at a time. He’d lose sleep because he was up late on the phone with her. A few times he told me he was going to meet me after I got off my shift, only to text me 15 minutes late saying that he wasn’t going to meet me anymore because he was busy calling her. He randomly mentioned after a week of receiving it that she had sent him a 9 paged letter in the mail. 

At this point, I felt so... confused by how to feel. I felt uncomfortable, disrespected, idk. We had a few long and emotional conversations about it, and I told him how those things made me feel uncomfortable and disrespected as his partner and that every time I brought it up to him I felt reassured by his words but was always disappointed by his actions. 

(I know myself enough to say that I’m really not a person inclined towards jealousy or possessiveness, and I feel like this issue is more one of showing respect for our relationship.) 

The conversations were very long but at the end he agreed with me, saying that he understood where I was coming from and that he wasn’t doing the right things, and that if the positions were switched he’d feel the same if not worse, and he promised that he’d be better and change his actions, etc. 

After that, I felt a little relieved. But I also knew that nothing was “fixed”, and that we were just making a problem very clear and that it needed to be addressed if our relationship was to continue. Except it was around testing season, so this wasn’t a primary focus for either of us in the last couple weeks of school, so I thought we’d talk in more detail about personal boundaries and comfort zones once we got home. 

And then for the most recent event... 

We had just gotten home for maybe 2 or 3 days and one night he calls and asks to hang out because he wants to talk about what I am and am not comfortable with when he goes to see his girl friend. It was last minute and getting late, so I didn’t want to go out and I said so. And then he said that he’d actually called his girl friend a couple days earlier and they had already made plans to hang out that day and she was texting and waiting on him, so he wanted me to give him some guidelines so that I wouldn’t get upset. 

I decided to be completely honest and said that at the moment I wasn’t comfortable with him seeing her at all. He continued to push it to the point where I felt too overwhelmed and stopped responding. 

He went anyway. They hung out late into the night per usual. 

I didn’t respond to his texts or calls for a day. I felt so disappointed and disrespected and angry and just hurt. I didn’t know what to do with myself. 

He eventually asked if we could meet up and talk and decide in person if I wanted to end the relationship. At first he tried to justify himself, but quickly ran out of things to say. I told him how it felt like all the promises he made me while at college were empty, because the first decision he made completely dismissed my discomfort with the situation. I felt like if he had a moment to prove that he was going to follow through with what he’d told me at college, that was the moment. He was really sorry (again) and said that if I chose to continue our relationship, he wouldn’t let this problem happen again and that he’d show me the respect that I deserve as his partner. 

So now I decided to give him one more chance and continue the relationship, at least for now. 

But how should we move forward? I feel like it would be unfair for me to just ask him to stop being friends with her/ stop seeing her, and I doubt he would stop. But if I’m being completely honest with myself I’m just not comfortable with him seeing her at all after all this, at least not right now. I’m still just sort of overwhelmed/confused. I’m not even sure what particulars to include in some sort of “boundary guideline”... 

What should I be doing moving forward? What should I keep in mind? Any advice on figuring out and establishing boundaries with each other? 

I’m sure I wasn’t very clear in my explanation and probably left something out so if you have questions please feel free to ask!! 

TLDR// my bf has not changed his actions despite making promises to change when I communicate my discomfort towards his interactions with his girl friend. I gave him another chance and he has made more promises. How do we move forward? Advice on figuring out, establishing, and respecting boundaries?",20Dec2020,1
703,"Me (17f) and my crush (17m) have been talking just in school (mainly about teachers, school stuff), and   we'll walk to some of our classes together and help each other before a test. He's really nice and I've enjoyed talking to him and I look forward to our walks in the hallway. I don't have a ton of friends, so it's been nice to have him to talk to. I'm a little shy but I was getting pretty comfortable around him, but then I also started crushing on him at the same time. 

Here's the thing.. Some days, it seems like he could like me too, but it could just be as a friend. Other days, not much happens between us. My best friend thinks he definitely likes me, but I'm not so sure haha. We don't have each others' numbers but we follow each other on this app. We both have similar interests and share a couple of classes. 

It's a busy time of year, but lately I've really wanted to ask him to run or hangout and study. But I'm too scared and not sure if this is the right move. Even if it's just as friends, it would be nice to do something together, but hopefully we'd be bf/gf at some point.

Should I just wait for him to ask me? Should I ask to get his number first (and how should I do this?). How would a guy react if a girl just straight up asked him if he wanted to hang out outside of school?

704,"I’ve been working at my dads small landscaping company for four years now. I started part time working two other jobs trying to save money for a home. A few months ago they asked me to work for them solely. I told them I would if they guaranteed full time. They did so I quit the other two. I barely get twenty hours a week now.

A year ago I was promoted to lead equipment operator. I was just put on the insurance to drive trucks as well. Didn’t see a raise for either of these. 
I’m not paid terribly but I’m ready to move on to an actually career. 

I live with my family and I know this will cause a falling out as my dad acts like the company can’t run without me. This might be true as they don’t run it very well. Moving out would also be difficult as they charge me rent and say they can’t pay their bills without me. This is due to excessive spending so I don’t have a great deal of sympathy.

How do I go about it with them. Should I try to move out first? Should I have a job ready for when I bring it up? I don’t feel my dad hasn’t treated me fairly at work or at home for a while, but I still don’t want to ruin the relationship entirely.

709,"Hey guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

this is just a little rant about my current situation. So last year I finished studying and am finally working full time. I've been pretty happy with my collegues and work overall, although I already knew while studying that I probably dont want to work full time for the most of my life. I earn pretty good and could afford the exchange of some money for more free time. So I finally asked my boss if that would be possible but he was rather angry and disappointed I guess and told me this is not possible. They are short on people anyway and growing and are depending on me. I can really understand his point of view and situation but I'm still pretty sad about it. I heard it so often from people in my life that they should have worked less or how happy they are since they cut some hours. But my boss point of view it seems is that im still young and have to do even more than the typical 40 hours so that I improve and can climb further up the career ladder.

I dont really know, I just dont want to make a great career right now. To be honest I'm pretty fine with how much I am earning right now and I just want to enjoy my life and don't have to feel regret later for being unhappy due to spending so much time at work. I just feel like its not wrong for someone to want more free time and less money if its possible, although for some people it is as it seems...

Sry for the rant guys, just had to let that out.",20Dec2020,1
710,"TL;DR I left my old discord server and took the active members with me because it died for a month and now they’re mad because we played somewhere else. I also left because I didn’t want to be friends with the old server owner and he seemed like he was flirting with girls online while he had a girlfriend. Also the girl I’m talking to is friends irl with a couple girls from the old server so idk how this will affect my chances with her. Now I don’t know how to handle my crumbling friendship with Bella and Tori as well as how to talk about this situation with the girl I like. It’s tough because I feel like they’ll talk poorly about me and she might lose interest. 

Recently had to deal with some server drama and it’s been making me a bit anxious.

First wanted to get off my chest that I was quite depressed starting in March and I was quite lonely for the reasons as everyone else. I didn’t see my friends very much and I was an emotional wreck and extremely anxious mainly because I picked vaping up again during quarantine. I eventually started playing a lot of Among Us again with the whole twitch boom and I got back into using discord a lot more than I used to before. I mostly felt empty after playing with randoms and I wasn’t having very much fun. I played voice chat randoms and it was extremely anxiety inducing playing with strangers and witnessing a lot of verbal abuse over what should be a fun party game, I quit random voice chat lobbies and played more text only games and day after day I was left with an emptiness after finally turning the game off. It was just a cycle of repeatedly winning and losing with the only satisfaction being from winning as imposter, sometimes.

I eventually met a a small group on Polus (a map on Anong Us) and we started clicking in the ghost chat(where all the dead players talk) there was a guy and two girls. I’ll call them Nate, Bella, and Tori. we eventually exchanged discords and played again the next day with a couple other people they just met recently and it was a good time. We eventually had our first voice call and nervously played a few games with our small group and randoms and we had a great time. Nate eventually started a server and we had a closely knit group and added more and more people we met, eventually I was introduced to one of Bella’s friends and little did I know I would fall madly for this sweet lady. We played many nights for many hours and added random people we vibed with to our server, many of whom would only play with us that same night and never be heard from again. I eventually grew to dislike playing with Nate, he seemed quite rude to me and quickly get on my nerves. My gut told me something was very off with this guy and my suspicions were high when he joked about simping over Bella, who was 17 at the time and he was 24 with a girlfriend. My stomach turned at the thought of playing with this guy and it would eventually happen when me and a few others would start a game and he would join in.  We continued to grow and I continued to really dislike his company. 

Probably a couple weeks before thanksgiving Bella and Tori both leave the server at the same time without telling anyone. In my head I felt like this is when the server started dying, Bella and Tori were my first friends I had made in a long while and my heart sank when I didn’t see them in the server member list. In the two weeks til thanksgiving I still played with a few people who still played but thankfully Nate stopped joining, probably because Bella and Tori left I thought to myself. I still had fun with the remaining active members but I finally decided I should start my own server because I felt like me and my new friends were a great vibe and I didn’t want to add people to a dying server ran by someone I strongly disliked. I finally created a DM of six people and told them my plan to start a server and they were all on board. My server launches and now we’ve grown to 14 kind hearted and active members, most days we play we have a full lobby of Among Us and it’s been slot of fun. I feel a lot less lonely playing with and messaging my friends and we all vibe together very well. Everything is good and I feel like I’ve created a nice space for people to have fun and interact.

I eventually left the old server less than a week ago. No games and very few messages were sent from the time I stopped playing there to yesterday. So two weeks before thanksgiving to yesterday that server was very much dead with 26 members. Suddenly a mutual member of both servers tells me that Bella and Tori have rejoined and a couple of Bella’s siblings started playing there again. Bella’s sister who was there since the beginning of my new server suddenly leaves and mutual members of both servers tell me of drama brewing in the old server. Nate learns about the things I’ve said about him and calls my server “shit” and accuses me of stealing his “fave peeps.” I don’t believe friends can be stolen, I feel like I just offered a fun atmosphere for people to play and vibe together and it just wasn’t in the old server. 

He accuses me of spilling tea and talking shit. I flat out just didn’t enjoy playing with him and never considered him a real friend. I was told I was offered to rejoin the old server but I didn’t want any part of his bad vibes especially after insulting the community I worked hard to create with people I care for a lot. I feel bad because Bella and Tori have taken his side and I feel like I’ve lost two friends I genuinely cared about. They removed me on Snapchat and I don’t know how the girl they introduced me to will feel about this, we talk, flirt, and talk about meeting each other in person and going on a date and I just don’t know what Tori and Bella will say to her and it makes me nervous.

I just don’t want anything to do with Nate’s server and I’m not sure how this will affect my relationship with Tori and Bella’s friend that I like.

I haven’t talked to her yet because she’s been busy spending time with family all weekend but I guess I’ll have to wait and see. I’m not sure what to do and I’m very nervous to talk to Bella and Tori because I feel like they hate me and don’t understand how badly I don’t want to be Nate’s friend. I’m so very scared because I don’t know what the girl I like will think about all this",20Dec2020,1

Now that everything has settled down with my ex (since I now have the R.O.) I want to go back to the church and start volunteering, the problem is; 1. don't know if she still goes there and 2. If by some chance she is there, I don't know how she'll react to me being there.

The R.O. is civil and I can have her arrested and/or fined if I see her or if she contacts me, but I'm not going to go out of my way to do so.

715,"Note: I have a PPO plan


I had a primary doctor all the way till I got married and moved so I found a new PCP in that city.


2nd Note: I LOVED my PCP growing up, he was very kind, listened to me, he helped me more than specialty doctors.


So I moved back to my hometown this summer and was having some issues I’ve been putting off. Only very specific doctors treat what’s wrong with me and the guy who does is associated with M hospital. It made sense at the time to then choose a PCP also associated with M hospital. So I chose this nurse practitioner, she was available &amp; I had to be seen right away turns out I had a broken rib. I saw her and I can’t get over some comments she made.


We’re both from the same town. We did some small talk and I told her “yeah my husband the city boy loves having the raccoons visit our porch at night” SHE SAYS “you know what I would tell your husband SHOOT THE DAMN RACCOONS” 
Moving on... we talked about where we live, I live down the street from “the club” to which she goes “oh we’re members there” (it’s notorious for being a place for the “well to do” folks) I told her “yeah they want to put a stop sign at the end of the block I guess a lot of people speed” SHE SAYS “oh definitely, it’s always honey we need more ice! honey we need more booze! we’re all getting DRUNK then speeding through that street to pick stuff up, a stop sign wouldn’t be a bad idea.” 
Err ok... 
She suggested I should get my abdominal wall fixed after it separated from 2 pregnancies, I’m like “oh sweet so that’s covered” (why else would a doctor suggest it) “oh no that’s a tummy tuck” Uhh like I have that kinda money?
Lastly, she acknowledged my pain, but didn’t give me options she got very quiet and asked “do you smoke marijuana for pain?” and I’m like nooo. “OK GOOD, yeah I can’t do anything but you could come in for a shot” this shot she’s suggesting is like extra strength ibuprofen and should not be used more than a few days. 


So before I called M hospital to see the nurse practitioner I called my old PCP office and they had to get permission from him if he would start seeing me again... at the time I had to be seen right away but I finally got the message back that he said yes. He’s associated with a different hospital, since I have a PPO plan it doesn’t matter I guess. I’m having some issues now and should see someone soon I don’t know if I should suck it up and see the first lady (her schedule is probably more open) or go back to my old doc. I’m also wondering if I should call my insurance if I’m like flip flopping between drs.

I didn’t get a wonderful story to tell about losing my virginity and he hates that. I hate it that it happened. This summer he saw where I was feeling uncomfortable and I had PTSD. From the rape and the situation this summer. I had a guy talk to me in a really wrong way and it hurt. But I moved on. I hurt him because I did get drunk and I used drugs as a crutch. However now I am facing the world and it’s crazy to think but he isn’t helping because he is all over the place with his emotions. I feel hurt because he keeps pushing me to do therapy for the rape and to talk about it every day. Every day I am seeing flashes of what happened and it’s hurting so so bad. It’s worse now than even back then. He don’t seem to grasp at that. He says we will be fine but I believe he is wrong in every aspect of the story here because he don’t see the forest for the trees. I would be able to accomplish more by going and dealing with each day getting an accomplishment done of homework or school stuff in general. Clean the house anything small and he doesn’t feel that I should do anything but trap myself. There isn’t any moving on and doing more to move forwards. I feel like he doesn’t want it as much as he says he does. I’ve spent weeks tapering down and I’m down to taking nothing at all for over a week. Am I emotional yes.

Covid, however, left me job-less and since I’m studying full time (I’m 19) I don’t really have any savings rn. I asked his friends if they wanted to help and they did, which is awesome, but I’m still about 150/200 euros short.

728," 

So here is the gist of it. I'm 22 and currently studying psychology (second year). I already switched from electrical engineering (spent a semester there). Basically I picked EE because of good job opportunity even do I didn't like math and physics (yeah I know not the best move) and I was a great student and thought I could power through it. I got depressed and begged my parents to switch to something more close to humanities. My favorite classes in high school were in order history, literature, philosophy and sociology (I did very well in all of these and often did a lot of extra curriculum projects) while psychology didn't leave a mark on me as much. I decided to switch to psychology because I was still worried about my finances (In my country therapists can make a decent living and people have started to open up more to the idea so it was an ok plan for the future) and the idea of being a therapist seemed great because I love helping people.

Now here I am still dissatisfied with my choice. The change was certainly a step in the right direction but I am barely making it through and often miss deadlines (the covid breakout made all the professors lax and let me turn stuff in at a later date). I don't know if I just became lazy or is it just not for me. My mom said she hated university (she studied economics because her father made her do it) but she is satisfied with her job now so she recommends that I power through it. Idk if therapy training will be more interesting for me (to a certain extent probably yes but I don't know if it will be enough). I have also changed my mind on education and find that it shouldn't be for job training but for the sake of learning itself.

I was thinking of switching to history next year. But I'm worried I'm just a lazy, selfish, spoiled bum and I will be unhappy again (even do I love watching history documentaries and reading about many different periods). I also feel ashamed that my generation of high school friends will son be finishing up with their studies and I will be just starting again for the third time.

My questions are:

Is my mom right? Should I just power through or should I switch to history?

If there are any psychologists or historians I would especially love to hear your opinion.",20Dec2020,1

I will literally venmo you to give me advice since any thread I make gets zero attention lol

Hey all, i’ve been depressed and dealing with extreme anxiety issues while also dealing with bi-polar disorder for majority of my “actual” life so far (Age 14-now). I live in a very tiny, and freezing, Wisconsin town in the middle of nowhere and i’ve been here my entire life. I began working retail/food service jobs at 15 and I don’t think since then i’ve been unemployed for more than a week straight. The issue is though I absolutely fucking hate it and will do anything to get out of this place.

I’ve worked 3 different retail jobs over the years and after spending 6 or so months at my current one, I can’t do it anymore. I can’t just float on mindlessly through the work days like I used too. Every shift now leaves me working the entire time thinking about quitting on the spot, running away from my current life  and living in my vehicle somewhere I might finally enjoy (This is the option i’m looking the most at), or considering killing myself right after the shift is over.

Misery is mostly an accepted part of life where I live. Majority of the people i’ve worked with in my life across all age groups are also clearly in depressive episodes and your mostly encouraged to just shut up about those feelings because “Everyone has them, welcome to adulthood” is my towns and many others way of thinking. 

I have a lot of learning disabilities, I dropped out of high school but a few weeks ago earned my diploma back. I have zero passion or interest in trades and everyone who knows me thinks I should avoid college like the plague since i’ll more than likely flunk out due to my disabilities and mental struggles and end up further into debt.

My social life is ok, i’ve had the same friends my whole life but I can tell they’ve always seen me as the least successful (They all attend universities and work internships) and they openly have pitied me a lot. I’m also not overweight at all but i’m generally very unattractive and oddly put together so I haven’t spoken to any women or girls I know for about 3 years now. I feel it’s rude to make moves on people when you already know the result and how uncomfortable it’ll make them feel having to go through rejecting you. 

I have way too much going on to write it all out and have anyone bother to read this lol never the less reply to it.


But please, literally any advice for me would be appreciated. If you’ll talk to me please leave your venmo or whatever you take payments on, I just need some help",20Dec2020,1

So my friend is turning 21 and I decided to make a tshirt as part of her birthday present. There’s a meme with Paris Hilton wearing a shirt that says “stop being poor” (it’s very google-able) and we laugh about that shirt a lot because of how stupid and insensitive she is to be wearing it. I make shirts sometimes and she’s asked me to make it before and it’s definitely not something she’d leave the house in. It’s more of a pop culture nod and ironic because we truly do not feel this way. After doing more research I found that the photo of Paris wearing the shirt is edited anyways and doesn’t actually say that. My mother found out I made it and is very upset at the shirt which I also understand, but I really think it’s just a joke between us that people aren’t going to see and that most people our age would understand. We are also NOT rich (especially like Paris Hilton) at all. I will definitely scrap the shirt if the consensus here is that it’s too far.

Another thing is that this is all long distance for now, because I live in America and he lives in Korea; he said that when I move I could live with him and his family. He also gave me a Korean name that has his last name in it. But then he just calls me his friend, so I don’t understand. Maybe it’s my insecurities holding me back? Or maybe he’s just being friendly?

739,"So like I’ve been with my girlfriend for a month and three weeks. Friday night we had a really nice date and spent six hours together until she had to go home. We haven’t spoken since. I was kind of hoping for her to reach out after finding myself doing most of the initiating of contact, and to be honest it seems like I’m more into her than she is into me. Like on our date I was always looking at her and smiling, and she would ask me what I was looking at. I was also complimenting her frequently, completely communicating my interest in her. And on top of that I was initiating physical touch once we were alone in my room. 

So basically I don’t know it feels like I’m more into her than she is into me. Like it’s not balanced. So I just thought maybe it was smart to sort of back off and give her time to come to me on her own with her own interest. But she still hasn’t messaged me, and it’s leaving me confused and worried.

They would beg for me to buy them something, then when I did they would kick me from the party. Because I was so desperate for friends, I overlooked it as a joke. After I had spent over 50$ on them I started to realize what was going on. They never even said ""Thanks"" when I spent money on them. I never thought I would get used, but here I am.

Then I remembered some old friends I hadn't talked to in a while. Turns out they turned into bitches who blasted Ariana Grande while they gossiped yelling out ""PERIODT"" every now and then.

We are very close so naturally i want to see them on Christmas, but my sibling is unsafe and we also have a lot of personal baggage.

743,"Hi..just seeking some advice on how to feel better about my current situation and sort of find passion in moving forward. I just recently turned 21 and find where I am at in life so unsettling. There is nothing extremely bad about my life other than how unhappy I am with myself. 

I have always done really really bad in school and unfortunately that has followed me to college. I attend the community college in my hometown and it has taken me 3 years to get my associates and even then I'm not sure how this upcoming semester will go. I always seem to do bad in my classes no matter how hard I try. It's not lack of knowledge but lack of effort.. I know some may call that lazy but I WANT to do good and I always have but when I look at my school work and my classes I always get so overwhelmed that I avoid it which soon turns into months of stress and anxiety knowing I have so much to do. but never actually doing it. I don't go out or spend time with family and always say I have so much school work. but never actually do it until the very last minute. It causes me to avoid people and important events, I'm not sure where I picked this habit up but I can't seem to break it.

Aside from my poor school habits I also have bad spending habits. I know I need to save for a new car or pay off the 1,300 I have in credit but I always impulsively spend the money on things I don't truly need. I know it makes this all worse that I am aware of the issue but I just don't know how to actually change it. I hate where I am and feel so useless being in my hometown at the age of 21 working in a coffee shop having no idea what I am actually doing. Everyday feels like a waste, I don't feel like I am living the life I am supposed to be living. I have so many dreams but don't know how to start.

I do not want to be here. I want to travel and meet people but how do I start? Whenever I am around people that also live here it makes me feel so sad and sort of bored and I end up leaving just to go to sleep and be even more sad that I am here. I have tried my best to be happy (Bc I think if I can't be happy here I won't be happy anywhere else) but I am truly so unhappy and bored. I know if I did better in school I would have more opportunities but that is not the case and I just really need an alternative way to finding something better for myself. I plan on spending one more semester here but even that sounds so unsettling. I don't live with my parents but even that wasn't enough to make me feel okay with being here in my hometown.

I am only 21 so why do I feel like such a failure. This life isn't for me..I know that sounds so cliche but I am not happy here and don't know where my passion is. My major is PSY and I love it but considering how bad I do in school I don't see a future with it. I'm not sure what advice I am looking for but please anything will help. My dad sees me as a failure and just calls me lazy but that is truly not the case, I have passion in me I just don't know what it's for. I stopped seeking my parents validation and that has helped a bit but now I am just battling with myself. I feel I have spent most of my life seeking validation in boys and items and now that doesn't do anything for me and it's scary to realize how much time I wasted not reaching for a goal.

744,"So I recently moved into a new home, and basically since I moved in, I've found out that the seller was cutting corners on the repairs that I requested during the negotiation period, and a ton of things that were supposed to be in working order, are broken.  


Long story short, in the midst of all the repairs, I was charged around $200 for someone to come look at the broken HVAC unit, and in the end-- by having a different company come out to also look at the HVAC and verify the problems with it-- found out the first company was feeding me a ton of lies about what exactly was broken with it. So now my real estate agent is urging me to go to that company and ask for a refund of the $200.  


So this is the part I'm having trouble with... I've never gone to a company and asked for a refund like this and I'm absolutely terrified to make the initial call myself. I'm not confrontational at all and I've been really struggling with my anxiety lately, so I'm tempted to just take the $200 hit, but I also don't want to be taken advantage of...  


I really wish my real estate agent would just call them directly so I wouldn't have to deal with this anxiety, but I know I need to handle it myself. Does anyone have any experience on how best to phrase asking for the refund? I think I would feel better if I just had any idea of what to say to them.  


tldr: Does anyone have any advice on how best to approach asking for a refund from an hvac company? Any and all tips on wording or the process is greatly appreciated...

He seems to make friends much more easily than me, I’ve been doing a degree for about 3 years I’ve never really made a friend in that time, I have friends and I try not to be ungrateful, but when he started a course he got all these pals so quickly.

My sister (16F) was brought into our family just over a year ago. Her previous family was abusive, and I feel the long periods of starvation she had to go through resulted in her not being able to eat as much. She has been going to therapy and has been diagnosed with GAD and PTSD.

I don’t know if it was the starvation, or her mental disorders impacting on her eating, it could be both; but I need to find a solution or at least something to ease it. She is very close to being underweight. She describes it as her stomach just not allowing intake of food, either because it feels full, or she feels very nauseous. Commonly she wants to eat but physically can’t, and has expressed frustration in herself for not being able to eat dinner. I found that soft foods worked for a period of time (jelly, pudding, etc) but recently that ceased to work as well.

Online I found that probiotics, Vitamin C and lemon water can help increase appetite; but I don’t know if I’m going in the right direction. Is it increasing her appetite that I need to work on, improving her mental health, our mum suggested her stomach isn’t used to full meals so she needs to stretch it by eating more than she can handle, is that the right way to go?

She has reassured me she doesn’t have an ED, though I’m pretty sure by ED she means she doesn’t want to lose weight for looks, which is a huge stigma around EDs that isn’t entirely true for every cause.

But recently I’ve been thinking I need to get my actual own place. Be on my own in a sense to feel satisfaction. Anyway I was recently offered a new job for a warehouse where it’s high pay, 3-4 12 hour shifts with the rest of the week off. I’d be making anywhere from $2k-3k a month and I’d be able to actually get my own own place, and pay all that I need to pay.

I know &lt;my password&gt; is one of your password on day of hack..  
Lets get directly to the point.  
Not one person has paid me to check about you.

You do not know me and you're probably thinking why you are getting this email?

in fact, i actually placed a malware on the adult vids (adult porn) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what i mean).

When you were viewing videos, your browser started out operating as a RDP having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your display and web cam.

immediately after that, my malware obtained every one of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as email account.

after that i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you have a nice taste omg), and 2nd part displays the recording of your cam, and its you.

Best solution would be to pay me $1013.

We are going to refer to it as a donation. in this situation, i most certainly will without delay remove your video.

\[case SeNSiTiVe, copy &amp; paste it\]

You could go on your life like this never happened and you will not ever hear back again from me.  
You'll make the payment via Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search 'how to buy bitcoin' in Google).

if you are planning on going to the law, surely, this e-mail can not be traced back to me, because it's hacked too.

I have taken care of my actions. i am not looking to ask you for a lot, i simply want to be paid.

if i do not receive the bitcoin;, i definitely will send out your video recording to all of your contacts including friends and family, co-workers, and so on.

Nevertheless, if i do get paid, i will destroy the recording immediately.

If you need proof, reply with Yeah then i will send out your video recording to your 8 friends.

it's a nonnegotiable offer and thus please don't waste mine time &amp; yours by replying to this message.

He's gotten alarmingly skinny (he's naturally skinny I would say but it's a bit too much I feel like, I'm concerned for hum, ya know?) and stinky around us, and we keep yelling at him to eat and take showers and do the laundry, but he doesn't bat an eye. Only thing on his mind is video games and friends (which is understandable at his age, but I think it's fair to have some responsibility around the house as well at this point, right?). My parents yell at him so much to come downstairs that I eat in my room with headphones to avoid the yelling cause it's too much. My parents and I (18F) have tried to set boundaries and talk to him but my parents kinda give up easily and I've resorted to ""he is his own person, let him do whatever he wants"" kinda mentality.

759,"Backstory:
My dad had been cheating on my mum since the day they started dating in the 90s. They married in 2001 and had me and my twin brother two years later. I don’t think he was happy about it, to quote him directly, “I needed kids like I needed a hole in the head.”
Fast forward to 2015, it finally came out that he had multiple affairs, and also put my mother and his father in hundreds of thousands of pounds of debt, unbeknownst to them. This fuelled a gambling addiction, and gave him the means to take mistresses on lavish dates and holidays.  
It was a difficult divorce for me and my brother, being 12 at the time. Even worse for my mum who started to disappear to binge on drink and drugs. At around this time I got involved in gang violence (common for disadvantaged kids in my area in London). But of course, being a girl in this situation, they assaulted me. Repeatedly.
I was hospitalised three times after this to deal with the trauma of being a victim to gang sexual assault. Clearly, these hospitalisations proved to be unhelpful, because I am now 17 and yet to find peace with my childhood. 

When im not blaming myself for this, I blame my dad. I stopped talking to him in late 2015, but he’s never stopped trying with me. He used to arrive at hospital in the middle of the night, where he’d leave me a card/flowers while I was asleep. He’s clearly trying to make it up to me.

Realistically, there’s no reason I shouldn’t talk to him, and many reasons that I should. But I just can’t bring myself to. And I don’t think I’ll ever be more ready than I am now. 

So, the question is, do I call him? Why? Where/how do I start? Has anyone reconnected with their parent and regretted it? 

TLDR: Parents had a nasty divorce that potentially caused a downward spiral in my life, although not directly. Should I call my scumbag dad? 

Disclaimer: I’ve told this story many times before, sorry if it seems like a lot of detail in a short amount of space, it really would drag on for hours if I were to give all the information. Any questions just ask.

Now its December and I'm working on my rough draft. My teacher is very understanding and is being flexible. Note that I am working hard and being active on the project. I attend 1 on 1 conferences with my teacher every week and am halfway through my rough draft.

761,"Hello all! I would love some advice! I (F 22) have been seeing someone (M 24) for a couple of months and when we first met we mentioned that we were fine with seeing where things go and keeping it casual. Since then things have progressed quite a bit. We have seen each other many times and slept together multiple times. Recently the ""what are we"" conversation was brought up and he mentioned that he is only interested in open relationships. He told me that he has been seeing a few other people for longer than he has been seeing me and that since we first met he has gone on first dates with a few other people, with the last one ending very recently.

When we first mentioned seeing where things go, my assumption, as I would think many people's would be, is that if anything was to develop, there would come a time where we were exclusive and monogamous. To now find out, months later, that this isn't the case hurts. I am hurt that he took so long to state what he wants, hurt that he made the decision to tell the new people he was seeing that he was seeing other people but he didn't tell me, and hurt that he potentially put me in an unsafe situation sexually and covid wise by not telling me that he was actively going on dates as well as sleeping with other people.

So to put it plainly: I don't know where to go from here. From the research I have done since talking with him, there seems to be a consensus that it is appropriate to tell a new partner right away that you are interested in non-monogamy. Learning this, and realizing that he made the conscious decision not to tell me has left me feeling quite manipulated. A lot of what I can find online talks about how to turn a monogamous relationship into a nonmonogamous one, but I can't seem to find much information on anything that relates to my situation.

I guess I'm just confused on why he waited so long to tell me and what is appropriate to ask from him moving forward. He mentions the deep connection that we have and that he sees the potential for a serious, long term thing, but seeing as we've know each other for three months, what right do I have to ask him to stop seeking out new people if we are to see what this relationship is? What emotions do I have a right to be feeling in this situation? Why did he wait so long to tell me? What is and isn't appropriate for me to ask of him in terms of his other relationships? At what point in our relationship is it appropriate for me to try and set ground rules?

In this relationship, it is not the lack of monogamy that scares me. I am just worried about feeling as though I am easily replaceable or the person he chooses to spend time with only when his other relationships aren't available. In the beginning we mentioned just seeing where things go, but at this point I don't know if that will work for me anymore. It is not his other relationships that make me weary about it, but the fact that he kept so much from me, chooses to tell me now, and is still so vague about what I mean to him and what he sees me as.

I am really trying to educate myself on this and make the decision that is best for me, so i'd appreciate any advice I could get on how I should move forward and what is appropriate for me to ask from him in this situation. I am not trying to change him or force him into monogamy, I simply want to know if I am to continue this relationship, what is appropriate for me to ask from him?",20Dec2020,1

I have always had low self esteem. I have a few reddit posts about this, and I have implemented suggestions. I am working out, eating better, engaging in my hobbies, sorta got a job (I freelance, I'm a uni student so I can't really get a full time job), engage in my hobbies, have been working to stop feeling insecure about certain things (like not feeling like less of a man cause I liked a Taylor swift song or whatever). But still, there's one area i haven't been able to address. I have a deep seated fear of being cheated on. Idk why, I have never been in a relationship before (that's another insecurity, I'm 19 and haven't dated. Went on one date in HS and I didn't even ask her out, she asked me out). That's not to say I haven't liked girls or anything, I have, but I've always had some excuse. For years I used the excuse that dating while in school was stupid because you are unlikely to end up with that person for a long time and it just sets you up for essentially guaranteed pain, so I should avoid it. That's a stupid argument I know. I know that now anyways, but I wasted a lot of years with rationalizations and fears like that. Regardless, I'm trying to change now.

I don't know why I have this deep seated fear, I expect it's because I feel worthless, unattractive, and have low confidence and self esteem, but idk of that's really the reason why. I have this fear, and I have no basis for it. But it is there and when I've reached a point where I actually like myself and feel confident, I'm worried it will hold me back. Idk, I just am deeply deeply insecure about that and I don't know how to not be. I hope I don't sound like an incel in saying that, though unlike incels I am trying to improve myself so perhaps I don't.

In high school one of my class mates was a guy from previous school, we were talking going to cinema once a year (with a few more guys) but still nothing more. Other people from my class didn’t text me either even if we were talking at school. At some point I thought it’s normal until I found out that it’s just not. I used to play with a few guys too, but now I think they were playing with me because they wanted to play with someone and there was no one else. After high school ended I had no contact with anyone in first year in college two guys from high school asked me if I want to play with them a few times but no chat at all (it happened in second semester of college). Now I’m in college there is one guy who is from high school on other major, he only texts me when he needs something college related. And people in my major, exactly same story, I’m trying to be kind and helpful but no one texts me beside college related stuff. In first semester I think I was trying to make friends and after I just gave up and accepted the reality I live with. I also was in scouts at primary school, no friends from that either.

When I got out of my car, I had to walk 10 mins to get to this park (Which merged into a very shady wood)  when I arrived at the spot, I could see a man standing around this park and typing on his phone. My phone dinged a few seconds later and he heard. He came into my direction and said “This that you sexy, my dear” I immediately walked to his direction and confronted him. I had a large hoodie on to hide my face to begin with. He said “Show me that sexy face dear” I lowered my hoodie and confronted him. I told him what a sick fuck he was and that I have all the evidence pointing towards that he is a sexual predator and that I am taking it to the authorities. His expression changed and started shouting about how it was all a misunderstanding. He pulled out a switchblade from his pocket and threatened me not to tell the authorities. I said that I didn’t give a shit and proceeded to tell him in depth about my evidence. He full on lunged at me with this blade. I sparked him with a punch straight to his nose. This sent his crashing to the floor in pain. As mentioned in my previous posts, I had tipped the police off to what might go down. They i rang the authorities and told them what happened.

Also, the same thing with getting into college. I had trouble getting into college for years because my parents didn’t know where there tax info was and they didn’t really try to find it. The same thing with bullying in school. In high school, I showed my dad a picture of me that a girl posted to her facebook with the caption “this ugly azz girl named alisha” and he just ignored it. Same with therapy. I had to find my own therapist and spend uber to get there and back even though my parents could have took me but just didn’t feel like driving five miles away.

775,"Hi I am looking for some advice.

We live downstairs from a 7-8 year old autistic boy and his parents. It's been noisy especially since Covid and we tolerated most of the time but the jumping on the furnitures and stomping has been more consistent and louder (since he is older) and  driving us insane. We went upstairs a handful of times whenever there was a noise loud enough for concern (like dining room table being flipped over by him jumping on it) (or fish tank crashing on the floor) and the last time I went up because of his jumping, the mother got very defensive, told me her child is autistic and told us not to come up anymore and go to management. 

 After that , we started making multiple complaints to our management and board (we live in a coop) and they responded back acknowledging the child is autistic and can only ensure that they have 80% carpeting, and that it is padded and have stickers on the doors to help with the door slamming noises. (because the child always slams the door daily when he has his tantrums). 

The noise have gotten better since we complained to the management/board, although there are times when it sounds like they would allow the kid to let loose  because they are exhausted or whatever, in that we have to make a formal complaint again. We can hear some of their struggles upstairs when they try to calm him down and am sympathetic.  It is not really his outbursts (screaming fits, slamming doors and stomping) that gets to us- it's the jumping and stomping. When he jumps on furniture and crashes onto the floor, our TV on the wall and paintings shake (but has never thankfully fall off). I invested in high end noise cancelling headphones so I can work during the day but it doesn't prevent the vibrations of the jumping - I can feel those and after awhile of that - it really drives me mad. 

Anyways, my partner wants to try to be neighborly and researched on a VR headset specifically for autistic child and thinks it would be diplomatic for us to gift it for Xmas with a note stating we sympathize with their situation and don't want any ill will but if they can try to stop the jumping on the furnitures etc. 

I am nervous doing this because I don't want our good will to be construe as harassment or something by the parents. Basically I don't want to give an inch for them to take a pound. I don't want our efforts to be interpreted by them as us being ok with all the noise. I just want respectful neighbors and for us to at least be civil. I am a NY lifer so I am very jaded, my partner is from the mid west so he believes in people more. 

What do you think? Should I take a risk and hope for the best or am I stepping into some legal nightmare ? Thank you for your time.",20Dec2020,1

778,"My boyfriend got really angry today. It seemed like an extreme reaction and his anger went from 0 to 100 in like 2 seconds.

We don't live together and see each other a few times a week. I have never experienced him getting so angry at me.

So we were cuddling in bed this morning. I am very playful and joke around a lot. My boyfriend is more of a serious/stoic type. I started doing that annoying thing you do when you're a kid to annoy your friends where you copy/repeat what the person says.

The conversation went like this:

Him: I'm going to get up and take a shower.

Me: I'm going to get up and take a shower.

Him: Then you'll have to join me.

Me: Then you'll have to join me.

At this point my boyfriend gets furious ""That's so fucking annoying! That's so fucking annoying! Get off of me!""

 At this point he rolled out from under me and got out of the bed.

I didn't say anything. I just laid there.

Then just as quickly as he got angry he backtracks and hugs me and says he loves cuddling with me.

I said ""are you really that mad about it?""
He said ""I wasn't mad that's just annoying""
I said: ""Ok I won't do it again.""

BUT he WAS really mad, like he got furious.

I understand I was being annoying. But why get that angry about it, why not just say ""stop that's really annoying""

Is this a big deal or not? 

It was just so quick, flip of the switch, then back to normal just as fast.

I have never seen him get so angry at me before, it was just strange to experience and it seemed like a petty thing.",20Dec2020,1
780,"My mom a few days ago decided to put some cooked wet rice in these 2 large bowls with lids on top, facing a window. My initial impression was that she was giving my brother and I food to eat, but I was wrong. I can't tell her to throw it away,

After doing the dishes today, the 2 bowls with rice are still on the table, I opened the lid of each and I saw little scattered black 'dots' all over the rice. I googled what would happen if you left rice overnight, and the top result that it was toxic and not safe to eat. It's winter at the moment, so my mom can't garden but I have no idea what she's trying to do with this rice. Any thoughts or advice?",20Dec2020,1
781,"Predator Hunted (What went down)

In my previous posts, I explained what happened with this guy. Long story short I arrived at the meeting point. When I got out of my car, I had to walk 10 mins to get to this park (Which merged into a very shady wood)  when I arrived at the spot, I could see a man standing around this park and typing on his phone. My phone dinged a few seconds later and he heard. He came into my direction and said “This that you sexy, my dear” I immediately walked to his direction and confronted him. 

I had a large hoodie on to hide my face to begin with. He said “Show me that sexy face dear” I lowered my hoodie and confronted him. I told him what a sick fuck he was and that I have all the evidence pointing towards that he is a sexual predator and that I am taking it to the authorities. His expression changed and started shouting about how it was all a misunderstanding. He pulled out a switchblade from his pocket and threatened me not to tell the authorities. 

I said that I didn’t give a shit and proceeded to tell him in depth about my evidence. He full on lunged at me with this blade. I sparked him with a punch straight to his nose. This sent his crashing to the floor in pain. As mentioned in my previous posts, I had tipped the police off to what might go down. They i rang the authorities and told them what happened. A few moments later the police were there and took the man off to some place (I don’t know where, it could of been a station or somewhere else) 

I gave them all the evidence I had and said if I find anymore, I will hand it in. I am currently writing this in my car. I have a few contacts that have links to the dark web, they can bring up things like Age, Name, Car, Were he lives etc. This will help with evidence and the whole thing. 

If anyone has any questions or anything about this in general, don’t be afraid to comment or DM me. I am also involved with the dark web (Not the bad stuff like Drugs, Porn, Guns and all the other bad stuff.)just to access things like information about people and different types of hacking.

785,"this is a lot so bear with me. my father is finally clean off heroin for the first time in years and he’s been doing so well this past year with being clean and i’m so proud of him. However, he’s homeless and is currently spending 400$ a week to live in a hotel. He wants to live with me until he can save back some of his social security check to get a place and live on his own. i genuinely can’t take him in though. i’ve lived with my father before while he was on drugs and it was debilitating. I’m only 22 and living with a boyfriend. When he wasn’t on drugs my father has always been very sweet. He would bring me home a stuffed animal every day after work, he’s not a bad guy. He struggles mentally a lot and his memory is absolutely awful. Growing up he never could take care of things on his own and always relied on my grandmother to take care of him. my grandmother raised him to very dependent on her and when she passed he started drugs and other things to cope with it and his girlfriend (he’s no longer dating anyone) who was an addict at the time talked him into heroin. He’s the kind of guy who will do whatever you tell him to do if it means you won’t leave his side. it’s a sad situation. i want to help him because he doesn’t understand much of anything really. he’s only in his 40’s but sometimes it’s like talking to a brick wall. he zones out of serious conversations, he drifts in and out of subjects, to me it looks like his just dissociating out of everything. He has never had to think for himself because every time he did my grandmother would throw a tantrum. She would chase his girlfriends out of the house with baseball bats, she had my aunts kid taken away when she defied her, and she was super abusive to him and his kids (I was the exception because I looked like her) and so he’s never lived his life knowing how to function on his own. She even applied for jobs for him when he was able to work. He’s actually a really good artist, but she wouldn’t let him pursue that. Now, I’m stuck with a father with a debilitating mind who cannot get the help he needs because he doesn’t know how. I’m still in university and i have a home to call my own now. I want to help him because I know how shitty it is to be homeless. I was homeless with him from ages 13-18, so I know how much he has struggled. Once my grandmother died, other addicts and my abusive brother kind of filled in on her role and took advantage of him. My brother stole thousands from my dads checking account and literally convinced him the bank was stealing all his money, crazy, I know. He sometimes hits him and is known to be very violent. My brother is getting help now for his violence and addictions but the difference is he’s intelligent enough to get that help. He really is as gullible as a child. I guess my advice question is how do I help him? I don’t know the proper resources for this kind of thing and I guess I’ll do all the paperwork needed for him since he’s illiterate but he can’t stay with me. I don’t want him to fall into those old patterns and start hanging with other addicts again for support and turn towards bad influences because i’m unable to help him. How do I support my father but retain my boundaries??? I don’t want to turn my back on someone who’s trying to stay clean. I just don’t know how to help him without being the mother.",20Dec2020,1
786,"Sorry if this is not the place for this question, but I figured I'd try.  I've been texting with someone I met on Facebook for a couple of months, in a semi flirtatious manner.  Outside of texting, there hasn't been any other form of communication (some pics, and one brief voice message from her).  Anyway, we text for hours and have great convos, but she refuses any personal calls citing random excuses(at work, Maybe if our schedules allow later, etc.)  

So today during one of our text sessions, I texted the word ""stop"" to her as a response to something she said.  IMMEDIATELY I received this text: ""To stop texts from 1214*******(phone no. redacted) reply STOP to confirm""

So....I'm trying to figure out what this means.  Is this a possible option that can be set-up on a personal mobile phone, or is this evidence of some robo phone system that I've been talking to?  If so I really don't get the endgame....there's been no mention of wanting money, cc info, gifts, etc.  Can a more techno savvy Redditor help me solve this mystery?",20Dec2020,1
787,"Hello guys and girls of reddit. So as the topic says I need advice about a friendship that is literally now a shadow of its former self. I'll start from the beginning.
So two years ago I (19M) met a very interesting person (19F) in college that we'll call Emily. It took me a few months to start a conversation with her, not for any reason except for the fact that I take my time before becoming friends with someone. She just seemed very interesting to me from the first day and I wanted to get to know her and see how her mind works. So eventually after 4 months we started talking and having incredible discussions regarding numerous topics. I'm an introvert but I found it very easy to converse with her and in short I was very attracted to her mind. Anyways after the first year she left college to pursue her studies on her own. We were still at this point good friends and often chatted alot ranging from jokes to serious discussions but not much about our personal lives. At this point she was with someone else and I had no physical attraction towards her. A few months later the conversations just ended and even though that saddened me but life moved on. During this time another friend of mine stated that she believes that I do actually fancy Emily and not just find her interesting due to the discussions I can have with her. But by now we weren't talking anymore so I didn't pay much attention to it.
Anyways after 6 months of no conversation I get a message from Emily that she wants to reconnect. I msged back and again we started conversing. I had apprehensions as to what happened and she said that things didn't work with the guy she was interested in and she wasn't in a good place so she would have been unable to keep a strong friendship with me and that's why she dissappeared. She said that I was a very good friend and she just wouldn't have been able to return the same amount of energy. Satisfied with the explanation we started talking oftenly. I realized that I did actually fancy her a lot. After around 2 months of having amazing conversations she stated that if a guy like me did fancy her she'd be very happy. Long story short we did tell each other that we fancied each other. She talked about how she always had a clue that I fancied her in college. We both were pretty genuinely happy but she was a bit afraid. As she put it she wasn't someone very good in relationships of any kind as she always talked diplomatically with people and felt uneasy if someone came too close to her. However, the thing most important to me was our friendship and I was willing to put my feelings aside for it. At first things were very good but then there were issues. One day she did decide to run for the hills and was going to end the friendship because the way she put it is that I'm a very amazing guy but feelings and all just isn't her thing. Somehow I did manage to bring her back and again state that this is just a friendship not a relationship. We do fancy each other but we are friends first and foremost.
Unfortunately things just never got better. Conversations didn't flow as easily and seemed forced. She even got accepted in the same university as me but that didn't make things better either. Our conversations were now just limited to studies and that's all. I confronted her and asked if I did something wrong and she stated that I wasn't at fault anywhere. She put the distance in our friendship because she just don't make close friends and except for her sister and her best friend she just doesn't opens upto anyone. I told her how once she considered me a great friend too to which she replied she still does but she's diplomatic in a friendship and doesn't gets warm or personal. By now I was tired of making an effort to somehow save this friendship. She stated that I could still talk to her about anything it's just that there's something wrong with her and that's just how she is in a friendship.
I said that no I'm fed up of sharing stuff from my side and  friendship is always both ways and that now this is just a practical friendship just for study related help. For the next few weeks this continued. The only times we talked was about quizzes etc. Whereas once I used to love talking to her now it seemed like a task. She seemed normal because to her that's how a friendship is. Few days ago I finally decided to make sure once and for all that it's not me who did anything wrong. She again stated that she still holds the same incredible view of me as of the start and anyone would be lucky to be a friend of mine. I'm a great guy and that her perspective of me hasn't changed. She apologized how she's so guilty because she forgot to wish me birthday. Now this really struck a nerve because the least I had expected was that she'd wish me and not apologize a month after my birthday. And like every other time she was so diplomatic and cold. Every conversation I always had with her I put my heart in it and everytime her reply was indifferent because she thinks practically and that's how she is blah blah. This time I wanted to say so much, not criticize her, I still believe her to be an incredible person, but just to get things of my chest as to how again and again I've felt like a fool. But I remembered a saying as to how no one owes anything to you and it took huge amounts of self control but I didn't say a thing. She even said that she still fancies me but feelings or even a friendship or any bond makes her repel it.
So after all this, I'm no longer willing to make any effort to do anything. The friendship can't get better and I believe it 100%. After all I can't make anything better as it's not my fault, she's just that way, and pretty much she can't have any attachment or friendship because she's diplomatic and impersonal. 
The question is now should I just end it and tell her that the friendship was good while it lasted but that's it? We won't talk anymore about anything and tell her why. Like for one final time speak my part, explain it and end it. Or do I just stop talking? If she messages I won't reply and act like we never were friends although it'll make it very awkward when we meet in uni. So if I do see her we'll just say hello hi. But the problem again is that to her it'd be a normal friendship whereas to me that's no way of having a friendship. So it's either having one final conversation with her or just not talking to her and hoping she won't either.

789,"One of my closest friends that I live with gets really, really angry pretty frequently. We play a lot of video games together, and it's just alarming to see how angry he gets. As an example, when playing Xcom every shot you take has say an 80% chance of missing. When he misses that shot, he'll freak out, shouting and punching his bed. He also takes bad luck events really personally, shouting ""Of course XYZ happened to me, of fucking course!"" This happens at least once a day, often multiple times to a varying degree.

Maybe it's just because we have different personalities, but it worries me that he expresses anger so intensely over ultimately minor things. It seems to me like hitting things in frustration is a slippery slope. When gaming together I try to model what I see as positive behaviour for him, shrugging it off when luck turns against us. ""Ahh shit happens. I guess they had the upper hand."" I make an effort to point it out when good or 'lucky' things happen to us too.

But that's an indirect way of dealing with it. So I guess my question is, as a friend should I talk to him directly about addressing his anger issues? How do I approach that issue without driving a wedge between us? I don't want him to resent me for pointing out his flaws, I just want to help him get a little more self-awareness.",20Dec2020,1
790,"Im 15m, and would rather not post this but here I am. Sorry about its length. 

Cutting a long story short. After my 'rough' school experiences, being a first born and not having the most peaceful household,i have become a hate fueled nihilistic, antinatalist misanthrope with emotional instability problems.

A few months ago I made a choice after having a mental break after 4 years of enduring tribulation, I decided that I was better of enduring my suffering and accepting that as my life. Through introspection I decided that Im battling with myself over thinking I need help or knowing that I am made in my suffering. But from experience, 'help' either does nothing for my mental health or makes things worse. I have since refused help until now.

However, a few weeks ago I had the strongest, uncontrollable emotional episode of my life. I hate other teenagers, a lot. An unimaginable amount of hate. One day I got a black beanie as a gift from my nan. I put it on and listened to a song I like, ""red megalovania metal remix"". Personally I don't like the metal or sub genres of it, accepting few songs and some Dubstep. And a thought dawned on me. ""wait a minute, I'm wearing all black, listening to metal, as a teenager. AM I BECOMING LIKE THEM? Oh my god I am! Oh fuck I'm becoming like them"". I then proceeded to tell my brother about this and began having a panic attack, not. pleasant. When that was over I started laughing and getting euphoric, then started garbling my words to my brother, laughing more, then proceeded to start crying uncontrollably. There was a very very brief moment of anger somewhere there too.
When it passed and I could speak I was recovering and confused as to what just happened. About 2 minutes later my body shook intensely for at least 5 more minutes. I was baseline after that.

I did some research and found 3 constant conditions pop up all the time: bi polar disorder, cyclothymia and BPD, aka borderline personality disorder. Bi polarity was too far fetched, cyclothymia was too calm. So it must be BPD right? The symptoms typically seem to take longer to cycle through on other people than me. I wasn't sure until then to present day. I was having quick mood swings that would go from extreme happiness, to a strong feeling of emptyness and depression for a few minutes to an hour, then back to baseline. I have also been having frequent episodes of depersonalisation and derealization since before the emotional episode. I also have little mental 'fluctuations'. I'll start off fine but then my flight or fight activates for no reason and doesn't shut off for hours at a time. My reflexes are violent and almost anything will make me jump when I'm like this. I feel like crawling into a ball in my head and breaking but force myself to stop being weak. This is gonna sound emo as fuck but it's the best way I can describe this forcing myself to not break down. I think I use my hatred for humanity, and teenagers, as a mental shield of sorts. Like a saferoom to keep my head in check. Another thing to note linking to hate, in High-school, I would be confronted by a teenager of waste, proceed to be consumed by anger but never a blind rage, I lost all fights. Now though, all I feel in that situation is all my hate directed to that one excuse for a child in front of me, no anger, just pure black hatred. One time a bully didn't leave me alone for months. One day I lost it and bust one of his testicles and almost cut his throat with a dinner card in year 7. Part of me wishes I did cut it, after all, he was undeserving of life. I don't think I did because the way I see it, life is a fate worse than death. 
Now the only thing that keeps me going is my hate for them. Im not sure if that's why I'm unstable emotionally or the reason I Haven't gone insane yet. 

God I'm shaking while writing this. 

Do I have BPD or is there something seriously off with my mental state?",20Dec2020,1

792,"Hey, everyone.  I really want to get some people together and make a game.  Seems simple enough, right?  The game would be a fan-made Half-Life spinoff game.  So here’s the issue: I’m 14 years old, and I couldn’t pay people to help me.  I don’t have a job, or money.  And if I wanted to pay the people helping me with money made by the game, I couldn’t do that because the game would have to be free, being a fan-made spinoff of copyrighted material—I couldn’t sell it for any money because I don’t own the rights to it.  What should I do?  I have a dream that I really, REALLY want to make a reality, but I don’t see a way that I could pay my developers, voice actors, writers, coders, musicians, etc.  I’m stressed out because I want to make this game SO badly, but I know that I would have trouble finding people who want to help me but don’t want to get paid.

796,"Over a week ago, on monday, one of my roommates knocked on my door and asked if we could talk. She said she had something she wanted to talk about, that had been on her mind for a couple of days now. She then told me that on the friday before she had had an uncomfortable situation with my boyfriend. My boyfriend was staying over, but I wasn't home yet as I was working late. She told me they had had some drinks with my other roommates, and at the end of the night, were both going back to their room and had been talking in the hallway for a while. She told me they gave each other a hug to say goodnight, and that my boyfriend then slipped his hand under her skirt. She told me he had then asked ""Is this ok?"" She told me she had hurriedly said goodnight and went to bed and, over the course of the next hours had realized how uncomfortable she thought the situation was. She told me she texted him  the next morning to tell him that she thought it was uncomfortable, and that he had texted her back saying he apologized. For the next few days, my boyfriend was still over. After he had left, on monday, she came into my room and told me this. 

I told her I was sorry this happened, that I was sorry she had been in an uncomfortable situation, and that I was sorry that she had felt so uneasy with him being at the house still. I also told her I hadn't talked about it with him, and that I was sure to do so. So I called him and I told him that my roommate was upset and asked him what happened on friday. He told me they had had some drinks with my roommates, and at the end of the night, were both going back to their room and had been talking in the hallway for a while. He told me they were acting goofy, and were play-fighting. (I know that they do this, as they do this sometimes when I am also there). He told me he had playfully pinched her in the back and that she had acted taken aback. He told me that he asked ""Are you ok?"" to see if they were okay in the situation. He told me she had laughed it off and that they went to bed. He told me he had received a text the next morning from her telling him how she felt uncomfortable about the situation, and that he had texted back apologizing about it. 

At this point, I didn't know what to think about the situation, as they had both told me a different account of what happened.

I told my boyfriend that his account of the situation was different from the one I had heard from my roommate. I was trying to stay out of the situation as much as possible because I had not been present and I felt this wasn't about me. I wanted them to see eye to eye again, so I told my boyfriend that it was probably a good idea to call her or send her a message to invite her to talk about it. He did, and my roommate texted him back saying she didn't feel like talking about it for a while.

I had not been home for a few days, and when I came back, my roommate's boyfriend came over and asked if we could talk. He told me that my roommate had also told him what happened, and that she was still very upset. He was also upset with my boyfriend. He told me he didn't want my boyfriend to come over anymore. I told him I did not think this was fair, because it also affected me a lot in my living in my own home. I told him I thought it best if my roommate and my boyfriend had a talk to hear each others account of friday night, in the hopes of figuring out each others perspectives on the situation and hopefully being able to find a way forward from the uncomfortable encounter. He told me he did not think this was a good idea as my roommate was still very shaken up. We agreed that I would talk to her, to ask her to talk to my boyfriend, and that before they had a talk, I would not have my boyfriend over.

So I talked to my roommate and I told her that her account of the situation was different from the one I had heard from my boyfriend. I also told her I thought it was best if they talked, so she could tell my boyfriend how he had made her feel, and so she could hear from his perspective as well. I also told her I understood that she may still be shaken up, and that I did not want to rush her if she still felt too uncomfortable. I told her she might think of writing it up in a letter or message if she felt too uncomfortable meeting him. She said she would take the holidays to think about it. However, she said that now, she is most comfortable leaving things as is, not seeing my boyfriend and not talking about it.

I told my boyfriend that my roommate would like some time. He said he felt the situation was being made bigger than necessary. He told me he had sent her another message saying he was sorry and was there to talk if she wanted. He said he did not know what else to do, as he wanted to respect her feelings but also wanted to get past the situation. My boyfriend said he wants to hold off and let my roommate decide when they should talk. 

Two weeks have passed, and I have been thinking about this every day. I have not talked about it with either of them since.  I still think this is a situation that can only be solved with the two of them talking about it.  I would like the two of them to be able to be in the same house. And I also want to be able to have my boyfriend over, comfortably. Even if my roommate would ultimately feel too uncomfortable about it for that to happen again, I would still like my boyfriend to have a chance to apologize. 

And now I fear that my roommate will perhaps want to wait a month to talk, or longer, or might not ever be open to it. I am afraid that taking too much time will make the conversation even harder than it already is, as everyone will have gone over it so much in their heads that the tension may keep building further. I want to respect my roommate, and I want to give her the space she needs to feel more comfortable, but I don't know how much space to give her that will benefit her. I don't know how to advise her on making choices based on strength, as I am way to tied up in the situation. I also want my boyfriend to be able to share his account of the story, and for him to hear my roommate's account, and for him to apologize to her in person. And I also feel unable to really advise him, as I am way too tied up in the situation. 

In the mean time, I feel stuck in between two people that are close to me, that I want to help work through this, but that I also feel unable to help because if my position. Not only was I not there when it happened, I am also personally close to both of them. I now find that I do not know how to move this forward. What should I do?",20Dec2020,1
797,"Since probably 2 years now I don’t feel thirsty. I drank max. 300 ml per day, lately I went 2 days without drinking multiple times. When I installed an app I did drink a bit more, but after a week I gave up. How do I stop dehydrating myself? It’s getting bad, sometimes I can’t even hold things properly anymore",20Dec2020,1
798,"My (29M) mom (53) has been depressed practically her whole life. Dad not on the picture since a long time now, she lived with her mother (my grandma) for a few years and since march 2020, lives with a guy she met a year ago, still depending on my grandmother’s allowance, which it wasn’t much, but when they live together, it was enough.  

She met a guy a year ago and decided to move in to his house this year 2020, because she wasn’t getting along with her mother. When my mom and this guy met, she was going through better times, so is not hard to understand why someone would like to be with her.  

The cycle goes like this: She’s always been on medication, most of the times she goes to the doctor (psych) a few times, gets a treatment, feels better, then stops seeing the doctor and continues with that “treatment” forever until the crisis starts, basically for not working on her real problems instead of trying to “fix” bad feelings.   

The thing is that since 2017, she’s seen several doctors and therapists, attempted suicide (already treated for that), has been treated with lithium (which went bad), some other medications and ultimately, self medicated. Since may more o so, she stopped going to the doctor and started following her own made “treatment”... another loop of the cycle. She’s been calling me every Saturday at the same time in the morning and is like talking to a machine who asks the same 3 questions every time, then the call ends. She doesn’t even listen to what i say most of the time.  So today (sunday) she texts me and my brother to ask if we could give her monthly money each one of us until she can work (she hasn’t worked since 2016). So I told her that I have no problem to help pay doctor bills or meds, but I’m not willing to give her money to perpetuate her situation, which is: doing whatever she wants with medication, not going to a doctor or a therapist, and basically lying in bed all day in this guy’s house. She said she will go to a psychiatrist, then I said that first I had to see how much was the psych bills and what medication she’s being prescribed so I could help her with that. I want to help her get better, not to sustain destructive behaviors. I’m not sure she gets it; she says: “ok so you can’t give me money” in such a soulless tone. 

I don’t know if I’m being an asshole, but she’s not my responsibility. All I can do is to help her get better, not just giving her money. Right? I would like to hear other people’s opinion on this. Thank you!",20Dec2020,1

I got him 3 days ago, from my mother as an early xmas present. Ive always liked cats, so woo.

Ive owned many rats over the years, but always looked forward to them dying after only about 2 ish years. Its like a weight off my chest.

Its cute and all, but its going to be around for another 13 years, and its not even that annoying.

Recently, Ive had the urge to just kill the thing, lock it outside, suffocate it or something. I hate myself for having these thoughts but oh well.

Recently I've noticed my  friends asking me to repeat things constantly and it's led to me being  extremely self continuous and avoid speaking often.  The only language I  speak is english, so it's not because of an accent.  I've asked my  friends if my voice was annoying or something like that and they  wouldn't give me a straight answer.  Does it sound stupid, or annoying  or something?  If so how can I fix it? Does it sound normal? If so, is  my resentment just what everyone goes through?

Now a little bit of info before I dig into the actual problem, my mom started working about maybe 2 months ago or so , since we were having some money problems and with my step dad he was being irresponsible and leaving to drink with friends or whatever bullshit and he was the one who worked and my mom stayed home but since he started doing that we didn't have money , point is my mom had to start working to be able to buy groceries , bills , etc. She started working and told me that now that she's gonna work I'm gonna have to start doing all the house work , cooking on certain days , and taking care of my brothers. I knew the situation was rough and well I of course agreed and for the past 2 months I've been cleaning the whole house myself and cooking on certain days , and just over all taking care of my brothers , she pays me a small amount but it's all she can afford to give me to be able to take care of everything else and I'm ok with it I have no problem all I want to do is help out and stuff especially since her job has her working 10-12 hour days everyday and only 1 day off, unless it's holiday season she works 12 hour days with no days off. So by all of that you could imagine she has been really stressed lately , now here's where the problem is my brothers have been rude with me and I've just been tolerating it because I don't want to hurt them or say something I don't mean so I've just been taking deep breaths and trying to just calm the situation down but today was just my breaking point , earlier my grandma invited us over to eat with her and my uncle and well we went and we ate (she lives near us) and after that a while later my brother said he was hungry and before being hungry he had ate cereal so I just didn't know what to do or say and  he asked me ""what are we gonna eat?"" And I told him we had already ate and if he wanted more he could go get some more as there was leftovers and he said ""what?!? No I didnt know we were gonna eat that"" and I told him ""I know I didn't either but just eat that for today so we don't eat unnecessary food from here that we can't be affording to eat right now"" and then I told him if he didn't wanna eat that I could make him a sandwich or something and he got mad and told me shut up and left to his room and slammed the door and I just lost it because this has happened so. Many. Times. Like I'm getting sick of it every single day one of them has to yell at me to shut up , rolling their eyes at me ,or that I'm stupid or even times where they've tried cussing at me etc. and I never say anything , Im trying my best I really am , with the little money im getting payed I save some of it for whenever they're feeling bored or down I take them to the nearest store to pick out a snack or something and I spend time with them , we hang out , talk , I have them cook with me whenever I have to cook , I play games with them , etc I just want them to feel loved and wanted and do stuff with them that my mom never did with us , and it just hurts when they say these things to me I mean ffs im 14 I'm still a kid myself and I didn't choose to be left with all this responsibility , but I'm trying to make the best of what I have and be the best I can be , Christmas is in 5 days and I tried to save some money to buy them something and I couldn't and I just got them a few kinder eggs and just little snacks we could enjoy since we wouldn't be getting any gifts and I'm more on the side of i know what we've been through with money especially since covid everybody has had it rough and stuff and I don't care I really don't I could care less about getting gifts or anything I just want everyone to be happy , but I can't do anything about my situation as my mom gets home at 11-12 pm and leaves to work sometimes at 5 am sometimes at 7am or sometimes at 9am and she barely gets enough sleep to go to work and I don't wanna bother her to tell her about what's been going on , I wanna fix this issue between me and my brothers so we can get along well for the time my mom is gonna be working , sorry if It seems I came just to vent I didn't have anyone else to express what I was feeling and I just decided to get it out here on the internet at least , but if anyone has advice it would be greatly appreciated.

826,"Need some advice or feedback or comments. Bought my house with my bf over a year ago. Although our relationship has had ups and downs, lately I guess everyone is in the same boat with the virus and all. I find it harder and harder to communicate with him. 

We've gotten down to this routine where he gets home from work (I work from home) says hi than goes straight outside to the balcony for a smoke. Comes inside grabs a few beers and heads back outside for more smokes. And repeat. This goes on every night, and the only time I see him is at supper time and we only interact if we don't have the t.v on (usually at my request) I know. I know. It's normal for a relationship to fall into a routine but when you work from home all day and this quarantine doesn't allow you to see your friends. The only human interaction you have is with your partner. Before all of you ask, yes I have had numerous talks with him and communicated that more communication is needed from him when he gets home and more of effort to interact with me. It all goes back to the same routine after a few days.

 Lately things have been really intense, his parents invested into a condo and gave it to him &amp; his sister. But now for the last month, his sister calls him at least 4 times a day ( I am not exaggerating) and they text almost every 10mins. Every night I hear the texts go by or the phone rings. I'm happy for them but it eating into our ""couple time"" I've brought it up to him that I would love for us to have a moment here and there without interruption but he says him and his sister have to communicate often as they have a mortgage together now. Okay.... But now 6 days ago, we got into a massive argument which results into neither of us speaking to each other and 6 days have gone by. I have noticed when we fight, he always calls his sister and acts like they are in a relationship, laughing, talking forever ect... 

I am at a point where I wonder, where is this relationship going? We talked endlessly about getting married and having kids. But he had promised to propose in the summer and it never happened. When I finally got the nerve to question this, he said he needed to save money for the condo with his sister and it would be coming soon. But we are Christmas time and nothing but condo talk. Even when we talk to our friends he just goes on how great his sister is at this mortgage thing. Even our last argument he said to me that he wishes I was just as mature and outgoing as she is. (Hence why we haven't spoken in 6 days). 

I am 34, scared of being alone because all I ever wanted was to be married, have kids. I work fill time in upper management, have a great salary, no debt. Why do I feel like the constant third wheel?

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

The cheerful, friendly and outgoing boy I used to know is gone.

He has severe depression, PTSD and anxiety, he goes to therapy regularly.

With my husband and I, he acts relatively normal. However, recently my youngest daughter has confessed that since he got out of jail, he has been verbally and physically abusing her.

When we are not present, he insults her, threatens and hits her if he gets angry.

830,"We have been dating for a year now and have broken up for a few days to a week three times. Last night, he snuck into my house to sleepover and we had sex and everything was yayyayyay of course. He begged me to steal more of my dad’s alcohol, and I eventually did, came back to the room, and he told me “if I’m talking to a girl that’s just a friend and she isn’t flirting with me, then I don’t need to tell you”. Before this, he sent streaks on snapchat (10 girls) and one responded whom he’s had a past thing with. However, the girl who was actually talking to my bf on the past thing’s snap was just a mutual friend of theirs. Although I was still hurt at the fact that he was snap chatting his ex thing’s phone which meant the two girls were together. 

I know, you’re thinking “oh no. did you really get mad at him for saying that?” Yeah, trust me. I regret it. I questioned him about it, and he ignored me and was on his phone. He wouldn’t get off his phone, so I shook him, which escalated to me hitting his leg and him kicking me in the ribs (he said this was self defense). Keep in mind this mainly escalated due to him continuing to be on his phone and not put it down THE WHOLE TIME. Also, a very important detail is that i’m on nexplanon birth control (implant). I have my period every two weeks, binge eat(lose/gain significant weight in a week or two), have many symptoms in common with BPD (not self diagnosing), and bad anxiety and depression(no self harm). Since the implant, I have very dramatic episodes and can overreact and take things too far very fast. I just exposed my mom to her boyfriend for romantically talking to her ex-surgeon(whom she should be suing for messing up her surgeries for breast cancer 4 times) after she ate my burger one night(yeah). 

Back to the argument, my boyfriend also brought up that his parents mentioned me not eating my in n out animal fries that they had bought for me with dinner the other night. He told them to buy me(5’5 130lbs), the same meal my bf(6’1 160lbs) has: a double cheeseburger with animal fries. I have only been able to eat about 500 calories a day this week, which I told my boyfriend multiple times about, due to not having weed and honestly despising my body because I constantly compare it to all of his exes’ perfect bodies(I, my friend, and some of his friends have even considered the possibility that he could be using me). During dinner, I was able to finish the burger but maybe 80% of the fries were left so I looked at Mitch and he said it was ok to not finish them because he knows I’ve been getting nauseous from eating too much. I kept slowly eating them and until his parents left the room to throw it away, and I even put my plate in the trash upside down so they wouldn’t see. BUT OF COURSE!!!! His parents randomly end up looking through the trash for some odd reason (are they out to get me?) and yes!! find the animal fries. They said to him “I take it ___ didn’t like the fries?” 

He mentions this last night after I became upset at him over his statement about texting girl friends, and I responded by apologizing and kinda getting upset at him for making me look bad to his parents when he knows that I’ve barely been able to eat all week. He told me that I’m ungrateful and it’s my fault for not being able to eat all week because of relying on weed to eat. Honestly, I think my emotions and hating my body played more of a dominant role in not eating than weed ever did. I know that his side is also understandable because I could have saved the fries, but we went out with our friends after (nowhere to keep them edible) and I didn’t even think about that option. 

In the past, both of us have snap chatted people whom we’ve talked to romantically/had past hookups with. I admit that I, from what has been exposed in the relationship, have been the worse partner out of us two regarding loyalty. However, my bf slept at his (m) best friend’s house for about a month, where his best friend’s girlfriend would also sleepover. The girlfriend and my boyfriend would often find themselves in the room alone together due to the best friend moving to the other room, evidently caused by my boyfriend and the girl talking too loud while he’s trying to sleep. They snap chatted for a month, some highlights: 1) she asked him if they could make a tiktok of him twerking on her 2) while the best friend was in another room sleeping, the girl said to my boyfriend “sooo what do u wanna do?” with a smirk on her face. This, which is what my boyfriend told me, is a prime example of my confusion. I’m conflicted on whether he leads them on or initiates the flirting (because how else would it have gone on for that long) or is feeding me lies to get back at me for talking badly about him to a past hu of mine. 

Yes, I deserve a “b*tch” award 100%. However, since then, I have stopped talking to everyone on snapchat besides my boyfriend and my best friend, and legitimately have no friends besides my best friend and his friends that I’ve grown to become kinda close with over the year. I know not putting effort into other friendships is destructive and definitely has a huge impact on my stress, but I have never been an extroverted person and prefer few friends that I can be really close to. 

This has recently changed into a larger issue because my best friend, and only friend, left for Navy boot camp 2 weeks ago. ***My boyfriend has told me multiple times that if I don’t find friends, he’d leave me***I feel so trapped because I honestly don’t know anyone, especially girls, that I’d want to be friends with. Most girls that have hung out with us have been home wreckers, and i’m not going to add another girl to that list. I have online school, no job (currently trying to get one), and no hobbies or sports so I don’t really have many opportunities to form friendships which is my fault. 

Age!! - My boyfriend told me he was 17 November 2019 when we started dating. He waited until I think July 2020 to tell me that he was actually 18 when we started dating and turned 19 in June 2020. I was 17 when we first started dating and just turned 18 in October. So, we have about a year and 4 months difference. I was unaware he was an adult that whole time and he’d never let me see his drivers license(i see why now).

TL;DR My boyfriend and I had an argument last night which started with him saying “i can talk to any girl and not tell you as long as it’s a friend and we’re not flirting”. I got upset and questioned him about it, and he barely payed attention to what I had to say because he was on his phone the whole time. Also, he brought up how I was unable to finish my dinner 2 nights ago that his family bought for me, which was because I was barely eating all week and could not finish the double cheeseburger AND animal fries without barfing. He left my house and said to text him the next day, but then came back 5 mins later to get his stuff after all and told me that we were free to talk to other people. Any advice on what step next?

After reading all of this, do you have an opinion on this situation? I will fill in any gaps needed to be filled. I’m begging you please help me, the only people to talk to are my family and they keep telling me to leave him because he puts me under the bus all the time. Although this is most likely the right advice for my situation, I would really appreciate some outside opinions. Thank you so much for your time.",20Dec2020,1

I like to play among us and have joined a discord server where I can join a voice call and be in a game quickly. I'm okay with talking to some random ppl. We are just playing a game anyway. If it does get uncomfortable I would leave but this time I didn't for some reason. Okay so I join a VC (also I'm a very talkative person) and start talking. They keep saying I sound like a little boy which I get told alot and I'm okay with it and then I just say that I'm a 14f and move on but this time no. They either were still misgendering me or making sexist comments about me like ' I should stay in the kitchen than play a game ' they were obliviously older so I didn't wanna defend myself caus that would do nothing. They would probably just keep making sexist comments or misgendering me. So I just stay in the call,sobbing to myself. I don't know why I didn't leave but yeah thats story. Now I'm really self conscious to speak which as I've said isn't like me. I still am very talkative to my friends irl and in text but in VC I get super self conscious. What should I do to help myself?",20Dec2020,1

833,"Sorry if this isn't the right page for this. I'm new on reddit and just needed to let this out. 

All my friends went to different unis and I don't have really have any friends at my uni. They're more like associates, I'd sit next to them if I see them in lectures but I wouldn't walk in with them or call just to chat. I know people say that uni should be the best yrs of your life but thats not the case for me. I spend a lot of time alone in my room. I don't drink, not a fan of partying and a virgin so I might as well be an alien compared to everyone else. I'm 20 and haven't even had my first consensual kiss yet (two uncles made me do things with them when I was 7 or 8). No guys (apart from creepy old guys) have ever expressed any interest in me at all. I have a particularly hilarious memory where one boy actually ran away when he was meant to kiss me while playing spin the bottle when I was 10 or 11. That was a huge help to my self-esteem. All my best friends have boyfriends and I really am so happy for them but hearing about how happy and in love they are just makes me think about how I'm not and brings up so many fears I have of being alone my whole life. I just feel so unwanted and insignificant, like if I disappeared, it wouldn't matter. The isolation from the pandemic didn't help matters either. There have been so many nights were I've cried myself to sleep because the loneliness is so suffocating. There are days when I just want to stay in bed and do nothing all day. I have little to no motivation for anything. I do my assignments and study because I have to and I can't let my parents down. I can feel myself breaking and I'm trying so hard to keep it together. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't that big of a problem but I need some advice to get me through this.",20Dec2020,1
834,"I (18M) started to study physics at university this semester. Since I was young I was always intrested in planets and stars, so I developed this dream to become am Astrophysicist in like 9th grade. Math never has been my strong suit, but I figured that if I just study enough it'll work out. But I always doubted that studying physics was the right choice for me. 

In every class I have there is Homework where I need to have a certain amount of points from 33% up to 50% to be able to write the final exam. So there is always pressure to have the all answers right or at least to have the bare minimum of points. 

I started to study really hard, party because of my problems with math and partly because I had nothing else to do. So I would say that I'm almost at full capicity right now. But I still struggle with the homework.

In math (Analysis to be correct) I've had two mental breakdowns (idk what else to call these) so far, and today I had the first one because of physics. My brain basically shuts off and I either throw shit around my room and rip the answers I wrote down apart or just give up cry. I spiral down this path where I tell myself that I'm not good enough and that I should've never started to study physics.
My overall mood has also suffered drastically, I get pissed of way easier and I got generally more angry towards my family.

So I'm asking for advice on how to get this under control and on what I can do to be more calm in these situations?",20Dec2020,1

837,"I'm going to try to make this a fairly short post. I just need somewhere to put this and maybe someone to see my story and tell me if I'm being crazy and tell me what to do. I don't feel like writing a lot right now so I'll make edits and comments for additional details if they are needed. For context, I am a 14F. I have been friends with these people ever since I have moved to this neighborhood about 4 years ago and I've always thought that they were my friends, but lately I'm starting to wonder if I care more about them than they do about me.

Today, I went to my friend's house to see if they wanted to hang out. We'll call this first person ""S"". S lives next door to me, and we hang out quite a lot. I am usually the one going over to his house to hang out, and this time was no different. I went over and he had two other friends over from our neighborhood. I'll call these two people ""F"" and ""N"". Anyway, after I came over, F left shortly after and we told her that we'd see her later. N said that S and her were just getting ready to go to N's hot tub. I asked if I could come, too, and they said sure. I asked if I should go get my bathing suit, but N said that she had to ask her mom, first, and see if she would even say yes, and I could get my bathing suit afterwards.

We walked to her house and she went inside to go ask. S started talking to me about how he and his family were going to go to the ski park that had just opened for the season and how he was excited for it (Side note, he had asked me if I wanted to go with him to the park two days before, and I had said yeah). I asked him if I was still allowed to come, and he said that he hadn't asked if I could come, yet. He started talking about how the only reasons that I wouldn't be allowed to come is because skiing is hard and it was expensive to go, even more expensive if you had to rent gear. This made me feel a bit disappointed because I had actually been excited to go. Just the other day he had even been telling me that it was a lot easier to learn to ski than to snowboard and that they had instructors at the park. But whatever, it's his family, so it was up to them. A few seconds later, N comes back out and says that her mom is being a jerk and said that N could only have one friend over. My heart sank, because I had a feeling where this was going. N turned to me and said that since S already had his stuff, they could go in and, if they didn't take too long, could come see if I wanted to hang out afterwards. I agreed, since I didn't want to make it a big deal. S didn't say a word about any of it, maybe not knowing what to say, I'm not sure. I walked away and out to the park near my house where I cried for a few minutes before calming myself down and walking back home.

And now I'm here typing this. I don't know what to do. It's not the first time I've been left out of stuff that they got to go to. Maybe I deserved it for kind of inviting myself along? Maybe I'm just an unlikable person? I don't know what to do or where to go from here. I haven't received any communication from either S or N, and this whole thing took place about two hours ago. Do I tell them how I feel? Am I overreacting? I could really use advice, even if it's just someone telling me that I'm in the wrong.",20Dec2020,1

839,"Hello, my grandpa died almost 2 weeks ago now and a week ago we had the funeral.
My grandpa always meant the world to me and I always talked with him and he would give me advice.
Unfortunately he lost his battle to cancer eventually.

The first few days I was depressed and sad and was mostly just mourning. I also cried a lot. 
On the funeral I did a speech which I barely was able to do. I even carried his coffin. 

I visited my grandma the first time since the funeral so it was very weird to be in the house. But it felt more like he was just away for a while. I just sat in my usual spot and it felt more like I was waiting for him to sit next to me so we could talk. We even visited his grave and of course I was sad, but some part of me just didn't believe he was there.

I even helped my grandma with some financial stuff which I did in my grandpa's bedroom where everything was the way he left it. And i have helped him very often, so even though he was't there, it felt more like I was helping him instead of my grandma.

I don't know if this is normal and maybe it's just my way of mourning, but I find it so weird to be sad and at the same time just not believing it.

Is there anything I could or should do about this? I have talked to my family about it and they don't really know how to respond. 


Tl:dr, I'm very sad but at the same time feeling like he'll be back any moment.",20Dec2020,1
840,"(I apologize in advance for any misspellings or grammar errors, wrote this on my phone).

So here’s the thing, I started at my new job a few weeks ago at a grocery store. It’s a graveyard shift with great pay, benefits, and my position is one of the managers for a department. I don’t have any big issues with the job (working overnight is tiring but another than that I enjoy it for the most part). 

My coworkers are fine except for one person, we’ll call her Lexi. Since I’ve started, Lexi has been acting a little different toward me than the other coworkers. She gets incredibly irritated at me, gets mad at me for small things, and now has started to yell at me in front of other people for just doing my job. 

I thought I was just overreacting  and there was nothing to be concern about until the second week I was there, I notice if I make own small mistake, such as put one wrong item in the wrong aisle, she’d get incredibly mad about it and make me feel like shit the entire time. Or when I have to do my nightly order (when I’m in charge I have to do a huge order that usually takes like an hour or when I’m not I still have to order but it’s just for my tiny department), she’ll get mad and ask me questions like, am I sure I have to do it, or am I doing it right, or even why I’m so slow at it. 

Just today, she yelled at me for me saying I have to go do my ordering in front of another coworker. Which by the way, the other manager does the same things I do but she doesn’t mind him doing it. But when it’s me doing the exact same job I’m the one in the wrong. Not only does she yell at me for literally doing what my job description asks for, when she’s mad, she’ll throw product on the ground or throws stuff in her cart when she’s mad at me. I had to clean up after her twice because she broke product in aisles that spilled everywhere (notice the spill but didn’t brother to clean it up or help.

She’s also walked out of the job before because me and another coworker tried helping her take out the cardboard into the compactor. She apparently didn’t like us helping her and stormed off. She’ll also get mad if I tell her she can take her 15 or her lunch or even when I ask her to help me with moving some pallets or back stock. Lexi refuses to sit in the same break room as me (after the first week if she sees me in the break room she storms off to another one). She’ll nitpick everything I do even when I’m just trying to help getting the job done.

Lexi also started to complain about me to all the coworkers and including my manger as well. But I haven’t really done anything other than my job. I let her do her thing while I do mine but I have a lot of duties I have to complete every shift. The other coworkers don’t have a problem with me, they are happy to help me when I ask and when they tell me something I did wrong they aren’t rude about it. But when it comes to Lexi, I feel like Im walking on eggshells around her. 

It’s just a constant battle ground with her and it always results in her belittling me, humiliating me, yelling at me, and just pain out bullying me. I may understand if she’s just trying to help me understand how things work around the job but I’m sure there’s a better way of doing it than what she’s been doing these past few weeks. She just gets so irritated and angry easily and I feel so bad when she’s working the same shift as me. If my other manager is there it’s not so bad. She will just ignore me and I can work in peace.

If she’s not working that day it’s even better because I feel like the job gets done faster and everyone is more relaxed. But if I’m in charge and she’s working, it’s all down hill from here. I talked to me sister about it and she says I should really talk to someone about it. But I just don’t want to make things worse. And I’m still a little new and I don’t want them to think I’m already starting to complain about the job or I can’t do my job correctly. I just didn’t sign up to get harassed by one of my coworkers all the time. 

What should I do? What’s a good way to handle this? I’ve just never came across a situation like this before. I have to see her tonight again (luckily my other manager will be there so I shouldn’t have any problems tonight). I just want to go to work in peace and go home in peace without any problems. I treat all my coworkers and everyone with respect and always try to get my job done the right way. But with this Lexi situation going on, I don’t know if I can continue doing it. 

Any advice would help greatly, so thank you in advance.",20Dec2020,1
