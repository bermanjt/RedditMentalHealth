0,"Could anyone help with my confidence or any tips I am 14 male I've always had low confidence because of my ugly features big forehead, weird head shape, bad hair, and big gap in between my front two teeth, because of this I've had low self confidence for as long as I can remember. 

Is there a way to stop or help this because I always think bad of myself and sometimes it hits me randomly in class or at home and I'll just start crying to myself",04Nov2020,1
1,"My girlfriend and I have been together for almost two years and her mother passed away early this year from a stroke. Now with covid coming in with another wave her father contracted covid and takes care of my girlfriends grandmother / his mother in law. I believe he contracted the virus while traveling for amateur racing across the US. Basically a super spreader event where people get excited about driving in a circle. I am so sick of seeing my girlfriend in such pain now that her grandmother is now being transferred to a ""comfort"" unit to sedate her as she slowly dies of suffocation.

Both my girlfriend and I have tested negative for covid after getting the news that her grandma contracted the virus.

What should I do? All I can think of is to attack him, his property, and confront his secret girlfriend to get tested.

BTW he has been seeing several women during the lockdown after a few months his wife was laid to rest.",04Nov2020,1
2,"I'm a man in my early to mid 20's, but I feel like I've lived a lifetime. 

I've seen and experienced things which make it hard to smile, things that have changed me as a person. I just want to forget and move on with my life. 

What I need to be happy in my life is a wife, kids and a family.. but previous life experiences is making that an incredibly difficult feat to overcome.  

It's not that I can't find someone, it's that I can't trust anyone. I'm always thinking they're gonna leave or screw me over.

It's not just with dating either, it's with life in general. I find it hard to maintain friendships with people because I can't trust anyone. 

I'm always concerned that I'm about to get screwed over at my job. 

I always see the bad in people. Everywhere I look, I see bad. 

Certain things can't be changed, certain things can't be healed.. they are permanent. They are everlasting &amp; unchanging. 

I just want to know how the hell can I recover from life and move on to brighter shores? 

I've given it time, but time isn't healing these wounds. I believe it has significantly altered my brain chemistry or something... I'm not the same person I was... 

I hate living like this. I hate hating. 

I hate not seeing any light, I hate getting to the end of the tunnel and having to go through yet another god damned tunnel. 

It's like rolling a rock up a hill, and it rolling right back down, ad infinitum. 

I just want to get better. I want to be happy for a change. Everyone else can get happiness, why can't I? 

How can I move past a lifetime of nothing but bad experiences, and find some positive and happy experiences?",04Nov2020,1
3,"I just heard about this condition and it seems scary. I'm uncircumsized myself,but I can easily retract my foreskin behind the shaft. I have had sex and wacked off successfully this way,but I have read some uncircumsized men getting Paraphimosis during sex.

I've been having a crush on her for a while and wanted to ask her out. But I wanted to give some hints first, how do I do it?
And I've been thinking of giving her a letter with a drawing of her since I'm a stuttering mess...but I feel like it would be too boring? Unoriginal? So how could I make it special?

6,"I'm aware of the current state of the UK employment.  And there might be a person write ""suck it up and get over it""

But,  I was mare redundant just before lockdown and this week I managed to secure a job that will (a) not leave me bored out of my fucking mind and (b) be very good for my future career. 

The boss is a decent bloke as well.  He's offered to get a delivery lorry and move all my stuff and he's offering me support,  and training.

The issue is I'm a very slow thinker.  I like to think of all avenues before I make a decision.  Its what I do. 
But, after I accepted the job, i have to move and start in the next seven days.  At present,  it feels very rushed.  Like I'm not in control of anything and I'm going along for the ride. 

I know that if I turned that job down now I'd be a fucking idiot.  I also know that's common practice.  But it still feels like I'm being rushed into it and that I'd like longer to plan,  make a decision and feel comfortable about it all.

7,"I’m so confused. As far as I know I’m (19F) straight, I’ve always had boyfriends and never felt that same attraction to another girl. But starting a few weeks ago, my heart just goes crazy every time I see my best friend (19F). 

Normally I get excited to hang out with her, but it feels so different now. I’m not really a person who craves physical attention but whenever I see her I just look for excuses to hug her or touch her. Also when she smiles at me I get that feeling in my stomach that you get when you’re in love. 

I’m pretty sure it’s a crush, because I’ve had it before with boys, but I don’t know what to do. We’ve been friends for years and I’m pretty sure she’s not into girls. We’re really close, and I don’t want to lose her friendship if I let her know I’m kinda into her, but it’s also really hard to act normal when we hang out. 

Should I tell her? I don’t want her to find out herself and feel like I lied to her, but I also don’t want to lose the friendship if she gets uncomfy around me.",04Nov2020,1

11,"I am extremely intelligent. (Yes, I know how conceited I sound.) I've never found any particular challenge in school, even in the accelerated courses. If I put no effort into trying to do extra work or staying on top of things, I still make between 95 and 98 in all my classes. I've been doing this for the past three years, and it has made me lose all motivation for school and trying to succeed. My thinking is, ""If I can be top three in my class, with a fraction of the effort of the top two, why should I try to be better at all?"" 

Coupled with this, I have significant social anxiety. I find it extremely hard to make friends, and find it especially difficult to keep up a good conversation with someone who isn't my close friend. I started at a high school where none of my friends attend, and feel like a fish out of water. I have not made a single friend in the past 3 months, and have barely started tentative talks with one of my classmates. 

To my mother's eyes, I probably look very depressed and as if something serious is wrong with me. I assure you, I am not experiencing any type of depression. Regardless, she has been pushing me harder and harder to put more effort into school, and she is about to resort to taking away my electronics to try and force my hand to get me to actually try in school. She is also contacting the school counselors, to get them to work with me to find the root of the problem. 

I don't know what to do, or how to start putting effort into my schoolwork. These past three years of breezing by have turned me into a procrastinator who hates doing any type of work, and is in all honesty, someone I hate.  I want to start being able to actually find something in school that makes me want to try harder, but as of late, nothing has challenged me still. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, how can I stop procrastinating, and start trying harder in school?",04Nov2020,1

Sorry it’s long i’m just having a hard time composing myself. Today as i(f20) was leaving work i almost hit a pedestrian leaving the parking lot. I feel horrible about it and was too shaken up to even apologize. This was in the tsawwessen mills lot. 

I made a left turn to get out of the parking spaces to to the stop sign. Another car was going slowly to the stop sign so i went in front there was enough space. Right in front was the walk way and a pedestrian was walking. I didn’t see him when i scanned before  and when i did he was to my left. He kind did a little jump skip motion to avoid me as my bumper was close. He just kept walking tho. Now i’m home and objectively everything is “okay”.

14,My dad needs a birth certificate because he does lost it. He is from New Jersey and now we live in Georgia. However he was living in Tennessee and has a Tennessee driver's license. We applied for a birth certificate at https://www.state.nj.us/health/vital/order-vital/ and we payed money for it and everything but they sent him a note in the mail stating that his license does not match up with his Georgia address (like OBVIOUSLY he moved and he's been living in Georgia for a year and he gave yall the information that states he's been living here!) Hell... The department returned our money late so he spent 100+ dollars for literally no reason. My dad really needs to get a Georgia license so he can get a Georgia tag because we are driving without a tag which is not good at all. Please if anyone can help me that would be greatly appriciated.

She also doesn’t follow COVID guidelines, which bothers me because I help my mom with my disabled sister. My sister was on a ventilator 4 times this year (not due to COVID) and would die if she got COVID.

What do I do? My husband doesn’t see anything wrong with her behavior.

I think I’m also bitter because I have supported my husband for years, and have worked hard for everything I have. And she is getting handed everything.

the 2nd time i found out a few months later which was more recently he was texting her and they even hung out all night until 4 am (he said he was with his guy friends) she admitted to them kissing and talking and almost having sex, he denied everything except for talking and meeting with her. so this is twice now that he has lied to his ex about being single and hiding it from me until you know he gets caught. 

there have been other incident with Instagram pictures and his snap chat stories, all that i can get over but now it makes me thing he is doing more but i just don't know, he says hes not, but how am i supposed to take his word for it, when it already been broken

22,"He’s a real good friend of mine, he is very kind (to me) and thoughtful (to me) but he just ha s this weird entrepreneur, psycho mindset. I am 100% for him and others wanting to start their own business and have control of their lives, in fact i encourage it. But with this comes his crazy views of people who work jobs are dumb and are sheep. His family is wealthy and so he doesn’t have to get a job, i’ve told him about how good a job can be and how much you can learn from it, not just money. For some reason he really genuinely thinks that working for someone else (even if it’s just to keep food on the table and/or to fund your passion/career).


He also is a psycho christian who cannot even phantom discussion regarding God and is so spiteful and disgusted with others. I really don’t want to be around someone like this but to be honest he’s my only good friend. 

He lives in a fairy tale, he seriously watches like one video with Elon Musk or Ben Shapiro and now he’s a political philosopher and a future entrepreneur. He doesn’t have respect for time or realism. He won’t get a job, thinks that people who are millionaires are worthless and just doesn’t have a grasp on life.

Also some of the radical shit he says drives me insane. I feel like he genuinely thinks women are below him. He said one time he doesn’t want his future wife to have a job because “I am the leader and the leader of the house” I mean really? A real leader and smart person isn’t afraid of help and wants others to succeed and is also a gentlemen. He thinks gays are disgusting people and they are living in a sinful lifestyle, even though it’s been proven that homosexuality is natural. (He doesn’t believe half of what science says either in order to protect his radical faith). He also thinks rape isn’t even an issue and that racism doesn’t exist. Please help me. He is a good person i guess but his mindset on a lot of things is so bad.

24,"(There’s a tl;dr at the end)

My main high school friend group (all 19M or 20M) and I (19M) were all pretty moderate (I think that’s the best word to use here) during high school. We could be edgy sometimes but were mostly chilling, and very rarely were edgy things said just for the sake of it. We’re all in our second year of college now (at different colleges), and although we naturally drifted apart during our first year, we came back together in COVID season to #game during Zoomschool.

I’m starting to get uncomfortable with the interactions we have, though. For a good while now I’ve been increasingly radicalizing into an SJW mindset (which I don’t think is a bad thing but I can’t deny that it’s happening), whereas two of my friends have been radicalizing in the opposite direction— or at least they’ve become more vocal about their reactionary beliefs.

I don’t want to just ghost them because we had some really good times in high school and I still catch good vibes from everyone else in the group, but it’s come to the point where almost every time I open our group chat I’m disappointed, sometimes even outright disgusted. I also don’t want to ghost them because I don’t want to set up an unhealthy precedent where I just leave friends behind for disagreeing with me, especially if I don’t even tell them what’s wrong. ~~Also part of me wants to stay to try and “save” them, but I think that’s a really unhealthy, fucked up mindset to have so I’m working to limit it.~~

All that said, I don’t really know how to bring up my concerns. I’m one of the most privileged guys in the group, and it would be painfully ironic for some white dude to lecture an Indian guy about racism… but I’m still not cool with him using the n word as a punchline, and nobody else is standing up. Moreover, I’m worried that this irony would only further radicalize them, since it would give credit to the notion that social justice is only something by and for overly-sensitive white liberals detached from “the real world”.

I’ve been stuck at this road block for a few months now, and even though I can still enjoy it when we game together, I’m always left with a bitter taste in my mouth. Any advice would be appreciated; I have no fucking clue what to do.



TL;DR: My homies from high school and I are meeting up over discord again because corona, but I’m becoming an SJW libtard beta cuck while two others are turning into Alex Jones 2.0. I‘m starting to dislike interacting with them, but they’re still my friends and I don’t want to leave them. As the most privileged motherfucker of the group I don’t know how to bring up my concerns without it coming off as horrendously condescending.

Gross. It’s mainly more my mum, there is nothing wrong with her as a person but I get this strong resentment feeling. It’s annoying because I’m just viewed by them as horrible aggressive ect when I really can’t help how I react. It’s like I want them to perceive me as being a robot?

35,"Hello. So this is going to be long because it’s been going on for months. 
Me, my fiancé, and our four year old moved into our new appt end of June. I just had our daughter three weeks ago so I was also pretty pregnant throughout those months. 
Right after moving in a few neighbors warned us about the top floor across from us. A few college aged kids lived there and were so loud past hours, throwing parties and having girls over who would stay on the back porch drunk girl screaming all night. They would also smoke cigarettes on the balcony which isn’t allowed. These drunk girls also got into fights frequently and cops came multiple times for this specific unit. 
Being at the end of my pregnancy with a four year old, I made a lot of complaints to the appt management about this unit. Emails and calls. The emails were never answered and the calls never ended in anything helpful. They just kept saying to call the police but when I would the police would say it’s the managements job. 
Fast-forward and this unit is finally getting evicted due to an issue where one of the guys threatened and actually tried to fight a girl who called him out for being annoying and a child. 
Now, although that unit is now quiet, our upstairs neighbor has two dogs who have started HOWLING and barking for hours on end every day. It’s been about a month of it now. I’ve called about it and our management said they can only call and just tell the tenants their dogs are howling but can’t do anything else. I finally called the cops about the situation and they even said management has a lot more pull than they’re making it seem.

So this happened a few days ago, and i can’t decide whether to be angry or not at my best friend.
So me and my friend have known each other for ten years and its our junior year of high school. Weve had a duo costume in mind since the beginning of january and we finally made it happen. Ordered all our stuff, nothing wrong there.
But we planned to go to a small little gathering with 5 other people (mostly) in her friend group. Shes really the only friend i have.
So i drove everyone around, we all got food, did our makeup. 
Then i went to go pickup another friend and then she kinda just slowly started to ignore me.
Time passes and we finally go to the party. Everything was alright for the first hour but once everyone started showing up nobody wanted to talk to me. I tried to create small talk, but everytime i tried to say something to my friend she would reply with very short responses and avoided eye contact. but had no problem talking with everyone else. 
I left around 9 pm cause i was tired of wasting my energy when no one wanted to talk to me.
Before this whole party even happened, she promised she wouldnt ignore me. I was beat up about it the whole week cause i spent a shit ton of money on my costume and for me to just be ignored in the end pissed me off. But we went back to school today and she hasnt talked to me once. 
I just think as soon as it involves other people she doesnt want me to be there. I keep beating myself up about it and i feel like im in the wrong but i dont even know if i did anything. Im pretty socially awkward so shes the only friend i have that actually talks to me and i dont know what to do.",04Nov2020,1

His plan is to send thw CL currency to UY, so we can exchange that to USD (situation on CL is not going well) so, in order to preserve their savings (learned from Venezuela that when everything is going bad look for another currency) , they want to do so, main reason, because UY has better rates than CL in this moment. I refuse to do so, mainly because that could be interpreted as tax evasion, fraud, capital flight and another bunch of stuffs, and everything would be registered on bank transfers.

Greek Deites were the closest thing. A sort of wishful thinking that I hoped was real despite the mythical creatures. It was a bit comforting that there were multiple Gods/Goddesses for the same things. It made more sense and it also helped that there was some sort of middle ground. 

Recently, I've wanted to make my own religion. One that isn't filled with toxicity, one full of beliefs of my own and it helps me a bit to know that its fake but I can believe it regardless. I can believe that whatever I made is where I'll go even if it isn't but picking one set religion is so hard for me because, what if another religion was the *right* one and I go to the bad place for not believing that religion?

Here and there, we like to make inappropriate jokes but recently it has kind of crossed the line to where it's not jokes but it's straight up questions. She asked my other friend who is a dude when they found out about ""touching yourself"". It was really uncomfortable to listen and I just kind of sat there in silence not knowing what to do. She also answered the question saying that she had been ""doing the deed"" by herself since she was in preschool and found out last year of what it actually was. It kind of baffled me that she did not mention or know anything for years, that her parents never even talked about it or did something about it or that she kept it a secret for so long. And the thing is, she would constantly bring the question up, even in front of other friends. The last thing that's concerning is that she has developed a kink. I know what a fetish or a kink but I never expected a friend to develop this, especially when she's still a teen. I don't even know how she discovered she liked it? We found this out because we were talking about incognito tabs and whether they delete your search history or not and she freaked out really bad. We asked her what's wrong and she said there were some really ""bad"" things on there.

47,"First of all, im an 8th grader. Idk about other countries but where i live theres a biiiiig exam at the end of the year which will  decide which high-school you can go to. And it is taken very very seriously in my home. And i take it seriously, too. A bit more than necessary actually (It is the start of year rn.)

Of course, i have started studying already. I go to the courses my school makes, i also go to another course (?) which is just like my school, except there are more homeworks there. I also take private math lessons with a friend of my dad. And i have piano lessons. (I do not mean to show off how many lessons i take, i just think its necessary info? Im not very sure tho.)

And the exams these places have been making makes me anxious af. I didnt even care that much last year, but it makes me anxious for some reason? Ive been anxious for eveything recently. And i dont know why. I also started biting my nails, and well ive done that before but i thought it stopped. It started again for some reason. Idek if this was necessary but it was interesting for me.

Anyways i have been feeling more anxious. Especially in exams. Heck even when were just taking a test from a testbook. When the teacher starts to tell the answers I can hear my heart beat. Im literally so scared to get something lower than %90 I dont know how do i beat that. 

My sleep schedule is so messed up. I dont sleep till 3-4 am and i need to wake up at 7-8 am. It just started changing like that (mostly because im a procastinator {hopefully i spelt that right}) and i dont know how do i go back to normal. 

I like to make plans but i suck at following them. Im most likely to do it 1 hour later. Or just decide to do it at night.


Im pretty sure for people who are older than me these issues are pretty minor, and i shouldnt complain. Well if i was older id think that too ngl. But i feel like if i wanna do better first i need to change these.

I am 17 years old and after a long road of jumping between possible career paths I think I have finally found the one for me. I have spent countless hours watching YouTube speedpaints, browsing art sites and reading articles, Concept art just fascinates me and I haven’t found one thing about it to make me hesitant about pursuing it but that’s where I reach my problem.

Some context to start: In a little under a year’s time, I will be travelling abroad to study in a different country to get a bachelors degree. The reason I am choosing to study abroad is mainly due to both mine and my girlfriend’s current living situations in which its both causing us a lot of mental strain. By the time I come over, we will both be able to remove ourselves from those situations. 

This brings me to my problem. From research both me and my girlfriend have done, I understand the high risks of choosing an art career as I suspect every other artists does to.
“You won’t make it.” Is a real fear, it’s a very competitive area that generally doesn’t pay much. The college I will be studying at offers the following art courses: Drawing, Graphic Design, Painting, Printmaking, General Fine Arts and Studio Art. 

Whilst I understand that Concept artists don’t necessarily need a degree I think it’s a very safe choice to make due to it being a competitive area and as a back up in case things turn for the worse. Graphic design has so far been the course that we have both been settling on but I’m skeptical if I’ll enjoy it as it’s more of a advertising/marketing area instead of concept art itself but if this course if the best to take to reach my dream then I’ll take it no questions asked.

TLDR: What degree would you advise I take to have a good chance of becoming a concept artist: Drawing, Graphic Design, Painting, Printmaking, General Fine Arts or Studio Art.",04Nov2020,1

I never had any “real” friends in my life like everyone else and I always tried to have them but I was always too scared and not confident enough to get any or fully try like everyone else does. I remember I was so scare at even the thought of trying to have friends even though it was my biggest goal in my life because I always felt so alone and lonely that everyone around me had people who laugh and have fun with. Whenever I would come close or at least have the feeling I am included and they considered me as their friend I always mess up and ruin the friendship for stupid reasons or I am not really considered their real friend and always the second or third preferred person and only ever chosen when there is no one else or I am the last person. I dealt with this all my life and I’m so tired of it. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even care anymore and think it is not worth the trouble and pain of trying because I already know the outcome. Is it just me, I am what is wrong, I always feel like it is because if I wasn’t there i wouldn’t have ruined everything. I don’t even see the benefit anymore because I feel as it is not worth the suffering I feel every time I try and fail. I don’t have any hope anymore but I try still to only fail like I always do. Everyone always tells me to wait and eventually I will be able to get friends. I been told that all my life and I am still waiting and I don’t know why I continue to wait when I know there nothing to wait for. I tried the best I could my whole life but is never enough. Maybe it’s just I am meant to be alone away from everyone where I can’t ruin or hurt anyone. Every time I try to learn because I know was fault but never can stop myself from messing up again. I try so hard but never can prevent me ruining everything.

My parents were okay with paying for one of the best schools in the country. For some stupid reason I rejected it and went to a second tier public school that used to be great but not now.

I'm in a lucky position to be purchasing a house in the next few months. My friend is pregnant and her husband just lost his job due to covid layoffs. Their previous roommates kicked them out of their place for strange reasons at the start of quarantine. They're all currently living with the husband's mom in a one bedroom one bathroom apartment. (Sorry the title was a bit click bait-y) Technically my pregnant friend has a place to live, but I know it's going to be super tough on them when the baby does come. The mom sleeps on the sofa, and my friend and her husband take the bedroom. Also their mom lives in subsidized housing, (for older people) so technically no one else is supposed to live there. I'm sure newborn cries may alert the neighbors so there is a possibility they can get kicked out. There's basically no other family in the area that I'm aware of that they would be able to stay with if someone complains.

I'm really stuck on figuring out if I should invite my friend and her husband to move in with me for the time being until they can get back on their feet. There's a nagging worrying feeling I have that is telling me I should be considering this.   


However there is also a side of me that is saying this isn't my problem. I need to focus on my own mental health and well being (I was an au pair at the start of March for my cousin and his newborn and it was very very physically and emotionally stressful). There's a side of me that's concerned about the increased financial burden inviting people over to live with me for an unexpected amount of time, rent free given the employment situation with covid, in addition to just having to live with two new rooommates and a newborn.

67,"I recently started a seasonal job at a major retail store helping with online orders. I have only worked two eight hour shifts so far, but every day I have a manager giving me a stern lecture about something. I understand that being new I'm going to be talked to a lot about mistakes I make which is normally totally fine, but I feel like some of the stuff I'm getting in trouble for is genuinely just because I'm new and haven't gotten the swing of things yet.

The first day, the person training me showed me how to do a few orders and while waiting for my trainer to use the restroom I was approached by a manager and told that I wasn't being productive enough and if I couldn't cut it I needed to find another job because it was unacceptable. I had been on the clock for only a few hours at that point and hadn't even picked any orders on my own yet. I had packaged and prepped orders and thought I did a decent job. The trainer even said that I wasn't doing terrible and that it just takes a minute to get into a routine. 

Yesterday I got yelled at for not taking my lunch break when I actually did. I clocked out and everything like they told me to so I apologized if I made a mistake but I had thought that I had done the correct procedure and would ensure that I wouldn't do it again. It turns out that she had confused me with another seasonal worker. Then at the end of my shift I got yelled at for not finding certain products. I was confused about the online system because it was saying we didn't have any products in stock (apparently you're not supposed to pay attention to that, but no one told me this because I was only trained for a total of four hours before being sent out on my own entirely) and when I went to where they were located in the store/back room there weren't any of the products. I apologized and explained that I was already talked to about not being quick enough so I was trying to go quicker and I was confused at the system. I reminded this manager that it was only my second shift as well as apologized and said that I would pay special attention in order to fix that issue. I got no understanding or help from my manager and just told to do better, but again I've only done this for two days so far. I was also told if by the beginning of next week I'm not doing exponentially better then I will have a serious conversation with one of the managers about my future with the company. 

At this point I'm not sure how I'm supposed to learn the job when I haven't really received adequate training and I'm not given any time to learn or figure things out. The person training me is still expected to keep up their work load while also training me so it isn't really their fault. It is as if they expect me to already know 100% what I'm doing automatically. I'm not sure if this just a bad match for me or if I should still give it time. Everywhere else I've worked has given new people two solid weeks to get a hang of the majority of things. Is it worth it to keep trying or should I start looking for employment elsewhere?",04Nov2020,1

71,"we used to be super great friends back in 8th grade. like, we were seatmates, we always hang out after school, go to places and whatever and like, she's the only one who never laughed at my problems that seemed small to everyone else. she's the only one who understood them.

but ever since 9th grade, i think she just drifted apart. i mean, we belong in the same friend group and all of us hang out every break we got, but she's been very different. it's like she's distant and i'm always tiptoeing around her because one wrong word i say and she gets annoyed and just closes everyone off and it makes the atmosphere for everyone else in the group awkward and uneasy and i hate it because she's my friend, i shouldn't be tiptoeing around her, i should be comfortable around her.

and it just pisses me off because when the pandemic started, she just disappeared for at least three months and deleted all her social media accounts and when she did come back, she never told me anything but some of my other friends knew what happened.

i always see her on twitter posting screenshots of funny conversations she has with her other friends and i'm always wondering why she never messages me like that. i see her posting on twitter almost everyday and so i sent her a message and she left it on inbox, and then proceeded to tweet the days after like she never checks her inbox on twitter.

and when i was tested positive for covid, all my friends in our friend group sent me messages and i'm grateful for that, but she never did. not a single word.

i don't know if i should take this as a sign to cut her off because she's still been nice to me (occasionally). like on my birthday this year, she (with our other friends) made a video with a personal message and sent it to me. she apologized for all her shortcomings as a friend but after that, she never really contacted me again. we probably only talk on group chats and it's like those civil conversations you have with acquaintances and not someone you used to hang out with everyday.

i've talked about this to some people and the reason why i'm also confused whether to cut her off or not is because they said that your friends don't owe you anything. they don't owe you an explanation. and that's what makes me confused because i'm always thinking that maybe i'm being demanding, wanting her to message me because i'm her friend. i thought that maybe they're right, that i shouldn't ask her for explanation because she doesn't owe it to me. maybe i'm just overreacting.",04Nov2020,1
72,"My friend R is really mad at me for saying in front of friend D that there is a something that R wanted to say to D but didn’t. 

R made a comment saying he really wanted to hook up with D’s ex girlfriend. He told me not to tell D. Obviously this comment would have probably made D mad at R. 

I just felt that R should come clean with his secret and acknowledged that a secret existed between Me and R when all three of us were hanging out together. Nothing was mentioned about R saying he wanted to be with D’s ex.

Now R is extremely mad and is calling me “fake friend” and “loser.” I was shocked and in pain for hurting my friend R. R always talks behind people’s backs but gets mad when he gets exposed for it. R has ignored me since and when I call him he says “fuck you.” He started telling our other friends in the group chat to “never trust this man for any confidential information” and “this guy is fake.” 

I’m feel guilty and frustrated with my life right now and I feel like I caused this problem. I want to fix the problems between me and R and hopefully be friends again.

78,"I’m a 15 year old girl and for as long as I can remember my dad has fat shamed me, treated me different to my younger siblings and made very sexist comments about my behaviour. I’ve always been a little bit chubby compared to all the other girls but never officially “overweight”. When I was 8 he started fat shamming me, calling me fat, pointing out my stomach rolls, comparing me to other girls and saying that chubby girls shouldn’t be doing gymnastics (I was doing gymnastics at the time). I never told mum this until I was 9 and she found me crying in my room, I told her that he had been calling me fat and she confronted him. After being confronted, instead of calling me fat he would say stuff like “you’re not fat, you’re just slightly overweight”. This never really stopped. When I was 11 or 12 my parents got a divorce, dad moved away, it was about a 10 hour drive to get to his house and I had to visit him every school holidays for a week (4 times a year). 

When I turned 13 he started blaming all of my emotions in my period, for example he would call me fat, I’d cry and he’d say “oh you’re just crying because you’re on your period”, every time he said this I wasn’t on my period. And then he’d say “is mum treating you okay at home? Is that why you’re crying? You know you can live with me right?”. I stared to develop an eating disorder from all the fat shaming and I wouldn’t eat when I was at his house and he would encourage me to to eat. For my 13th birthday he took me to do a glassblowing course (we were walking) and apparently I said something to pi’s me off and left me on the side of the road in an unfamiliar town to find my open way there. 

Basically he treats me like shit, adore my siblings and praises my siblings for bringing alcohol to him. 

I’ve told mum all of this and she’s agreed to not force me to visit him anymore but recently I sated working at kfc and whenever someone came in that slightly resembled my dad or is wearing a shirt my dad usually wears I get a sinking feeling in my chest and get a slight panicked until I realise it isn’t him.  I mentioned this to one of my friends and they think it might be ptsd because they are suffering from the same thing. I just don’t know how to tell mum that I want to talk to someone and maybe stop the anxiety I get when seeing people like that.

85,"To further explain myself, I started this new job 2 months ago. I graduated this year and am UNBELIEVABLY lucky to have a job right out of college especially right now. Though not at all a job in what I studied, it’s still a job with incredibly nice people. When I applied, they wanted someone who could operate their phones. Though not the main point of the job, it’s still expected of me.
Originally, I was COMPLETELY fine with doing this. I operated phones for 4 years at a college job. Never had an issue. I was confident in my phone skills.
Fast forward to last month where I have a full blown panic attack after floundering around a couple of calls. Everyone at my office has been super sympathetic and assuring me that it’s okay and I can take my time with it. However, now there is more pressure for me to start taking calls again. As per the title, I still feel incredible anxiety over this and struggle to hold back tears at the thought of having to answer calls. I have no idea why.

101,"This is very very odd but I've just barely noticed this...  
My mental health is extremely, extremely tied to my glasses. My OLD prescription that I wore for about... 4 years. When I don't wear any glasses, or I wear my new prescription, I feel an extremely, extremely agonizing twist in my stomach. like something is severely wrong and I'm insane.   


The other thing is: My glasses are BROKEN. literally they are in half, they are split in two places.  


I would be very embarassed to walk around with glasses taped up as much as these would have to be but it seems like the only peace I'm going to get is if I do that.  


Some other factors:  
\- I had an episode recently where I went to the hospital for ocd. The therapist in charge of me there recommended dbt therapy and recommended I get back into my old habits. Perhaps the best way to get back into my old habits would be to use my old glasses atm but still... it's going to suck

\-advice wanted: Should I return my new prescription and ask if they will just renew my old prescription? Would they do that? If my mental health is so tied to a glasses prescription.. do you think I should do this? Perhaps they wouldn't do it because it's against the rules? I don't know if they would give a prescription based on someones ocd or mental health.. but then again maybe I shouldn't feel this way with. Maybe if I ask them I don't have to bring up the mental health aspect but the dizziness or twisting in my gut feeling would matter?  


\-when I got my prescription, I was off some pretty intense meds (resperidone) as in I didn't take them that day after taking them for about a week. perhaps that's good enough reason to go back and change my prescription anyway?  


Also I'm typing all of this with one eye open because that's the half of my glasses that is still in tact..  


I'd also like to say this is the most stable and level headed I've been in like a week as I've typed this.. I feel like the world is finally evening out.. I went through some awful shit this past week feeling insane.. I'm glad but I also feel this dread like the pain I went through this past week will haunt me for life.

TL/DR: a girl I’m talking to seems extremely interested in me, but then doesn’t respond. She posts on Facebook about cute relationship stuff but ghosts me. Has she lost interest? 


So I started chatting with this girl about 4-5 days ago. We hit it off really well! She works, so I can’t text her when she’s off, but when she’s home we usually chat up a storm. Well, the past day/ 2 days, she’s been distant. 3 days ago we were planning on meeting up, we had set up a time ( 2:30-4:30) and place to meet and go out and do some fun activities. The day after, I hit her up to see if we were still on and she said she didn’t know because she wasn’t feeling that great and she’d let me know at 3 ish. She never respond after that and bailed on our plans to meet up. Around 5:30-6 I hit her up asking if she was alright and she had responded that she had some family issues going on and just completely forgot about us. I told her I’d give her her space as she seemed not all with it and kind of upset. Forward to the next day (today); I hit her up with a “hey, what’s up”. She responded likewise and I responded back. She has yet to respond, but she is posting stuff about relationships and what she wants, etc. 

Am I doing something wrong? Is she not sending the message that’s she’s lost interest,  but doesn’t want to hurt me? It seems hypocritical to share about you love when your significant other is obsessed with you, but disregard the person you’re trying to get with.

116,"Long story, will leave to;dr. Also, forgiving spelling, I need to vent.

I work at lube shop. It's got 8 stores in my town (500k population) this job has been profitable, I love it through and through. My boss however, is the pinnacle of what's wrong with this country and makes my life miserable 

For starters, I transferred to the store we work now, to help them out because he (assistant at time) and the other store manager at the time couldn't hold on to people. Plus my boss at old store was incompetent of training people and promoting. 

Day one, we butt heads. He's a try hard ex military my way or highway managing style, which to most of you has to be a shock why he can't keep people long. Even better, he knows nothing about cars. Yes, he works at a lube shop and knows nothing about cars. He got the job because he's friends with our old boss. 

Bear in mind, I pass two lube shops, on the way to come and work here. I have no problem with. But mind you it's 20 miles round trip to work everyday. 

Fast forward, 6 months and tons of bull 🐂 later. He hires his buddy, then we get promoted both of us. And the old boss goes to new store. He's now store manager, I'm assistant. It's like trump's the president and Biden is vice. The two don't click. 

Everyone is required to wear a mask when customer's are present, not his buddy. Everyone has to wear ppe properly and at all times when operating on a car, not his buddy, etc etc. He claims to never show favorites but when I call him out on it, he denys it by lying further. And now every chance dude gets he undermines me as assistant, and looks for reasons to fire me. Make me look like a theif, but can never prove it. Meanwhile, he demands we handover any and all tips to the tip jar which is kept at his place, and he decides how it gets used, never us. Which, spoiler alert is stealing.

And if you don't like him more, he's a trump supporter, he supports white supremacists, and will argue the sky is lime green when you can demonstrate it's clearly not. And thinks the earth's flat.


Tl;dr -Long story short, my boss is being a greedy selfish, immature, and overtly huge prick which robs me of joy, but I just got this promotion doing something I love and making the most money I've ever made, I'm just stressed over this. Do I transfer, work else where, or put up with it???",04Nov2020,1

118,"My boyfriend(20m) and I(20f) currently live with his mom (my MIL) since about January. She just got the news that she’s relocating in December, and she will be going out of state, which my boyfriend and I cannot do since our jobs are here in Cali.

As the title says, we have less than $2000 combined in our savings, and he and I both work part time minimum wage jobs with an average combined salary of $900~ where apartments in my area range from $700-1200. I have a credit score of ~720, where my boyfriend has a score around 500 due to a fraud case involving a house down payment from years ago that he hasn’t yet taken care of.

I do have a full time $16/hr job basically in the bag currently, but I know apartments want you to work at a job for a couple months before they consider it viable income.

We may be able to get roomates since my friend and her boyfriend are looking for an apartment as well, but it isn’t confirmed and im not even sure how to go about that either.

Do you guys have any tips or advice on how I might find an apartment even though we have no renters history and are not making a lot in our jobs?",04Nov2020,1
119,"Hey y’all! Basically I need your help on how to handle a situation.

I have a super close friend who is a few years older than me (21F). I’m currently in college (studying remotely) and taking eight courses (some are half credits dw) so I have an extremely full load and never have time for anything other than school and when I’m not working I just like to chill because I’m so exhausted all of the time.

Now, the friend I’m talking about is very supportive of me and knows all of the pressure that I am under. Every week she asks me to hang out, which completely makes sense, and wants to make sure I stay sane and have some fun, also makes sense. She’s a freelancer and stays at home to work but hangs out with people all the time. I’m also more ambiverted and my social battery is super limited rn and she’s very extroverted and seems to always wants to be around people whereas I need time to recharge on my own. I text her every day and try to facetime her whenever she calls wanting advice, to chat anything when I can.

But, every time we hang out I always need to go take Ubers to go to her and it just gets difficult to manage my time around schoolwork and class times and we just end up sitting and talking at her apartment. Maybe I’m just a homebody, but I’d personally rather just talk over Facetime or something because it just doesn’t seem practical to spend 20 dollars a week going to her place sitting for an hour and a half or so and then Ubering home.

So, this past week has been middterms season and I’ve been stressed out of my mind, even my mom told me how terrible and stressed out I looked and she’s 100% correct I sleep 3 hours a night and am just a flat out mess. I told my friend that I might be hard to reach this week because I had so much going on. I texted her tn cause I was planning on calling her and asked if I could call her tomorrow instead because I have four projects and two tests to work on. She’s an extremely blunt person which ik already but she takes me super off gaurd sometimes - She responded that she knows I know she’s my last priority and doesn’t take offense to it.

Huh? Am I the only one taken back by this? She’s certainly not my last priority - I make more time to talk to her than I do any other person, except for my mom whom I live with.. and I’ve told her AND shown her just how much I have on my plate and I’m literally not ditching her or avoiding her I genuinely do not have spare time. 

Am I being an asshole? She lives alone in an apartment and ik she gets her energy from being around people and makes plans all over the place whenever, and ik she means well and cares about me, but I just don’t think she understands the level of pressure I’m under and that I care about my schoolwork a lot rather than just checking off a box.

What do I respond?

Literally if I didn’t see her every week I’d see nobody because I’m doing. homework. so idk why she thinks she’s last priority. Is it because she doesn’t think I’m making enough time for her? I just don’t know what to say cause her response seems a bit harsh, but, let me know what y’all think! Thanks!",04Nov2020,1

I'm two years away from finishing and lately I don't feel any motivation to continue, which hurts me because my parents provide me with all this and I can't fail them.

However, I always told them that I wanted to study music and they told me that I could learn that with a private teacher or something similar, and although I received that piano education, I always left it because university was my greatest responsibility and as I progressed it required more time and effort.

The last few months I have realized that even though I learned to play piano regularly and continue on my own, I am not who I planned to be at this age, the songs that I listened to years ago and wanted to play now, I cannot play them and I can't stop listening to them, I try to get them out by ear or searching the internet, but I don't have much help and I feel frustrated, but there is something good in it, I feel like I have will because it is what I always wanted to do. With university studies I search and research in the same way but I do it because I feel an obligation to myself and to my parents, but it is something that I cannot hide or stop.

I know she's older now, but just picture the actress Susan Sarandon.

131,"My boyfriend &amp; I (female) have been together for over 3 1/2 years. At this point we just share a friend group, his friends are now mine &amp; vise versa. 
His best friend (male) and I started talking &amp; hanging out more about 1.5-2 years into our relationship. We always hung out as a group but as we got to know each other we just became friends &amp; casually talk on snapchat (just like I do with any other buddy) pretty often. On rare occasion we’ve hungout with other friends w/o my boyfriend, and very, very rarely just alone. 
The only times we’ve hung out alone was earlier this year, when he was having a really hard time &amp; I was genuinely worried about his safety being by himself. He was very suicidal and abusing drugs and he admitted to me that he didn’t know if he could stop himself from hurting himself. (I did contact suicide hotline, parents/family, etc.) Just trying to be there when no one else was, honestly my boyfriend didn’t take his struggles seriously and always told me I was crazy or annoying for reaching out when I noticed he wasn’t doing good. 
Coincidentally, every single time I was with our friend during those times, my boyfriend NEEDED me right then and there &amp; was feeling suicidal. But only when I was with his best friend. I know that this is a very, very touchy thing and I don’t want to invalidate his feelings at all - I know those struggles too well myself. But the circumstances felt very manipulative to me. 
My boyfriend thought it was weird when his best friend and I started hanging out more but he didn’t mention it to me at the time, he mentioned an example of him (bf) working a weekend and my best friend (female,) me and his best friend would hangout. At that point we never hung out alone. I didn’t think it was weird, we were all just kicking it. 
I just wish we could all be friends without the drama, I wouldn’t be weirded out if he was closer with my best friend. I trust him and if he or my best friend did anything shady then I don’t have time for either of them. I don’t think it’s my job to police what he does or who he hangs out with because at the end of the day, If I can’t trust him then I wouldn’t see any value in our relationship to begin with. 
My boyfriend gets really jealous about this, he says he’s scared me &amp; his friend are gonna fall in love and run off together, (wtf??) and I’m confused on where to balance this, because on one side of things I care about his feelings and want to respect his boundaries, but on the other side I don’t think it’s fair to me to lose a friendship over his jealousy when there is nothing going on - on my side at least, I guess I don’t know what his friend’s intentions really are at the end of the day. I’ve expressed this to my boyfriend many times and we’ve openly communicated about this, but he can’t shake the feeling.",04Nov2020,1

 I'm 27 and I just recently graduated and I'm currently unemployed (quit my first job last week because of my boss). My relationship of 5 years is over, bf broke up with me last week. My parents are filling divorce. All in a single week.

So ever since last week I've been feeling terrible cause of all the things happening. I feel like I'm getting old and I lost time. It's like I feel the need to compensate for all those years that passed and I did nothing, I did not enjoyed life, did not party, did not meet different guys, you know? So now I'm on an identity crisis (quarter life crisis maybe?) and I just want to wear crop tops, meet 20yo guys, etc. Act like I'm 20 again you know?

137,"Hey everyone,
I'm sort of grappling with a lot of thoughts and emotions right now so I'll try my best to keep this organized.
I'm a 5th year senior at my 4 year university (did 3 years of community then transferred). 

I'll preface with saying that school has never been easy for me, Ive always struggled a lot and I picked a difficult major based more on job prospects rather than my own skills/interests. I realized this in my junior year and by then decided that it would make more sense to stick it out and finish. Fast forward to this year when it was finally time to pick a specialization (finance) is when I really started running into problems.

I already struggled with so many of the concepts in this major, but combined with the fact that classes are completely online, theres no tutoring for any of my classes, and I'm just working from home all day made things so much worse. I was already just barely scrapping by before but this semester has been awful, I'm failing tests and assignments and struggling to keep up.

I just got my second exam grades back and they were awful, I already had to drop a class this semester and it looks like I'll now fail two more. I feel like a fucking failure, I literally only need 20 credits more to graduate. I can't believe this is happening, I'm literally at a loss, I honestly don't know what to do anymore I have thoughts of killing myself.

I'm living with my parents right now and I'm 22 years old, all my peers from high school and college have graduated and have jobs and I'm literally just a financial liability on my family now. I've barely been able to hold down a part time job while in school, I've only been able to work 2 maybe 3 days a week. I don't know what to do, I just want to graduate and grow up, I feel like I'm stuck in this terrible limbo of being a man child just stuck in school in my childhood home.",04Nov2020,1

146,"I was in an extremely abusive relationship . I hate my abuser (20M)  i despise him, he abused me in all forms and took so much advantage of me . I kept forgiving him because he was my first boyfriend ever and i fell really hard for him. He took my virginity and we dated for a year. 

The last straw was when he had finally gave me a good punch around the end of May this year, breaking my nose and shattering a couple of my lower teeth. After that i ran away from him and LEGITIMATELY ghosted him, i ran to my parents and changed everything my phone number my social media anything i could. I went to the police that same week too and they documented everything. I recieved a FINAL restraining order and They released a warrant out for his arrest and charged him with aggravated assault to the second degree and another felony i dont remember currently. Also they charged him another misdemeanor for my damaging my car (he damaged my entire vehicle)

He was finally caught and arrested in august. He has been locked up ever since. Hes looking at 5-10 years possibly more. It took them 4 months to catch him because he literally fled to new york not even a week after attacking me. In that whole time of waiting for him to be caught i was harrassed and black mailed. He posted a video on instagram of him holding me from behind and  fondling my breasts from when we first became a relationship. He would make all different types of accounts to find me and send me messages saying that i belonged to him and sending me music. He befriended a boy that i had a crush on before him and now they both talk about me. He would degrade me and other woman on his social media and flaunt about abusing them. As you can already tell this guy has no life no future and no purpose. I was young and i made the silly mistake of choosing him and ive committed to refraining from all relationships until i graduate college. He was basically a wolf in sheeps clothing.

My work met with me and said they know me, they believe that what I said and what these people thought I said was completely off and they are not firing me.

150,"Now I know this may be a silly thing to be upset over..I think?

My boyfriend (22M) and I (20F) have been together for almost 2 years. I’m extremely left; I would say left of Bernie Sanders. I would say I’m extremely passionate about politics and advocacy and am currently working toward a career path in criminal justice reform. I would say my boyfriend is generally uninvolved in politics but he’s also left and voted for Sanders in the primary. 

For the past couple of weeks, he told me that he probably won’t be voting. I wasn’t upset about this, especially with how disillusioned people have become this year with politicians/politics in general. Tonight, a couple of hours ago, he tells me that he voted for Kanye West. I asked if he was joking and he most definitely wasn’t and when I explained why that upset me (supported trump, comments about slavery/abortion, etc.) he said “he sure did” as in referencing what West has said in the past. 

For me, this has been difficult to hear. I 100% understand why people have chosen not take this election seriously and the growth of distain for American politics. But to know my partner voted for someone who has said things that are completely against what I stand for/my beliefs is not something I can take lightly. 

Am I overreacting here? How do we have a productive conversation about this? 

Thanks for any insight. 

Tl;Dr: I (20F) found out tonight that my boyfriend (22M) voted for Kanye West. I’m extremely left standing in terms of politics and involved while my boyfriend does not care much and feels as if this whole election is a “troll” election. I’m having a hard time digesting this information. Am I overreacting about this? How do I have a productive conversation about this?",04Nov2020,1
151,"I've had this friend since high school (we're both 20 now) and we're fairly close, but haven't talked as much as we used to since we go to different universities. A while ago he casually mentioned a post he made on Reddit. Afterwards, I was curious as to whether I could actually find that post - I didn't expect to, but I did. And me being the curious person I am decided to take a peek at his other posts.

I know - it's a terrible invasion of his privacy and I shouldn't have done it. I still feel bad for trying to find it, but when I saw his posts I found a lot of stuff he wrote that indicates he has pretty severe depression. We've talked a bit since and I've tried to make it clear that he can talk to me about anything since he's told me a few things that have been bothering him (nothing as big as what I found, though), but I've never directly asked something like 'are you okay?' because usually people just say 'yeah, I'm fine' even if they're not okay so I figure I won't get a real answer.

Since I found that out, I've been pretty worried for him and since I don't know how to ask him directly I've occasionally checked his profile a few times since just to see how he's doing (again, I know it's bad, but I don't know what else to do), and it looks like things are only getting worse for him.

I want to let him know he can talk to me and I've just written up a text saying something along the lines of 'hey, it seemed like something was on your mind when we last talked, I don't know if there's anything you want to talk about but I'm here if you need someone', but I don't know if I should send it. For context, a text like that would be very out of character for me (I try to be very conscious of other people's feelings but I'm not good with asking people directly if there's something wrong and I don't usually get that personal) so I don't want him to suspect that I already know what's going on.

Should I leave things be and pretend I don't know anything because he hasn't actually told me anything? Or should I be checking up on him and making sure he's okay? I'm worried for his safety and mental health and I just want to be there for him and do what I can to help. I just don't know if it's more helpful to him if I'm there or not.

I'd really appreciate any advice anyone can give on this.",04Nov2020,1

I have student loans I don’t pay on, $4,000 in medical bills, and my car broke down and never came out of the shop so I’m still paying on a car I don’t use while I drive my mom’s car.

I'm definitely good at it, I can usually whip out an A+ assignment when I need to, but I'm far too lazy for that so I just end up cheating If I can, which morally I fucking hate about myself. I don't really know what I want to do at all, but goddamn the thought of working in this vague ass field sounds like torture. I don't even know what a Computer Scientist is!! I work a minimum wage retail job full time right now to pay for school but honestly I don't even like that either. I genuinely have no clue what I want to do with my life. Honestly, I don't even think I care all that much about being alive at this point either. Not to say I'm suicidal, I don't think I am, but If I were to find out I was gonna die tomorrow, I wouldn't really give a damn either way. I've tried everything to find some path, something to work towards but I can't. I even took a whole year away from school to try and figure things out, and even though I thought I had a pretty good idea of things, this semester just reminded me of just how wrong I was. I have no goals, and while I would like to set some, I can't think of any. I sleep 3 hours a night now, eat one proper meal every two days, and do nothing but daydream about being a cooler better version of myself that honestly is nothing like me in real life all day (Think Maladaptive Daydreaming).

I was with this person the entire first half of my twenties and we lived with each other for 3 years. After about two months I tried to accept it was over. I went to a friend's (small) gathering at a bar and I saw an another old friend. We ended up hooking up that night. This was about two weeks ago. This friend is let's say promiscuous. I do not judge for that. That is her choice. She has a lot of rules about it all. She doesn't let people stay over, only does so many times, tries not to talk them much. I've been breaking all of these rules she set. Things got a bit weird one night and she told me that she doesn't necessarily ""like me"" like that but she is scared that she could. I didnt know what to say besides all I want to do is respect her boundaries because I like being around her. We still have hung out and hooked up since. I've been thinking about it and I want to tell her I don't think id mind if she did. She thinks I deserve a life of being able to hookup with no connections. But I've never been that person. I've realized my ex was kinda boring, I lost a lot of friends because of her, and we didn't do much the last 5 years besides see each other. This new person is confident, and so much fun. I haven't had this much fun with someone in years. And that has me thinking that sleeping around isnt what I wanted to do. I just want to be with someone and confident and fun as her.

I'm just going to keep this as short as possible. At my job we have this policy where due to the current pandemic people are required to stay home for 2 weeks if
they are feeling unwell. I am actually completely healthy at the moment (or so it seems for the most part). But I've been under a lot of stress lately and
have been having trouble sleeping and keeping sane. My job has been draining me (long story) and I want to take some time off because this stress I feel will
eventually effect my health negatively. I was thinking of calling in sick to take some time off to relax and recouperate mentally. But I feel bad about lying...

At my job I don't have benefits like vacation and my health benefits for things like therapy because they were used up on something else. I thought by just taking some time
off to chill out at home may do some justice for me. I'm not too concerned about not making money for 2 weeks because I have enough saved up to take a break.

176,"I will try and keep this as short and concise as possible, but bare with me as I need to go into some detail about my past. Starting at about the onset of puberty, I began to experience intense social anxiety. The main reason i see for this, was that my parents never asserted much control over my life nor  disciplined me in any way, and so I ended up spending the latter half of my childhood years locked to a screen. I wasn't having the sorts of experienced that build character, make you an interesting person, the sorts of experiences that people use to relate to each other. I would hang out with friends occasionally, but most of the time I would dissociate from whatever was going on in my life by watching YouTube videos. I wasn't really learning, or developing my emotional and social skills. I wasnt learning how to problem solve, or how to commit myself to something. How to have intimate relationships with others. I had stronger emotions then, and I was a very happy extroverted kid so my parents never really felt that they needed to push me. But even then I remember never feeling anger, or sadness, never crying, never being able to empathize with someone enough to feel their pain as my own. This was a key developmental period and I didn't utilize it in any way. From then on, I started isolating myself more and more, spending my days in my room instead of being with my family. Not trying to meet new people and build new relationships. Because my parents never disciplined me, I never had any self discipline, so I didn't ever set goals for myself and achieve things. In 7th grade, my stepdad attempted suicide, and I lost it. All innocence and happiness dissipated immediately. I recall not being capable of smiling for that entire year. I didn't feel much, except anxiety and awkwardness. I started smoking weed heavily at 13, which I regret significantly, as it made me feel less. After my two younger siblings were born, my parents didn't really have the time or energy to parent me, so they just kind of let me do my own thing. There was no parenting or mentorship available, so the self-neglectful behaviors only snowballed from there. They didn't know that I was doing nothing with my life, that the hours I spent in my room were being wasted. It's not their fault, I know they were doing the best they could with what they had, but I never learned the necessary life skills that others did. At a certain point, I stopped feeling love mostly. Fast forward to December of freshman year. My social skills were horrible, and I had no friends really. I texted in full punctuated, multi-sentences messages, which turned almost everyone off, and my presence made most people uncomfortable as I radiated anxiety and desperation. Then... I met my soul mate, a friend who I related to on every level of my being. But the relationship was born from and sustained by weed smoking. Heavy, heavy, weed smoking. Sometimes an eighth a day between two people. It made my social anxiety disappear, and I could talk like normal people. I learned how to say stupid silly things, how to be normal I guess. But slowly I stopped caring about school entirely and thinking about the repercussions this would have on my brain. My friend was self-destructive and rarely thought about his future, so I in turn became self-destructive and stopped thinking about my future. Then I came across the teachings of Alan watts and Ram Dass, great spiritual teachers. I was entranced and basically let everything else go, I thought if I transcended my ego, and become desire-less, everything would be okay. I neglected my relationships, stopped doing any school work really and made it my mission to experience reality without the filter of my mind. I wanted to stop thinking. Instead of doing what Ram Dass and Alan Watts REALLY teach, which is fulfilling your roles beautifully just without identitifying with them, by not destroying your ego, (individual identity) but to instead not identify with it, I abandoned my roles and tried to destroy my ego. I became obsessed with the guru stories, particularly the miracles, and developed a very delusional and distorted view of reality. Looking in retrospect, I thinking this was the oncet of drug induced psychosis. I decided to move in with my dad because I didn't want to face my failure in school and in life generally, so I chose to run, believing I would somehow have discipline there. Before moving there, my father had been alone completely alone, crippled by his severe untreated mental illness for over five years. I would go out into woods behind our house every day for sometimes 6-7 hours, and listen to the same spiritual lectures over and over again. I would also smoke extremely large amounts of weed, sometimes up to 12 bowls a day. I was not learning anything else for the twelve months that I was up there. What I thought was meditation, was nothing more than extreme dissociation. I forgot how to think, how to feel. I became incapable of carrying a conversation, and my thoughts became very jumbled. I eventually stopped talking at all. I'd be in the car with my dad, and he'd be talking to me, but I'd just sit there quietly... dissociating. I wanted to exist as pure consciousness, what's referred to in hinduism as the Atman. I was very confused, and mistook my pathological state of mind for a state of transcendence. I had a very delusional notion that I clung to for dear life, that every single thing that happens is predetermined or destined, and thus when I heard about other people's problems or terrible things going on in the world I didn't react emotionally. Eventually, during one of my trips to Seattle that friend I mentioned earlier told me that he smoked fentanyl, and I didn't feel anything. At that moment I knew something was very very wrong with me. I thought that what I wanted, for months, was to exist in a state of thoughtless awareness. But I am 16, there are many many things I need to be thinking about. I started to panic, and over the next few days I came to the conclusion that I had gone completely crazy. Over the course of the next month, I had uncontrollable thoughts brutally dissecting all my memories and using them as evidence that I've always been fucked up, that I've always been crazy. The thoughts told me that I would never get better, that the only option is to commit suicide, that there's no way I'll make it in the world. I felt that my life was completely over. I started to dissociate more and more, my thoughts became more and more incoherent, until I stopped being able to think. I then moved back home, and have been seeking medical care ever since. My thoughts are disconnected fragments that fade out before they ever finish. I'm not able to feel empathy at all, and not only empathy, all other emotions as well. I feel nothing... nothing at all. No happiness or sadness, no fear of love, no pleasure of emotional pain. I also have no access to my memories anymore, what used to be detailed videos in my head are now foggy and minimal. I am hardly able to have a conversation, because a conversation is an exchange of thoughts; if your thoughts are completely incoherent there's no way of connecting with people. If feels like I'm completely on autopilot, like I'm just watching my life go by without any control over it at all, without any control over what I say or do. I can hardly read anymore, as my brain is unable to piece the words together automatically. It feels as though my brain is malfunctioning, and that my mind has nearly disappeared. I know this may be hard to believe, since I'm able to articulate myself so well, but there aren't coherent linear trains of thought which are translating into this writing. Nobody I've explained my situation to really believe the extent of my mental dysfunction because of this. My ability to write elegantly creates the illusion of mental integrity. My question to you is, is this really a life that is worth living? Without emotions, is there any reason at all to go on living? I don't plan on commiting suicide, as it doesn't really solve my problems, so you don't need to comment about that. I just don't see a possible road to recovery. I'm getting a psychiatric evaluation in a month and a half, but all that they can really do is give a name to catagorize my symptoms, prescribe medications which may or may not improve things, and give me a therapist. But talking to someone will not make me feel again, it will not teach me to how to think again. It feels completely hopeless. I would give anything to feel sadness, to just be crippled by sorrow or anger. I regret not appreciating my anxiety more, at least anxiety is a feeling. Please, if you have any advice for me or have experienced something similar yourself, let me know. It would mean more than I can say. Thank you for reading this, god bless.",04Nov2020,1

The only issue is my school is online only, and we can classes every semester. I'm scared that we won't make it back until next semester and I won't get another chance. I did a bit of searching, but I couldn't find any social media profiles, or anything else relating to her. (Not trying to be creepy, just tried to find a way to contact her.) 

I'm running out of ideas and don't know what to do. Please help, thank you in advance!",04Nov2020,1

I'll make my story short. I live in Australia. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression that has prevented me from moving into a 'real' job, hurt my studies and motivation. It led me down a path of alcohol addiction and doing a lot of things I am not proud of. My family are supporting me on my path to recovery and I am planning to return to study. I was recently accepted in an Honours program for a psychology degree. Now that I'm getting treated I want to put my life back together and meet some great people. Guys and girls.

I've also never slept with anyone because of this anxiety and fear of judgement.

Hobbies include: Films and TV, heavy metal music, history, working out at the gym, psychology, US politics, art, trying different foods, occasional video games, atheism, writing, bushwalks, most things horror-related.

Not expecting much, but would love to at least talk to anyone. Please message me if you would like to chat. Have a good day.",04Nov2020,1

I thought people who refused to get tested for covid-19 (“I’m not sick, it’s just a cough. I don’t feel sick) especially if they show symptoms were either ignorant or uneducated. So sad that my bf of a million years may fall in either category, but doesn’t change that he could spread whatever he has, especially since he works at a clinic! 

How can I tell him without being condescending that it isn’t about HIM and that he could be putting other lives at risk? My uncle died of COVID-19 so it makes me sad that people would be so reckless. 

An even tougher question is how do I come to terms that I even have to be telling my bf this? Smh",04Nov2020,1

183,"It's the start of term 2 in my jr. high school. We're doing presentations that are about us called ""all about me"". The name is self explanitory. 

I will say though, I am anti-LGBT, but I'm respectful about it. I don't scream in a gay couple's face about how Hell's warming up for them when they kiss, I just try to avoid it. I know, I know, you're probably going to feel biased to immediately hate me, but just hear me out. Sorry if I break rule #5, I don't mean any hurtful words to the LGBT community

Today a girl named Catherine went to present. She pulled up her google silde with the stuff. On it she had things she liked, such as harry potter, our region's NBA team, and... the lesbian flag. I was fine with it; she do her, I do me. But here's the kicker. She had the NBA team logo in the bottom LEFT corner, and the Lesbian flag in the bottom RIGHT. Catherine began to present and explain her interests and hobbies, and when she got to the flag, all she said was: ""The bottom LEFT is self explanitory"". I got confused. Did she mean that she obviously loved the NBA team? Her presentation ended, and the teacher let us ask questions. I asked ""what did you mean by bottom left?"". Mind you, the flag was in the bottom RIGHT. There was an awkward silence, and then the teacher just said ""we respect your privacy"".

HERE COMES THE CONFLICT. The thing is, I have no fear when it comes to my beliefs, like Christian Martyrs in ancient times. So, I put the anti-lgbt flag on my slideshow. The teacher said we're going in alphabetical order on who presents, and my last name starts with S. Catherine's starts with B. If my calculations are correct, I have roughly 7 days until I have to present. I want to tell my mom about what happened in class, but I fear that when I present, the Teacher will be angered by the anti-LGBT flag and phone call my mom, and she will go ""Why didn't you tell me you were gonna put the flag?!?!"" or, if I do tell her, She will be angered at my choice of beliefs (her childhood best friend was her cousin; a gay man).    

But, what if I tell her about the situtation, she just shrugs it off, and when the 7 days pass, she'll defend me from the phone call because she saw what I saw/took a stroll in my shoes? I mean, I don't want war between a teacher and my mom (it's happened before, It's bitter), but at the same time, I ALWAYS stand up for my beliefs. So what do I do?

184,"Hello, this will be my first time writing on reddit! English is not my first language, so I'm really sorry if I make any spelling mistake/ grammar.

On sunday, I got bored and open instagram, nothing special. Until I decided to unfollow some weirdass meme account. When I'm checking my ""following"" section, I noticed that I'm not following my friend's second account.

A little backstory, my friend and I have been friend for 7 years. We met at 3th grade in elementary school and we've been the bestest friend since then.

 Unfortunately, my parents have to move because of work when I'm in 6th grade. We kinda lost contact because I'm dumb as fuck back then. (I frickin delete my line, the only way I can message her, for some shitty game).

 I got her contact back at 8th grade though. We chat a bit, but we became so awkward (which obviously because of me). I hate myself so much lmao.

 On 9th grade, I make myself an instagram account and tell her about it. She followed me with her first account and second account. 

On her second account, she only followed her close friends. Like about 8 people?. And I tell you, she is very very pretty, fun, nice, and her drawings are super nice. AND AFTER I LEFT HER FOR SOME SHITTY ASS GAME SHE STILL THOUGHT ME AS HER CLOSE FRIEND? AND I'M NOT EVEN PRETTY. OR FUN. OR RICH. She's so nice I can't-

I was so happy that i jumped around my room like a kid.

Back to the topic. When I checked my following section, I noticed that I'm not following her, AND she's not following me. I think she removed me from her follower list? And then unfollow me? Like mmm what? I've never chated her in like 3 months? Why are you angry at me :(.

I don't know what should I do. If I ask her directly, I'm afraid she'll just follow me again because she feel awkward that I asked her about that.

Can someone give me advice? Thank you so much!",04Nov2020,1

I didn’t end up voting after that, and I don’t know how to feel at this point. His antisemitism and bullshit has bother me for a while, but is the a best course of action at this point?

190,"I have struggled with mental health issues from a young age, specifically Major Depression, Anxiety, and Suicidal ideation. I didn’t expect to live this long. I’m 18 and in university. A few years back I received a back injury that left me with a crushed spinal plate. I’m lucky though as I can walk, the downside though is intense pain from small tasks or standing and sitting for too long. Finally, to end it, from a young age I was expected to go to university and my mother had saved to help pay for our tuition. But my mother then used my tuition money on my siblings. (I’m the youngest in my family.) There’s always been issues in my family but thats a story for another day, the money wasn’t spent on education like intended (as only me and my sister attend university) but instead things like a truck, travel, bills, etc. With my back injury I have issues getting jobs so money for tuition is difficult, I’ve even considered doing more risky things for money but I can’t bring myself to do it. 
I have been very unhappy in university and have had issues with my professors (mainly due to remote classes and my professors not knowing how to use technology.) I feel like I’m falling farther and farther behind by the day. If I stop going to university I lose my orphans fund (as I lost my father as a child) I gain a bit of money each month, the majority of it goes to bills but some is saved for tuition. 

I don’t want to be a university student anymore. I know it will upset my mother and I will be scolded by my family but I’m so tired and depressed. I don’t feel like I am learning anything of value and due to my mental illness and physical injury I’m worried work wise I won’t be able to get a job even if I leave university. It’s terrible to feel so vulnerable but I don’t know what to do or how to solve this, do I keep shelling out thousands each year of money I can either barely scrounge up or will eventually have to go into debt to continue my classes? Or do I drop out and possibly become unable to return to my classes, and at the risky place of not being guaranteed work or even a stable home?",04Nov2020,1

195,"Hi friends. I’m coming to the slow realization that I’ve lost touch with myself. I’m trying to pinpoint a time, but I’d guess it’s been getting to this point for about a year now. COVID quarantine has escalated things I think. Let me give some backstory. 

I’m pre-med, and I’m a sophomore in college right now. All of my classes are online and I don’t see friends (haven’t since March) and I’ve only seen my boyfriend four times since March. A year ago, the fall semester of my freshman year, I loved life. I started utilizing the university gym. I had straight As. I saw my friends all the time. I was active in my church, and saw my family all the time. Life was good. Now, I have mostly Bs and a C. I have no motivation to do anything. I don’t work out, I don’t study, I don’t read anymore, and I don’t see my friends (because of COVID,  but it still sucks.) My only source of socialization is working part time at a hospital, but as you’d guess that’s a source of stress right now more than anything. My grades are slipping because I don’t care about anything anymore. What’s scariest though is that recently I’ve noticed it’s not just that I’m “lazy”....I think I’ve actually gone numb. I don’t have thoughts and emotions and reactions to things like I used to. I feel like my subconscious is fading away. I used to have a little thought process and I constantly thought about things, had conversations in my head, heard songs in my head... but now it’s pretty empty. Things don’t really hurt my feelings the way they used to either. I’m pretty “meh” about everything. 

Is this depression? I don’t feel depressed though? Is it burnout? I’m only 19 how could I possibly be burned out? I just wanted some advice on some stuff I could do to maybe reattach my mind back to my body. Should I meditate? Start running? Journal? I’m starting to feel pretty miserable.

Thise were the most embarrassing 30 seconds of my life. And two because I wanted to know what is like to be in a relationship and also because I would never get the change to date someone again.

It got too crazy so we came back home with 6 protestors we gave them water and the neighbor saw and started cussing and was shit talking us basically until they were gone and was questioning my mom why we went out there and my mom said ""my two son's that went out side not me I didnt tell them to go outside it was their  decision to do so""

So today my brother was walking by and the land lord son/neighbor told my brother in a rude way not to bring protestors in again which we had no intention of doing again anyways.

201,"I got access to private chats between these two women and the company owner. I shouldn't have, but I needed to protect myself.

Essentially both my girlfriend and me are being constantly targeted by these two coworkers. It usually unfolds like this: I do or say something, one of these two tells what I said to the other one either ignoring facts or plainly using it as an excuse to insult us behind our backs, and then one of these two tells the same story to our boss (company owner).

Same deal if my girlfriend (who I work with) says something.

For example, we are currently working from home because of the virus. I had a brief call with one of them, and during the call someone rang the doorbell. I apologized for being interrupted and said ""sorry, it's the doorbell, I can still talk, jenny's there"", and kept on with the call. My girlfriend (jenny) got the door.

Right after the call, this woman texted the other one literally saying:

- **Her:** I was in a call with Peter when the doorbell rang. It was Jenny. Where do  you think she went? :D

The implication here, of course, was that my girlfriend was not at home during working hours...

- **Other:** jesus... what the hell?

- **Her:** I don't know... or maybe he said ""Jenny was gonna get that""...

Besides the blatant attempt to smear her, she was absolutely doing nothing because her manager (one of these two) didn't give her anything to do for the entire day in spite of my girlfriend telling them she had finished her job, which means she was not  busy at all. But that of course didn't matter, it was about trying to smear her, nothing more.

And the worst part is this: **the other woman immediately told OUR BOSS the same story on chat just a minute later...**

This thing has been going on for a while. Nobody's doing anything to actually punish her nor me professionally, but this purposely negative gossip is relentless.

1. I will get my homework ready and tell him I know how to do it myself he will then insist on helping and hover over me.

2. He will claim that I did something incorrectly even though I didn’t and then we have to find a video showing how to do said subject and he makes us watch the whole thing to see whether or not I’m doing it correctly even though I am and already tell him I’m sure I know how. This will normally waste about an hour on an assignment that is essentially only meant to be twenty minutes long. 

3. He will then finally let me do my work for a little while but then he’ll come back to “help me” and I’ll spend another hour explaining my homework to him and by now I’ve wasted at least two or three hours to do only one or two assignments when I could have done at least 6

205," Me (42M) and my ex (28F, 50% avoidant style) broke up in June due to my insecurities which I had seek help for and is improving. She saw the improvements and came back to try several times but kept pulling away once I have a slight relapse. She had blocked me twice already and came back approx a month later both times to start talking again.

The latest being she unblocked me and called me from the hospital as she had appendicitis. I stayed with her through the night where she literally have no one else. Not even her parents as she pushed them away. We were back to fixing the relationship but she said there's no guarantees because she don't know if she is still attracted to me. Then I thought she lied to me about something and I started digging deeper but she thought that I have not improved and is interrogating her. She stormed out of the house and ignored my messages but didn't block me. I was pushing my luck and bombarded her with messages trying to get a response. She then blocked me. So I packed up all her stuffs and went over to her house to return them.

She came out of the house and I apologised telling her that its all just a misunderstanding, I didn't mean to dig as I thought she lied to me but she didn't. She began to sob and mumbled ""I wanted to spend my life with you."", causing me to sob hard too. Perhaps me returning her stuffs made her realise she might lose me for good. We hugged and sobbed. She touched my face and wiped my tears tenderly. There was a lot of emotions and for her to sob, showing vulnerability, is not common for her dismissive avoidant nature. It is kind of contradicting because she said she had lost attraction for me and there's no feelings. I explained why I asked so many questions because there's a misunderstanding, not because I have a relapse. She seem to take the explanation and before I left, she promised to give it all a good think on whether she still wants to fix things.

Next week she is sending me to the hospital for surgery so she told me to email her the details since I'm blocked. Overnight, I realised she unblocked me. I left her alone. I want to know why she unblocks me when the surgery is a week away and that she already told me to email her the details. She has absolutely no reason to unblock me - which made me think it might be a positive. Though she knows very clearly that I do not want to be friends. If she has to move on, she has to cut me off. She knows that clearly and knows my expectations.

215,"Hello, I've had a lot of my head lately and wanted to get feedback and advice. It's long so you have been warned. I posted this on a different reddit last week too but I updated it in this post.

Before I begin, I'm 33 years old, male. Never been in a relationship. I didn't really start trying until I was like 18 or so and have only improved since. I really came a long way but I still have so much to learn. I'm not sure why I haven't gotten a girlfriend yet other than not going out much and not having certain skills. I'm a very nice guy although quiet. I'm also nerdy. I am going to start exercising and eating healthy to get in shape, physically feel better, and to look better. Looks are important and maybe that is why I haven't gotten a girlfriend? At the moment I'm out of shape (long story short: in high school I got skinny but it literally did nothing; so I hope this doesn't repeat itself although I'm more social than I ever was in hs).

I noticed that I tend to like girls too quickly. It makes me really confused because I don't really know what I want. I mean, yeah, I want a girlfriend for companionship, but I guess I don't really know who I like because I'm blinded by the attention I get from an attractive girl. This is a problem for me because I quickly get my hopes up, imagine things, and then get disappointed when things don't go how I expected them to.

So, before I begin, I also want to say that my libido is extremely high! I was not like this in high school or whenever the libido is at it's highest (which I think is normally in high school). This may not be a problem for most guys but it is for me because I don't have that many friends and it's not like I have the skills to bang any chick. The big issue is that I really respect women especially the women I personally know. I try not to be perverted (checking them out, etc.) and I even felt bad sometimes checking out random women. But now? I do it ALL THE TIME! I just can't help it. I really feel like a pervert now. I really think about sex almost all day long! I see attractive women and I wish I could have sex with them.

If I had to make a guess, I would say that my libido increased tenfold because I stopped taking my anti-depressants. I read on google that antidepressants kinda keep the libido at bay. So now that I haven't taken meds for several months, my libido is really high.

Below I'll write some information on girls I've recently been into or that I am into. Maybe you can see something I can't.

**Elaine** \- Met her at work last year. She was 19 at the time. I wanted to get to know her so I introduced myself and started talking about movies one day. Then for the next few weeks we didn't really speak much. I quickly gave up because I don't know what to talk about with some people, usually with girls I am interested in. So that's how it was for a very short while. I still said hi and stuff so I wouldn't look weird or whatever.

Then one day we were in the breakroom together. Sitting near each other and she started talking to me. We learned some cool things about each other and that was the start of our friendship. During this time I was so happy and looked forward to work. I also started eating cleaner and managed to lose weight. I did it to impress her.

Things were going well. Way better than I expected. I wanted more though. I wanted to hang out with her outside of work. But she always came up with something. I believed her at first and I respected her decision. She also introduced me to weed. I started doing it to eventually hang out with her (but we never did.

Then she quit working there and we saw each other less. We also texted each other less. I was still hanging on because she always said really nice things about me. She said I was (one of two people) from that workplace that she really considers a real friend. She implied in the past that we would be friends for a very long time (talking about years), and all that stuff. She even texted me a sweet birthday message (she only knew my bday because she wrote it down after I saved her birthdate) and told me she was gonna take me out to eat whenever she got paid.

But she never took me out to eat even though I had told her I could pay. Speaking of birthdays, I gave her some nice shoes on her bday and she said she was going to wear them and send me a picture. She never did. Anyways, I was so sad that she made another excuse. Then near the end of last year she told me she had a boyfriend. I was so sad but it was what it was. I still kept in touch with her but not as much as before.

What Elaine did that got me really mad was the fact that she came to visit where I work a few months ago and she just said hi, how I'm doing, and went inside. If I was such a good friend to her, she could've spent a few minutes talking to me. But she didn't. To me that was it. I stopped texting her and everything. Eventually she did text me a few times just asking when she can return some stuff I let her borrow. I always made excuses because I feel so hurt by her. And the last time she texted me, I didn't even reply back. This was like 2-3 months ago. 

Even though I was only friends with her for a year, I still can't stop thinking about her every day (although less and less as of this update). I only have negative things about her. I just can't keep her out of my head. It's not THAT unusual though. Years ago in college, I liked this one girl and even though I barely even talked to her (she was really weird and didn't speak much), I wasn't able to get her out of my head for a few years.

Okay, lets move on to the present. This will be much shorter.

**Sara** \- Met her at work last year and have developed a nice friendship with her. She's about 7 years older than me. She's very attractive and a nice person. I really enjoyed working with her. She had to leave the country around the time the pandemic started. But we added each other so we could talk. And we did talk for a few weeks but I'm quiet and don't really have much to talk about unless it's nerdy stuff so I stopped messaging her.

A mutual friend of ours informed me recently that she's coming to visit next month! So I was thinking about messaging her again to hang out with her. I'm not going to lie, I would like to date her but I really feel like a kid because of my lack of experience. Besides, she probably has a boyfriend. She did have one when she left and they were going to do it long distance. In any case, whether she has a bf or not, I do want to see her again. I'm just nervous I won't have much to talk about.

**Sally** \- New girl at work. She's about 22. I met her about a 2 or 3 weeks and so far we get along pretty well. There's not much to say other than the only reason I actually bring her up is because she is an attractive girl that talks to me. I mean, she thinks I""m nice and all otherwise she wouldn't talk to me. But it's different for me. A pretty girl talking to me feels very nice and part of me wonders if she could be interested in me. I can acknowledge that she hasn't done any thing to show any romantic interest in me (even if she did, I wouldn't know. I'm clueless). The only thing I did notice is she does ask me to explain work related stuff with her. My wishful thinking hopes she's doing that just to spend time with me. Oh and I almost forgot, when she was on the phone, I felt disappointed in myself thinking what if she has a bf? In any case, I recently lost interest in her because of a new girl at work (Sara 2)

**Sara 2** \- New girl at work. She's about 18 I think. She's only been working a few days but so far I'm making good progress. By progress I mean we're speaking and laughing the few times we bump into each other at work. I also used the word ""progress"" because sometimes I guess I'm intimidated by a girl I like and I don't end up doing too well (as I had hoped at least).

I barely know her but now she's been on my mind for the past few days. I don't even care about the other girls I'm interested in (including the strong lust I had on my boss because she's sexy). It's not even about looks... well... kinda. I'm not sure how to explain myself, but I find her very attractive. But I'd be able to understand if people didn't find her attractive. She looks very tomboyish (and based on some of her hobbies, it makes sense).

Anyways, ""liking"" Sara this much, this fast, without knowing much about her makes me sad because I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be successful in dating her. I'm not trying to set myself up for disappointment, but she's like 18, I'm like 15 years older, people say I look my age (33) but because of my facial hair, I think I look much older. I also don't want people at work to see me as a creep because I'm not.

As much as I want to be around her at work, I might avoid her because the more time I spend with her, the more I'll like her and that's just going to hurt me more and more. In fact, I was walking around work today depressed thinking about this.

I talked to one of my best friends about this and he suggested I keep trying to talk to Sara and see where it goes and I agree. I don't like to give up. He gave me some good advice and hopefully I'll be brave enough to do it.

I think that about covers it. I'm not like this way to every attractive girl that talks to me. Not like that. But I think you can see a pattern here. I'm trying to figure myself out.  I know I want to be in a relationship but I don't have the experience. I also want to have sex, badly but luckily I don' t have to worry about that now. I just wish I wasn't like this. I don't want to feel confused and not know when I like someone or confusing it with liking them.

What do you make of all this? What do you suggest? I'm going to talk about this with my therapist as well. But our sessions are only 1 hour long and not nearly enough. If you want to know more, feel free ask.

One other thing I forgot to mention and this happens often recently. I quickly jump from one girl to another based on what happens. I get too excited, too quickly. lol",04Nov2020,1
216,"I am 18M in college right now. I am not happy here. I don’t want to continue doing this. I used to want to do this. I wanted to major in Forensic Science and become a CSI but recently I’ve started not feeling so sure and I’ve started feeling like maybe it isn’t what I want to do. I am not doing particularly well in college, i have already had to drop 2 classes and might fail the only other 2 that I am taking this semester. I don’t know what to do. I am not sure what I want to do. My only real passion is video games and I know it isn’t realistic to try and turn that into a career overnight especially since I am not very good at video games. My point is I don’t really know which direction to take my life. Drop out of college and pursue a video game career, or drop out and apply at a trade school, or drop out and join the military, or just drop out and find a low paying job to just get by, or keep going through college. I don’t have anybody here to help me decide what I want to do. Everybody in my life just keeps saying, “Keep doing college MAYBE you’ll like it when you start studying your major”. But that’s maybe. I don’t want to end up not enjoying it and waste 4-5 years of my life just to change it. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks all!",04Nov2020,1

219,"I'm 16F and I've recently started homeschooling (by my own choice) but since I was signed up late, by the time I figured out how to sign into my classes (I take 3) I was bombarded with 30+ late assignments in each class. Right now I have over 100 late assignments (in total) that were due by Oct 28. I will admit I did procrastinate for a bit but in the beginning I did a couple assignments in each class. If this means anything, I do have depression and anxiety so I get overwhelmed very easily and I tend to feel unmotivated to do anything. My mom said that I must have all my classes finished by the end of this week and it stresses me out because if I can't complete them all by Friday I won't be able to visit my boyfriend. I feel like she's expecting way too much of me and making me overwork myself.

221,"Im 25, female, she/her, and i still wives at home with my mom. With the U.S. election, I've been making an effort to talk to my very republican mom more often about certain issues to kind of practice my debate skills, see where she stands, and see if I can educate her about topics that I am passionate about, that I know she doesn't know very much about.

We came to the topic of abortion rights and planned parenthood. She said she was personally against abortion, but was in favor of women having the right to choose. She had a problem with planned parenthood and government funded abortions, and I tried to tell her that only a small portion of pp's services is abortions, and no abortions are carried out with tax payer money. She told me I should look up the nefarious things that pp has done. And insisted that they occasionally carry out late term abortions, even on healthy fetuses. 

I didnt know how to respond. I dont think any competent doctor would do an abortion past the second trimester without there being something seriously wrong. But she disagreed. Any recommendations on where I can do some research on this topic? 

When I'm in a heated discussion, I tend to forget the points that would help me and can't find the right words to express my opinion. It all seems to fly out of my head and I feel like an idiot when I cant remember terms or get distracted on a certain point and loose my train of thought. I only remember later, long after the discussion is over. Is that normal? Because of this and lots of other reasons, I've begun to suspect I'm adhd, though I've never been tested. My mom doesn't really believe it's a thing, and there's already a stigma against girls with adhd. I know its not exactly related to my main question, but any tips with this would also be helpful.

Thanks!",04Nov2020,1
223,"this is a long story, buckle up people!!

So, I really like this kid in my class. I'm not sure if he likes me back but some of the stuff hes done has made me question if he does.

Last term, I was sitting at my desk, he sits on another. And he moved his chair over right next to me, and I was sorta feeling sick so my head was down and I didnt talk to him, after a bit, he left, I put my head up, he looked over and started to come back. I put my head down again and he stopped. And I was kicking myself for the rest of the afternoon because I didnt talk to him.

One time he jumped out the window during maths, and started running around. Once again, I felt sorta sick so my head was down and I was sweating. My friend tapped me and I looked up and hes at our window, waving. I'm not sure if it was at me or his friends that where over from us, but they didnt say anything about it, which I thought the would have. When I noticed, I was super surprised and over come with anxiety l. I said ""oh"" and he ran off to somewhere else, idk where, I was too shocked haha.

During the holidays, I grew some balls and desided to add him on snapchat because he was on my for you page. I started texting him a bit and he even said happy birthday. As the end of the holiday came, I got super scared, like, what if he tried talking to me when we get back to school? Or brings it up around his friends who are assholes and are kinda mean to me and my friends. So I did the dumbest thing in the history of crushes and I told him I had the wrong person (there are two people in our class with the same name, my crush and his asshole friend. So I said I meant to text the asshole friend). He called me a player and told me &lt;asshole friend&gt; had a girlfriend. (Which I already knew). I asked him what he meant by calling me a player, and he never responded. At school first period he brung it up when he was with his asshole friend, but wasent that mean? He accused me of lying and said I wasent cool. I was super sad, but I did look over at him sometimes still, and when I would, he started looking back, I'd look away and outtake the corner of my eye, I'd see him still staring for like, 3 more seconds after I stopped till he looked away. He usually positions himself behind me and my friend in class, never really talks to us tho. But isnt mean either, like, hes nice to us than anyone else, theres this other kid in our class who he threatened to hang if he kept the class in, once.  

Please send advice for what I should do? Should I keep glancing at him? Or somehow talk to him? (Idk how that would work since I have rlly bad social anxiety around boys). Or snap him again",04Nov2020,1
224,"I'm indian, 14F (9th grade)
I've been thinking about it. I know its a bad idea. 
School..its just not for me. I hate it. No I don't get bullied or anything. I just dont wanna study. I dont understand anything and I dont see the point in it. Its useless information that I most likely will forget in a few years. Its not just that..i just have no interest in studying and I can't bring myself to do it. My grades are average, I'm not that bad at studies but I just don't want to do it. 
Yes that is a petty excuse. I know..
If I dropout I'll just stay at home with my mom, or she might get mad and kick me out. I dont what I'll do then. But I just don't wanna study. I get so frustrated at the idea of it. Its just schools testing your memory and after examinations all that information you've learnt just doesn't matter and it won't come to use anytime in the future. I've not talked about this to my mom because I know she'll take it super lightly,  think I'm joking and brush it off. Maybe she might call my dad (parents are divorced btw, dad stays with his other wife in another country) and tell him to take care of me or something. I dont know.
My sister is a nurse and she's doing OK. A little less than average pay which is why she's looking forward to working in the UK (it got canceled due to the coronavirus so I dont really know about her plans).
But anyways, she she might take care of my mom and make her proud and all that. 
But I dont know what to do. 

I wanted to become a makeup artist when I was a kid but my mom doesnt really support me since she says its just putting ""chemicals"" on peoples faces and just makes fun of me whenever I mention makeup. So I've given that dream up now.

pluses, like moving to a place with people they know, moving into a relatively cheap place, that is fully furnished by me, and they get free rides and are helped out with their move here.

I’m very empathetic to the bummer that would be trying to make stuff happen here right now, and I’m the best friend so yeah you can complain to me...but it’s starting to be kinda shitty. They complain about everything A LOT.

It just feels like he doesn’t wanna take it out on this new relationship, so he shits on the rest of it...and the rest of it is kinda what I provided.

237,"Hello there. I am 20 years old now, have decent job, graduated from college and university already (I actually continued studying, but via distance learning)

Before, I have already lived separetely from my parents: with a few girlfriends for months, with my friends - stayed out at their apartments for a few days or weeks, abroad travelling etc. And what I am trying to say here, is that I am a pretty much ""independent"" person for a long time already. 

When I live with my parents, they cook, bring meals to me and almost everything that I ask and even not ask. And it was always hard to me to tell them, that I want to be more ""independent"" among them - however they still don't listen and do this for me, for lots of years. 
And understand me right - this is amazing, I really love my parents❤

Recently, I lived at my home alone without parents for about half a year(they moved to country side due to the Covid). And I really love being alone without any control from their side - either mum or dad came home once in a few weeks, just to make sure everything is all right (I would have been already dead, if they discovered somehow about what parties did I held here😂)

And the thing is, that recently they moved from a country side to the apartment again - and I understood  that I got soo much used to living by myself, that I have a sense about lack of freedom now - and also I am tired of living with my friends, and not having my ""personal"" place where I can rest and do whatever I want.

That's why, I started thinking about moving out seriously only now - before, I thought that I would be able to live with them for another year, buy PS5 and then fly off studying abroad. 



So the main question is - should I rent an apartment or buy PS5?🙂 


You can say that this is a really stupid question, since the first option is MUCH better - however not for me. I have a passion for video games and was dreaming to finally have and buy PS5 on the release - so it is 2 weeks left and I am really concerned. If I buy a PS5, I will have to rent an apartment with less money next month, even after salary comes - it would be really hard to save as much money as I wanted for moving to another country next autumn, because I will have to pay rent, food etc. 
And if I do the opposite, it would be really hard for me to buy a PS5 after I start renting an apartment - maybe on my birthday in February it will become more easier, however, the main problem is still the money saving for my upcoming autumn trip.


So what can you suggest here, guys?

My dad always expressed to me how he’s sad and nostalgic for his life before meeting my mom. Tonight, because of quarantine, I suggested that he take a break from being at home and check into a hotel to rejuvenate his spirit. He then responded, “with my girlfriend?”

I responded without thinking, “ew you’re disgusting you freak weirdo.” He has spoken about other women with me ever since I was 9 years old. Women from his job and women he meets online. He never suggested physically cheating until tonight. 

Obviously I never told my mom but I don’t think any woman deserves to be with a man like him. My mom is not a good person either.

So yeah, why meet her when you can't handle it? The thing is, he is my only good friend (like a friend you can hang out one-on-one with) so I'm either alone or with him. He takes time to invite me when she isn't there but that is only on weekdays so I'm missing out on a lot of fun evenings. 

I don't really want to meet her but I can't avoid her for ever either. I'm just very afraid that due to my low self esteem and lonlyness (and therefore jealousy) I wont stop comparing myself to her and that I'll get sad with any form of their interaction. Which will then not only ruin my evening, but also theirs. 

- A bit more info about the relationship between me and my ex: When we are alone we still cuddle and he kisses me on the forehead, sort of like a big brother. He is polyamorous (that is why it didn't work out between us, my self esteem can't handle a second woman) and his new relationship is open for as far as I know. So I am not making him cheat in any way. I just think it complicates things a bit more because that makes it hard to fully let go, but sometimes my depressed ass just needs a good hug.

So TL:DR: I can't avoid my ex's new gf forever so how do I meet her without emotions getting in the way?",04Nov2020,1
244,"I (23f) started smoking weed a little more around 16 years old. My dad taught me how to properly do it then and I was also using hard drugs at the time until 18 when I decided to quit cold turkey and kind of used weed as a crutch. At 19 I met my boyfriend through weed, and now it’s his whole life basically and I feel it’s difficult for me to get away from it.

I’ve asked him if he will cut down eventually, as I feel it’s hard for me to not smoke daily. Luckily we don’t live together so I don’t have to be around it too much but I’m afraid if we do I will just want to be getting high all day. I’m fairly productive while high but I feel like there’s a lot that could change if I stopped because of how long/frequently I’ve been using it. I’ve rarely taken breaks and they’ve been because I can’t afford it at the time. I’m so tired of wasting money on it and being a stoner basically. Has anybody been here? What can I do to stop or cut down",04Nov2020,1

246,"So I have this person who's in the middle of being an acquaintance and friend and I wanted to build more of platonic relationship with them. I know them okayish and they've mentioned that they're going through a lot at the moment. 

I've asked them a couple times what's wrong and what was going on and they told me that they didn't really want to talk about it. I get and respect that people have boundaries and that it's perfectly normal and healthy for people to have them.

I'm just not sure what I should do. I care about this person and I want to be there for them but I also know that it's up to them to decide on if they want me as a support and as a friend. I don't wanna be pushy with them and I'm not trying to be selfish with wanting to be better friends with them. 

I honestly just wanna be better friends with them but im not sure if they feel the same way about it. I feel like I'm kinda treadding on ice of being too pushy with them and with being too distant from them. I try to check in with them every so often and I say hi to them whenever I see them around but im not sure if I should try to do more, do less, or just keep on doing what im already doing.

247,"Me (16m) and my best friend (16m) have been friends since second grade. We went to the same elementary and middle school. We went to different highschools though. His parents put A LOT of academic pressure on him and don't give him much affection in general. Due to COVID though I haven't seen him in months and just saw him again today. Because I knew his situation I probably knew he was going to get into something when we split up. I was right. 
Basically, he's been vaping and doing other shit with kids at a skate park near my house. I don't know how long has been doing it because I just saw him today for the first time in a while. Now, I'm not one of those vape haters or stuck-ups or whatever. Idrc what you do with your body when you're of legal age.(I live in America so he's not of legal age anyways.) I don't like it because he's doing it to fit in with these illiterate, emotionally unstable, turbo virgin dickwads that would definitely do more than just vape.
Obviously my first move would be to tell my parents, but they will probably tell his parents immediately. And his parents ground him for getting Cs. I don't want to know what would happen to him if they find out he's doing this. I also don't want to ruin my friendship with him over this. What should I do?

248,My GF and I have been dating for a little over a year now and she suffers from depression. She usually goes into a depressive episode about once a week and I’m kind of used to helping her through it but recently it seems to be getting worse. She told me how she has a plan to kill herself and how her life seems meaningless to her. I’ve tried my best to explain to her that her life is worth so much more than she thinks but it’s hard for her to accept my word especially when she’s in an episode. I want to get her professional help because I know I can’t do anything beyond comfort her but she is super against it and I feel like if I do it without her consent she’ll resent me and feel betrayed.

250,"TL:DR: I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for years and my depression is at an all time low, spending time with my family (except my sister who isn't insane) exacerbates these things as my brother is a dick, his wife is some sort of narcissistic sociopath, my dad just likes to talk my ear off about the same 5 stories I've heard a million times for hours on end and with no way of getting a word in edge-wise and my mum never listens to anything I say, dismisses my views as rubbish, treats me like a baby and pushes her religious views down my throat.
I have strict dietary requirements (due to health issues) + vegetarian and nobody takes it seriously.

What I need advice on is; I have to come up with a way of telling my parents and sister that I am not going camping (my initial reason to get out of it, but may fall through due to variables) but I still don't want to come to Christmas lunch. Also, is this selfish of me?

Background:
Youngest of 3 siblings, I'm a very introverted person, I hold no religious beliefs, been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I have bad IBS (requiring a low fodmap diet) and have recently switched to a vegetarian diet (much to my mothers disgust).

My parents are insane Christians (mostly my mum), I hold no religious beliefs and do not care for the holidays. I do not want to celebrate christmas or easter because they are not representative of my beliefs and I care not for presents. I've always found it odd that like other people, my parents who have always been quite poor and make consistently bad financial decisions, put so much pressure on themselves and screw themselves financially to have this amazing present and food filled day because that's how you celebrate the christian holiday of christmas. 
Though the public holidays are nice, I do not wish to partake of the celebrations as it holds no significance for me, other than putting up with family I don't like, feeling obligated to spend money on those same people and having to worry about getting to each place on time to see everyone, meaning you can't actually relax anywhere because you gotta be somewhere else.

This year will be the first time in 9 years I haven't had a partner and therefore, I have no obligation to see anyone else's family or extended family except my own.

I do not enjoy spending time with my parents as they are incredibly draining to be around, my mum treats me like a baby who can't think for myself, my dad just doesn't stop talking and its about stuff I've heard a million times or people I do not know or care about, with almost no room for me to even get a word in anywhere. 

My brother and his wife, well I've never really gotten along with them and we had a massive falling out after his wife stayed friends with one of my exes (idc about that, though I find it a little odd) and kept inviting her to family events (she would show up too). Clearly she had no respect for me or boundaries, even after I politely asked her to respect my feelings and boundaries (ie, don't invite my ex to family events). My parents never call her out on this behaviour and bury their heads in the sand when anything like this happens, same with my brother, essentially giving her license to do whatever shitty things she likes. She also has this annoying habit of making everything about her and when you try to talk to her about something that has nothing to do with  her, you can see her eyes glaze over and her replies turn to monosyllabic grunts and moans which make it clear she neither cares or is listening, but re-animates immediately when it's her turn to talk again or you shift the focus to her. 

I called her out on all her shitty behaviour and it started a shitstorm that ended with her threatening to tell my parents about my drug use and other things, when she realised she could no longer control or manipulate me. I basically just laughed at her, called her bluff (as it was my brother who gave me my first taste of drugs and partying) and made her well aware that I did not like her and would not put up with her bullshit. Now she just doesn't come to any family event I am at, always coming up with some excuse, which is fine by me (she didn't show up to my sisters birthday one year, even though they get along, because she ""double booked"" and spent the evening with my ex instead).

My sister and her husband are quite the opposite and I get along with them very well, I hold no ill feelings toward them and don't mind spending time with them, though we are worlds apart.

On top of this, I require a low fodmap diet as I have been diagnosed with acute IBS and after going on the diet, my stomach has never been better. I have also recently decided to switch to a vegetarian diet on top of this (eventually want to go vegan), my family do not approve of the vegetarian diet and were quite disappointed when I told them I was making the switch.

My mum is quite sick and her health is deteriorating quicker than it should be for her age, this is mostly self inflicted through poor diet and no exercise. She cannot be trusted to prepare a meal for me that is safe for me to eat, vegetarian not withstanding.

When I was growing up, I always had stomach aches and problems, the doctor at the time said I was lactose intolerant and yet my mother would still put cream and cheese (though some cheeses are safe due to low-nil lactose) in everything she made, then wonder why I was complaining of stomach aches all the time.

Now with the low fodmap + vegetarian, I have no hope in actually being catered to at a christmas lunch/dinner.
Add to this that my sister in law always forcibly makes us do it at their house, which means I have even less chance of being catered to.

For the last few years, I kept trying to convince my (now ex) GF to go camping over christmas so we wouldn't have to put up with my family but she usually worked on the non-public holiday days since she works in retail and since I'm an office worker we rarely had our time off line up, she also likes her family (hell, I felt more comfortable and had a much better relationship with her family than my own).

This year however, I have no partner to consider, I am my own person and do not wish to spend christmas with my family, where I won't be able to eat anything, have to do an awkward exchange of gifts where it will either be crap I don't need/like or food I can't eat and I have to pretend to be happy and thankful for it all? No thanks.

I am currently working out where I can go camping over the break, but I am increasingly worried that I will have to put up with crowded camp sites, full of families and kids (yuck), due to travel restrictions and so am thinking that I will just leave the camping trip until after school holidays and will just spend it at home with my cats.

I have already told them a few months ago I was going camping over christmas, when there was discussion about it. My sister has since asked me about it and I have agreed to tell her when I am going, where I am going and when I expect to be back (camping safety 101) but since it looks like I may decide to not go camping (depending on variables like I might have to be on-call for work and deferring it until after school holidays), I have to come up with a new excuse/reason to not be there.
 
I plan to go see my sister and parents who live near each other, about an hour drive away from me, before christmas to do the present exchange (mostly me just giving presents to my nieces)  and catch up, probably won't do a food/meal thing though. 

Or:

My Nana always does a christmas lunch &amp; dinner (usually in early January) with the full extended family and though she is equally difficult with the food, I actually get along with my nana and she loves me, I feel more obligated to go to that and thus, I was considering just doing this 1 day with the family, instead of 2.

I also make sure I always show up for the non-religious celebrations (birthdays etc), so it's not like I have completely ostracised myself from my family, I just don't want to have to deal with Christmas (or Easter).",04Nov2020,1

254,"I am a senior in my first semester of high school. I’ve been mildly involved in extracurriculars and have maintained straight As up until junior year where I got two Bs. I’ve been recommended for a full scholarship recently so I’m not a complete lost cause I guess. 
 
I only have two classes during the day. English and Math. English is fine and I have the expected A but AP Calculus is whooping my ass and it doesn’t help that it’s my first period of the day (on zoom btw). 

I plan on being in the medical field (I need a Bachelor and Doctorate degree) and I know I really wouldn’t need calculus or anything besides basic math. My GPA would remain high if I failed Calculus. I admitted that I didn’t understand the content and my teacher gave me about two weeks to review the entire course and ask questions. Yet even with her help, I cannot understand and it’s frustrating. I’ve never been strong in math but could always finesse enough to get a B or A. Could it really hurt me if I just gave up and did bare minimum? Even with the F, my gpa would still be above a 4.0 weighted (most likely will be between 4.2-4.3 still)

257,"I’m jealous of my extroverted older sister

I’m 23F and she’s 28. We have a pretty tight bond; we understand each other’s sense of humor, we get along well, and I always go back to her whenever I need someone to vent to.

As you can guess, she’s the social butterfly of the family; has a huge circle of friends, admirers (she’s no influencer or anything, people just really like her), and acquaintances who love her charm and charisma. She’s always the one willing to go the extra mile for anyone, throwing the best parties, getting the best gifts, and people always come back to her for advice and opinion on certain things. People can’t get enough of her, really. And I see why; I love her to pieces, too. 

I, on the other hand, am the introvert; don’t have any best friends, just close friends that I hang out with and check up on every so often. I don’t fair well in social situations since I don’t know how to do small talk and it’s hard for me to come up with things to talk about. I value my privacy and downtime, and while I’m also the type to always offer a helping hand and go the extra mile, I have a lot more boundaries around that. And it’s because of all this that I don’t receive the same kind of appreciation, admiration, and love.

I sometimes wished that I was also the type whose opinion and advice are valued. The type that doesn’t lead conversations that fall so miserably flat, so dang easily. The type that wins everyone’s hearts by doing nothing more than being their natural, charming, lovable self.

I’m not sure where I’m going with this, but I thought I’d just let it all out somewhere. I think I just want the same kind of appreciation and admiration she has. I don’t mind being introverted and not as sociable, but I just wish people appreciated me and loved me just as much for being myself. 

TLDR; jealous of my 28-year-old sister (I’m 23F) that has so many people who love, appreciate, value, and admire her. Everyone comes to her for her advice and opinion, and she’s constantly being showered by love it’s honestly enviable.

I'm trying to act advanced. And no one questions it, yet I'm constantly, fastidiously doubting it, because I know that isn't me.

I say I don't care about my appearance. Other than brushing my hair and showering, I don't care for my appearance at all. Because the ways I want to appear aren't possible, as I don't have the resources to actualize them.

I'm a 14-year-old boy. I have curly, brown hair, an incredibly hairy body, and I'm overweight. I have large hands, a large nose, a small mouth, and facial hair. I hate how I look.

I want to be clean-shaven. I want to be curvy. I want a plump butt, vagina, and breasts. I want long, black flowing hair. I want Asian skin. I don't wear to wear boys clothes. I wanna wear dresses, leggings, makeup, Converse shoes, Vans, heels, boots, skinny jeans, overalls, sweaters, crop tops, makeup, and jewelry.

I hate trying to be who people expect me to be. I'm supposed to be a teenage intellectual, I'm expected to be a rhetorical prodigy. Everyone wants me to be fucking Einstein. I can't take it. I just wanna be a kid. I just wanna have fun.

But they'd never allow that. It would scare them. I was once watching an episode of Adventure Time, and my dad looked at me in bemusement: ""How do you go from Schopenhauer to this?""

People's expectations of me have robbed me of my childhood. All I want in life are the things I never enjoyed as a child: Hopper balls, cartoons, plushies, bounce houses, toys, video games, etc. I just wanna have fun.

Yeah, I'll hold a job, pay taxes, own my own home, of course. But all I want is to take the steps necessary to recreate the childhood I lost to high expectations and a fucking pandemic and be at peace with my body through transitioning and cosmetic surgery.

I feel dirty and disappointing. Everyone in my life expects me to become the author the next Plato's Symposoum, everyone wants me to unlock the key behind psychopolitics, everyone expects me to be a superhuman genius. And I want is to snuggle a teddy bear and watch Steven Universe. All I want is to be a woman.

I'm scared of what my family will think. Their son/nephew/grandchild who could once hold a conversation on the geopolitical buildup to the Russian Revolution is now someone who grew up looking like a Sephardic Jewish male and now looks like a southeast Asian woman, who spends their time off from work riding hopper balls, binging Adventure Time and We Bare Bears, and snuggling plushies.",04Nov2020,1
261,"This is a long one:
TLDR at bottom.
New to this sub but hopefully can get advice.

I am a 46y (M) who is a father to two adult daughters 25 and 27 who both have a child each. One is in a committed relationship and the other is a single mother. 

Their mother and I separated on bad terms about 4 yrs ago and subsequently their relationship with her isn’t too good too as she grinds her axe about me onto them.

As a result, they have been using me as a sounding board/counsellor/advisor etc for their health and well-being issues. 
I am happy as a father to support and provide advice to a point, as I believe their issues are better suited being addressed by an objective professional.  
I know by them talking to me about their issues and often seeking counsel, the boundaries between father and daughter/S get blurred which happens often.

I would get random texts about how hard their
Life is and all their stress etc but despite offering support they get annoyed at me for (assumedly) not saying the right thing. 
Often they just want to vent and expect me to just listen but I hate that as it wastes my time and it’s draining especially as I am someone who thinks if there is an issue, offer a solution or support to fix it, but they frequently don’t want that and go off in a huff saying that I’m not listening when I offer solutions. 

I have lately just offered them basic responses because as far as I can see, they don’t want anything further. 

They both have their issues which is complex and really heavy to deal with. I raised them essentially as a single father with the mother being an emotionally absent parent which could explain why they turn to me to meet their emotional needs but sometimes I just don’t want to. 

I live by myself and after spending 28yrs with their mother and raising them, think that they should be at least prepared to keep some of their things private from me. 

I have told them to seek counsel from professionals but they refuse to as their mother has told them that they’re not crazy or have issues so they don’t need to talk to a counsellor. 
Any advice?

Adult daughters often emotionally offload on me  and want me to just sit and listen but I can’t do that.",04Nov2020,1

267,"I need to get out of an akward situation.

-Basically I got interest in wanting to talk to this person. We both gave each other glances &amp; even tried to get closer to each other's proximity/mutual ppl and such. I was successfully able to say hi to her eventually and had a sweet but short convo. (Because I panicked)

That panick continued on and I'd act weird everytime we began crossing paths a lot. I failed to acknowledge her a handful of times. And now we curb directions whenever we see each other. Also, dont have a friend where I can show I'm still normal in front of her. 

 I have no idea how to act/do/say to fix this. PLEASE help me.

268,"Hello folks, I’m in college and I have a group project due tomorrow. My professor randomly partnered everyone up, and just my luck, my partner never goes to class and seems to always be slacking off. I contacted him multiple times asking if he needed help with his part of the project, and he always had an excuse as to why he hadn’t done anything (he has been sick, his power was out, he forgot, etc.) This morning, he emailed me and told me he would have his work done soon, but it is now 1:30 am, I still haven’t gotten a reply to any of the emails I sent him, the project is due at 8:00am, and I have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to do the whole thing. Here’s the dilemma : we are supposed to email the professor when we turn in the project and let her know what each person in the group did so she can factor it into our grade. I’m not sure what to do. If I tell the professor I did the entire thing, I’ll get a good grade for my work, and my partner will get a 0. I feel really guilty and I don’t want to be responsible for someone failing, especially since this project is worth a huge percentage of our grade. He’s also a lot older than me, (he’s around 40 and I’m 19...idk why I was paired up with him to begin with but whatever) so I don’t know his situation about why he’s still in school and I don’t want to mess his life up. But on the other hand, I did my part well in advance and am now on vacation with my family, and I’m forced to stay up all night to do his work, and in a way I feel like he really screwed me over.

I said sure if it would make you laugh since things have been rough, I meant in a it’ll cheer you up kinda way.

My mom escaped her relationship, has a stable job and her own house. I live with my grandma, dad, younger brother and older brother. Who are all at risk to covid-19. So since March I have been home and doing online school. I am not able to get a job or go back to school with my friends like Id like to. My dad and step mom work from home so we're all basically avoiding going out as much as possible

Meanwhile my mom works everyday and my you get siblings who live with her go to school in person. Everytime I go out to the dollar store, the grocery store, or see a friend (with masks and social distancing ofc) which is very rarely. I panic. I feel guilty that I could get one of my family members sick and they could die. With my mom I wouldn't stress about it, I could get a job, go to school and see my friends. Without feeling guilty. Without putting anyone at risk. I wish I could live with both but due to the pandemic I'd have to pick one. Either I stay with my dad and do nothing I'd like to do or I go with my mom and do all the things I want to do. I'm also obese and I feel like I'd have a better chance of losing weight at my mom's. My dad doesn't let me run at the track alone, and tries to control my diets, and excerise. It's just hard to lose weight here. My mom is more chill and would support me instead of criticizing me. Losing weight is always something I want to do. And need to do.

I'm having a really tough time deciding whether I should get the Ipad Pro 11"" (128GB) or the Ipad Air 4th gen (256GB).

I use my current iPad mostly for gaming, editing videos (which I do from time to time) and watching streams/videos. However, I want to get in the habit of taking down notes on the Ipad instead of on paper and I couldn't decide which one to get (forget about the 12'9 inch Ipad Pro cause I have relatively small hands)

The Ipad Air 4th gen (256GB) goes for $979 CAD while the Ipad Pro 11"" (128GB) goes for $1049 CAD. The Ipad Pro costs $80 more but I don't know whether I should get it and lose the 256 GB from the Air at a cheaper price. I've read from a lot of sources that the Pro is the best for note-taking because of the 120Hz refresh rates which again, confused me even more which I should get.

Can anyone help???

288,"So I’m facing a lot of backlash currently for throwing a big halloween party over the weekend. It wasn’t supposed to get as big as it got but it did, things got way out of hand. Kids said they would test after the party but nobody has obviously. 

People were taking photos and videos and posting them on their public social media pages which was stupid. I guess a bunch of people emailed our dean (btw seniors in high school but multiple grade levels were at the party) and our school shut down for the next two weeks and all fall sports have been cancelled completely. I got fined heavily for it. 

This situation is a lot bigger than I thought it would be, it was in a big newspaper and everything, everyone is talking about it, parents keep fighting about it. One girl reposted every single picture she saw of kids at the party and she’s getting bombed on social media for it by all the kids from the party. And I feel bad. I can’t say anything to anyone but everyone’s putting the blame on her. She does not have a large social media following and I know me throwing the party was wrong but I can’t control how people react to it at all. There are tons of rumors about this girl going around now and nobody in these group chats even knows her personally besides like one person who refuses to discuss it. 

They’re all blasting this girl and I don’t even know what to say, the cops don’t want me to say anything but people are threatening her because she has such compromising photos of them up. Is it legal for her to have those photos on her page even if it’s private? She only has like 9 followers and hasn’t accepted anyone’s requests from the party so nobody has really even seen them but is it illegal for her to have those up?

I saw (what I’m assuming) was her post on here yesterday which is why I decided to also post my side. I know what I did was stupid and I’m facing the consequences but I don’t know what else to do my hands are kind of tied. 

Apparently she can’t even do her online classes because our peers from the party/their friends have been harassing her in online meetings too I feel terrible. Are they gonna just end up leaving her alone and am I going to get blamed for them doing what they’re doing? I haven’t talked to her whatsoever but people have been speaking on my behalf without my permission because they’re assuming I’m angry with her, I’m not. I knew what I did was wrong and I still did it. It’s not her fault that she had to tell the dean whether she told or not, someone was gonna tell because everyone was posting it publicly.

Her post didn’t get a lot of traction but I saw one person comment saying she got innocent people in trouble. She didn’t. I got in trouble because I hosted the party, and only about 13 other kids from the party got in trouble because they were clearly in the photos and tagged. 

I don’t know if she’ll see this because she deleted the post but I’m sorry for what happened. I didn’t tell anyone it was you that told the dean, I don’t even actually know who told for sure. I can’t control how people are interacting with you right now and I’m sorry you feel unsafe in our city I did not think this would happen.",04Nov2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to be that person in class who always gets perfect remarks. If not perfect, maybe a couple of mistakes. I realized that after my Science exam, I made a huge mistake in one of the questions, which caused me 5 points.

&amp;#x200B;

It was devastating for me as I was confident about these exams, and I studied my ass off this.

&amp;#x200B;

So unto the thing I need some comfort with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that I wasn't worried about the mistake I made, but what if someone perfected the exam...and it's not me? I realized that I was selfish, but I kept worrying over that. 

&amp;#x200B;

My teachers tend to give a shout out at the class whenever someone gets perfect remarks, and I'm always pressured to maintain my scores.

&amp;#x200B;

I worry that if someone gets perfect, everyone will immediately think it's me. Then what if it's not me? That would really be awkward...

&amp;#x200B;

I also have yet to adjust to this new normal even though the 1st semester is about to end. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm chasing scholarships too. Today, I received a letter from my school saying that my tuition fee would be free of charge this year due to my good academic performance last year.

&amp;#x200B;

I worry that I may not do well this year which may cause me to lose my scholarship for next year. I'm afraid my parents would be disappointed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I don't want to disappoint my classmates, but it turns out I just want to save myself from humiliation. I guess I'm not what I used to be, and I think I'm starting to look at academics for good grades and not for actual learning.

&amp;#x200B;

Some may say that I'm just 15 and worrying over useless things but I've experienced this a couple of times, and I can't help but have a mental breakdown whenever I think about it.

295,"I am currently in a very odd situation that I am seeking some suggestions on what to do or maybe some information that could send me in the right direction. There is alot of information to provide to give a good idea of what's happening.

I lost my job back in May due to having undergo chemo and not having an immune system. During this time of treatment my mom came to stay with me to help me out. This put my already small apartment 720 sqft over capacity with me, my son, and her. Not counting my dog and her cat.There really wasn't a work around for this and it is temporary. 

At the beginning of October it came to light that my father had not paid the taxes on my grandparents house that he was residing in. My grandparents are both deceased so it is just him.This is not the 1st time for this to happen however this time the house sold at auction leaving him homeless. 

He is a horder and doesn't take great care of himself medically. He hasn't worked since the last job I actually got for him in 2017. Due to him not taking great care of himself he ended up with an infection in his leg that required surgery to remove. This was end of September that the hospital stay happen. 

After the hospital I offered him to recover at my place because of the condition of his and his inability to walk well or drive while his leg healed. After he was here we found out about the house being lost. Since he was a horder there is just tons of stuff at the house both junk, tools, and stuff of my grandparents. This prompted his sister and close friends to want certain things of my grandparents and miscellaneous other items. This also left him to take what he thought was important and bring it to my apartment. 

So now there are 3 adults, a kid, 2 dogs, and a cat in a very small apartment. He hasn't had a real job in years except for a brief time at the end of 2016 and 2017. He has no desire to find a job either.  While he comes by cash scraping and selling random items he spends it as fast as he gets in on things like lottery tickets and his chewing tobacco. My mother even though she is only here till the end of my treatment in January (hopefully not longer) had to get a part time job because her unemployment ran out and she still has outgoing expenses. I am currently unable to work because of my condition. 

There are other cleanliness issues with him such as leaving things with blood on them on the coffee table, just piling dishes in the sink, having multiple spit cups around the house, and just a general lack of respect of being in another person's home. 

I have a functional relationship with him at best and I didn't have the best of times growing up. The issue is im the only person who seems to help. While one sister will give him money if he ask if he wasn't staying with me he would be on the street homeless. 

The issue is while I don't want my father to be homeless  it is too much stress for me and my apartment is far to small to have the living arrangements as they are. Even when my mother leaves. I am not in a situation where I can move and get a bigger place any time in the foreseeable future. 

I was always told if you can help someone you should but his lack of offering any monetary help, help with any house work, or barely taking care of his own dog im feeling a bit used. This has caused me to take up residence in my bedroom as my home no longer feels like my home. 

I can't just tell him to leave. He has no where to go and he would probably end up back in the hospital because of his current medical state. 

This with my health problems and other life issues have put me in a situation where I have to choose between sharing my home and being stressed or telling my dad he has to be homeless. Neither of these are good options.

Im hoping someone may have a better idea of what can be done that suits both our needs?",04Nov2020,1
296,"Hello everyone                    
I wanna star off by giving a bit of a background:                            
I've recently found out that the religion I was raised in is a total scam. Needless to say I lost faith in it. The problem is that I turned down many girls over the years and skipped on a lot of opportunities due to my religious beliefs. Right now I am 30 years old.                                                                  
I had many chances but never took them because I believed it was the right thing to do (It wasn't).                         
Now I found out the truth and I am trying to get my life together and actually start a relationship with someone. My self esteem is unfortunately very low in part due to my balding. I don't feel I look good when I'm fully shaved or when I let my hair grow and I don't know how to deal with it.                        
The other reason for my low self esteem is that I have no experience with relationships or how to ""correctly"" approach a girl I like. I feel like I don't know what I am doing 90% of the time when I am talking to someone I am interested in. I don't know when I should ask someone out.

297,"I’m f22 and I’m kinda seeing someone f20. We are basically in two stages of life. I dropped out of school to work and she’s in school that’s fine. 

But there is nothing to talk about anymore? We’ve been off and on for the last year I’m just really tired of trying to make conversation with her. Everything always pertains to school and work. There is really nothing to talk about at all anymore. When we spend time together I get bored and frustrated cause if it’s not me talking and asking 100 questions we don’t speak at all. Like I’ve been in relationships where I’ve been this frustrated and all you do is resent your partner. I’m trying to make this not happen but how many conversations of ‘hey we need to change this’ is one to many? I feel like I’m never enough cause she’s always trying to say you need to change this to be better for her, when I’m just me and it’s never good enough for her. 

For background she’s like so smart brilliant. I’m street smart and i love school but it was never for me. I don’t like homework and papers. She’s in love with education but that’s all she is sometimes. Just this smart person. No personality to life. And not to mention she’s so fragile while I am complete opposite. I’m tough as nails and don’t cry at anything. She’s always crying and I’m tired of it. It’s emotionally draining to have to comfort someone every damn day. I want to make this work but am I just justifying this relationship? 

My gut tells me she only wants to be with me because I’m so different than her and I’m opening her eyes to the unsheltered life that I live. I work two jobs and by the end of the day I’m so fucking tired and asking how her day was is getting boring, I don’t want to talk about work I just want to bullshit about trees or something for fucks sake. It’s a chore to make conversation with her.

TL;DR boring communications has lead to a lot of turmoil.",04Nov2020,1
298,"I was dating someone for about a month. We were on the same page about wanting to be in a relationship. The night before, or in this case literally just 12 hours prior we had made it “officially seeing each other”, he told me he slept with someone else who he was romantically involved with prior to meeting me. Technically, we were not exclusive so I can’t say it was cheating but I’m definitely not happy about it. Am I overthinking this?",04Nov2020,1
299,"Hey,

It was sort of my first “ex” from a year ago, she also was my best friend. After she broke up w me, from time to time we sometimes talk then stop talking after that because my instincts just feel that I’ll get hurt again.  A few months ago we were really close again because she hit me up before I left and we just sort of connected.  I was really questioning us as friends and a bit even more than that and she admitted to seeing me as a rebound at first(when we were together) but then she says she changed her mind after(she actually had genuine feelings for me).  It feels wrong because even when we start talking again at any point, a bit of feelings and jealousy just come out of nowhere and start again.  I definitely know it’s not good for me but it always comes up in my mind from time to time.  Yesterday, my friend just told me to hit her up and she told me she missed me and all that but I’m not sure where to go from now.

302,"Hello. Through my life it has not been unusual for me to like more than one being. It's a weird feeling, that I do not enjoy that much. Specially because it has always been in vain.  
well this last couple of years I hadn't had this feeling of liking two people at once. Specially since I was finally in a relationship, that's now finished. Well, it eventually happened again.   
I recently started liking two beings again. I still don't like it. I feel like I'm being played by my feelings again. It always ends up in pain to me. Eros dislikes me, never hits someone with the same dart as mine's (small Joke).  
Well it got me curious, why is it? That I end up liking two beings? It's not that I eventually just start enjoying someone new and disliking the feels I had for the other. I still like both with the same intensity. I don't believe I am polyamorous. 

But why is it that I still like them? At once?

313,"Hey all, been a rough time for everyone this year. Will try to keep this short. 

April 2020, wife-to-be has falling out with bff (who was originally the MOH). Realises this friend is far too wrapped up in her own life to organise a hen do or even make a 2hr car journey to see her. 

Wife2B: “Call me and let’s get this sorted” BFF: [Long monologue via whatsapp of how hard life is for her]

Wife2B: “Call me..” BFF: [Long monologue via whatsapp of how hard life is for her v2.0]

Wife2B: “Why won’t you call me?” BFF: “Because you’ll shout at me” 

Months pass.. (including the original wedding date) ...nothing

A few days ago I got a short whatsapp message: “Hi, hope [Wife2B] is ok and I would love to speak to her again some day”

Me: “Hey, hope you’re good. Wife2B has actually not been great. Lost a lot of faith in everything lately as wedding was cancelled she doesn’t hear from her family (BFF knows this). Hate to say it but it’s not likely things will be patched up, a lot of time has passed and Wife2B more than ever needs ppl to show they care about her. Hope one day you both can make up, really hope you’re okay.”

Then...

BFF: “Let her know as soon as I can I’m taking a few weeks out to Florida and whilst I’m ok going alone she’s welcome to join me”

I’m bewildered. My options I can think of are:
1. “Shockingly, I think it’s gonna be a no”
2. “What planet are you on exactly?”
3. #leaveit
4. [Whatsapp rant about this is exactly why she doesn’t want to talk to you]
4b. “This is why she won’t talk to you again, enjoy Florida”

This girl invited me over her house to watch a scary movie weeks ago. “Heyyy you should come over sometime this spooky season and we should watch conjuring”. That was weeks ago and then she kept cancelling, having excuses, stuff kept coming up. 

But this morning she finally followed through and asked me if I wanna come over and watch the movie. But later she’s like “oh I forgot I’m actually getting my room and basement redone so so we don’t really have a place to hang. So we can’t hang here but we can do something else”

We still hungout and did something different and it was fun 


But something just doesn’t feel right. Why would she invite me over just to keep making excuses why I can’t come over? How could you forget your getting your house redone??

But after some time i dint find it worth it as the kids were just bunking and enjoying their life all they had motive of relying on there fathers money for rest of the life and didn’t had any other motive and won’t struggle for success .

So i left the college after an year and joined distant college , although I had all the funds and everything but I didn’t liked they being ignorant of their future . And it was like a time waste too . I even have to travel total of 3 hrs up down . 

So , today I met one of my fathers friends who told me to join college . They said their would be difficulty in ur marriage as u would be from corresponding. My dad is insisting me to join a hood college or make a good amount of money . All our relatives are good in money expect .

I don’t understand what I did wrong. I tried to be everything he wanted but my stupid eating disorder kept making me gain and lose weight like every other week so I’d literally go from chubby to skinny again with drastic methods like biking long distances while fasting. It’s over now, I suppose. I feel overdramatic but then again I have so many health problems and I spent the last year of high school wearing a stupid ugly ponytail because my mom ripped my hair out and left a fat bald spot. It grew back. And he says I didn’t make him happy, even though I even did role play as a furry for him, bought latex, and everything he wanted. He even said he wanted girls with abs so I started furiously working on that too. It doesn’t matter who I tell, no one can feel empathy for me. I am less than human. I’m basically a glorified dog. I can’t kill myself because the only jerk move worse than staying alive is becoming dead, so I’m stuck in this pit of misery for who knows how long. I just wanted him to think I was enough.

Every now and then although it isn’t brought up often she says she feels like:

• She’s just going through life like a third person character.

• Lack motivation.

• Life tasks are just difficult like just the usual day.

• Takes motivation to be around people, only goes with people so she doesn’t regret it later.

She doesn’t like sharing this type of information often but when I do get it from her I know she must be struggling in some form. She’s a strong girl and likes to put her emotions down and doesn’t care about them much. Although I think that’s terrific in some instances in others I feel like she’s left with a bunch of emotions just festering up till they release and I just don’t want that release to harm her.

I didn’t think anything of it, but she was really cute and had a great personality so the more it comes back to me the more enticing getting to know her sounds.

So I kind of bit the bullet and friended her on Facebook. I never even use Facebook, but I did not know how to talk to her again as I only really knew her name. She accepted my friend request, but I haven’t figured out what to do as the next step.

I am actually terrible at this kind of thing, I have no awareness and an awkward steak longer than most, so I’m hesitant to do anything.

There may not even be anything there, she could already think I’m a creep, but it’s been a while since I’ve been distracted like this or even thinking of making some kind of attempt at talking to someone more than once (I’m kind of a loner).

325,"So, I think I’ve known this since I first moved into halls in first year. Like, there’s certain spans of time when I just don’t want anyone to look at me or interact with- I want to be just completely alone in my little world and I can genuinely do that for weeks on end. 
Last year, I lived on my own in a different city and I think its made me realise how much better that set up is for me. 
This year, I moved in with 3 of my best friends and sometimes if I can hear them in the hall, I’m too anxious to leave my room... I often don’t eat because I don’t want to prepare food in front of them and my room has become messy because when I do eat I keep the plates in my room because I don’t want them to watch me washing them. 
I know that the obvious solutions here are: tell them you need to move out and go find a place on your own or talk to them about how you’re feeling. 
The problem is that I can’t leave the lease- there’s no way they’d find another flatmate rn. The other problem is that as far as telling them, I don’t know. I feel like they wouldn’t believe me because I’m otherwise extremely outgoing, friendly and chatty. Like this is a side of myself I’d say that only my long term partner and mum fully understand and I think there’s more chance of my flatmates thinking I’m being attention seeking than anything else. 
I wanted to know if anybody had some tips for me to sort of navigate “living alone” while I live with others? 
Thank you 🙏",04Nov2020,1
326,"So I’m 20 (F) and graduated from high school 2 years ago. I always planned on becoming an artist but when I started to get more into it I came to the conclusion that it might not be the best choice. So then I came up with the idea to study something Japanese related but that didn’t feel right either so I quite the major and started thinking about what I really want to do. The whole quarantine I was googling all the options that are out there and I thought that probably linguistics or psychology would be a good choice for me since I really like to Analyse and understand how the brain works and I really like to help people with their problems. 
But when it came to studying for the psychology test to get a place for the major I was so inconsistent and started overthinking, I ended up not passing the test so I was like okay linguistics is still left let’s have a look. 
Now I started linguistics like 2 months ago and I don’t think it’s bad or anything 
But no matter what I do or try I always start to overthink if what I’m doing is right and then I feel like it’s not and then I don’t want to study because I feel like it’s such a waste of time. Like you study so much just to forget it at the end again and I’m just not a really big fan of the Educational system in generell because I’m a person who can learn best while actually doing the thing but like with someone showing me how to do it, but at university it’s just talking for several hours and i have to listen to it and take notes and then sit down for hours a day studying it until I understand it and most of the times the professors are kinda boring too which makes the whole thing 100x harder. 

And I mean I could just get a job or something but I really don’t know what 
I literally was spending the whole quarantine thinking about my passions and what’s important for me and what I can imagine working as when I’m old. But it’s just so hard to actually come up with something 
I feel like I just can’t find it, like as I said I’m really interested in everything that has to do with psychology but as soon as it came to the studying part I just couldn’t do it, just sitting in front of a desk all day is so fucking boring 

And as I said I’m in linguistics right now and I think the classes are pretty interesting but like my thoughts and feelings about it change all the time like one minute I’m like yes this is nice and I feel like this is something I can do for a living 
But then I start to overthink again and be like but I don’t even know what it’s really like, and all the studying, you will forget it after the test is over and it all was for nothing and then it’ll just start over again and you will be a communist slave for the rest of your life and just be sad and depressed for the rest of your life because you never were able to figure out what to actually do and you didn’t believe in yourself because you were too scared of others opinions 

So basically to sum this all up: 
I feel really anxious about my future and I literally see nothing but black thinking about it. I’ve been struggling to figure out what I want to do and no matter how hard I try i just don’t seem to really come up with anything and if I feel like yes maybe that’s it I still can’t put myself together and really study for it because the education system just doesn’t really do it for me 
I am a person who chances all the time and i always like to try out new things (like if there’s anyone into personality types or astrology I’m literally an infp-t and a Gemini sun with a Capricorn moon) 
I just don’t know what to try anymore I try to just be like yea whatever happens happens just stick with what you are doing right now if you kinda like it but the louder voice in my head will be like no you need to figure it out now and we need all the answers. 

(So I Hope this makes any sense at all, also English is not my first language so if there are any mistakes I’m sorry, this is my first post on Reddit and I really don’t know a lot about this app yet so pls don’t be mean I’m just hoping for someone that maybe felt the same in the past and got some advice for me o.o)

332,"tw: inevitable mentions of murder, suicide, etc. 

So I've always been a horror/true crime fan, ever since I was a kid. I think they're interesting and the psychological part of them really fascinates me as much as it frightens and disgusts me.

But I have been consuming these for months now and it's starting to feel a bit unhealthy. Whenever I'd have free time it would almost only watch murder documentaries or read/watch horror. This impacted my day to day life since being such a reccuring topic I inevitably think of it a lot. 

I have terrible nightmares almost every night, usually involving murder, suicide, cadavers, death in general or supernatural. Although I have a very high tolerance to horror they get more vivid and creative and I am inevitably shaken. The worst I experienced was a whole day of being extremely scared and upset because of a dream like this I had the night before.

I don't know why I like this so much. I think the adrenaline they give me makes up for the boring life I currently have due to the pandemic and not being able to get out of the house too much, also because of the pandemic.

This is starting to feel like an addiction although I'm not sure. I don't know what to do.

333,"I will try to be brief.

I  live in Europe. New neighbours moved next door from South Africa about 2  years ago. Both seemed lovely. The woman is always nice chatty and  positive while the guy is nice but a bit quiet and reserved.We have two  beautiful hunting dogs (GSPs) which he made clear that he loved and  wanted to get one and so I let him play with mine quite a  bit (we have very large land). He would throw sticks and balls etc but I  warned him to be very careful because when he does this, the dogs focus  is only on the stick and he could hurt himself or other people if he  didn't throw the stick into a clear safe area. His wife also told him  this so many times I became embarrassed. These dogs are big and powerful.

2  weeks ago the inevitable happened and he threw a stick and the dogs ran  after it. Trouble was, they had to run around a corner of the garden  wall where I was working. They hit me side-on and snapped by kneecap  completely. The same knee that I had an ACL and meniscus reconstruction  many years ago.

Ambulance,  hospital and complicated operation that I don't yet know if it will be  successful. More ops to follow. Pain, depression, splint, 5 weeks in bed  and 5 months at least to recover.

His wife has sent texts and rang and been nice.

Nothing from him. AT ALL.

Now  I understand how accidents happen and we must move on but this man has  not even had the decency to ask anything about my well-being, let alone  apologize for his part in it. If he did that then I could move on. But I  always find myself going over what to say to him (and how) the first  time we meet. The evil part of me wants to beat him with a stick while  repeating ""nothing to do with me"", but how do you think that I should  get him to acknowledge the fact that he never did what he was asked  about safe throwing and he has caused such a bad accident. Perhaps even  apologize, because this I think is the only decent thing to do.

I should I just let it go and ignore everything?

334,"About 6 years ago, when I was in grade 5 there was an event. A senior student had leukimia and the school organised a kinda donation thing where students could ask for a book with a bunch of tickets like paper. We then go around telling people we knew like friends, neighbours and family members about it and hand out a ticket from the book to anyone who donates. We collect as much as possible by a deadline and hand them over with the remaining book.

I was a bit of an introvert but I asked for one. Then some of my friends decided to help so I tore of the a bunch and gave it to them, so that they can use it to ask others.

But some forgot, other lost their and some just returned back the crumbled tickets. So, now i had a lot of paper missing from the book and not enough donations to match the missing paper. I don't know what came over me at that time but I got scared that people would accuse me of stealing some of the donations. I feared the adults alot and thought a lot of horrible scenarios, which now that I'm older I know could have easily been resolved if i had just explained. so I never returned the donations and hid it away.

A lot of things happened ever since and I've changed but, i can no longer go back to find the person to apologise or repay the few people that had donated. (because I've moved countries)

335,"I love clothes a bit too much, I’d say I own around 300-500+ items of clothing, they take up more than double the space my gf’s clothes do and the worst part of it all is I wear maybe a good 10-15% if that of them. 

To make matters worse, I struggle throwing things away - and I do actually really like a large majority of the things I own.

Has anyone got any tips on how I can bring myself to wear more of my clothes and avoid wearing the same 10 things all the time?

There many other constructive ways to entertain yourself (yet still very enjoyable) yet, I keep clicking on youtube pin on my browser's front page and going for hours of pointless stuff. Watching pewdiepie, stupid stream highlights etc... 

It feels like it's melting my bain but when I get home, the only thing my body wants is to crumble into my chair and deactivating my brain when my mind wants to do something else. If I try to picture myself doing anything like reading, making music or else.. a wave a repulsive energy invades my brain and tells me no no..

Then I'm pregnant and on valentine's day I see hes texting transwomen telling them how much better they are than cis woman. He flip flops between saying he just likes to dress and that hes trans. Then cheating via the internet happens over and over again with empty promises of it never happening again. Then I give birth and 2 months later hes ""meeting other trans women"" because he needs trans friends. It was a date. He didnt go. He flirted with her. I hate that I love him so much. He frequently yells at me until I'm locked in the bathroom quivering in a corner. He frequently throw thjngs. I think about leaving all the time. I dont know why he made a child with me if I'm not what he wants. I've become transphobic at this point. Not hatred towards them just actually scared of them and feeling extreme anxiety every time I'm near a transgender person. 
I often find myself wondering if the abuse comes from his identity that he represses. I'm not attracted to trans women. Before him I was but now I'm terrified and slightly spiteful towards them. I dont like giving or receiving anal and I know hes gonna cheat on me physically one day. I dont know what to do anymore. I want to leave but it's not that simple.

I think that part of my issues and insecurities are because of the way my parents raised me, or the way they payed attention to certain things I did. I have a problem with taking everything personally and seeing critique as a personal attack (and by doing so defending myself and sometimes insulting others). I want to get better but I know that I can only achieve that with the help of my parents. How do I ask/tell them that I think they are part of the reason I have these issues without sounding like I want to insult their parental skills? I am also not a 100% sure that they did sth specifically wrong in the way they raised. I just want to get behind my issues and find reasons and explanations.

342,"My (19M) dad (~45M) has been weirdly invested himself in letting out his emotions in whatever way he wants, since last year he was working in his office and used to stay in his office till 9-10pm and did everything over there but this year as everything was shut he was working from home.

 My dad had a small business of 3d architecture, but as corona virus came houses stopped being built and architect. So he came up with a whole different business idea and shutted off the old one partly. My mom works as a govt employees so she handles the house till...

Now, I understand building a business from scratch takes a lot of effort especially when you're doing it all alone but it's impossible to achieve if you don't have a right mindset.

My dad get very EXCITED on small things like an aeroplane goes by our house and due to radiations the comput screen flickers (don't know exactly what happened but it's some kind of radiation that messes up idk) or being FURIOUS on small things like me getting 10mins late from my evening walk.

I tried my best to make him realise that this behaviour is not good for him and for anyone near him in general. You should not become slave of your emotions! 

But he always thinks that he knows more than me in EVERY THING in life and I should shut up and do my homework.

My mom has started behaving the same way and all these excess of emotions are being showered on me and my younger brother (16M) whenever dad shouts for ANYTHING that dosent even matter to anyone I find a way to release those bad thoughts by constantly punching a wall or shouting at people when I go to park (after which I feel terribly embarrassed) I have found a way to control this by feeling empathy for him and saying something like he's ill or not good to talk right now to myself but that's sorta not working out that well now.

I've tried every single method to talk to him and make him understand his behaviour but IT'S IMPOSSIBLE because of his ego. I can't change him.

346,"throwaway, sorry for it being long in advance. this all happened when I was 15 (16F) so not long ago. TW: Su*cide

When I was younger I would throw suicide around, started at like 10. It wasnt ok. When I had a argument with someone, would tell them that I was going to off myself because of them, sometimes say I was gonna off myself for attention.

Fast forward I join this Twitter fandom. I met my (ex) best friend on there. Ended up falling out. I was the annoying fly that would text and block her for attention when I missed her.  I messaged and blocked her once again. We became friends again and made up. Most of the time our falling outs would be because I refuse to apologize for stuff I did wrong. I would apologize for stupid stuff but never took accountability for anything major. Long story short we weren't friends anymore, and I kept throwing subs at her on social media. Honestly it was obsessive. Everything I posted was towards her. Then got into an argument with her after she finally called me out, and I told her that I was going to off myself because of her. Mind you she told me she had PTSD/ADHD before and she knew I was going to do that it would mess her up. I also told another person (same fandom) that I would off myself and make ""13 reasons why list"" and the final person, I told them I was going to off myself because of them. As disgusting as it is, I didnt think it was a problem. I thought at the time I was just melting down, or the one suffering so I could say stuff like that, not realizing it was manipulative, abusive, and wrong. And I came to conclusion that I am a emotional abuser. I got exposed as you could say by all three of them, everyone in our fandom started attacking me. It was a 2 hour thing of us going back and forth. They were calling me a psychopath, saying how sick and disgusting I am. Making jokes comparing me to Hannah Baker and I was sick in the head. I delete my acc, and go back to my personal. Somehow they found that, and blocked me. (When I would see who my only friend was interacting with, it would be a link, meaning user blocked me) curiosity got the best of me so I went on another account to see what was up. I knew that one of the people that I had manipulated told a few people, and leading up to the exposing it was my own mutuals that were shading me, I shaded back when I should've just kept quiet. my biggest regret. Anyways, its a screenshot of me throwing shade, having a mental break down, you can see that I was breaking down. Got 17 likes, and the people that were attacking me or also saying how disgusting I was, were retweeting it. At this point Idk what to do. The people who still talk about it were people who werent  affected at but defended their friends. So should I just let them bash? Someone said if I was really sorry I'd accept all bash that came my way, which are mostly jokes mocking me calling me disgusting/sick. I just don't know. Thanks for reading.",04Nov2020,1

350,"I’ll try and make this short, I (m 26) have met a lot of girls over the last 7 or so years. Whether that’s via OLD or IRL it doesn’t matter, I formed good relationships with many of these girls and could have had relationships with them. However, when I was between the ages of 18-22/23, my father and my brother kept telling me I’m way to young to be in a relationship and have a girl tell me what I can and can’t do with my own free time, they essentially made it out that I’d lose my free will. 

And so came the commitment issues. Now, while I said I formed a lot of good relationships over the years with girl, I also lost a LOT of of friends that I had met via OLD or IRL because of it, I would meet a girl, bang or whatever and then I’d never wanna hear from them again, I’d stop replying to their messages and no longer initiate conversations. 

My problem is now, I don’t attract girls like I used to even though I’m only 26, it feels like I’m 36 the way that I get so little matches on OLD. I’ve finally gained some wisdom after all this time and learnt to never burn bridges. I was young and dumb and had gotten bad advice. 

I had chances for relationships with many attractive and interesting girl, but the shitty advice I’d gotten matched with my own stupidity blinded me to what I could have had, I even missed out on the girl who I now see as the love of my life (different story won’t get into it). 

A problem I have now as well is that I think I’ve went from being a little bit of a dick in my younger years, which girls always seem to like for some reason? To being a nice guy now, and I can see drastic differences in how my conversations go now compared to then. 
In terms of advice, I’m not sure what I’m looking for, but it’s just hard because I feel like a lot of the guys asking for dating advice have never even had the chance with girls, not so much as a second look. Whereas I’ve had a lot of great girls and now lost quite literally every single one of them, as life moves on, but I’m a slow learner. 

If anyone can offer any advice for me it’d be great. I think maybe the psyche behind this for me is that, i had a decently long period of success with women, even now I still have casual sex semi regularly. But I feel like now with the results I get from OLD I don’t have a chance, and even when I do get lucky, like I did just before corona hit, I went on a date with a nice girl, we agreed to go on a second, but she broke it off after we both got home on the first date.

360,"Ever since I started junior-high school was when I really noticed a significant decline in my attention span on projects and school work and it was definitely worse than usual. I just really couldn't find myself to do schoolwork if I don't see a clear goal or reward in my path, like if I put all this hard work into my grades will it amount to anything when I am an adult? How do I know I won't just screw up some job and be living on the streets? I'm also just drawn to things to give me something to do rather than to do something that's boring and repetitive like homework. Me personally, being bored is legitimately painful and I always need to be doing something to entertain myself. This is when I looked into ADHD. I haven't been diagnosed to this day but many sites I look at say I have a pretty mild to severe case. I've talked to my mother about it and she just written it off and said I was normal and I was going through things everyone else did, even though I had this attention span problem for as long as I remember even when I was a toddler.

I've recently gotten into high school now and things are only getting worse. My grades are dipping and are nearing the worst grades I have ever gotten in my lifetime. I mentally couldn't get myself to do homework because it was just not interesting enough. Of course I know it is beneficial and I really want to work on it, but whenever I try my brain automatically shuts it out looking for something else that could be entertaining. My parents really hate this decline and have had yelled at me at some occasions, which is reasonable since all my classes were basically Fs. The more I try working at it the more inefficient I get which makes my parents angry, which then again makes me more inefficient and depressed. 

And this online school crap isn't helping because it makes learning even harder and I haven't even seen my real friends for nearly a year. They didn't even call/text or even try communicating with me which gave me anxiety to just call them myself. And being all alone by myself only gets the depression worse and deeper. The only friends I have are online ones I meet while gaming, but having friends I never even met in person doesn't amount to the feeling of having an actual friend there where you can physically face-to-face meet. Hell, since I don't have any real friends to talk to nowadays I starve for the attention of my online ones to points where I am just waiting for them to get online so I can play a game with them.

Wrong, I do that and a bunch of old programs I have installed on my begin to pop up including the VPN software and my PC begins to randomly just download Steam. Something I tried getting months ago but got tired of all of the hard work of logging, setting up an account etc. and just kinda left it there in my Files. My cursor seemed  to be moving on it's own and even now something my Cursor jitters without me even touching it. These small ""Glitches"" or ""Lag"" don't even seem like Glitches or Lag anymore. various scenarios are just playing in my head at this point... Am I  being hacked? Is someone doxxing me? Is it someone I've annoyed on the internet? Can they see what I'm doing on my screen? Is it from someone who used the same VPN as me and they somehow have my internet connection? Will they Blackmail or humiliate me for being a Young horny teenager (13) looking at rather uhhh how do i put it? Let's just say: Rather questionable porn when both curious and Horny.

376," I need some advice. I have a sister who is older than me by 3 years. She is currently suffering from depression as a result of losing her job in the entertainment industry and going through a messy breakup during lockdown. I have been trying to support her emotionally for months, since before lockdown, during lockdown and since that ended I have tried to finally flee the nest and stand on my own two feet. I had a rough few months, with my job being delayed and not receiving any benefits to help pay the bills during quarantine. It took me months prior to this to even get the job because competition is high in my department and I don't currently drive due to anxiety. Basically, ever since my mum moved out of the house she has been feeling lonely and has asked me to be around for her. I have even delayed moving in with my boyfriend as this would have upset her but I feel at breaking point. She says that she feels lonely and can't stand to be in the house by herself and so has a go at me for not being around enough, despite me working full time in an office. My mum has been coming down despite restrictions and living 30 miles away to try and be around the house for her but its made no difference to her mental health. The one time I was able to convince her to go see an online therapist, she went to two meetings and gave up. I keep telling her that the underlying issue is that she is not working through her issue with being alone, she is just trying to grab at anyone who will keep her company which isn't a longterm solution. But she insists that I am just not taking her seriously and that I am being so unforgivingly unsupportive. It's making me very resentful. I love my sister, I want her to be happy. But I can't stand that myself and my mum have been going out of our way to be there for her without any acknowledgement or thanks. She acts so entitled to our time and energy and throws a hissy fit whenever I refuse or try to set boundaries about how I spend my spare time. I feel like she's completely given us responsibility for her mental health and its taken me so long to get myself to a happy position in life that I feel like I can't even enjoy it because she makes me feel guilty for wanting to spend time away from my mum's house. I wish she could be happy for me, moving in with my boyfriend for the first time is no small event and its being tarnished by her comments that by leaving her I am being unsupportive and that I am rushing into my relationship (even though we have been dating for over a year now).

We have a really dysfunctional family I have alot of fucked up stories  mostly about my father but i dont need advice on that atm
Atm I want to convince my mom to let my brother leave

My brother was a college dropout(which i dont mind) however the reason he dropped out 3-4 colleges was because he dint wanna wake up early despite my mom doing so for him, hes quite toxic with a victim mindset, he's also jobless bc my mum takes care of him despite him yelling and fighting my mum all the time.
 he had shitty girlfriends and was a two timer, until he got someone pregnant, a 18 year old girl, I forgot to mention he's 22 or smthing idk.
It was okay a few weeks but after that he totally disregarded the baby and refused to even hold him while making a bunch of excuses and continues to play computer games.
now my mom and dad(my dad is another kind of extremely abusive which pretty much is why our family became really dysfunctional) is forced to take care of him.
Recently my mom and dad fights alot bc my dad wants my brother to leave and fend for his own if he refused to be a better person or atleast a better father however my mom wants him to stay because the only thing she wished in life was a perfect family
Idk who to siden although i hate to admit i kinda agree with my father. What do I do or say? 

Before saying anything about my mom heres a quick background, My mother is a reallllly good and loving person but shes too good that its making my brother spoiled rotten.
My mother grew up from a really poor family infact one of her only wish was to know what burger tasted like  lol, she donates all the time to sick children or to charity secretly and she works extremly hard(workaholic) and now shes successful andowns alot of property but she found out she had kidney disease when it was already failing, luckily we found a donor and she became a kidney transplant but even after that she continued to work and work and work while constantly abused by my brother and father and is now forced to care for my brothers baby, she doesnt complain much and sometimes i see her secretly crying in the backyard( i give her space)
Thats why I want to agree with my father but I want to fulfill my moms wish of a complete family",04Nov2020,1

380,"I'm feeling old. Like really old. But I'm still in my prime. Compared to my not too distant younger self, I've reached a point where I've matured in my social reading skills enough to catch the hidden intent and meaning behind what and how people say a lot of  things I used to take for face value, and I don't like what I see.

I litterally can't go a day at work without someone trying to subtly demean me, say they are better than me, imply Im not trying, or just mock me for having an oppinion. I told my boss I'm probably going to transfer to a new location and that the work culture was why as well as most of the people I liked having quite or transfered already. 

He said he'd hate to loose me. He's a good guy so I didn't say explicitly, but I really blame him for my dilemma. He's the GM and he does all of the hiring. The few times I've tried to convey that I didn't like some of the workplace behavior or that he wasn't giving me the hours/shifts we had agreed on, he basically did nothing but make empty promises. 

I'm taking a week vacation soon and told him I'd think it over more during it. But honestly I asked for the vacation thinking maybe I was just burned out and needed a break. But every day since I asked for the vacation last month ive made note of at least one instance of the behavior/treatment/attitudes that are making me hate working with a lot of these people. Honestly I already feel like it's not just in my head and a vacation isn't going to make a difference. I told him that this was why I'd asked for the vacation and that since then I've only gotten more sure.

I'm afraid if I switch locations I'll just run into the same problems. Especially because my bosses wife manages that location.  I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong at work. I just feel like I'm to aware of how disrespectful and arrogant my coworkers are to maintain any self respect without confronting them on it. I've already snapped at a couple of managers and asked them if they'd prefer to do my job for me when they are rushing me when I'm already an hour ahead of schedule. This is a regular thing and I'm tired of busting my butt only to have it implied im slow because other employees that do a bad job finish faster. Oftentimes slowing me down as I redo their work.

Also looking back at a decent number of my jobs I had when I was younger and less socially intelligent I realize this same kind of toxic work environment was very prevelant and I just wasn't as savvy to it, though I knew something didn't sit right but just assumed it was just lazy coworkers.

I don't want to be a jerk but more and more I feel people keep testing my tolerance or even just flat out disrespecting me. The only thing that seems to stop it is being an enormous jerk and never sharing any personal opinions on anything.

How normal is this? I feel like this is something HR isn't handled to fix and that honestly my boss is largely liable for being an issue in the first place. So despite his offer to help I don't view him as capable. And even if he was more capable I dont see how you can force people to me more mature or less arrogant.

I feel transferring is the right move. Especially since one of my favorite managers already transferred to the same location. Though I'm fighting cold feet and am hoping for outside input.",04Nov2020,1

389,"Hi everyone,

Im sorry in advance if this is in the wrong sub.

First time posting on this sub and just want some advice/clarification on whether or not I was raised by narcs. 

Quick background, I was predominantly raised in a single parent environment - I have a stepdad who my mum has been with for 20+ years however, growing up I only saw him of a weekend until they got married in 2002. Despite them marrying , giving me a brother and creating a family ""unit"", my stepdad would always segregate me by calling me ""golden child"" whenever he and my mum argued and when they would argue, it would be explosive.

I lived at home with them up until I was 26 and all of the following continued up until the point at which I moved in with my boyfriend. I paid £500 per month to live in the box room of the house - my parents said that me paying £500 p/m was them subsidising me - and they made me give them so much money towards my savings account. I worked a shitty arse job - shitty because I had been working there for 8 years in the same department - that was a 2 minute walk away from my parents house earnt around £1050 at the time. I had around £50 disposable income by the time all my rent and savings money was deducted.

&amp;#x200B;

These are all actions that my parents enforced within the family home and what I had to adhere to:

\- I was never allowed friends round as my mum never wanted ""strangers"" to see what possessions we had in the house.

\- I was never allowed to shower past a certain time in case it woke my brother.

\- I wasn't allowed to stay downstairs to watch TV after my family had gone to bed - this was usually around 10/11pm.

\- My mum would call me relentlessly asking when I was coming home if I was out in the evening with friends. If I did not answer within her timely fashion -eg 30 seconds- she would leave countless voicemails. She would also say if im not back by \_\_\_ time that she was locking the front door and would not open it till the morning.

\- My mum frequently read my diary to the point that I stopped keeping one.

\- My mum went through my things and eventually found my birth control.

\- My dreams of travelling was met with criticism.

\- I wanted to move to London a few years back to grow as a person and ""find myself"" if you will. I also wanted to move to switch career fields.My folks quickly shot it down my degrading the location.

There are more things I could mention.

My stepdad has demonstrated some equally bizarre actions however, that's another post in itself. My parents had never met my boyfriend or even attempted to get to know him. They only met him in the delivery room when I was in labour with our child.

I think I should also mention that my parents have no friends, have no real close relationships with family members and do not often travel or go out. My mum has lived in the same place for the past 50 years and seems to have no interest in broadening her horizons on that one.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to act advanced. And no one questions it, yet I'm constantly, fastidiously doubting it, because I know that isn't me.

I say I don't care about my appearance. Other than brushing my hair and showering, I don't care for my appearance at all. Because the ways I want to appear aren't possible, as I don't have the resources to actualize them.

I'm a 14-year-old boy. I have curly, brown hair, an incredibly hairy body, and I'm overweight. I have large hands, a large nose, a small mouth, and facial hair. I hate how I look.

I want to be clean-shaven. I want to be curvy. I want a plump butt, vagina, and breasts. I want long, black flowing hair. I want Asian skin. I don't wear to wear boys clothes. I wanna wear dresses, leggings, makeup, Converse shoes, Vans, heels, boots, skinny jeans, overalls, sweaters, crop tops, makeup, and jewelry.

I hate trying to be who people expect me to be. I'm supposed to be a teenage intellectual, I'm expected to be a rhetorical prodigy. Everyone wants me to be fucking Einstein. I can't take it. I just wanna be a kid. I just wanna have fun.

But they'd never allow that. It would scare them. I was once watching an episode of Adventure Time, and my dad looked at me in bemusement: ""How do you go from Schopenhauer to this?""

People's expectations of me have robbed me of my childhood. All I want in life are the things I never enjoyed as a child: Hopper balls, cartoons, plushies, bounce houses, toys, video games, etc. I just wanna have fun.

Yeah, I'll hold a job, pay taxes, own my own home, of course. But all I want is to take the steps necessary to recreate the childhood I lost to high expectations and a fucking pandemic and be at peace with my body through transitioning and cosmetic surgery.

I feel dirty and disappointing. Everyone in my life expects me to become the author the next Plato's Symposoum, everyone wants me to unlock the key behind psychopolitics, everyone expects me to be a superhuman genius. And I want is to snuggle a teddy bear and watch Steven Universe. All I want is to be a woman.

I'm scared of what my family will think. Their son/nephew/grandchild who could once hold a conversation on the geopolitical buildup to the Russian Revolution is now someone who grew up looking like a Sephardic Jewish male and now looks like a southeast Asian woman, who spends their time off from work riding hopper balls, binging Adventure Time and We Bare Bears, and snuggling plushies.",04Nov2020,1

I've sort of come to terms with what I've done and how much I've messed up and I can't really change it, just might be destined to a solitary existence, if something does come up I mean I'll definately take it but it's not likely too. Is accepting that I'm jus going to be alone healthy?",04Nov2020,1

409,"Hi Reddit on mobile so forgive me 

First things first I live alone and because of my house contract I’m not allowed to have visitors, plus with the whole COVID situation it just made me feel more alone, so I basically see my GF once a week on sunday ( only day I get off )

Me is me 
Gf is gf 
Sis is sis 

Myself (28) and my Girlfriend (27) have been dating for 6months+  we are both very happy with each other.

We come from very different backgrounds mine being non-religious, herself being from a catholic upbringing.

I could tell her sister didn’t like me from the start me being very heavily tattooed (can cover all of them if I’m wearing work stuff) I’m guessing that would be the only reason because I’ve always been nice to her.

Yes we have had her troubles with her mom and dad but the more they got to know me they treat me as part of the family.

Over time the closer I have become with her parents the further her sister seems to push away, like I get it if you want some space but I haven’t seen you in two weeks the least you could do is say hi to me. 

So the issues properly started when my GF had all 4 wisdom teeth removed at the same time, I took her to the hospital took her home... cooked... cleaned... helped her in anyway I could.

I don’t think her sis liked that someone did that for GF but not for sis when she had hers taken out.

Fast forward to one week later when I’m due to go over....

Sis proceeds to tell her parents that she’s lost all trust in them and she wants to move out and she’s not allowed to for some fucked up reason.(if I knew I’d tell you)  and believes that GF is falling into old habits of having her ex come over on sunday, so she ordered that I only come over once every two weeks. Which her mom said that’s abit ridiculous because I live here alone.

Which I respect that so I don’t go over 

which left  me feel pretty shitty and lonely cuz I don’t very often get to just sit and talk with people.

So I call GF to see if I can go over which is met with I don’t think that is a good idea right now...


I can’t go over because GF’s sis has “anxiety” I know people will shout at me for putting anxiety in quotations but also shouldn’t she consider my feelings of not speaking to anyone for a week.

I’ve recently come to terms with we can’t be in the same room alone because “Jesus” which I respect religion but don’t force it on me.

It’s like we have to do what the sister says or we can’t do anything which is abit fucked up.... it’s like teenage shit.

I’m an adult not a child, I won’t be treated like one either.

Like I have to ask Gf parents permission to go on holiday with her... is it not like she’s old enough to make decisions on her own. 

I’m just abit stuck in the middle and it’s giving me anxiety thinking about just going over.

It’s like every time there’s a problem it’s one caused by sis but GF gets shouted.

I’m the type of person like if you have a problem with me let’s talk about it and find out why you feel this way and how can we solve it.

But sis never wants to talk about it... just sets fires and makes a break for it... 

Just feels very controlling and jealous of her

411,"Im 14 almost 15M and have no siblings.

Recently I've been in a lot of arguments with my parents, since I've grown up a little bit and now know how to form my own opinions and thoughts.

Whenever I get into arguments with my mom, my dad always takes my mom's side no matter what the argument is about, or if I'm in the right or wrong. They always end up winning, obviously because it's a 2 vs 1 and they are much older than me. That always makes me feel weak and puny and absolutely lowers my self confidence.

My dad always laughs at whatever I say mid argument and just completely ignores all my points. My mom just straight up doesn't listen to me.

This might sound a bit silly, but my love and respect for my parents are going down.

I do admit that i should learn how to get my emotions under control, because i always find myself not screaming, but raising my voice at my parents(but mostly only after they shout first). I do understand that it is disrespectful, but I don't understand why me shouting at them is any more disrespectful then them shouting at me. 

I don't owe anything to them, and the simple reason that they gave birth to me isn't gonna cut it. I didn't ask to be born and i would much rather have not been. Partially thanks to them.

I have found myself envying people with actual functional families, and I would honestly give anything to be a part of a nice functioning family.

I have come to hate myself and the way i am over the last few years, and i think that's mostly because of my parents constantly lowering my self esteem.

At one point, i cut myself because i was just so upset and depressed. (And before you think I'm just another teen faking depression for pity, i was actually diagnosed with depression and took antidepressants for a while.)

My dad was more upset about not me being depressed or wanting to harm myself, but how i inconvenienced him. He said something like how most jobs check your wrists for markings and don't hire you if you have a history of self harm. I don't think he takes mental illness that seriously.

When i did it again, my dad's reaction was more like ""oh not again"" the  actual concern.

I actually have no clue what to do. Im too young to move out or even get a real job, and will be stuck here for at least two or three more years. I'm at home most of the time due to COVID, and i just hate it.

Oh but there is always a possibility that I'm in the wrong every single time and I'm just an ignorant asshole. But my gut tells me that im not, and my parents are trying to make me feel like i am.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk. If you read this far? Thanks. I appreciate it. I don't really know what to expect from posting on reddit about this, and don't really think this will help that much, but hey, no harm in giving it a go right?

Again, thanks for reading this, and sorry for no to;dr. I feel like this wouldn't really fit in a few sentences.",04Nov2020,1
412,"So I’m an 18 year old college student and I am having a very strange issue. 

I have been close with this Mexican girl there is a lot more to that but I don’t want to give names of course so I’ll call her “A” and the other female “B”. So I have known A for a while and we have been very close friends but she takes 17 units at UCLA works a job full time and does a lot of volunteer work. She’s extremely busy and is really interested in me romantically but struggles to find time to relax and spend time with me on top of that but when we hang out we click so well and talk on the phone it’s amazing. Due to how busy she is which she is very busy she feels it’s not right to get in a relationship at the moment but we basically do everything like a relationship without titles and names. We go on each other’s phones because we are good friends and I know I’m the only guy in her romantic life. We are basically close friends with benefits. We workout together hangout together and do everything besides sex but everything leading up to it. She is great and I find her as wifey material if im able to stick out the distance we will have which I will be driving before she goes off in a year (we are all 18 btw) so I will be able to visit her by just driving down to LA for a weekend or so it’s like 8 hours of driving but for a good friend it’s reasonable. She said to me she likes me and wants me but doesn’t want to hold me down because she knows it will be difficult in a year when she is gone. So I was talking to other females but nothing serious until I met girl B. Girl B and I just clicked as well we play video games together laugh at the same dark humor and it is great. She has a lot of baggage though she was raped 2 years ago and attempted to commit suicide a year later and now we are great friends. She has told me her whole life story and has grown a close connection with me and I her. Girl B lives an hour away from me while girl A lives 10 minutes so actually getting to spend time together is gonna be dam near none until I get my license for girl B which it will at best be 2 months from now probably longer. Girl A drives and picks me up to hangout when we can. Girl A is extremely ambitious which I love she’s so hardworking it’s great while girl B and I click well she is still getting over her hardships and lives with her parents not in school but seeking treatment and taking medicine for her issues prescribed by the doctor. So I have a very strong connection with 2 females but the situation is very different as you can see. Girl A has recently showed an increased interest in me romantically as her long term option. Love is a difficult thing for me because I’m not sure what it is you know? But I have a great connection with both females and with girl B it is difficult as a partner to get over someone taking advantage of a person you care about so it will take a tole on me mentally for sure I’m a very insecure person I’ll admit it. I won’t say I love them both because I’m not sure what love is but I do care about them both and picking one to be my partner and main focus would almost guarantee losing the other all together. You can call me shallow I guess for having an issue with my partner being raped I know it’s not her fault but it’s difficult to cope with we a survivor and as a lover seeing your partner being taken advantage of. When she told me the story you know the images in my head and it’s horrifying. Telling me the details crying saying she didn’t think he’d lock the door and she didn’t know where she was because they drove around and she had no clue and was just scared. It’s horrifying hearing that from someone you care about. I may not be able to say I love either of them but I care about them both so much it’s crazy. 

Sorry for the long story but maybe if someone can give me how they see it from an outside unbiased opinion it can help. Everyone have an amazing day and please give me some advice",04Nov2020,1
413,"I know some variation of this question must get asked a few times a day, but I \*literally\* cannot get over this ex. It's pathetic. I have been broken up with her for 3 months and I cry myself to sleep  for hours literally every night over this girl. Maybe it was the circumstances by which the relationship ended, or maybe it was the fact that I bought her a $300 diamond necklace three weeks before I begged her to leave me. I was unstable, manic, and hurting her simply by being with her due to my own self-deprecation and emotional instability. So, I did the kindest thing I could think of and told her to run away from me as fast as she could because I was bad news. 

I begged her to leave me for 2 hours (while I was hypomanic and probably talking a million miles a minute) until she finally listened to me, understood that I was a bipolar piece of shit who didn't deserve her, and left for her own good. That's a year of my life wasted. She has since moved on with someone else and is doing better. She's happier. I did what I set out to do, which was make her happy even at my own expense. 

He is fucking her the way that I could not fuck her and taking care of her emotionally the way that I could not take care of her, all due to my bipolar depression and crippling inability to escape it. It prevented me from even having sex with her because I suffered from depression-induced ED, and that was really the last straw for her in my opinion. I also did a lot of her schoolwork for her because, well, she let me. 

Point blank, I got used and discarded like a piece of trash while being told I was loved dearly. She knew everything about me. Over a year she got to know my deepest insecurities and thoughts. I still love her but she isn't mine to love anymore. 

We don't talk anymore because she has blocked me on everything, nor does she know how badly I am suffering in her absence. She used to call me a part of her family, and now she is gone without a single trace. She used to tell me that she wanted to be with me forever, and that was a lie. She used to tell me she wanted to marry me, and now she could give a fuck whether I live or die. I could give a fuck whether I live or die. 

The best part is, everything is my fault because she would have stayed with me if I didn't beg her to leave me and maybe I could have gotten stable with her by my side, and I can't seem to get over this girl. She lives in my head rent-free all day before infiltrating my dreams at night, and I can't take it anymore. I'm never getting her back, ever, and because of that I don't want to be here without her. 

I flunked out of college - losing a full scholarship - as soon as she left me because my depression got to the point of being unmanageable (which ended in a trip to the psychiatric hospital), and now I am back at home with my abusive family while she's having sex with and cuddling someone else on the dorm bed we used to sleep on. 

Now that she is no longer with me and because my circumstances have eroded in this manner, I've tried to kill myself 5 times in her absence and I'm seriously considering making another attempt whenever I get paid and can afford to end this game we call life in a painless manner. Again, I'm not sure how to get over losing somebody I considered my wife and forever figure. However, I need to find a way to do so very soon or I'm going to end up dead. 

I don’t have any friends or family who would have really cared about my present existence except for her, who does not care anymore. 

I'm definitely overreacting and I'm hoping someone can say something that will make me feel even a little bit better.",04Nov2020,1
414," Hey, so, I need y'alls opinion about something. So, I'm a cisgendered, teenage female. (Nothing against trans people or anything). So, I know this, and I have no interest in being a guy. I'm happy being a girl! But recently, I've started wanting to do something, and I have no idea why. Why do I want to change my appearance from feminine, to androgynous, to masculine, whenever I want? There are prob better ways of wording that, but whatever. So basically, I want to look like a girl some days, and a man the next. But I don't want to BE a man, just look like one. I wouldn't be doing it to trick people, either. I'd go by my female name, use my normal voice, and if people asked, I'd tell them I'm a girl. And when I say look like a guy, I don't just mean wear, like, clothes from the men's aisle. I want to use makeup to make my face more masculine, wear a minimizing bra or binder, and stick a sock in my pants or something. But I only want this some days. Sometimes I want to look like a girl. And sometimes I want to look androgynous. Why do I want this? And yes, I've looked into gender fluidness. Gender fluid (def: denoting or relating to a person who does not identify themselves as having a fixed gender.) does not match, because I don't want to change my gender or stop identifying as female. I just want to look like I'm a he or an it, you know? And I have not done any of this yet, by the way. I haven't told anyone about these urges, either. I know my family would think it's weird. It is weird! I don't know, what should I do? I've looked all over the internet, but I can't find an explanation. Anyway, thanks for listening, and have a nice day.",04Nov2020,1
415,"Hi everyone, thought I would heed your advice on what I could do (alone) during Christmas. 

My family does not celebrates Christmas and it used to be a annual affair to gather at one of our Catholic friend's place on 25 December with the rest of our ex-college mates. Over time, the clique of 12 drifted and became 'sub-cliques' (you know what I mean). I speak to a few, and have gone almost no-contact with the majority of them. The tradition of spending Christmas at our friend's home is long over (also thanks to Covid-19) after I left for Australia to pursue my studies.

I also recently called off an emotionally abusive relationship and while I can count the number of close friends I have with just my ten fingers, it also becomes increasingly lonely and the fact that I am a fresh grad still looking for job opportunities in my home country doesn't helps my situation (I have graduated and returned to the motherland). If I had a stable job, I would have focused on my work and not given a thought about the loneliness that consumes me on most days, but I don't and I really want to do something exciting (even if it means celebrating alone) this Christmas. 

To the singletons whose family does not celebrates Christmas, how do you spend the day (if you do are not in the company of friends)? Any advice how I could spend mine and not feel like a loser? :(",04Nov2020,1
416,"My job has gotten unbelievably stressful lately. Management has been piling on work like it’s nothing and getting angry when I don’t call clients back right away yet offer no solutions. I assist people who are ill filing for compensation with a federal program. If these ill individuals die, their families can claim on their behalf. We have one attorney who is in charge and a managing paralegal. Weve recently had 4 coworkers who have left and as a result, I have taken on some of their claims. 

The issue started with one claim in particular- my last coworker dropped the ball and left the claim sitting for 2 years. No work was done on it whatsoever for those 2 years nor was it ever submitted....the attorney emails me and tells me that he is going to call the wife (it’s a death claim and she is filing on behalf of her deceased husband) and eat shit for what happened. Then he would email me and tell me when to call. 

So he emails me yesterday asking me to call her and mentions “don’t tell her we fucked up the claim.” I call her and sure enough she’s upset because she had wanted to talk to the attorney and HE NEVER CALLED HER! She was nice enough to say none of this was my fault and still wanted to talk to the attorney despite me telling her what we’re doing for the claim. The worst part is she never knew the claim wasn’t submitted. The conversation reached a point where she kept pressing for a date as to when the claim was put in- I PANICKED AND LIED and said the claim was submitted last year. She now wants me to email her with dates of when this was done. After the call, I emailed the attorney and explain what happened, including the lie, and he said nothing more than “ill give her a call.”

I’m just so upset right now. I’ve already been feeling worn out with this job...the amount of work they’re giving is insane...and this incident was the final straw. I hate my boss for putting me in that position and I feel terrible for lying and know it’ll bite me in the ass. This job has been so draining and I’m just ready to quit already. I take pride in my work and care about my clients a lot, and just feel like I’m constantly being set up to fail.

I just don’t know what to do now- should I call the client and tell her it was an error and tell her when the claim was actually submitted? Should I wait on the boss to see what he says? I feel so stuck and sad.",04Nov2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my mid 20s. I've been with my gf for about 5 years now. I was her first everything, and honestly - our relationship isn't bad whatsoever. I have this ridiculous feeling that there is more out there for the two of us. I know we will both grow more as people if we experience life with other people. We have been long-distance for a couple years now as I needed to move for work. It hasn't been bad.

&amp;#x200B;

This would be a whole lot easier if she treated me poorly or done something wrong. She's done nothing wrong and loves me endlessly. Her family loves me as well and only says good things about me. She is always really communicative with me, we have a great sex life (when we see eachother) and we give eachother nice gifts, her more-so than me (she has a bit more money).

I have urges to cheat (I never would and never have) and have a consistent feeling that things would be better if I was single. My feelings have dulled towards her ""losing love"" kinda thing and with these constant thoughts I believe it would be the right thing to do to leave her, not just for me but her also. As I was her only ""proper"" boyfriend (long term) I think she would be better off experimenting her feelings with other people, and that goes for me too.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem boils down to how do I do this. How do I bring myself to tell her? I would feel so, so guilty. She's done nothing wrong at all and has been an awesome, loving girlfriend. She would be so depressed and her work life would probably suffer as a result (she's a really sensitive person). I couldn't do this over text or phone, so i'd have to see her in person. She would be excited to see me which would make it worse to tell her the bad news. I'm absolutely lost on how to bring myself to do this and how I would deal with her pain afterward. She lives at her parents house, which is fine! But she relies on moving into my place as her escape from that as she said she wouldn't feel comfortable with living with anyone else, and this just makes me feel even more guilty because i'd feel like i'm trapping her :(

Despite my learning disability and past hardships in school, I spent 9th grade and the first three semesters of 10th Grade a 4.2 High Honor Roll student.

422,"I turned 20 this year and I'm at a crossroads...Some quick background, I studied economics for a few months but didn't like it, so I spent the rest of the year mostly wasting time doing non productive things and enrolled in an easy college for the student benefits, but I did think about my future amidst all that.

I thought about what I wanted to do in the future and nothing really interested me apart from maybe working in the game industry as a 3D artist. So I sought out a few schools but kind of ""decided"" on one in Sweden, mostly because it's highly rated and has no tuiton costs. Great, I thought. I started researching the possibility of living and studying in Sweden, eventually I contacted one of the staff at that university. They quickly explained the admission requirements, one of them being a translation of documents and a TOEFL English test. Each costing quite a bit (translation 150-200€ and TOEFL 233€). So far I only passed the test and have yet to translate the documents.

Anyway, I was 100% sure I wanted to go no matter the cost because, frankly, I couldn't see myself doing anything else. But as the deadline grows nearer I find myself thinking more and more about this. And am unsure anymore if it's the best choice for me...

I now have 2 choices. The first one being, I translate the documents, send the application, wait and hopefully get accepted. I then pay an unknown amount to actually get there, rent an apartment for 300-400€ per month and attend college there with large expenses. This choice is a big plus because I really want that college experience which I was unable to get so far (coronavirus aside), I'd also be getting lessons from industry professionals and I'd be able to make connections for a better future career. Downside is, this would be extremely expensive and I'm not exactly sitting on cash right now.

My other choice is to keep attending the current college (which is sort of a joke) and attempt to self-teach 3D modelling and animation, but as I am extremely unmotivated I hardly see that being as effective as going to actual college. I could also save a ton of money, I guess.

I've been dating my bf since senior year of HS and he basically became my best friend over time, mainly due to the fact that i don't have a lot of other friends, i have 1 female friend from HS that i still talk to from time to time, i made 3 friends in college, 2 of them came from out of town (13 hours away) and i lost touch with the other (she has 2 kids and a husband now).

She is great and we really get along but she lives over 1 hour away from my house so we don't make plans on weekends and she's mainly just a work friend, everyone in my department is much much older then me and although i do get along with them, i don't really see myself making plans with them on weekends, i'm roughly 24 years younger than the youngest person in my department and one of whom is my mother. 

Same thing with my 1 friend from HS, we live far from each other and our schedules rarely align, but we try to meet up once a month. The other girl that i consider a friend is my bfs friend girlfriend and we only see each other when our bfs hangout but we text from time to time, i've asked her to hangout a few times and she's said no most times, we've hungout maybe twice in the last 5 years. 

My main issue is that i also don't have any hobbies, i don't really have a passion for anything and quit all of extra curricular activities when HS was over and most aren't offered to older people anyway, my bf is passionate about restoration and is in his garage most nights and if he's not in his garage he's out with his friends (my bf has a lot of friends) doing a bunch of stuff, he'll bring me along when it's possible but i hate the feeling of being ""that"" gf who follows her bf around everywhere he goes. 

We bought our first house last year, and i spend most of my time waiting around for him to come home and hangout with me, and i hate this, i adopted a dog 2 months after moving in, she keeps me company and i do stuff with her, but it's just not comparable to having friends to hangout with. We recently got a puppy, per my request, and even though i do love my dogs i wish i had something else to do besides spending time with them and had a bit of human interaction outside of work.

A few weeks ago, i mentioned to my bf that i was considering downloading Bumble Friends, to help me find some friends, he laughed a bit at the idea and thought it was a bit weird and mentioned that i do have friends... i explained that although i do technically have 3 friends, i rarely see them outside of work and only talk to them from time to time and explained how it upset me that i'm constantly waiting around for him to come home, he's allowed to go do whatever he want and i'd never tell him he's not allowed but the reality is that i do find myself waiting for him to come spend time with me. Has anyone used Bumble friends?

Basically, i'm looking for advice on what to do, preferably a hobby that doesn't cost a lot of money and could get me out of the house on weekends, any tips on making friends? I'm really more of an introvert and would struggle going out and making friends on my own which is why i am considering Bumble friends, i do really want some friends and hobbies.",04Nov2020,1

427,"So here’s the story. Someone posted their 2019 vehicle for a lease transfer and I decided to do it because he already paid a year and I’m planning on buying it out at the end. Anyways, his incentive was that he would pay the first month and the transfer fees. He paid the transfer fees but I technically only got 3 weeks of payment because I got the vehicle the second week after he paid instead of the first week and then he transferred me enough for two weeks, if that makes sense. Anyways, I noticed there were wheel locks on the vehicle and he didn’t give me the key. I messaged him Sunday and he said he was just at work. Then I messaged him Monday. Still no reply. So, today is the day that the payment comes out but there was a chance that it would still come out of his bank and he already sent me the payment under good faith. Should I send the money back? Or don’t send it back until I get the keys? Or should I use that money to get them removed and send him what’s left? Because without a key or lug nuts. It’s going to cost money to get them removed. Sorry for the formatting, I’m on mobile. I hope this all makes sense.",04Nov2020,1

Halloween weekend comes up and I see on his story and the stories of other friends a massive party he hosted that I had no information about at all so the next day I messaged him and asked ""wasnt I invited?"" To which he replied ""To be honest I totally forgot to invite you"" ""I dont even think to invite you anymore so please hit me up more"" 
 This cut me deeply as he didnt even apologize and he put it on me making me feel like its my fault he forgot about me. 

For a bit of backstory our friendship has been slowly fading for a while now yet everytime Ive hosted something he has always been invited. I also hung out with him only last month so I doubt he would just 'forget' me like that when we have been best mates for years...

In my eyes its the last straw and the fact he didnt apologise really shows the kind of person he is. 

I plan on ending the friendship tomorrow but I would like some other opinions is ending the friendship a fair response to being treated like this? If I dont do it this way I feel like I wont be showing myself the respect I deserve.",04Nov2020,1

432,"I'm (22F) currently in a bit of a fight with a friend (24M). I say a bit of a fight because I'm trying to be the bigger person and I apologized and we're talking now. We argued because I was sarcastic and he told me 'don't talk to me like that'. 

I have been annoyed with my new boss and needed to vent, I said that I needed to be negative for a bit, and didn't want advice. He's has a crush on my boss (but he's known me way longer so I thought he'd hear me out neutrally) and he started defending her and I didn't feel validated. I sarcastically said I 'didn't ask' for him to defend her like that and that's when he snapped and told me 'don't talk to me like that'. I was shocked for him to get so defensive because I'm usually very sarcastic and my humor is very dry so I'm always sarcastic but never serious. It's a big part of just the way I talk (to everyone) so I thought he'd realize I wasn't being serious. 

I quickly apologized, making sure to actually mean it and not do one of those apologies that say 'I'm sorry you're upset' (I have been guilty of doing that to other people in the past). He didn't accept the apology and ghosted me the whole night. He always talks to me about how he's ghosting this person and that person so I feel quite disrespected that he'd do that to me with our long friendship after I immediately apologized. I was crying a lot of the night and couldn't stop thinking about it. 

Now he's talking to me like normal but I feel quite upset about the whole thing. I don't feel like I can joke or be sarcastic around him anymore because I don't know if he'll take it seriously or not. We usually talk a lot so it's making conversation quite difficult but I don't want him to snap at me again. I will definitely not be talking about my boss to him ever again frankly. But I don't want things to get awkward as we have a lot of mutual friends. How do I let this go? Should I avoid joking with him again? Am I being toxic by feeling upset about this?

I am 18, and started university this year for the first time ever. At first there were these online sessions where we had to introduce ourselves and the normal things. There was this girl in my class and I found her pretty good looking. 

One class started, which was in October, we had to go to class two days a week, where there was a different class for the two days. This girl was in my class for one of the classes twice. I wanted to ask her for her number but I didn’t, because I was too much of a pussy. 

After that day, I convinced my self that I was going to ask her for her number. The day came when we were meant to be in class, but she wasn’t there. I waited another week and she wasn’t there either. 

I don’t know where this girl is, I am not sure if she just doesn’t come to class or if she changed her degree, but I don’t know where she is for a chance to talk to her. It’s really eating me up inside bc I wanted to ask her out on a date to see what could possibly happen. 

Also, I think I found her Instagram but I don’t know if it’s her as her face isn’t on her profile and she’s private. Should I follow her Instagram page and talk to her? I would have done that but I feel like that’s kinda creepy that I stalked her Instagram.

He called me in the evening asking if I wanted to get dinner with him the next day. I agreed, was excited, did my make up and planned a cute outfit.

When he arrived (6pm) he said he needed to drop some things off to his friends and asked me to come along. It’s 40 mins each way, we get there and his friends invite me in. We had coffee and chatted for 30 mins, embarked on our 40 min journey home. By now it’s 10 to 8, I called a few places and couldn’t get a table anywhere.

We went to the supermarket and I bought steak, cooked it, cleaned up after. He then was in bed by 9.40 saying he’s tired and wanted to sleep. In the morning, he said he was too late for work to drop me off and left before I was even out of bed.

441,"He asked me for a specific amount of money that isn’t large at all, and he told me what he needed it for. He said it was for a plane ticket so he can get to his brother to go live there so he can “start over”. Many question came to mind such as as that amount of money can easily be made from one day of working or borrowing from someone in person like a parent or something, but he said he was homeless while explaining everything in that first message which made me think he was in prison for a while and that can easily make him lose everything (possessions, people he know, maybe disowned by parents, etc.) and since I wouldn’t know anything I was a “safe” person to ask for help. 

The problem is I have no problem giving it to him. He says he’ll pay it back. But I don’t like being paid back. One I give it, it’s a gift. To me “I’ll pay you back” is just a word of courtesy. If you actually pay me back it just strengthens our friendship and is not expected.

The problem is I don’t KNOW if he is honest or if he will see me as a sucker and keep coming back for more and more. Do you see? Like what if he is just drug addicted? And just wants drugs? I don’t know how to proceed.

Also, thanks if you take your time to read/help. Some background, I'm a 14yr old girl, hazel eyes, red/pink hair, not too short not too tall, Puerto Rican (little tan), not flat but not too gifted in any part of my body.

So, I've been wanting to change a lot about myself, because it bothers me. I come from a family where having a bigger chest is common so I do plan on having a breast reduction, because rn i feel like they are already big (even though I don't even need to wear a bra) I'd like to have a bigger butt, but I still want it to be good enough for my bf. I once got hit with a basketball on my nose and have a little bump, so that's 1 major thing for me. People are always looking at my lips and sayin ""they are so full"" or ""do you have lip filler"" and I know it's a compliment and not everyone has that, but it makes me self-conscious. I changed my hair color to red/pink and I feel like it makes me look a little better. I've had a condition for about 5-6yrs now and I was once overweight, but now everyone calls me a twig, so I started working out like last yr and nothing rlly changed besides me losing more weight (enough to make me underweight) So I wanna gain some weight and it's just not happening. I really don't like how long my arms, legs, and neck are, because it makes me look unevenly proportioned. And another things is I was always told ""you'll grow into your feet"" and here I am getting told I'm done growing so now they are huge compared to how all the other people. And my hands are bigger than every guy that asks to put my hand against theirs. My bf says I'm perfect, but I want to show him that what he's always complaining about (on himself) isn't a big deal he can do what he wants with his body to make him happy and I'll do the same as it is my decision. I know it seems like a lot, but I really don't like looking in the mirror or even in the shower I prefer not to look at myself. So basically I want to change everything about myself and I don't know if I should. I just need help knowing if I should change anything and if so what is too much change?

451,"I (15) had a GF (17). I know that it may be kinda early for me to have a relationship, but please listen. 

At first, we had many happy memories. We even helped each other in our studies since we were both in the top in our class.  

Over time, I became busy with my extracurricular activities (academic contests), but I tried my best to give my time when I was on break. She said that it was okay, so there were times that she spent time with her circle of friends, majority of which are men.

During the pandemic, I became depressed and had multiple attempts. But I sucked it up, knowing thath I'll regret it when I did. I let her know that I was depressed, and that I am trying to find answers to my problem. 

Weeks later, we had a convo wherein  we were talking normally, and suddenly got angry at me. I didn't know why, so I asked her. She got positive for COVID. I prayed for her, knowing that my parents banned me on using laptops, so days went by without talking to her. Although I did my best to sneak out to talk to her, I always get caught.

2 months later, I was finally well again. I began to regain the energy I lost, and my pessimism is gone. I was going to prank her with a breakup (since she did the same a while back), but got the worst thing I could think of: she and my best friend had feelings for each other, and that they just started chatting each other.

I was devastated. I thought that she was okay with me not talking for her for a few weeks. She said it herself. But why did she do such a thing?

I let her go because she seemed happier with him. When I asked her why, she said that he was always there for her, compared to me, especially when she had COVID. So their feelings started developing. She was happier. Feelings cannot be easily removed. I did not want my best friend to be hurt. So I broke up with her, so that no one else but me gets hurt.

Up until now, she is on my mind. What did I do wrong? Should I just pretended that I wasn't depressed? Should I never got a girlfriend in the first place?

I couldn't even face her and him properly; I just keep a facade on everytime I chat with them. I pretend to be okay, but I'm not. The breakup made me pessimistic again, and made me have a ""lower"" idea of myself?

452,"I haven’t been doing so well recently mental health wise, and I feel like the last of one of my happiness sources has to disappear. You see, a few years ago I met this girl on roblox, who we will call T. A short time after that, I also met this guy on roblox who I also really hit it off with who we will call B. Now, this may sound like cringe, but we all like to rp(roleplay). Not in real life, but we just like making stories and characters with each other that I honestly hope to animate one day. We’ve all been doing this for years on roblox because we’re young and it provided us enough games and experiences to be happy with it. I introduced them to each other and we all have been a trio for awhile, they’re honestly the bestest friends I’ve ever had and I feel horrible for even having an issue. Basically, we moved to discord, where we found it was way easier to let our imaginations flow when writing stories and plot and furthering character development, as looking at a roblox morph standing stiffly while you type an action got a bit old. Upon relocating to discord we found we could talk to each other every day, and we do. Although, that’s when the problem started. I love both T and B, but with B, I like our conversations a lot more, he’s a pretty caring and sensitive dude and on top of that he’s really pleasant to speak with, a fresh perspective. With T, I feel like I’m talking more to a friend I could relate with and that I’m more similar to, but for some reason I just never got that much joy out of our conversations as opposed to the chats I had with B. I made a server exclusively for our trio, and we have stored our roleplays that still go on there in individual channels, along with channels for art and just a lot of stuff. Ever since we first moved to discord, I roleplayed with B a whole lot more, every day. Meanwhile with T our roleplays were always the three of us, never two, always three, and they weren’t as often. With the rp I created with B between just the two of us it feels like such a genuine and great thing to the point where I actually feel for our characters despite the fact that sounds a bit stupid, and I cherish them, I really want to animate them one day. With T, that feeling was nonexistent, I liked our characters sure but it never hit for me, rping with her always feels like more of a task. Even when me and T started roleplaying just the two of us it was just never great for me like the duo rp I have with B, it just wasn’t enjoyable. And so we kept it up, every day, me and B, occasionally all three of us on another roleplay or just me and T. After a year, we noticed T acting up a bit, and we eventually found out after she vented to us that she was jealous, jealous that me and B hung out so much and that she had to deal with everyone’s problems, she felt cast aside. And I’ll be honest, looking back, she was, she really was and I feel horrible for that. After that, me and B locked up our rp channel and focused on T more, T insisted me and B rp more together again and so eventually we did. After that, it was never the same, no rps every day, in fact there was only a small session or two in two weeks, not because we were holding ourselves back, it just wasn’t in our spirits anymore after that. But, somehow, our time with T still didn’t increase all that much, things just got rather depressing. Thing is, B asks me when he wants to rp, T just doesn’t unless she works up the courage. And I feel bad, because I’ve been selfish rping with B all the time while T wants to ask me to hang out with her. Again, things never went back to normal. Yesterday, T broke to me again that she was jealous of B, that he always got to hang out with me, and she confessed she always saw him as more of a rival than a friend.

455,"
I haven’t been doing so well recently mental health wise, and I feel like the last of one of my happiness sources has to disappear. You see, a few years ago I met this girl on roblox, who we will call T. A short time after that, I also met this guy on roblox who I also really hit it off with who we will call B. Now, this may sound like cringe, but we all like to rp(roleplay). Not in real life, but we just like making stories and characters with each other that I honestly hope to animate one day. 

We’ve all been doing this for years on roblox because we’re young and it provided us enough games and experiences to be happy with it. I introduced them to each other and we all have been a trio for awhile, they’re honestly the bestest friends I’ve ever had and I feel horrible for even having an issue. Basically, we moved to discord, where we found it was way easier to let our imaginations flow when writing stories and plot and furthering character development, as looking at a roblox morph standing stiffly while you type an action got a bit old. 

Upon relocating to discord we found we could talk to each other every day, and we do. Although, that’s when the problem started. I love both T and B, but with B, I like our conversations a lot more, he’s a pretty caring and sensitive dude and on top of that he’s really pleasant to speak with, a fresh perspective. With T, I feel like I’m talking more to a friend I could relate with and that I’m more similar to, but for some reason I just never got that much joy out of our conversations as opposed to the chats I had with B. I made a server exclusively for our trio, and we have stored our roleplays that still go on there in individual channels, along with channels for art and just a lot of stuff. 

Ever since we first moved to discord, I roleplayed with B a whole lot more, every day. Meanwhile with T our roleplays were always the three of us, never two, always three, and they weren’t as often. With the rp I created with B between just the two of us it feels like such a genuine and great thing to the point where I actually feel for our characters despite the fact that sounds a bit stupid, and I cherish them, I really want to animate them one day. With T, that feeling was nonexistent, I liked our characters sure but it never hit for me, rping with her always feels like more of a task. 

Even when me and T started roleplaying just the two of us it was just never great for me like the duo rp I have with B, it just wasn’t enjoyable. And so we kept it up, every day, me and B, occasionally all three of us on another roleplay or just me and T. After a year, we noticed T acting up a bit, and we eventually found out after she vented to us that she was jealous, jealous that me and B hung out so much and that she had to deal with everyone’s problems, she felt cast aside. 

And I’ll be honest, looking back, she was, she really was and I feel horrible for that. After that, me and B locked up our rp channel and focused on T more, T insisted me and B rp more together again and so eventually we did. After that, it was never the same, no rps every day, in fact there was only a small session or two in two weeks, not because we were holding ourselves back, it just wasn’t in our spirits anymore after that. But, somehow, our time with T still didn’t increase all that much, things just got rather depressing. Thing is, B asks me when he wants to rp, T just doesn’t unless she works up the courage. And I feel bad, because I’ve been selfish rping with B all the time while T wants to ask me to hang out with her. 

Again, things never went back to normal. Yesterday, T broke to me again that she was jealous of B, that he always got to hang out with me, and she confessed she always saw him as more of a rival than a friend. That shattered my perspective on our group, because I thought we were all really good friends who could go and support each other, I never knew she saw him as a rival. I just kind of thought we were all besties. I can’t blame her though, not at all, the mistakes I’ve made are immeasurable regarding this, I’m young and dumb but that’s no excuse. I haven’t told B any of what was said yesterday because I promised to T I would keep the conversation private. 

Now I have to let B down every time he asks to hang, and in turn ask T if she wants to do something every single day. Now I don’t have to do that, yet I have to at this point if that makes any sense. Over the past few months everything has been going horrible for me regarding some very personal things, but asking my dad for a therapist would be a death wish, so I look to interactions with my friends as the only thing in my life that makes me smile besides my cat. I’ve been clinging on to my interactions with B as they’ve given me so much happiness, but now I have to cut that off for something that makes me feel deflated in a way.

456,"We're both living in the same Uni halls, and it's just the two of us in this flat, I'm local (from the UK) and she's from the US. We've been living together since September now, and everytime we go for a food shop or order food in, I end up paying. At first I didn't mind because she was still figuring out how to get things working over here and her card wasn't accepted at the shop bc it's American and she promised to cover the cost next time we went for a shop (but her card wasn't working by then either). It really feels like she expects me to cover all the costs everytime we need something but I don't know if that's just me being paranoid because I essentially have to make my budget work for 2 people now. I feel so awkward talking about money but being a Uni student, it's not like i have lots of money to spare and this is beginning to make me nervous. If she really doesn't have any way to pay for her own stuff, I can't and won't just leave her hanging but I'd really like to set my foot down and say that she has to start paying for her own food, or at least pay back her half of the receipt when we go shopping and maybe cover our next takeaway.

457,"So i've been trying to move out for 2 weeks now, since everything was last minute, i barely had time to prepare (i had some time, but procrastinated a little since i misjudged the situation). I had to wait for my car that i bought, got the car for 1 day before the lockdown started again. So now all stores are closed in my area for about a month. I have to buy furniture (a bed, table, couch etc...) and electronics. I can't really do that atm, so i was wondering if i should take my chances and order my bed and table online (the couch can wait). I also have an option of driving to another country which doesn't take too much time, but since the furniture store is apparently still open over there, i figured i might go there to check out the bed in person, since i will be spending a decent amount of money on it. 

What do you guys think i should do here?

This girl invited me over her house to watch a scary movie weeks ago. “Heyyy you should come over sometime this spooky season and we should watch conjuring”. That was weeks ago and then she kept cancelling, having excuses, stuff kept coming up.

We still hungout and did something different and it was fun

463,"I’m in my mid-twenties, F and diagnosed with PCOS which is essentially a hormonal disorder with a bunch of factors but one result is infertility. While it’s not that I can’t ever get pregnant, my chances are super low. And I am not often sexually active and haven’t been in a long term relationship for years, so that makes my chances even lower. 

I had sex with someone for the first time in maybe 8 months, about 3 weeks ago, this cycle I experienced a ‘normal’ length of 30 days and had no pms like I usually do, and my period was much shorter than normal. I wasn’t ovulating or at least if it had been a normal cycle it wasn’t the right time for ovulation so I don’t think I’m pregnant, however, is it really bad that I fantasise that I could be? I know not to really get my hopes up since it’s not like I went and planned to have a baby anyway, I feel like it’s just because I know I will have trouble ever having kids, that I like to pretend I could be pregnant. 

This happens every time I have sex, regardless of who it is or the circumstances, I will spend hours analysing the chances that I could be and daydreaming about a little baby growing inside of me. It’s particularly awful since I recently decided to ‘let go’ of my goal to have a family - biologically at least. I decided to focus on my self and hope one day to foster or maybe even adopt.

I don’t go out looking for sex or even to date very often, as it isn’t something super important to me and if I ever do want to date someone I’d like to have fallen in love and not just like them. The problem now is I definitely have feelings for this guy from 3 weeks ago, and that makes this whole possibly pregnant thing worse as I feel connected to him when I shouldn’t. I know at the end of the month I’m just going to get disappointed that I’m not pregnant, so what is the point in indulging myself in the fantasy that I could be? Yet I find such comfort in it, it makes me feel a little less lonely, if that makes any sense...",04Nov2020,1

Two weeks ago I met a girl through a mutual interest. We’ve been spending nearly every day together and hit it off extremely well. We like all the same shit and it’s always a fun time together. We’ve communicated that we’re definitely interested in being exclusive moving forward. 

However I am nervous because she just turned 21 and I’m 24. I am well aware how much personal change can happen in those years and I’m afraid of getting hurt more or less. I’m in a place where I don’t wanna fuck around with a bunch of people anymore. I do want a stable relationship. 

My concern is that she’s just gonna get bored at some point and move on to the next best thing. Or for whatever reason she’s gonna drop my ass. It isn’t an insecurity regarding myself; just thinking that she’s young and shit changes so fast. 

I don’t know how to proceed or if I should at all. All I know is that I like her and I’m definitely catching heavy feelings. I think she has those feelings to but who knows how long they’ll last?",04Nov2020,1

Seems suoscius that suddenly after that they go really hard to make me feel nervous with the word indicator of violent and rapist(word with some feeling) followed with sudden nervousness and i lied feel. Match with the outlook and sensations basically trying to bundle that up and set me up.

basically bullied quite a bit from the horse thing. Same with the horse thing being in my line of sight. The emotions that occur like right now is generated by them neither shire nor natural 

they would also make it seem like im having fun and have something on mind(ai thing with a face like shiro,goku, the one with some Halloween themed thing usually followed up with feelings and it being on the back of my mind as a result of the industry(usually feel near head. like for the goku thing or the other one id get something and it would appear as as im suddenly happy the goku feel popped up. atomic ton of the reactions emotions and my perception has been changed and or plugged in in a sense that makes things appear very diffrent.

472,"Hello,
My friend has gone out with this dude like 5 years ago. She dumped him then. Then, two years ago, she met up with him and they went out for 2 years.
In these two years, he refused to let her talk about their problems with anyone. She even got a ‘procedure’ done because he wanted it to be done. She didn’t want it done. He told her he cheats on every single girl he has ever been with (according to him 50+ girls), except her. He stopped calling her after a while, no ‘I love you’ texts, nothing except when he felt like getting booty.
She went over to his house at 3 am and saw his car wasn’t there. When she asked where he was, he was with his other “friend” (who also got the procedure he suggested because they were just “friends with benefits “) getting advice on the relationship. [she chose to believe that]. 
He took a week to decide he didn’t want my friend. Eventually breaking it off. She didn’t get to decide, it had to be his decision.

I guess he called her up again a couple of months ago, more than 2, and used my friend for more booty. My friend thought they were gonna work things out somehow. She is really desperate and really thought he was the one. 

She recently suspected that he was talking to other women because she “knows him and knows how he is” so she asked. He said that he is talking to six other girls, but that he could drop four for just her and another girl. How it was great and wants to make the other girl his girlfriend (only known her for 2 months) and that my friend would be the “affair”. How he loves my friend and would not give her up, nor would he give the other girl up. He loves them equally. That this is a great opportunity for him to do something he really wants. My friend has no choice and needs to agree.

My friend told me that she was so hurt but loved that he was being open and honest with her. I tried to get her to understand that she had “caught him” but she overlooks that detail. 

My friend asked him to choose, he can’t pick both. He told her, that he will be in a relationship with this girl and have my friend’s booty and that’s final. That even if he is married, if he calls up my friend, she needs to drop everything so he can have her butt. 

She is actually hurt that it’s not her that is the wife!  She wants to be the wife that gets cheated on.

She wants revenge though, and wants to tell this girl, but seeing as the dude isn’t even with her, she plans on being with him and doing this for a few months!

While talking yesterday, he said that if she says anything, he will report her to the government (because she works for the county) and that he will frame her family and call the police on them. 

So now, she is scared. She wants to warn the girl, but she doesn’t want him to know it was her because she is scared of what he would do. He then told her that this is what they are doing and that’s that. But the only reason she is the side chick is because he loves her too much and can’t bare being without her.

Yesterday, she told me that she still had hope that he would change. There is so much that he has said and done that screams ABUSE and she excuses him. 

I don’t know what to do. She won’t listen to me. I want to tell her sister but I erased her phone number when my friend and I lost touch a while ago (when she started seeing him the first time).

My friend means a lot to me. I’ve known her for half my life and she was there for me in my darkest days. I just don’t know what to do... I know where he lives and what he drives. But... when plotting revenge, you dig two graves. I asked her to just ghost him but she jumps from love/hope to hate/revenge. She does not want to just leave...

Some background: I work at a PT clinic and am a pt tech there so I see/“meet” a lot of people everyday so HIPAA might be an issue :-)))).

And I technically violated hipaa and don’t wanna lose my job bc I love it :0) 

Keep in mind I don’t know the patient outside of work. So it’s probably creepy that I found their social media, messaged them, and WAS DRUNK bc I don’t know them like that. 

At work they’re super cool, we have similar interests, recommend things, etc., (I suppose all the normal small talk shit), and I’d definitely want to be their friend if it weren’t for them being a current patient. We are about the same age and I am just freaking out bc they happened to call in sick and cancel their appointments this week so of course I freak out.

Yesterday was my final straw. While making small talk with a coworker, my supervisor walks up, shewing me with her paperwork and tells me to “go find something to work on!” then she proceed to strike up her own conversation with my coworker. I tried letting it go but I simply can’t. I’ve dealt with this behavior the entirety of my employment here.

The double standards here are insane. I’ll watch the same group of people chat endlessly and never be reprimanded. Granted I’m not around to see anyone else be reprimanded, but the fact that people continue to congregate and talk, doesn’t convince me that anything is being enforced.

If help is needed within the office, I’m the first to volunteer my assistance and often times, I’m the first to be asked to help as mgmt knows I’m always willing to pitch in. Not to mention, my work is never behind and I like to never ask for help. 

I get the feeling that I’m trusted and dependable enough to help but not trusted or dependable enough to not be watched constantly. The most baffling thing is that my supervisor will keep me at her desk forever to shoot the shit, and THAT’S acceptable!

I want to know how to handle this situation but I naturally keep myself from pursuing an answer because I fear that because I’m so passive that any mention of workplace “bullying” will be chalked up to me just “being emotional”.

What should I do? How can I keep myself calm? M i overthinking this? 


(the reason why we left each other) 

He would make racist jokes about me and I told him that I didn't like that and he kept on going. He always insulted me in front of others and at first I tolerated it, but got fed up and started insulting him with his mother and he told me to stop and I told him I  would if he stopped insulting me in front of others and stopped making racist jokes about me. Btw I call these jokes, but in reality they were insults. Like: oh no watch out he might blow up if we go near him -or- go back to your own country if you dislike things here...etc.",04Nov2020,1

And I told her about opportunity and she was quite furious and negative because it's too far away, etc.

I have worked at this company for roughly 1.5 years now. My current wage is 12 euro/hour. The last raise I got was in july last year. After my request for a raise being declined this July (due to the current pandemic). I have asked what I should do in order to get one, but haven't gotten any clear expectations. (I definitely have improved a lot since July, and they also rely on me a lot more now.) Any work I don't do, they will have to ask devs from an IT company (which are more experienced than me, are less available and also cost way more).  


I really like my job and this Company, but I feel like I am worth more. Especially considering I'll have my bachelors degree in computer science this June. I was getting paid roughly the same wage when I was working in a restaurant kitchen, which required no education or prior knowledge.

482,"(This is about the US presidential election, but you don’t need to be intimately familiar with US politics to answer this question)

My boyfriend has never been politically inclined, and up until the day we early-voted, he was undecided. It genuinely blows my mind how little he was paying attention prior to the past month, but he’s in a situation where the presidency won’t really affect his life much.

I’m not exactly a single-issue voter, but there’s a particular issue that is a lot more important to me than other issues, and so far, the incumbent has severely fucked up in that particular category. This issue does affect me and millions of other people across the country. Also, I live in a major swing state that hasn’t been called yet, so tensions are very high here.

My boyfriend didn’t say who he voted for, and I specifically told him not to tell me, mostly because I didn’t know if I could handle knowing if he voted for someone who is actively trying to destroy my livelihood.

Last night, I explained to him why the election was so personal to me. I explained the politics and practice behind my key issue. A few hours later, when he said good night, he said, “I wasn’t sure about my vote, but I learned some things today that made me more confident I chose the right guy.” I don’t know if the things I told him are what he was referencing.

483,"Hi  I live in the UK and my housemates and I all work in the healthcare sector, so we are all coming in to contact with Covid+ve patients on the regular.

UK are now entering a 4 week lockdown BUT my housemates are all saying that they are planning on visiting their significant others or having them stay at ours on their days off or go and visit family for a few days and then returning home. 

I know I can't control what people do, and I am fortunate to have a zero hour contract and so was planning on working until December, self isolation for 2 weeks before going home for christmas and new year, limiting the risk of spreading the virus, if lockdown has ceased by then. 

I've discussed my concerns with my housemates and have said to them, healthcare worker or not, they should be more aware of the risks and considerate of the rules/regulations etc. 

Their argument is we all wear PPE at work and shower, and have as much risk going to Asda etc and contracting the virus and then bringing it home, but I do not feel comfortable having people I don't really know that well in my house (when it's literally against the law), nor am I comfortable with my housemates leaving the house for a few nights to visit friends/family/partners and then returning to our shared home, when they know it's not allowed.

Idk if I am just overreacting or what, but would really appreciate advice on where I stand with this situation. I know I can't control them but I am really unhappy with the situation.

F(29) I have a friend who I have known since I was 8, she has taken 6 years to get her bachelors degree and constantly gives up and complains, she always has problems with men and is constantly suffering over people who are not right or good for her. I am the therapist in the relationship, or so it feels like it. She always hits me up and asks for advice and sends 5 page essays asking for help. Ive been happy to oblige but she hasn't done anything to make her life better, she wont listen. She has no full time job... no career prospects. She plans to build a house on her parent's property but that won't ever happen. That's her current goal that I know of. Speaking of which she can't accomplish ANY goals! I feel sorry for judging her. Which is why I should maybe back off. None of my advice has been taken seriously. I have another friend who lost her mother a couple years ago and is struggling, she is deeply obsessed with her ex and sends me emotionally charged texts all day. She keeps saying shes gonna burst or shes shaking with emotion over sending him texts about how she feels and I feel like a therapist who is there to talk her through these things.

488,"How do I forgive my parents?

 Background ( im sorry that it is long) I am an immigrant from Russia, I have been here since 2013. Abuse there is normal, towards children, and woman. So it isn't that looked down back home. 

I first saw my dad kicking my mom while she lays on the bedroom floor when i was 7/8, and i used to blame my grandma for not being there, and stopping it, because that night she left to spend a night with her best friend, and whenever she is home, he refrains from hitting my mom ( well, that was before)

My first memory of my dad abusing me, was when we moved to America, i was 10 years old. I had a burst of anger, and said i couldn't do my multiplication table. He took me into a bedroom, took out a belt and kept hitting me with it until i got tired. My grandma tried to stop him, but he is 5'11, and there is little she can do. My leg had began to bleed because the metal buckle continued to scratch my leg and back as he kept hitting me, and i couldn't lay down because the pain was so strong. My mom took pictures of it, but it has long since been deleted. 

He would continue to hit me since that, I have a few vivid memories of what extent he hit me to. Most days its him dragging me by my hair, throwing utensils, food, anything that is near him towards me at full force, taking me somewhere by my neck, and he always hits me on my head. One morning, on a vacation, i decided to wear a jacket ( during the hot summer) it had made him angry, and the more i said that i was not going to change, he continued to strike me on the side of my head, and the back of my head. I had began to get headaches, my speech is less eloquent, and i forget things easily. I dont know if that is directly due to the head beatings, but it would makes sense. 

When he can't hit me, he will verbally abuse me. Calls me names in russian that might not make sense to be called in english ( lamb, pig, cow, different variation of a whore, stupid, retarded etc. ) He doesn't even call me by my name anymore, just those names. 

The abuse eventually led me to self harming, it started in 3rd grade, after each hitting, beating, name calling, i would go into my room, and punch my head to punish myself, i would pull out my own hair, pinch myself whenever he talked to me, and hit myself on desks/ tables. I learned what cutting was in 5th grade, and i turned to that. My parents found out after searching my whole phone. She threatened to have me arrested. I got reported to the counselor in 8th grade, because my friend saw them, but i told my mom they were old ( they were from that morning) Last day of 8th grade, i decided i will report it myself, and get help for me, and my dad. I wanted to do it, no matter what consequence because i was scared that during the summer, the more i am home, the more he can hit me, and my mom. I was scared it would end up in me killing myself. The intervention didn't work. And social services left after coming 3 times, 3 different caseworkers.

I can remember a justified beating it had occured 2 years ago, when i was 14. My parents always took my phone, for a bad grade on assignment, they would take it for 2 months, if i missed the bus it was taken for 4-5 month. So my only way to keep up with my friends was to ask my friend for his old phone. I kept it a secret until my parents found it. They always check my phone, go through each app, messages, photos, just to find something. i got tired of it and i wouldn't give up the password, so they took a belt and kept hitting my arms, back, legs, and butt, until the inside of my skin bled ( i think that is what it was, it had large lumps of hard liquid which i assumed was dried blood inside my skin)  i cry whenever i hear in my head my mom telling my dad to keep going while he was hitting me with the belt because i wouldn't give up the password. I blame myself for that beating because i was so stubborn to stand up and say no to my parents. 

It is really hard for me to show love to my parents without remembering what they've done to me, especially my mom, she always says she protects me, but sometimes she partook in the abuse. One night two weeks ago i talked back to my mom while a friend was over i said "" so?"" she didnt like that and when i got home the next day, after a sleepover. She yelled at me for not doing the dishes, and the anger shifted to the way i talked back to my mom, she hit me, put me on the floor and kept pulling my hair and scratching me. She picked me up by my hair, and kept slamming my head onto the sink, which caused light bleeding , but nothing major. But it was the emotional pain that hurt the most. My little sibling and i had made a plan ( a childish one) i would slit my wrists open, so my mom would choose to get help, i didn't care if i died, i just didn't want my brother to go through same things i went  through once he gets older. I had practiced how to do it deep enough to cause actual damage, but they hid all the blades, and i had several blunt ones. I had given up, and my parents found out.

I thought telling them was a good thing, and they would get me help. Instead it all went downhill. They set up a camera to watch me in the living room, and i couldnt leave the room or they threatened to beat me. They make me sleep on a mattress on the floor in their bedroom now, bedtime is now 10, and the whole time they spoke to me they guilt tripped me saying i was just doing it for attention, that i dont know pain, and she made me get the blade i did it with, and said if i dont cut her she will do it herself, and she will tell people i did it, which i thought was insane, so instead when i stood my ground and said no, so then she gave it to me, and told me to slit my wrists in front of her, it was one of her tests ( she had given me a knife before and told me to kill myself because i told her i wanted to die when i was 13) So i told them i dont feel normal, my emotions change fast, i had told them ive been stealing things from people since i was 10 i just can't help it, and had began to do it in stores. I wanted help, and they denied it and said if i cut myself again they would kick me ou. i dont even believe i am real, my mom would constantly drill into my head that i was a nobody, that i am nothing without her, that if she put me out there on the streets, no one would know who i am because i am nothing without her, and she got me here. After they take me shopping, and buy me things, and when the same problems occur, they use it against me, and i keep falling for their tricks

This is already getting too long, but please help me on how to forgive them for everything. I have a year and a half left, but the issues they've caused will make me a non functional adult, and that terrifies me, i dont know how to drive, never had a job, dont have a permit or license, and it is hard for me to speak to people. i only know how to cook, and clean, but i can't even get myself to hate them, but i still cry knowing how unstable i am in my friendships, relationships, i cant even trust people, and believe everyone is against me.

489,"Given everything that’s happening in the world I thought I’d share my list of easy to use and easy to access mental health resources. Please feel free to add others you find particularly useful.

This isn’t a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it’s relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I’ve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There’s so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I’ve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I’ve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I’m a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn’t your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn’t include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/)

\- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you’re at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/)

\- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581)

\- Helps you express emotions through music. It’s like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/)

\- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/)

\- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What’s Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160)

\- This is a good one stop shop if you’re looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

[Mind Shift](https://www.anxietycanada.com/resources/mindshift-cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy%20/)

\- Free app based on cognitive behavioural therapy with user friendly design. Aimed at people looking to reduce symptoms of anxiety.",04Nov2020,1

495,My mother is in her 60s and in relatively good health (maybe a little overweight but has no trouble getting up and down stairs or off the couch or anything) but she always talks about how she wants to lose weight. I am not necessarily concerned with her weight being a problem but I'm worried that she wants to do something about it but isnt. She has joined gyms and bought excercise equipment but it doesnt last long and I think that's just not a good choice of workout for her. She says she enjoys going on hikes so I try to go out on walks with her but I dont think walking once a week will be enough to keep her in good shape as she gets older and winter is right around the corner so we are going to get stuck indoors anyways. I guess my question is how do I help my mom stay active and make it a habit before she gets too old and it's too late. I want to make it clear she is not asking for my help and If she wants to die fat and happy then I dont blame her but I genuinely thinks she wants to live a long healthy life but is just stuck in a routine.

496,"So I (m30) have had a life of random pain, mostly due to the medical conditions I was born with. but also due to the people in my life that just cannot accept that I have something they cannot comprehend. 

I have had migraine (with aura) and photophobia (extreme light sensitivity) since I was born,

 I had at least 3-6 migraines a week whilst in primary school (K-6) and maybe a bit less during my high school years(7-12). No one ever knew how bad I was suffering (my parents just told me to deal with it)

Once I turned 18 I went to a ""headache"" specialist and all he said was that ""migraines are just bad headaches"". which to anyone who has migraine would know is not the case.

I have since been to multiple neurologist and have had very little luck at finding any answers. 

However the problem remains, 

I cannot keep a job no matter how hard I try, as soon as I get a migraine I am completely broken, I can barely stand let alone communicate properly. and so I lose my job. 

I have to wear sunglasses at all times (when the sun is out) and I have a lot of trouble dealing with glare. 

I am at my wits end, I am not longer sure what I can do to secure a future for myself.

any advice would be greatly appreciated, and anyone who has frequent migraine and are able to hold a job I would love your advice the most. thank you.",04Nov2020,1
497,"So, for the longest time I was thinking about adopting a cat because I've always wanted a cat and I thought it would help with how lonely I've been feeling in college. I went back to my hometown during the Spring semester because of the whole pandemic and also because I was severely depressed and off medication. Now for Fall I came back to my apartment off-campus and I figured it would be a good time to get a cat. It was mostly because I was taking online classes, I was home alone all day, and I would basically just do classwork until my boyfriend got off work. I have absolutely no friends here and the only person that I interact with is my boyfriend. Seeing that I was extremely lonely, I decided to get a cat, because I knew I would have the time to take care of it.

However, I recently accepted a new job at a fast food place and when my parents found out they were livid. They're very controlling and I guess I had forgotten they were the reason I decided to come back to my lonely college apartment again. I made the mistake of ranting to them about my first day at work and how I had a really rude customer. I accidentally messed up his order and he became very agitated and threw his sweet tea at my face. After telling them this, they were like they should have called the cops blah blah blah. And I'm like over a sweet tea?? They're incredibly racist and they keep insisting that the only reason the cops weren't called was because everyone that works there is black and that they screwed up and should have defended me. It obviously has nothing to do with race, but somehow that's the issue here. Anyway, they contacted my manager and went off on her for not defending me against some customer who was clearly just troubled (which was incredibly embarrassing at my big age of 19). Like yeah it was annoying but I'm not gonna have them call the cops because some idiot threw sweet tea at me. They tried to get me fired and said that they would give me 2000 in cash if I quit and never went back. They're only offering me the money because they want to control me, not because they actually care about how I'm doing financially.

So I decided to finally stand up to them and not accept their money. I need this job and I know I won't be able to pay rent otherwise. However, because of the new job I've been spending less time at home. My kitten has become agitated and more aggressive because of this. I don't have anybody to keep her company while I'm busy at work. I also have to move because I can't afford where I live now. My parents cut me off entirely and blocked me everywhere. I can't even get in contact with them anymore. And they had originally agreed to help me with the kitten. Now that is no longer a possibility and it makes me so sad because I've really bonded with my kitten. I really don't want to give her away, but realistically I'm not in a position where I can take care of her like before. I don't know if I should return her to the shelter (she'd get adopted so fast bc she's young and very cute/affectionate still) or if i should try and find her a home myself. I'm just really overwhelmed and I feel extremely guilty. I feel like I'm abandoning her. 

TL;DR: My parents cut me off and blocked me. I can't afford to keep my kitten and I'm not entirely sure how to go about rehoming her.",04Nov2020,1

Ok some background- I'm a 14yr old girl, have anxiety, depression, I'm not too much of a people person, sometimes suicidal, and anything else you wanna know just ask.

He also knows I'm here for anything he needs. I came to visit him and I'm with him now, but if anything happens to me or anyone else he says he's bad luck and it's his fault.

So pretty much I’m not much of a confrontational person
And I’ve been depressed for around 2 years now
So one of my friends called me about a week ago we’ll call him joe
So joe said something that I thought about after and didn’t think of anything in the moment
He said that he was talking to my other friend
We’ll call him bob
Said that I was seeking sympathy going around talking about my problems with people
in The moment I said I guess idk
Later I thought about it and it wasn’t the case
I was not going around telling people my problems so they feel bad for me
So I thought about confronting me friend bob about it
He’s bigger than me and can forsure beat my ass
But I ended up confronting him about saying that he was talking behind my back assuming that I was doing that when I wasn’t
He said that he didn’t think of anything of it and it was in the moment when they talked and that’s what I looked like in their eyes and other peoples
He understood that I wasn’t doing that but I just looked like that
Things did get heated in the call
And both of my friends were in the call
So the convo ended
After I thought I should ask bob to apologize so I called him and he did
And I called joe after and he didn’t apologize and said that I’m taking it way too seriously
Joe then after called bob and told him that I asked him to apologize aswell
Bob called me and just started calling me a bitch and stuff for asking joe to apologize.. I didn’t say anything back because I was questioning whether I was taking the situation too serious
I thought about it and am I tripping and taking the issue way too seriously?",04Nov2020,1

This was because one of his 2 kids turned out to be from an affair she had and isn't legally his so cant be on his health insurance unless they were married. The hadn't been living together and were considering themselves separated for several years prior to me and him meeting. They keep a friendly type communication because he is very involved with the kids. 

After me and him dated for about 10 months he told her they needed to get divorced (i didn't tell him to, i had nothing to do with it) and she said ok. That will be wrapping up over the next several months. Shortly after he found out it was close to wrapping up he asked me to move in with him after my lease is done and i said ok. She has never been rude to me, and he isnt at all secretive about calls and texts from her. Like he will sit next to me and talk to her on speakerphone. 

Last night i noticed he was looking at his phone and smiling. Kinda how you would if you were talking to someone you like. He said that she texted him a shopping list for the kids. (Normal. He buys them groceries every other week). I asked why he was smiling so much and he said he asked if she voted and sent the meme about the dog saying i farted and she sent a funny voting meme back. He didnt text me or send any memes all day but he knew he was gonna see me at night. I didnt say anything but i got a bad gut feeling. I know they need to keep rhings friendly for the kids but something about the way he was looking at his phone and smiling gave me a bad gut feeling. Am i over reacting?

516,"Long story short, my bf and I (F 21) broke up a few months ago but we are still best friends. We still have feelings for each other but it just didn't work out. He recently got a new girlfriend (they started talking quite soon after the breakup, they went from fwb to a relationship) and I can't really handle that. 

So yeah, why meet her when you can't handle it? The thing is, he is my only good friend (like a friend you can hang out one-on-one with) so I'm either alone or with him. He takes time to invite me when she isn't there but that is only on weekdays so I'm missing out on a lot of fun evenings. 

I don't really want to meet her but I can't avoid her for ever either. I'm just very afraid that due to my low self esteem and lonlyness (and therefore jealousy) I wont stop comparing myself to her and that I'll get sad with any form of their interaction. Which will then not only ruin my evening, but also theirs. 

- A bit more info about the relationship between me and my ex: When we are alone we still cuddle and he kisses me on the forehead, sort of like a big brother. He is polyamorous (that is why it didn't work out between us, my self esteem can't handle a second woman) and his new relationship is open for as far as I know. So I am not making him cheat in any way. I just think it complicates things a bit more because that makes it hard to fully let go, but sometimes my depressed ass just needs a good hug.

So TL:DR: I can't avoid my ex's new gf forever so how do I meet her without emotions getting in the way?

521,"I’m a student in England but I’m from the Isle of Man. Currently, because of COVID, the Isle of Man has a mandatory isolation period of 2 weeks for any returning residents. This means that I’d have to arrive home by the 11th of December in order to spend Christmas with my family. 

The Isle of Man student loans system is different to the English one, you get a lot less but you have to pay back less of it. I come from a single parent household and get about £5,700 per year, which is about £1,900 per semester. My rent each semester costs about £1,400, leaving me with around £500 per semester to live off. It’s impossible. I did have a job in a hotel but they have closed down due to COVID so I can’t even claim furlough. 

My only solution to this is to get another job, I’ve had a call back from one who have said I’m a likely candidate, and it’s also relevant to my degree so it’s basically paid experience. I’m worried that when they find out I have to be home for at least 2 weeks over Christmas they won’t hire me. I’ve been out of money for a few weeks now and I’m so stressed. I have medication I can’t afford, a phone contract I can’t pay and I’m relying on my housemates and boyfriend to buy me necessities, which means I’ll have the same situation next semester as I’ll have to pay them back and will be left with no money again. 

I asked the Isle of Man government whether I’d be able to get a COVID test on returning to the island and reduce the isolation period and their answer was no. They have offered no additional support to students who rely on jobs to fund their living expenses when their parents can’t afford to send them money. 

I am unable to claim any kind of English benefits as I’m not from here, I’m also unable to claim any Isle of Man benefits as I’m not currently on the island. 

I am so stressed right now, if you can think of any way I’d be able to help this situation I’d be so grateful.",04Nov2020,1

Even though it hasn’t been an insanely long time, I love her with all my heart and we do practically everything together. 
It’s young love, we’re both halfway through high school, and we go to different neighboring towns. 
Basically, her family is extremely pro trump, and her father is a cop. He’s nearing retirement within the next few years anyways, and the way he sees it, if Biden wins he’s probably going to retire early. I don’t really know why, but that’s what’s apparently going to happen.
When he retires, they plan to move to South Carolina. We live in New York. I personally support Biden, even tho I can’t vote. 
Now this is where I’m at a crossroads. I think if Trump wins our country is gonna be more messed up than it is. If Biden wins, I think the country will be better, but my girlfriend will most likely be moving. 
This might be super petty and I’m making a bigger deal than it is, but i don’t know how to deal with that if it happens.

528,"TL;DR Children Between Ages 6 to 18 go to same-sex schools where the opposite gender is demonized, this has major effects in the realm of 'choosing' an orientation later on in life as young adults.

I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I will post it anyway, if you see it doesn't belong here, please take a moment of your time to direct me to the right location for posting this!

I am in no way, against the fact that people are free to choose their own sexual orientation in a world that is free for all of us humans! The story I am about to tell you however touches the matter of when things are imposed on people, perhaps against their own will, or in this case, without their own knowledge!

I am a young man who was born in Iran in 1998 (Makes me 23 years old as of writing this post). This post, is about an experience I had throughout my life, one I'm hoping would get some attention as to who it was who decided to take the actions that were taken in the story I'm about to tell you!

I went to primary school at age 6 (like most children do), it was a cool place, lots of fun memories, the only problem though, is that I don't remember seeing any girls there! But hey, what does a dumb 6 year old know, right? Fast forward 1 year, the world was bigger, I was in Elementary School, same situation, many classes, many students, all boys, no girls...

I guess you get the point I'm trying to make right? The schools here are Uni-Gender(Teachers and Staff Included), And Now I look in the society around me and see many uni-Gender groups of people all around me. Now I do know that there could be millions of factors involved, but as a Mind I cannot see what I see and deny the possibility of a connection!",04Nov2020,1

Hello I’m in desperate need of some help and advice. I’m having a huge work issue, I’m a manager at a retail company, I thought a month ago we got an email to our store from our LP/district manager saying that among a few other stores we had a deposit that was on accounted for and we need to go get the receipt from the bank and just send it to them to confirm everything. I was not in the store for four days during that time so my assistant manager volunteer to go get the slip and slide in the message to the DM as she said it was a day that she had worked. Thoughtlessly I never think about it again, I definitely should’ve followed up but I didn’t. Fast forward to Monday of this week two months after the deposit day in question we get another email asking for us to verify that deposit so I take a look at our deposit log and I see that it was actually a day that I closed. I believe my assistant manager got confused and sent her the wrong day. After looking at the sheet I cannot possibly fathom what had gone missing with this one random deposit two months prior and I started freaking out. I tend to have really high anxiety and a worst-case scenario thought process so I immediately started freaking out and thinking that my company would think that I was meeting stealing from them or something along the lines even though the deposit was only $24 and we have deposits on some nights as high as $300 $400 $500, it wouldn’t make sense. 

I rip apart my entire house and store thinking that maybe it was in a bag that I had used for shopping because I often bring home multiple bags from work, I cannot find it anywhere. There’s no trace of it ANYWHERE. 

So I decided to *STUPIDLY* just deposit the $24 now with my own money because there’s no way in my mind that I say I lost the deposit and they genuinely believe me.  

I made up this little story about how the shoot was locked and I had to bring it back to the store and I just miss filed it for two months and I’m just finding it now. The only problem is that my stupid self didn’t realize that the bag would have a different number than he originally logged number. So they have now found this L and I have a meeting with my district manager and my LP team tomorrow to discuss the events. What’s going to happen? What should I do? I really never done anything like this before I really don’t want to lose my job I don’t know what I possibly could do to prove my case because I know that I’ve lost a lot of respect and trust.

Tl:dr there is a missing deposit at my work I decided to just put my own money and deposit it as if it were the missing one. I’ve been caught what do I do?",04Nov2020,1
534,"I'm in my early twenties and due to some personal reasons I live with my mom and my sibling. Well, not so long ago I finally understood in what a crappy place I am right now. 

My mother as a child has been abused and wasn't in a good place until her early thirties. She never overcame her traumas which affected her later in life. Being a single parent, she did a great job. She gave us everything we needed, loved and cared for us, I truly did have a very nice childhood. 

I don't know what changed later, but few months ago I started realizing that she might be abusing to me and I have no idea what to do. She is overprotective of us and we have a curfew, no staying later than 7 p.m, she flipped out when she discovered I'm dating someone and not planning on marrying him anytime soon. I don't want to tell anything about my love life since I know she'll be worried, say he's using me and will just get into my head. Well, if I can escape that by moving out which is happening soon if restrictions are lifted, I cannot escape what's happening now.

She prefers my other sibling to me. I just realized how many times she has put the blame on me and idolized my sibling even though I didn't do anything wrong. How much she picks up a fight with me, starts saying hurtful things and makes me feel very small. And she gets annoyed by the way I talk, how much I talk, how I walk, cook, you name it. And she has never said anything like that to my other sibling. Never ever. 

I was always convinced it was like that because she got along better with her other child, that it's simply because I'm not as calm and easy going as my sibling. Well. Maybe that's the reason too. 

But later the favoritism got way more visible. I haven't spoken to her for a long time because we had a stupid fight and now even though I miss her, I don't know how to phrase my thoughts. She's a good mom, we have great conversations, she supports me on my studies and such, but I am deeply hurt that she has less love for me. 

Even when I tried to talk calmly to her, she thinks I'm blaming her, feels attacked and we have another fight. How can I handle it better? I don't want to lose her but I can't live like that anymore, I have to talk to her but don't know what and how to say it without causing another fight.

Hey  all. Over the last couple days, I've been reflecting on my gaming  habits to try and determine how I want to continue my hobby in a more  ethical means. Initially I was skeptical about continuing my support of  GOG due to CDPR's treatment of their employees in the face of  Cyberpunk's release, as well as the crude response towards the  developers by the fans. However, after some insights I understand that  the two entities have very different practices and don't feel as bad  about supporting GOG, especially as a supporter of DRM free gaming.

Putting  that into account, I'm wondering about the ethics on continuing my  habit of console gaming, namely Playstation 4 and possibly PS5 down the  road, or if I should fully opt over to PC gaming. I consider myself a  casual gamer, and usually put my work before any leisure time, so I was  initially trying to understand more and more which platform would be  more suitable to those needs, especially since I have a large digital  and physical catalogue in both platforms as it is. However, given the  new outlook that I've been taking on the ethical treatment of certain  game developers and their employees, I've been thinking about which  platform would be more worth my support in that respect. If anyone might  have any insights to this, I would certainly appreciate it.",04Nov2020,1

538,"My mom is sometimes someone sweet, but she has serious anger problems, and most of the times she is very toxic. She has a complex of authority, as well as my father but my father doesn’t like conflicts at all and he takes it more chill, unlike my mom which seems to live by it. She refuses to be ever wrong, literally, I have no memory of her ever admitted to be wrong, but lots of times when she is, she either shames me or says I don’t know what I’m saying or laughs and lies cuz I have no proof.

She acts like she was always perfect, doesn’t seem to sympathize with emotional struggles from teenagers saying “at your age I never bitched about that” and as expected, my opinion is irrelevant and I’m punished for even saying something. She doesn’t take my feelings or opinion into consideration, is like she doesn’t see us as people, but toys she can sometimes tell what to do. She says I can’t stress out for college cuz that’s my only problem on this age, when as a teenager, sometimes your biggest problem is yourself cuz it is a tough phase. She even debated a woman who was making me a haircut at the salon. My mom said “how can teenagers stress right? As she laughed, making fun of me and the other woman was a mother of 5 and clearly she knew more and told her “yeah they do ma’am” We haven’t gone to the same salon since then. 

One thing that I really hate is that she thinks depression is just a sort of hoax or tantrum exclusive of teenagers and is something like being sad and can be fixed by just not thinking about it. She says people older than 18 ISNT and CANT be depressed and says I’m weak if I am. Always addresses a celebrity or a successful cousin saying “they aren’t depressed”. My older step sister has been diagnosed with a very heavy depression years ago, she still lives with us and I don’t mind, despite that, she is still a very kind sister but my mom instead of worrying for her, said she won’t believe it and constantly makes fun of her and when I told her I don’t feel happy with how the life of our family is going and I feel depressed she got mad and called my phone saying “oh now my son is depressed too and I gotta deal with it?!?!”. She is very manipulative, she is selfish, she compares me to my friends or fake ass ideas she has in her mind of how teenagers are, maybe from so much tv she watches or how much separated she is form reality. She thinks conversations equals fighting, she knows how to hurt you emotionally and you can’t even joke cuz she doesn’t allow “rebel behavior”. Even my father knows she is toxic, my siblings like to pull the middle finger on her when she turns around, life here isn’t happy and has never been for years. I only like to be with my old step sister cuz she has been more understanding, better, more caring and overall more of a mother figure than my actual mother. She supports what I want and like, she encourages me all the time, we always do things together, she understands when as a teenager I want a little bit of privacy or I’m not doing good. She does all of that and she herself is also very strong to stand all she has faced and keep going. Everything isn’t as bad with her until my mother comes and starts to yell or feel self entitled, which is a lot cuz she is in the house most of the time

ANYWAYS. i would never date/marry him i just couldn't i would kill him but i also can't see him with anyone else and the thought of him being with someone else irritates me even though it shouldn't. neither of us have really had serious significant others EVER because we have just leaned on each other and avoided the heartbreak. we are both virgins other than messing around a little bit in high school. (not with each other). one night after we graduated we got really drunk and i gave him head and we NEVER. brought it up to each other ever again but it never made anything weird at all. fast forward a year i had never thought about doing anything with him again but, we ended up drunk alone together again and he said we should have sex and i honestly wanted to and i told him that but i was so fucked up i couldn't function so we went to sleep instead and never talked about that again either. but now this thought comes in my head sometimes that i want to lose my v card to him??? but i'm not even attracted to him in that way, i do not see myself with him. he has even mentioned us getting married and having kids but then goes back on it and says it's just a thought but he wouldn't actually so i don't really know what he's thinking with that? i don't think that lol but i do think about having sex with him every once in a while and idk what to do???? i don't want to tell any of my friends because they would literally gag in my face if i did because our relationship is so brother sister like lol i guess i just want to see if anyone else feels like that about their best friend?? or if i should tell him?? or should i just ignore it?? i'm just sick of this thought coming around and being all alone in my head about it because i tell him everything ever but this is something i feel like i can't so i'm lost. send help lol",04Nov2020,1

543,"So I don’t really know how to start this so...here we go. I have found that I getting extremely attached to things that I enjoy. Almost to a fault I’ll admit but it’s very conflicting.
Well recently one of the communities I’m in has branch out to Tiktok. And it’s all gone down hill from there. The community is 18+ and Tiktok isn’t the best place for it? And I understand that other people enjoy those things but actually seeing it being reacted to and the fact that drama came with it is scary to me. I feel like I can’t enjoy the community anymore and as of late it’s been the only thing to calm me down. 
In a spit of rage I created an alternative account on Tiktok and expressed my distaste for the community being brought to the app and how it made it uncomfortable for people like me to see it brought to the app. 
In doing this I mentioned a relatively big name in the community on Tiktok and was received with instant hate and judgment and after arguing a bit in the comments, I created another post called them out even more. And yesterday (last night) was the boiling point for me. It felt as those this person was leeching to everything that made me feel comfortable and safe in the community and in turn I couldn’t even go to the community without feeling HUGE waves of anxiety. I expressed it in a video. And I went to sleep having called the person out once again. I woke up to messages saying I was blowing it out of proportion and was being to sensitive and was just jealous of the person for their involvement in the community. And I got so scared that I deleted the account. I’ve been anxious all day because even thinking about going to the one place that’s helped me in the past 3 years I can’t even fully enjoy anymore because it feels like all the fun has been taken out of it.

So I guess this post is to figure out if I’m overreacting or if it’s reasonable to be upset? For some advice on how to get back into it without having that mental block of uncertainty.",04Nov2020,1
544,"I’m (19F) really shy/introverted so I can’t quite always tell when someone is being friendly or flirty. Usually I just think they’re being nice, but not too long ago at work my friend told me that one of our older male coworkers was flirting with me. I don’t know if she said it to make me embarrassed or something, because I always perceived my interactions with him to be nothing more than friendly. 

I told her I thought he was just being nice, and she shrugged her shoulders and said that’s just what she thinks. He calls me “sweetheart” and “girl”, has told me I was a lovely girl, and he also teases me about being so shy and quiet and not talking to him more often, but not in a mean way. His tone of voice is always friendly. 

My friend was there when he called me a lovely girl and teased me about being so quiet, and that’s when after he left she joked and she thought she saw me blushing and this whole thing with her started. I didn’t blush and if I did, it wasn’t blushing my face was red because I was honestly kind of uncomfortable being put on the spot by anybody. 

After my friend said that he “was flirting with me” it made me wonder for a moment, but it also made me sort of annoyed for her to assume that because she always thinks a guy is flirting with her in some way. I just thought this male coworker was being friendly. I am 30 years younger than him and he’s married, barely knows me because I just started working here. I asked another friend outside of work and she said it could come off as a bit flirty, but she thinks he was just being friendly too. 

My friend at work now teases me that I have a crush on him too which I don’t, even when I tell her stop saying it she doesn’t. Any advice on how to make her stop? No one else can control how she acts, but maybe she doesn’t take me seriously because I am a soft spoken person and I feel like maybe I didn’t make myself clear. 

This isn’t a big deal at all but our workplace is full of drama so I don’t want her to tease me about it and have somebody else hear it and rumors float around or something. Please help I don’t know how to handle this situation. I wouldn’t even know what else to say to her all I tell her is to stop saying that but she doesn’t. What else can I try?

547,"My mom and I haven’t always been on the same side when it comes to mental health. I believe she doesn’t even believe in it, that people can actually have mental health issues.  She believes it’s mostly an act or people overreacting and that their just feeling bad for a few days like everyone else. Which really sucks since she’s a fucking nurse working with elderly people, so it’s okay for elderly to have mental problems but not young people?
The first time I went to a psychologist (I think it is called) it didn’t really work out. But the last few years have been really trying and I really needed someone to talk to who wouldn’t fight me on everything I said (my mom). I tried a year or two back to talk to my mom to let me try talking to a psychologist again, but she didn’t agree and we just ended up fighting like usual. I dropped the topic for a long time, but not that long ago it went to the point I had a panic attack and it was terrifying, while I know a lot of people only experience it once in their life, it was the point where I decided I needed to talk to someone about everything going on.
Since I am now 18 I could get a meeting on my own and I did. However I needed a ride, my mom drove me but she kept saying that I needed to tell them to delete everything after Im done talking to them so it wouldn’t be on my medical records. While I suppose I can understand that to some degree but would it hurt her to actually be a little concerned or even care? I love her but I don’t know how to get though to her on this subject. I try to tell her how I feel and that Im having a hard time, she just seems to feel that Im just seeking attention or trying to fight her on this.

552," My stomach is in knots so often, I'm scared I'll get sick eventually. My work is often derailed because the strength of this is so distracting.  

I am HIGHLY emotional. I work in a creative vocation, which helps partly to expel this type of energy. I don't want to go on any medications (I've tried it, and its really just not for me at this point). I have trained myself in CBT to not much avail, I do talk therapy (I'm on my second year), I meditate, eat well, exercise.. I ask for support (but try not to do so often). I am trying and working SO HARD at this, to the point of exhaustion.

But I'm still like a live wire, an open wound.. all of the analogies! I just want to be able to turn this on and off yea know? It affects my work, my body, and my relationships. I am either very manic-like and happy, or quite low, or very stressed and jumping to conclusions. My therapist is convinced I don't have anything like bipolar. That's great! I am just an emotional human!

But how do I find balance? Sometimes I look back on my week, or month, or year, and I wince at how upset or crazy or desperately sad I was. I know I can control my feelings.. I believe that.

I am the only “liberal” in my family. I live in the south so that doesn’t help but as I’ve gotten older and moved away from their hard right ideologies I’m having a harder time wanting to maintain the relationship I have. My parents are older so I’ve attributed a lot of their “views” as being from a certain generation and it was a different time so that was the excuse I gave them. The issues have gotten so much worse during this pandemic and election. For the record I’m the only one taking it seriously. The “pandemic” that my family thinks is happening is a flu virus that kills some really old decrepit people in nursing homes. They’re annoyed that they have to wear a mask and just want the economy to open up. They feel that people will get sick, get over it and move on. I don’t feel it’s that simple when over 200k lives have been lost of all ages and we have the worst infection and death rate in proportion to other developed nations. So that’s been argument number 1 that has been a constant struggle. The second has been the election. My family loves trump. They think he’s one of them. They don’t hear the misogynistic, racist remarks or the lack of calling out white supremacy. Their response is “can’t be that serious of a group if I’ve never heard of [proud boys] them. They don’t care about BLM or feel any sympathy and keep quoting old stories of affirmative action from the 90s.  They keep talking about joe Biden having dementia and how “scary” Kamala is. I’ve tried to hold my tongue because I work in the family business but it’s seriously getting to the point where I can’t keep my mouth shut. We’ve had arguments about nearly everything. Police brutality isn’t a problem in their eyes because they feel that if you aren’t acting as a criminal then you won’t be brutalized (seriously it’s that bad). The above are just some of the problems I’m having because my family (including the extended aunts, uncles, siblings, etc) are all racist. They brag about how BLM has fueled their racism. 


I’m over here with shock, confusion, and disgust hidden from my face. I really should have an Oscar right now for my numerous performances of silence. 

I have kids and I want them to grow up in an inclusive, tolerant, respectful environment. My partner and I both feel the same on these issues and are frustrated to say the least with my family. 

How do I move forward? Regardless of the election’s outcome, I just want to have family. I feel like my only option is to move away and cut them all off. I am I crazy for wanting to completely excuse myself from my tumor of a family or do I accept them for who they are?",04Nov2020,1

He got a high paying job and I did well in school to the point where he could afford to send me to a pretty good university in another city. But it was a lot for our financials, and I started to slip in university (academically, started investing in developing soft skills more than my STEM skills and grading was all relative) that was the real first blow. 

I was not getting good grades and wasting the money he struggled to make in his last years before retiring. I tried but it was never good enough to even cross the 3.0 mark. Fortunately, the university had a good rep and I got a job right out of college at a decent pay. 

The job was difficult on my mental health with managers yelling at me to quickly learn things and coding languages I had never learnt before and forcing me to work till 2 am on bullshit assignments, but I kept trying for a few months because of him. Eventually, it got to the point where I was breaking down every other day and decided to quit. First my parents were supportive because I looked like I was depressed, the change in personality was visible, but as soon as I decided to leave for a less demanding job they'd change tune. I took a look at out financials and with me not in the equation we had enough income streams to sustain us, and with the money I didn't spend at all besides on phone bills and one software I could sustain myself without asking him for money.

571,"I'm 24F and my uncle (mom's sister's husband) makes me feel very uncomfortable and something about him doesn't seem right. My uncle is actually a very fun guy and everyone loves him. My aunt married him when I was 6 and I actually liked him a lot back then. He was always very nice to me.

 But two months after they got married we all went on a family trip and stayed in a house inside a forest. My uncle would always call me to go walk with him when everyone else slept in the afternoon. I don't remember him doing anything bad but he used to carry me in his hands to keep me from falling down. I don't know know why but since then I was terrified to go near him. I don't remember what happened during our walks or even much of the trip but since then every time he touches me chills start going down my spine. I'm always uncomfortable in his presence. 

He later moved away to a different country for work and I saw him again when I was 18 and the moment he put his hand around my shoulder I felt like throwing up. I even get scared when he looks at me. But everyone in my family loves him. He has two daughters and they're also very close to him. I don't know if I'm just being crazy but my gut tells me he's a bad guy. Now the problem is he's at my grandparents house right now and I'll have to stay over there for a few days. My parents think I'm being crazy but I know something is not right. Am I overreacting?

577,"I was contacted last week via the HR team at my company about a position I applied for. We setup a phone screening on FRIDAY and the recruiter told me she was going to recommend me for an interview with the ""Senior Administrator Manager"" and someone would be in touch soon. GREAT!

Fast forward to Monday at 9pm at night and I see an email with the title ""Senior Administrative Manager Interview"". We discuss some days and times to zoom, and we decide on today.

I prepared with the job description, had great notes and questions etc and really felt things were going great. I referred to the job description several times and talked about how my experience was relevant. I also mentioned how HR had discussed the position being a lateral move and how that was ok as long as I could build my experience. He seemed a little confused by this and seemed a little confused every time I referred to the position title (which I didn't notice at the time).

So the interview ends and I actually feel hopeful while not overly optimistic. And then, maybe an hour ago, I get an email from a Senior Administrative Manager: ""Hey, I heard the interview went great last week and I am looking to set up an interview for the X position"". My jaw hit the floor.

The job I was applying for WAS a Sr. Admin position (which would be the normal move for me) and I was simply assuming this was the senior admin manager setting up the interview *exactly in the timeline HR said the would*.

Obviously I fucked up. The timing was unfortunate, but I fucked up. My question: should I own up and explain the timing and unfortunate confusion to try and clear up the possible question marks he might have about our interview, or should I just keep quiet? I can see damage being done by reaching out, but I could also see those small issues possibly costing me the job.

580,"Hi, my phone had broken today and I dont know how I can live without it. I need it for everything I deal with these days. 

I need it to keep track of my sister bc she is signed into her insta account on there. Sometimes she goes missing and we have had some really close calls with her almost being hurt or disappearing, but since she is signed into my phone it can be really easy to track her and ask her friends where she was and what not. This is a daily occurence, im scared im gonna lose her just cause i dont have my phone to keep track of her anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I need it for work, i never really write down my schedules just because i know that i can always look at it on my phone. well, all of my jobs require me to sign into an app to view my schedule.  I also use my phone as a work phone as well, so, without it im kinda screwed at work. I think today i might have to make rounds to all my jobs and get physical copies of my shcedule to pass by. It is still going to hard though because everything I have to do is online for work...

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, and most importantly, I need my phone for my safety. I dont have a car so i ride the city bus to all my jobs. I use an app on my phone that tracks my location and if i press a button it'll alert police if something were to happen to me. I travel through a pretty dangerous area and i have already had some extremely weird and dangerous encounters thus far. It seriously doesnt help that i get off of work at odd times and getting home takes 2 hours minimum on the bus. I sometimes get off of one of my jobs at 3 am but its always 2 am if anything and i dont get home till maybe 4 or 5. Whenever i dont work that one though, i have a graveyard shift that starts at 12 am till 8 am, so im travelling to work at like 9 pm through a weird area.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that this may seem.. ridiculous. but i seriously need advice on what to do. In my current situation I dont have any money to replace it and its gonna be awhile till i can actually save up for it. Even though all i do is work and make money, majority of my money goes to my household rent and bills since im the only one in my family that has a job at the moment. The rest of my money goes into other bills like my familys phone plan, groceries, or my moms car insurance etc. My moms car broke down this morning on the highway, so i cant get any rides from her till we save up the money to get car up and running again. I dont have any friends irl, i dont really know anybody, its really just me and my family.

If anyone has any advice on what I should do, or how to cope. Please do let me know, im kinda desperate at this point and any advice i get can help.

583,"I'm like quite literally fucking done at this point. We had these people move onto the first floor like a month ago, if that. We live in, what is supposed to be, a locked building. It says right in the lease ""Keep the doors locked at all times"". They even gave us all specific keys to unlock the outside door so we could always keep in locked.

Well, the first floor has been nothing but problems. The mom, who is severely mentally unstable (like bat shit crazy), calls the cops at least every other day with lies. She fucking hallucinates. So the other day she called the cops and said that some dude was robbing MY apartment and had apparently run out of the building with a bunch of my shit. Mind you I am here 24/7 and I have a very territorial dog. I would have known if someone was here. No one was ever here. Like, the front door deadbolt (where she said he ran out of) was literally still locked, from the inside. She just fucking lies all the time.

Or not even 2 days after that incident she called the cops after SHE punched some dude in the face. She said he beat her up. The guy is a local drunk with autism. Literally doesnt harm anyone, ever. I have known him for so long. So we run downstairs to defend the guy because this bitch punched HIM and this bitches 16yo son actually threatened to kill me, while recording me on live stream for his FB the entire time. The whole family is fucked up.

Anyways, she leaves the door unlocked all the time. As I said. So we have homeless people shitting in our fucking hallways. I wish I were kidding but I'm not. Her son is also a drug dealer so his little druggie friends are constantly in and out of the building. If the door is locked, by chance, they scale up our porches and get into our back porches to get through our door so they can gain access to the building.

The police have been literally no help at all. The landlord wont even give us a call back and now there is so much tension in this building its ridiculous. Like, the first floor has seriously convince my 2nd floor neighbor that I am the reason for all of the traffic in and out of this building and they are so fucking blind to it that they just believe them and hate my fucking guts now.

597,"So I’m recently trying to get into politics and I realized that I mostly side with Republicans. However I also side with Democrats with some issues.

For example, gun control is a huge issue I’ve noticed. I don’t want to ban guns nor do I wish to take them.

However, I do believe guns in the wrong person’s hands is very bad. To counter act this. They anyone who wishes to buy guns should be put threw a background check to see if they have a violent history. They should also take a safety text to show they know how to properly care for the gun and how to properly use it. Finally they should get their head checked to make sure they aren’t crazy.

Abortion is another big issue. I personally believe it is wrong and should be illegal. However I understand that people are horrible and do unspeakable things to unwilling participants. So my stance would be, for 2 months, abortions should be legal. In case something happens and people get pregnant even though they don’t want to, they have plenty of time to figure it out and do something about it. However, after the two months, a person should only have an abortion if their doctor says that it has to happen or else the parent might be greatly harmed or pass away.

Drugs, another big issue. Marijuana should be legal, but taxed like cigarettes are. I mean alcohol is legal to own and as long as you don’t drive under the influence, it should be fine. However, with harder drugs, if a person is found with them, straight to jail. But this jail would be more like rehab. Try to get the person clean and try to teach them what they are doing to their bodies and how it’s affecting them.

Gay rights is another issue. I’m gay and would like the same rights as a straight person. I should marry who I want, I should be able to adopt if I want. Everything a straight person can do, I should have the same right. That goes for all LGBTQ+ people. Also if a trans person wishes to join the military, why stop them. They are willing to fight and die for their country so why stop them.

Minimum wage is an issue as well. No matter what it will always be impossible to live off of minimum wage. If you raise it, then the company will just raise their prices or cut hours or even lay people off so they can still make a profit. For small businesses, this could cause them to go out of business because they could no longer afford workers and they lose to much money.

College should not be free. Y’all are grown adults, if y’all go to college to just party like some of my old friends did, you deserve your debt. College is meant to provide you more education and in order to do that, you have to study and do the work. I personally would not want to pay higher taxes for some person who shows up, does nothing but party, change their major multiple times, then drop out. Cause that is were the money to pay for free stuff comes from, the taxes. 

Sadly for the people who actually go for a higher education and don’t spend your time partying, we can’t do anything for your debt and I apologize, but it’s only fair this way, we either do something for everyone or no one. We can’t give you special treatment and the partiers nothing. I hope you understand how it wouldn’t be fair and I am truly sorry.

Illegal immigration is a big problem as well. If your here illegally, you get no rights. If you are found to be here illegally, you should be given enough time to become legal, if you don’t, you’re out of the country. If you need help becoming legal. Help should be provided. However, a background check should be required. If the person is found to be extremely dangerous then they have to leave. If it appears they are here to harm America, they should be forced out. 

The wall probably won’t do anything to prevent illegals in the country. From my understanding they can get on a plane, fly here, their papers can expire and they are officially here illegally. So the wall probably won’t help. But I still support a better wall so there is less likely chance for illegals to cross over. Also if you’re a child, born in America, but your parents are illegally here. You are not an American and will have to leave if they do (unless of course the parents were here legally when they had the child). 
The reason why I want to crack down on illegals so much is because my cousin was killed by one. I know not everyone here illegally is a killer, but it is why I would expect a huge background check. Just to make sure killers won’t get in the country.

Police is probably the final issue I’m going to talk about. I feel like police don’t have the proper training they need. They should have to go to police academy for a minimum of two years. There they will learn when force should be used. How they should use it. They should learn every law because the average citizen has to know them so they don’t break them. If the cops know exactly when/how to use force, and they know and follow the law themselves, and if they get fair pay and normal work hours, then there should be less issues.

As y’all see. These are just a few of my views. As I mentioned before I am a Republican, but I do share views with both sides. I’m not of age to run for President and I won’t be for a while. But based on my views, if everything I said I did. Would I be a good President, or would there still be issues. Also as I said I’m new to politics so I don’t know what has already been enforced and what all is not. I’m still learning. 

I don’t want to receive hate so if there is a problem, calmly state it and I’ll take another look and see if I can understand all sides better and base my opinion on that. Opinions can change, I mean Obama and Biden both said in the past marriage is between a man and a woman. Then at the end of his term, Obama made gay marriage legal. Either his opinion changed, or (as some people told me) he just wanted to cause problems, but I personally think his opinion changed.
So please no hate, if we live without hate, then America can truly become great again.",04Nov2020,1
598,"So just some background, I was a shy kid in elementary through high school but I opened up around Senior year and developed myself through my early college years and I believe definitely changed for the better.

I think I can say that I am or have been socially engaged. Obviously due to responsibilities I am not getting together with people every night and there are seasons where school or work is the priority but I go to social gatherings when I can. 

I also think that I can make people smile and I, to be honest, do a ton of favors for the people I like so I don't think that I'm NOT showing that I care.

However, despite this, I don't think I've ever had someone ask me to go anywhere with them or take time out of their day to reach out to me. Honestly, I haven't received any ""thoughtful"" Christmas or birthday gift from any non-familiy member in a long while.

Any advice helps. I probably sound selfish but let me tell you that this is not how I normally think of things. I haven't cared up to this point but I am seeing where things are not all right.

Even if you don't have any advice, giving me some different ways to look at this situation would be helpful to.

Thank you.",04Nov2020,1
599,"My best friend of 27 years is moving next year :(

We've been friends since we were kids and have helped each other through some really difficult shit in each of our respective formative years, but now he's moving.

We're two straight men and I want to find a good personalized gift for when he leaves, but everything I see on ETSY and other sites is a little girly.

Does anyone have any recommendations of inexpensive but meaningful gifts to give my friend?",04Nov2020,1
600,"One of my best friends has recently started apologising pretty much every time she says something that could even remotely be considered offensive.
She was always careful not to offend anyone, but it started getting out of hand. I don't mean that she apologises for things like cutting somebody off or making a distasteful joke, she literally feels bad about everything.

To give you an example: In Chemistry, I commented on the fact that the way I drew a water molecule, it looked like a stick figure. She laughed and I quickly forgot about it again. But at the end of the school day, more than an hour later, she said she wanted to apologise and clarify that she doesn't think fat people look funny, because she laughed at a stick figure that had an O as its stomach. 
Another time we were walking next to each other when a pigeon flew right in front of us and she flinched. I didn't think much of it, especially since I was surprised too and I know she is scared of pigeons. But even though her reaction was clearly normal, that didn't stop her from feeling the need to explain that she flinched because of the pigeon and not because of me or anything I did or said.

There are many more examples of this. She apologises at least 3-5 times a day, even if the person in question didn't even notice or her intentions were obvious. I already told her quite a few times that she doesn't need to do that, that I understand what she means to say and that it didn't cause any harm, but she still insists on it. I read online that it can be a sign of insecurity or anxiety but I'm unsure if that could be an explanation for it in this case. If apologising makes her feel better I don't want to ask her to stop, but it's honestly getting annoying. I feel really bad for thinking that, especially since she always wants to make sure not to upset anyone, yet here I am, upset at her. I told her that if she wants to talk about anything I'll always be there for her,  and she assured me she's fine and will take me up on that offer if that should ever change. 

At this point I really don't know if it would be better to talk to her about it or not, because I don't want to pressure her into stopping and making her feel even worse. Technically what she's doing isn't wrong. Please let me know your thoughts on the matter.",04Nov2020,1

606,"I’ve had issues with attendance since 9th grade. I’ve gone to therapists for it, but it never really did anything for me. I initially thought I might have ADHD, but was never diagnosed. 

Now I’m in my last year of high school and I feel like I finally reached my limit. I’ve nearly been kicked out 3 times for having shitty grades/ being absent.  I hate school. I don’t learn anything, whether I go or not. I hate certain teachers whose style of teaching seems so outdated and garbage. When I asked to be moved from one English group to another (where I actually got along with the teacher and whose teaching style actually kept me engaged), they said no. 

My mother is also furious for my truancy which makes me feel super shitty and guilty, which I guess I should for skipping, but having to pick between that and going to a completely mind-numbing, boring place where I’m reminded left and right through various scoldings that I am clearly not as academically gifted as the rest of these young men and women, can be really shitty. 

In the end, I know I have no one to blame but myself. I put myself in a situation where not going to school feels shitty because i’m letting people down and going to school also feels shitty because I know how shitty i’m doing. 

What do I do? I can feel my mental health slowly plummeting each time I get scolded for skipping (by my mom and homeroom teacher) and each time I get scolded for not having my shit done (by various teachers). I have no motivation to go to school other than “I don’t wanna disappoint anyone”, which seems like a terrible motivation to wake up to every morning.",04Nov2020,1
607,"I'm 16F, and I'm a junior in high school. I'm currently taking a college level English class and basic communications class (known as ENG-101 and COM-103). Both of these classes dabble heavily in writing, and they are really stressing me out. I have a lot of outside stressors right now, and the pressure of 5 high school classes and 2 college classes is taking a huge toll on my mental health. I'm also the type of person who puts as much effort as I can theoretically give into something—I guess because I want to do things the ""right way"" and try.

My average GPA is a 5.0, and my grades are generally within the A+ range no matter what time of year it is. This has also carried over to my college classes, but I have to put a lot more time, effort, and thought into them. To be completely honest, I don't even think I'll end up going to college because I just don't think it's the right decision for me. All the things I want to do don't *require* a degree, but, as goes with pretty much everything, it's helpful to have one anyway.

I thought I made up my mind about dropping out of what would be called ENG-102 (or college level English second semester), but then I turned in my second English essay and got a 100% on it. My professor was telling me a bunch of really sweet things like, ""You'll do so good in college,"" ""You're gonna get a lot of awards and gain so much recognition for your essays,"" ""You wrote a solid academic, scholarly-sounding essay, and that will get you SO FAR."" This was amazing to me and stressed me out at the same time. I take my writing seriously and love to do it, but I've only wrote 2 out if 4 total essays for this semester, and I hate everything.

I can't remember the last time I laughed genuinely just because, I can't remember the last day I had where I wasn't thinking about how much I hate my life right now (although this is largely due to the aforementioned outside stressors, the classwork is getting to me more and more as time goes on), and I only think about how much I want to drop ENG-102 but the fact that the experience will help me, I don't want to be a ""quitter,"" and how I have a feeling that completing ENG-102 is gonna bring something for me (even though I have no idea what that would be).

610,"So I recently moved into uni and at first I got along with my 6 roommates well, we used to drink quite a lot and I thought they were all very nice people. But I had some personal issues going on in my life that made me spiral. I ended up stopping my medication (for social anxiety) without consulting my GP and isolating myself in my room for a few weeks. 

In the beginning they would invite me to go out for drinks and to watch rugby or just to socialise in the kitchen. When I stopped coming out they’d text me and knock on my door but I just ignored them. Now they hardly call for me and it’s just awkward between us all as I haven’t seen any of them in weeks. I avoid going into the kitchen when I hear them in there and wake up really early to get a shower. 

I always hear them in the kitchen until like 2-3 in the morning and I want to join back rather than just being miserable in my room but I can’t think of a way to do it where I don’t feel painfully awkward and end up acting all defensive and snappy because I feel like they’re judging me. 

I know it’s my fault and it may be just as simple as going into the kitchen and making food then a conversation will strike up but I just feel so awkward doing so. I was wondering if anyone had some strategies so I could ease my way back in without it being to painful. Sorry for the stupid question.",04Nov2020,1
611,"Long story short, I got fired for speaking up about my concerns. I sent an email about how I felt that I was being treated unfairly by one of the workers and I gave them some of the issues that I encountered with that worker. I also mentioned about how management made a false presumption about me being on my phone to text, when I was on it to look at pictures for references (because I had to sketch out a character for decorations). I ended the email saying that I have no negative feelings towards the worker, only towards how I was treated. That I didn't appreciate management coming to me and asking me themself. Instead, they had the coworker (who already has issues w me for some reason) come tell me to stop texting when I wasn't. I would have been fine with showing them my screen to prove myself. I mentioned that I only hope to understand their side of things and for them with mine and to resolve things in the end.  

Fast forward, they told me we'll discuss it on the next day I work (which was three days later). I came to work, my supervisor tries to have small talk with me and said we'll talk about it. Was taken to an office room with the supervisor, the boss, and his assistant. I spoke up after there was an awkward silence and asked if they want me to talk about my concerns. Boss shows me my email printed out in paper and doesn't address ANY of my problems. Just immediately went to, ""You have an unfriendly face, there are arguments, we've been getting complaints about you, you're on the phone all the time. We're going to have let you go because we need more positive people around here."" At this point, I felt shocked because 1) I never once got into an argument with ANYONE at work. I have disagreed with the worker that I had issues with, because I felt like I was being treated unfairly, but that's it. 2) I asked him what were the complaints because I never had any issues with the other employees. And if there were complaints for a while, why hasn't anyone talked to me about it??? 3) I don't engage in conversations at work. I don't do small talk. I just like to stay to myself and do my work. The only time I have spoken to a coworker is when I had questions (because I'm a new employee) and when an employee asked me questions.  So I don't understand where the unfriendliness comes from when I barely talk to anyone. He replied with ""We get them a lot. We see it."" and I'm like ??? ok tell me what it is then??? and he wouldn't.  I barely see him around and it felt like he bullshitted b/c wtf is an unfriendly face? How can you see my facial expressions when I have a mask on all the time? I'm the only one at my shift that properly wear my mask. The boss himself walks around without a mask on. The employees that I worked with would put it under their chin, or remove it to TALK. So I don't know what he means by ""I see it. We've seen you."" He wouldn't give me a legitimate answer. Just a really vague one. 

This has been bothering me for days and I don't understand why. I don't want this to bother me so much and I feel almost pathetic for letting this bother me.

I can get a Bachelors for only a $1 a day, so pretty much $80 a class. Which is pretty good and can’t go above $365 a year. However I’m at an online college that I don’t think is adequate enough and I’m worried that when I graduate then the degree won’t be worth the same as from a college that is highly credited in my state. 

The only problem is I work full time. And I don’t really see how going to an actual campus is possible with working 40+ hours a week. I’m only going to this college because Walmart helps pay for it. My roommate mentioned that I could go to this college for 2 years, get most of my general ED out of the way then transfer to on campus learning. I’d love to go to a state capital university but I just don’t see how it’s possible since I work second shift and I work the full time. And my weekends are used up for class work. 

Should I stay at this online college since I’m going for dirt cheap? Or should I try to transfer to on campus learning, pay full tuition without scholarships, and have no free time available? 

Any opinion helps. It has me stressed out and I don’t want to pay however much, use up 4 years of my life, for a degree that I didn’t learn anymore from and not have any knowledge in the field I want.

624," This is my 3rd attempt at describing my problems in the shortest way possible, it is so hard. 

1. I (22F) have always been the kind of person who barely interacts with anyone besides friends. But around age 13, I began debating and gained a lot of confidence so I kinda began being social and was pretty social till end of school at age 17. After that I moved for university to lets say country A in 2015, and despite my many attempts to maintain my friendships, all my friends gradually stopped texting me or replying back. Even after I moved back to my original country (B) in 2017, I made attempts to be included in their meet ups and somehow got left out everytime and was told that they forgot and meet ups were definitely not happening without me and they always did it without me so I haven’t met them since 2015. After all of this attempts failing, I have stopped trying to maintain contact with them, I have stopped sending birthday wishes (they barely ever wish me). And I really do not want to care anymore about them.

2. While I was in a country A, I went back to being socially awkward but I made a couple of friends who I am still very close to even now. And of them is my BFF. And because I haven’t been able to travel due to COVID, I always videocall them and text them to catch up. And we share the most amazing friendship ever.

(ahaha, it looks as if I am socially awkward actually and debating made me less socially awkward for a few years then I became the same again lol)

3. When I restarted university in country B, I met some people who I hit off with after a few awkward weeks. And these friends and the friends from country A are the closest friends I have ever had and just the most amazing people I have ever met in my life. They all know that despite being a fierce debater in front of audiences, I am a very awkward person in reality and they are always trying to up my confidence and pushing me forward and we all help each other a lot. 

4. Now the problem is, around mid 2019, I began becoming the kind of person who always replies late to texts and I absolutely hate it. But I never ever feel like opening them and seeing and if I do, I never feel like replying even when it’s my beloved best friend. And since covid and lockdown began, this behavior has exaggerated and now I absolutely hate the idea of having to text anyone or even videocalling them. I keep apologizing to BFF and then do the same thing again and I explained to her what I have been feeling and sometimes she tells me it’s okay, and sometimes she is like shall I come and reply to myself for you. And I just laugh and apologize and then text her back regularly for a week then go back to not texting at all. 

5. Also, around the same time, I started noticing I was always piling up things to do. My studies, books I plan on reading, shows I wanna watch, I just keep listing out these things but I never do them. All I do is scroll mindlessly on Instagram and look at memes. Recently though, I have gotten around to planning my studies so it has been working out very well so far, but other things I just don’t do them and I feel a like a loser cause I really wanna do atleast a few of the books and shows I planned on. I also cannot pay attention to online lectures, I just listen mindlessly but thankfully, I have been having clinical rotations for a couple months since I am a med student so we have very less online classes now. I just feel I have been losing interest in all things in general for more than a year now. 

So basically, is there anyone who can provide some insight as to why I have been feeling the way I feel and if you need to ask me questions, please do. And also any tips for changing my procrastinating habits as well please.",04Nov2020,1
625,"Hi everyone,

Recently been trying to reconnect with an old friend. Some backstory:

We met in an online group, where none of us knew each other before, back in 2015. We become fast friends and talked to each other quite frequently until late 2018, where life sort of took us in 2 separate paths and we haven't really spoken to each other since.

FYI we've never met in person, considering we live halfway across the world.

Recently I've been reminiscing about old memories about our old group, and I fondly recalled talking to her. I shot her a message on discord last week, but to be honest I'm not sure if she still uses that account since it shows it's offline, but of course she could've set it to that.

Here's the tricky part. I was actually a bit worried if she was even ok since I hadn't heard from her in so long, plus all the COVID business, so I tried looking for other accounts of her online under her discord name, and I was able to find her twitter, and she's been active recently so at least I know she's ok.

The advice bit. How should I go about reaching out to her on twitter? Either:

\- She saw my discord message and chose to ignore it

\- She hasn't opened it or doesn't use that discord account anymore

And either way, I feel we were pretty good friends before that she wouldn't be weirded out over me finding her twitter, but since it's been 2 years, I'm not really sure.

Just to clarify, I'm just trying to reach out to her as a friend, nothing more.

Any advice is welcome.",04Nov2020,1

SO and me life with our two kids in a bighouse, therefore he isolated himself from us right away, so I can not get infected (I am going to have insane shifts the next weeks, since the infection numbers are increasing) He got tested today, we are waiting for the results. Also he has symptoms by now, pretty sure that he is also positive, same for MIL.

And today FIL had an fatal accident. He died alone, as he was working yesterday evening, fixing something on the ceiling and fell from a ladder. His coworkes found him this morning.
And it‘s so fucked up, everybody is crying, isolated from each other, and I never wanted to hug my SO that bad. At least I can be there for my kids.

638,"Sorry if this is messy! I’m on my phone and my brain is scattered 

I (18f) have lived in a small town my whole life and it was mostly great. This year however, things got super intense, two of my friends passed away, my closest friends who were all smart and hardworking started using hard drugs, and it wasn’t a safe place for me to be in anymore. I was pretty surrounded in everyone else’s issues i could barely think for myself. I had been using a little myself (I had an apartment with several friends who used so i was always around it) and wasn’t taking care of myself, I realized I needed to move away after the second of 2 deaths and my best friends overdose. I moved out of my apartment and back in with my parents, got sober, and started saving to move to a city a few hours away. A close friend from high school and my boyfriend at the time found an apartment and moved together about a month later. I have been here for about 3 months now and although it’s good to be away from everything i feel like this move has hurt more than it has helped. My boyfriend and I broke up pretty soon after the move and I started seeing my best friend from home. My other friends from home are in really bad conditions and i’m scared they won’t be around for very much longer (my town also has a very high suicide rate and my friends are at risk). On top of all of this I haven’t found a job and although it’s important i have no desire to get one or do anything else, I typically stay home all day and get drunk with my roommates at night.

639,"VERY LONG SORRY. Some is just venting and it feels good to do this.

So, a bit of back story. My mom has had alcohol issues my entire life, she has on and off been an issue to her three kids and probably 10 years ago she basically started living like a gypsy, no job, drifting, living off of people. During this entire time I have been extremely supportive of her. I've let her live with me on and off (causing issues with my past significant other) and I've been paying some of her bills (storage, phone, car insurance) for over 5 years and giving her money when she needed it. 

Last year I went though a divorce and it kinda changed my outlook on life, I sort of slowly decided that I would not be such a push over to people in my life and this of course includes my mom, the biggest guilter and neediest person in my life (at times). 

She is in her 50s, capable of working, but she does not. She drinks too much and smokes a lot of pot and JUST recently got some scholarships and started going back to school. Which is SO SO awesome for her, but essentially she is sort of acting like her kids should be supporting her more. 

My siblings and I all decided recently to get a place together and I am VERY strongly against my mom living with us again. My sister and I actually recently let her stay with us for a couple of months and it was kinda shitty. She would do dishes on occasion and every now and then buy groceries, but she basically just did class and watched TV and would sometimes get drunk, keep us up late, argue, wake us up in the middle of the night (on nights we have to work!) And a few times we got pretty pissed at her.

At one point my younger sister told her if she is gonna drink that much she can't stay with her, my mom turned it around on her making her feel bad saying that she doesn't feel like she has any place to go, blah blah.

She actually moved up here from California to move in with her friend, and has several options to live, but she really just wants to live with her kids because it's so much more comfortable with her. She even told my younger sister to ""make sure she has a place for her"" 

I started having conversations with her explaining why we can't live with her, I'm single now and she gets over protective. She'll start texting me if I'm out late (keep in mind, I'm 32) and lecture us about what we are eating, not to use aluminum foil when cooking, non stick pans, plastic, blah blah. The biggest issue though is her drinking, she gets mean to my younger sister, I get pissed and honestly her drinking is extremely influencing and all 3 of her kids have alcohol struggles and I just don't want it around us constantly, plus she just gets annoying AF.

 I let her know we need independence and I kept having this conversation OVER and OVER. When I finally made it VERY clear to her, she went to my older brother to complain and make him feel bad, luckily he had my back so she just feel bad for herself a little and we started to move forward.

We just moved into our place recently, she's been sending hints and guilt messages and all sorts of things, but we've all been kind of ignoring it.

On a separate issue, I've been paying $80-$100 a month to store some documents for her for the past 5 years. They are native documents that are apparently important, but she has neglected to get them to the right person or do anything about it, so it's been a bit of a sore subject to me to pay to store what I feel nothing for.

Since we moved into a bigger place, we got these documents out of storage and invited her over for the weekend (she still stayed longer than we invited her for) and asked her to go through some of the stuff and get rid of stuff so we don't have to keep storing it and lugging it around.

Granted, she did go through quite a bit, but she started making comments to me about figuring out what to do with the rest of the stuff and storing it at our place until then. I got annoyed firm with her about how she needs to finally handle the stuff because I don't want to keep having it for her and she's not doing anything with it. She got a little butt hurt and defensive, but she went through a lot and I just bit back my guilt and let her do her thing.

The next day, she got word that she might have native housing through her school and she had to rush out the door to go complete the application, etc.

She did not get the housing because they have a no drugs policy and she smokes pot regularly (she does have a medical recommendation but not a prescription) and she got real depressed about it. This was yesterday.

Now, she is basically not talking to me. She will talk to my other siblings, but she's basically just talking about the housing situation and how sad it makes her. I know what she is doing, she's trying to guilt me about not letting her live with us and not letting her store her shit. My other siblings were not the ""bad guys"" because even though they agree with me, they did not have to do the confrontation like I did because I bit the bullet to protect my siblings and my sanity. And I told her that it was all me because fuck it, I don't really care anymore if she thinks I'm being cold or insensitive. 

I have been what my mom calls the ""Matriarch"" of our family for the past 15 years, the most responsible, the one supporting my mom the most, the one that plans shit to make birthdays, graduations, etc special and I'm a little worn out. If I'm gonna be the Matriarch, I'm gonna protect my siblings from having to endure more of her BS than is necessary (not to mention my brother's wife shouldn't have to deal with it).

She's ignoring my texts and calls, and I wanna say, whatever good. I know she's just playing with me because she knows from the past 30 years that I'm a softy with a mothering complex and want to take care of anyone. Basically I'm just fighting that guilt and that worry and that want to take care of her. I know this is for the best for the majority of us, but she cannot see that her children should not be her caretakers. She's in her 50s, capable and we worked hard to afford a nice place to live, I know that she raised us, but I still kind find a reason why we should be supporting her now. She doesn't have a stable place because she had refused to create that for herself, why should we suffer because of her poor decisions? Now I'm ranting, sorry. I'm just tired of this game with her, it's years of this deep seeded bullshit and it sucks.

644,"I’m gonna try and keep this pretty brief but my parents are very religious Mormons. When I was thirteen I decided that it just wasn’t for me, and they found out when I was fifteen because of my annoying cousin. They immediately told me that it was just a phase and that they would pray for me to “find god again”. Anyway I’m now 17 and in late September I started dating this girl I’d known for a while. I just told her I had feelings for her one night and she told me she felt the same way. 

My parents didn’t approve of her right off the bat. They didn’t like that she was agnostic and claimed that she dressed like a whore(even though she dresses like every other high school girl). Anyway a few nights ago I was pretty angry over some drama that was going on that I’m not gonna get into. We were sitting on her porch as she was comforting me(she is one of the very few people who can calm me down when I’m angry) and then she kissed me and eventually we wound up in her bedroom and we were “intimate” for the first time(side note it was also both of our first time in general). But when I came home today from school my parents immediately started yelling at me that they knew we slept together. I guess my sister found out and told them but I don’t know how she found out. 

Anyway they started telling me that I had disgraced the entire family by having sex before marriage and that she was a terrible influence on me. I then came right out and admitted that it was true but it was my choice and we did it responsibly. This caused them to yell even more. But it was my choice and we were responsible about it. I’m 17 and she’s 16, where we live the age of consent is 16. Plus she was on birth control(albeit for separate reasons) and we got a condom from her mom(who knew about our relationship, I had to tell my parents that we broke up). They’re still downstairs yelling and freaking out, and their saying that I’m not gonna be allowed to see her anymore.

649,"I was totally sure I would marry him, have kids etc once we hit our late 20s. I had no doubts. Now I keep worrying that because I met him in the first month of college at 19, it's quite possible there is someone better suited for both of us independently. 

We've had some serious issues which mostly come from his untreated mental illness. It really came to the fore around our first 7-10 months together. I felt so sorry for him and did all I could but after weeks and weeks of being an emotional bin for him, my own mental health took a hit . He had lots of doubts about us, which I took very personally as I had litreally no doubts whatsoever back then. I felt inferior and ugly. Every so often his illness rears its ugly head and he insists he is OK without therapy. It has made me cry and want to scream with frustration at times. My insecurity really doesn't help. I will ask him ""do you ever think of X mutual female friend sexually?"" and he'll say ""yeah I do sorry"". He is brutally honest. He tells me I'm pretty/sexy all the time but I hate how unattractive he made me feel in the past. His mental health still gets bad for a few weeks here and then and it alwsys sucks.

I feel like being long distance for almost 9 months hasn't helped. I still adored him and missed him a lot those first 2/3 months of lockdown when we couldn't meet.  Then I started reflecting a lot on how crappy he made me feel in the past  and how truly angry I still am over some of it a full year later and if its even normal in a relationship. I was used to seeing him every single day when college wasn't online for COVID. From June onwards I could see him 2 days a week again and we had fun together but after all my reflecting a lot of my attraction died, I was just so resentful. He wants to live together next fall for senior year of college and my family keep talking about this vacation they want to bring him on too, and I feel a little scared. I really don't know if I'll still be with him 6+ months from now. I still feel some affection for him and maybe if we had some fun together and saw each other more regularly (haven't seen him in 6 weeks), I might fall again.

My SO and I went to get coffee, he was driving. I had barely woken up, but then the drivers side window wouldn’t roll down so he offered to go in the back and I drive. We were in the drive through at this time. 
So, car put in park, we switch, and i make the shitty mistake of putting in in drive before placing my foot where it needed to be. I hate typing this. I could’ve done better.
Foot ends up on the gas where i’m thinking it’s the break, and I rear end the person in front of me a bit hard, I don’t think it was hard as they were only some feet away from me, but I may be coping.
Thankfully, there were no damages. But I’d rather pay for their new car than what ended up happening.
I checked out as soon as I crashed. I’m not trying to play the victim I’m sorry if it seems that way. But I did have an anxiety attack, it was MY FAULT. But my head went down, and my SO did the talking, I was not excited to see what I had caused.
Eventually I had to look up. Ambulances, two on stretchers, fire truck. I knew right there I would never drive again knowing I hurt these people. I can’t let this happen again.

The shitty thing is I have a family that I need to make money for, I’ll take the bus for work this week but I would like to get over it. I know I don’t deserve to get over it because it’s my fault. It’s for my family. 
Should I seek therapy? What can I do? Is there any way more I can help these people besides the settlement they should get?

Hello all!
What do you think if since a few months I’ve been experiencing weird coincidences between my boyfriend and a friend?

This friend is a girl that i know from my workplace and 1 year ago we have been expending 6 months together for work in another city, so at that moment i decide to give her my closest contacts numbers( mum, boyfriend) in case something happened to me. I always trusted her and she always helped me giving me advice in my relationship etc..and i was helping her too! She just met my boyfriend once cause he came to visit me! But they just crossed a few words and after that they never saw each other, they don’t have friends in common. I always talk a lot with my boyfriend about this girl cause she used to have a lot of problems like depression and she was always insecure, also once i asked my boyfriend what he thought about her, and he told me she was really pretty but that he would never had something with her cause of her personality. She is Spanish and lives in Madrid, im also Spanish but 1 year ago I move with my boyfriend to France cause he is french. I have been in contact with this girl since then via WhatsApp.
One day i was having a big argument with my boyfriend and right after i contacted her to tell her about it, and she said something like: woww maybe one day i will have to contact your boyfriend to tell him to treat you better! , I told her that wouldn’t be necessary and she told me she said that as a joke, but then i started to be more alert and i become a bit obsessive about the fact she could have contact him. Then coincidences started happening specially during the first confinement things like: words that she uses, my boyfriend suddenly started using( he speaks Spanish very well), one day she talked to me about a random topic and next day my boyfriend will comment something similar about that same topic, or she mentioned me a movie or serie to watch and my boyfriend proposed the same... i also checked WhatsApp connections between them like a crazy person and they were online at the same time. She has been always the type of girl who needs attention from other guys even if she doesn’t like them.
Even though i was experiencing these events, i have never had a real proof to accuse them of talking, so I decide to ask straight away my boyfriend and he told me she never contacted him and neither did he. She told me the same. After confinement she told me she got a boyfriend and she moved with him, I thought now i will be more calm and I wouldn’t have to start doubting again, but a few weeks ago my boyfriend talk to me about a company that it was about to close because of the coronavirus situation and it was actually one of the companies where she was working before.. i asked him how did he know about it and he told me because of a colleague at work but then i become nervous asking him more questions so he said something like: are you doing me all these many questions because you think it was your friend? That actually got me thinking, and he said he really knows me now, that’s why he thought about my friend and he did not try to calm me down , he just said he is tired that I don’t trust him and that is just coincidences, so I apologise with him again. But how weird is this that then the day after he went to work in the morning, so i decide to text this girl to ask her about the corona virus situations in Spain, so she told me: “we are not in confinement yet but we can not move between communities”, so in the afternoon boyfriend came from work and we were talking about corona virus situation and suddenly he asked me :”so how is the situation in spain ?cause somebody told me they can’t move between communities” he just said exactly the same sentence as her 1 hour after! 

TL;DR: sorry for the long text, I don’t know if i did wrong but I confronted both of them, my friend told me she have never talked with him and he neither! ( he told me it was probably a colleague again or in the news he heard it), And that are just coincidences and because im more focus that’s why I think they talk...So how is this possible to experience the same coincidences all the time between them? 2 same exact sentences formulated in the same way ?Is this me being paranoid for no reason or they are actually having something behind my back?( even if is not cheating, maybe they have become friends and they don’t want to tell me cause they think i will think bad) i have to say she was the only one having my boyfriend’s number! So in case they were talking it would have been her to contact first! 

Thank you all for your help",04Nov2020,1

658,"I occasionally do theatre. For about two months now, we had been rehearsing and preparing to put on a production of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night. 

Opening night was two nights ago. Everything was going so well, and we were having a good night until this happened. 

I was getting ready to leave and was saying bye to everyone and that they did a great job. This girl, who I’ve only know for the entire duration of rehearsal’s, called out to from upstairs “Maybe be nice to other cast members next time?” I had no idea what she was talking about so I tried asking her. She just laughed, and said my name and then something like “I don’t have to explain”. And I said “No. You have a problem, you speak to me like an adult”. I think I asked again, and she still wouldn’t explain. So I almost stomp up the stairs to go see her. 

She then comes out with a pack of lies that I had been saying nasty things to other theatre members and behind their backs. None of this was true. 

Unfortunately due to my past, I’m a very defensive person. I got scared that other people were going to believe her, and I was angry, so I lashed out at her. She tried saying something like “Please don’t yell at me” and I think I said “Well you’re accusing me of stuff I didn’t do!” 

I was angry that I stormed out down the stairs, other theatre members came after me, asking me about what’s happened. I told them. 

I got taken to a room by my director and the head of the theatre group, let’s call her A. They both said something like, while it may be untrue, my reaction wasn’t necessary. I said something like “Well she’s accusing me of stuff I didn’t do, and she just called me out about it in front of everyone”. It kept going back and forth, with A saying things like “Well I’ve heard multiple reports” or “Maybe you didn’t realise you said something?” But everything she told me about what’s been said, I never said. 

I did have one situation with another theatre member a few weeks ago, which I am not proud of, which I have tried to fix. And I thought I did fix, but A said it hasn’t been. Even though she wasn’t there. I will admit to that happening, but everything else I’m hearing is a lie. 

I felt like I wasn’t being believed by A even though there’s no evidence I said anything, so I stormed out and left. With the head of theatre saying “Just let her go”. I was so livid, that I just drove off and kept driving till I pulled over somewhere. I then called one of the theatre members to ask them if I had ever said anything to upset them. They both told me no, and that they believe me. They have been checking on me since then. I also messaged another theatre member to let him know that I heard someone was saying that I had said something about him, and that it’s not true. He said he hadn’t heard anything, but he thanked me and tried to tell me not to worry about it. 

Later that night, in my anger I wrote in our private Facebook group saying “If I’m going to have lies spread about me and then be called out for it, then this isn’t a theatre group I want to be apart of”. No one commented on it, and it got deleted. And I’ve been barred from commenting in the group. I messaged my theatre group explaining my outburst, and assuring them all that what’s being said is not true.

Unfortunately, I do have to go back at some point because we are filming the show for the people who couldn’t come to opening night. I messaged my director the next day saying that I’m sorry but I can’t come back yet, that I’m too angry and hurt at the moment to. He thanked me for letting him know and said he’ll talk to me later. We haven’t had another talk about it yet. I had to send him my availability via private message. 

I’m just so livid and confused. I’ve been under a lot of stress ever since. I had heard nothing. I didn’t know anything was brewing. Everything was fine until we had to leave. It feels like a big slap in the face after two months of helping out by showing up to be there even on days I didn’t want to. This is the only issue I’ve had with this girl, and I already feel like I never want to see her or work with her ever again once filming is over. 

What should I do? What could be the reason why this has happened?",04Nov2020,1

660,"(19M) Ive always considered myself an introvert ever since I was told by friends and teachers when I was younger. I've always seen myself as that until last year where I started to going out more. I love being with my friends but it drains the hell out of me at the same time. I recently started hating being alone. It's fine at certain times but I have too many bad memories of being alone and doing certain things when I didn't have anyone to make me feel better. A way that I cope is with friends. Phyiscally being next to me or just talking helps from the negative memories not be there. Ive recently got with my girlfriend who copes the opposite way and wants to be alone when she is down. I sometimes get down because (I dont wanna sound clingy for saying this, even though she likes it) I get sad when I'm not around her sometimes or feel like she doesn't wanna be near me. I can talk to the bois of course but man everyone is doing their own things and of course I have tons and tons of shit I can improve and work on creatively but they just don't make me as happy anymore in my younger teen years.",04Nov2020,1
661,"  I want to stay anonymous so I’m using throwaway.

I am an admin running a personal blog about political issues on Facebook (since last year). Some background: I am 21M and I have always been so interested in politics. In fact, the reason I have decided to become a blogger in the first place is that for years I have heard people around me praising that I’m such an expert, well-thought, well-informed, etc. about politics, so I’m quite confident it would work, despite politics as a topic, as you all probably know, to talk about is such a pain in the ass. I even thought, if this goes well enough, I can use it to later pursue a career of becoming a professional political journalist/commentator/analyst.

And it even went off to a great start. My first articles are generally well-received, and more and more people pay attention to my blog. And that’s where my over self-confidence kills me. It was in August, I wrote a new article concerning my own opinion about an issue in my local area and let’s just say that my opinion was wrong and really controversial. (The reason was that I made my points by using unreliable sources or one can call it “fake news”) It resulted in an outcry where many have commented bad things and insulted me personally, called me an a-hole, etc. 

Needless to say, I was shocked af. Tbf since it was all on me I didn’t (and couldn’t) blame anyone. I admitted my mistake, have edited the post and the content in it by using more reliable sources and made a public apology. The public shaming is then thankfully over. However, the incident has stroked me hard mentally. For days I couldn’t stop thinking about it and feeling incredibly terrible about myself, asking how I can be so stupid and unprofessional, … I began showing signs of depression and have been talking to a therapist recently 

Since the apology I haven’t been writing anything new and suffering hard from writer’s block. Every time I tried writing a new draft I started feeling numb, scared, anxiety and couldn’t think properly. To put it nicely I think I am being too afraid of making mistakes and got bashed online again. I have heard people around me commenting that I’m “such an impatient loser for wanting to quit after one tiny incident” and “if you are that easy to quit, then you will fail with everything else you do as well”. Look, think what you want to think, it maybe “only” one incident but it has drained me hard psychologically and I felt like I have lost all joys in writing. I’m not even paid for this, I do it only out of hobbies. And while I do like politics, becoming a political commentator is not my only interest, I am totally fine with choosing another career that grants me a much more peaceful life (hell even pays more).

Now regarding this issue, there are two things I need advice:  
 1. Am I truly a “loser” or “impatience” for being that scared wanting to quit, like, after one incident? Like my point here is not whether I should continue writing, it is about whether I’m having the right attitude about this.

2. I have been feeling annoyed and stressed every time I use FB since the incident. I every time I log in I have to see my page (obvs since I’m the admin) and therefore I got “reminded” of the incident. Kinda hard to describe, but it felt like living in the same house with your ex, you saw her daily and it just felt unable to move on. I have been thinking about deleting the blog, but many advise against it since some of my old articles were good, they have value and should stay so “many more can read it in the future”. Should I comply?

Last week I lost my first real job after graduating college. I was honestly relieved after getting this news from my manager since the job was causing me so much stress and anxiety. Since I lost my job I’ve been staying at home with my siblings and parents. I feel kind of lost now at what to do. I’ve been looking up jobs, but I haven’t found any that I’m really interested in. Nothing I can get excited about applying for.

I had everything planned out before like get job, pay off student loans, get my own apartment, etc. Now I’m not so sure what to do. I know what I would want to do though. I would want to take a TEFL course and teach English in another country for a year. I have $6,000 saved up from my job so it would be possible to do.

663,"Hey y'all! I was wondering if I could get some advice to help with my current situation. So I \[16F\] repeat mistakes that I know my parents will get mad at me for. An example is with missing and late work for school. Every time a mid quarter progress report comes out, I'm usually missing a multitude of assignments, and every time my parents will be (rightfuly) upset with me. They'll usually yell about it, mainly out of frustration, ground me, take my phone away, and will have me email my teachers to let them know I will be making up those assignments. The problem isn't the punishment, but rather why I keep repeating the same mistake. I know my parents will be upset and I know I'll get in trouble, but I still have missing work. I don't know why I keep doing this, I always know how things will end. I feel ashamed and upset with myself, and upset for wasting my parents' time with this issue.

I like travelling and he doesn't know I travel as I haven't told him plus he isn't on social media so can't see my photos.

My mom is very narcissistic. My sister and I slowed down communication with our mom because she can say and do very cruel things.

She has “tried” to commit suicide and I quote it because I honestly believe many have just been for attention. When I was in elementary school she drank two bottles of wine and tied a metal hanger around her neck after fighting w her boyfriend.

After this event she would constantly threaten suicide if anyone ever disagreed w her etc. This is a very short summary of many evil events.

669,"I don't even know what to say

I feel like I want to say everything but can't find the words, just disparate ideas

What if I'm gay? I'm not, but I guess I'm bi. I don't mind the attraction. But I hate the label. I hate everyone else. Not that anyone has to abide by a label, but that won't stop people from labeling you and treating you differently. 

I'm theoretically in therapy. Have my second appointment tomorrow. The first one that's supposedly supposed to be an actual conversation. I don't know. I don't know how to talk about myself. 

I'm anxious over everything, but somehow having a lack of worry for anything or drive to do anything. I can't make myself do anything productive. I just drink booze most of the time, and smoke weed when I can get it, I prefer it and it's far better for my body but I'm in a backwards illegal state. 

I don't plan on fucking anyone so my sexuality is irrelevant except for how it dictates and effects my behavior and how others perceive me. I'm an ugly dude, lol. I'm the kind of guy everyone forgets. Although I guess that's good for me. 

I have so many memories of me being horribly cringey or awkward that I can keep myself warm in an avalanche. I get along with people fine generally, that's good. I can talk to people because I know how to smile and nod while being somewhat socially smooth in small talk. Cool I guess. Most people I've met in real life are cool if you treat them well. Although many people online suck lol. But that's probably also my fault. 

I hate myself, I hate what I think of other people, but I also often hate other people. I look down on them even though others would only have reasons to look down on me. 

I live in what feels like a prison. I have no idea how to better myself. I spend money on booze that I shouldn't spend at all, it feels like I can't stop. I hate living with my family, I don't get along with them and go out of my way to avoid them in a small house. My sister won't speak to me or acknowledge my existence, but she'll complain to my mom if she hears or sees anything she doesn't like, and she lives on the other side of a thin wall from me so I can't even speak in my own room without filtering it first. I can't believe that I'm an adult and dealing with this shit. 

I hate everything about me except for being egotistically impressed with my own thoughts and the cynical way I look at life and make humor out of things. I don't know. My entire life I've been the opposite of an effective person. I'm terrified of every bad possibility that could happen to me. If I encounter any major expense than my life is effectively over. I can't even get the money to buy a gun as an insurance policy to exit life. Reddit isn't even a good escape from life. Honestly it mostly sucks on this website, but I don't know what else to do. 

I wish I was someone else, born in another place, to another family, in another body. But I would want to retain my memory and experience so I can remember what I used to be like, and what I've learned about life and people. 

You know, I jerk off to some drawn male porn that no one would want to admit to looking at, including me. But obviously a lot of people consume it. Sort of funny. People want to avoid certain labels at all costs, because some labels that don't involve hurting anyone else are still seen as justified reasons to make someone a pariah. 

This is gonna get buried, no one or barely anyone will respond. No one will read this whole thing. I don't blame anyone. This is long and without any point. I'm just so tired of life. So tired of myself. So tired of having my vices. Pretty sure my body is breaking down from all the booze. I have a very addictive personality. 

I don't care to maintain friendships generally, but I hate being alone, even though it's functionally what I prefer and what I almost always choose. I guess I value jerking off whenever I want than I value human interaction.

How can I make superiors and colleagues see me as an equal?

Trouble is, I didn’t think these actions through fully, and so am only now finding that i’m unsatisfied with living here. I’m currently unemployed because of COVID though was in a job just a week ago that I lost due to the second lockdown (UK). I cannot budget effectively to make any savings because all that’s available are low paid jobs- my rent is about £500 per month, without taking into account living expenses. I cannot get an internship either as this will not pay enough- I am possibly planning to go into further education, but I can’t afford to save for this either. 

I feel effectively that whilst my friend has a future here, there is no future for me. He’s got some savings and also student loan whilst i have no savings and as of right now no job.

I don’t want to tell my friend i’m moving now because I want him to enjoy this period in which he’s not upset, and I don’t want to spoil it. At the same time, a bit of me thinks he may be able to handle it better in this mindset.

677,"Hey there, I never thought I would ever be writing this post but here we are. 
I'll try to keep it as short as possible. 
I (M17) have been friends with this absolutley sweet girl (F16) for more than two and a half years. 
We are basically online friends but we live pretty close (about 20-25 minute commute).
We never got the chance to meet each other for most of the time we've been friends but we did somehow meet about two weeks back. 
It wasn't something special becasue we were feeling really awkward (we both struggle with anxiety) and there was a cousin of hers and her friends. 
But for the past few days after we met, she started being really rude to me and unintrested (I know this will immediately make you think that she didn't like me in person and well that may really be the case but there's more to the story) in talking citing reasons that I have been seeking too much attention and reassurance and have started being a self centered bitch (which I accept I am because I'm struggling with depression and anxiety, btw I am already seeking professional help).
And when I've finally started to understand what's wrong with me and willing to change myself for the better, she's started to push me away and break our friendship. 
She's also started to block me on whatsapp and two of my instagram accounts (I have multiple because I'm wierd). 
Now, the catch here is, we aren't just normal friends, we're best friends. And best friends in the sense that everyone in our online community (yes we have an instagram community, if normal people don't have instagram communities) thinks that either we are dating or we should. And to be honest it's correct, we've talked about dating and haven't really reached a decision and now this fallout. 
Honestly, I accept that I've been a really bad friend but I am trying to change and I believe I deserve a chance. 
And I really do love her so much and care about her so much, and she knows that. I'd do anything for my friends and especially for her. 
She does really love me too and she cares about me too but now that she isn't talking to me I feel really bad and anxious. 
Is there a way I could make her understand? 
Because I'd do anything in my power to save our friendship.

About a week ago we are going to bed and she rolls around for 15 min then just shoots up and leaves and shuts the door behind her without saying a word so I assume she went to the bathroom and try and go back to sleep. I wake up like two hours later and she’s not back so I go look and she’s sleeping on the couch. I ask her why and she says “idk I couldn’t fall asleep in there”.... so I try and ask why and she just says it’s fine I’ll go back now that I’m relaxed more and she comes back so I don’t think anything of it.

Like 3 nights later same thing, I’m dozing off just fine and all of a sudden she shoots up and is gone for like 15 min so I’m curious and look and she’s left without saying anything and is sleeping in our spare room. I admit that our mattress is needing replaced and pretty old and the one in the spare room is newer so I assume it’s innocent and ask if she’s ok and she’s like why do you ask, I’m fine just couldn’t sleep in there. I just say ok and went back to bed. The next day I ask her why she is sleeping elsewhere so much and she tells me that she just can’t get comfortable on the bed and wants to get a new one. Okay no problem so I say we could go look at beds after work later in the week and she seems excited and agrees. So we go yesterday and I’m not too picky so I let her try them all and she ends up really liking this $1500 mattress but I say hey my backs been hurting too, I make good money let’s get a nice bed and we get it. We’re both happy and I spend like 2 hours pulling the old one out and setting up the new one. Bed time comes and we excitedly go to lay down. She mentions again how it’s nice. But then asks if I can move the dog so she can stretch out so I do. She asks if I can adjust the heater so I do. She asked me to turn my phone over because the light from notifications were keeping her up so I do. I do everything she asks and again like 15 minutes of silence goes by and she says “maybe it’s not the bed maybe it’s you” and I’m like what??? And she’s all “kiddinggggg” and gets up AGAIN and goes to sleep in the spare room. Keep in mind now the spare room bed isn’t nicer and I got everything the way she wanted it in our bed. I text her and ask like wtf I feel hurt that you all of a sudden don’t want to sleep next to me and she insists that it’s been hard for her to sleep in our room and she doesn’t know why hust said nothing is wrong.

This morning it’s bugging me and I worry that she is bugged about something so I ask and she insists that nothing is wrong and comes and lays down with me and asks to cuddle for like 15 min before she has to go to work. Just now she texted from work asking if I was still upset. I want to believe that nothing has changed but I don’t get why she is doing this?

I’m a person who usually respects all opinions and beliefs. As long as you don’t actively undermine my opinions, I won’t undermine yours.

But I find myself having trouble with my own family. I came out as a lesbian to my parents four years ago and they seemed fine with it. With the election happening, it exposed their true colors. I was having a friendly debate with my dad about who he’s voting for (like five days prior to the election), and he said obviously trump. I asked him why cause I was just curious and he explained and I listened ofc and told him my perspective on why I’m voting for Biden.

Now here comes my mom. I ask her why she wants trump re-elected. She straight up says, the purpose of BLM is stupid, homosexuals shouldn’t have marriage rights here, and that abortion should not be an option. I found myself being able to respect my father’s decision to vote for trump, but what the hell mom? To me, those aren’t even political beliefs at that point. You guys can disagree with me, but I believe that to be basic human rights and if someone supports someone who is against those basic human rights, I find it hard to respect them.

And so since she said that till now, there has been an indescribable tension between my mother and I. I told her immediately after she told me that my future is getting married to a woman and she goes “no you’re going to marry a man anyway so it shouldn’t matter” And then I asked her what if she ever couldn’t do something she wanted because of what race she was and she goes “I would just suck it up and deal with it.”

I guess I’m just asking advice on how to deal with her or just calm down in general because these past few days, she keeps making sure I know that she disagrees with me, more so, disagrees with my sexuality. She also isn’t very educated about how politics/election works so it’s been hard communicating and trying to educate her but we have a slight language barrier. (she thought trump won yesterday and I was trying to explain how we won’t know for a while but she wouldn’t listen to me)

It just baffles me how for four years, I really believed she supported me. And then she also said she would vote for Pence if he ever runs and I’m here trying to calm down. Thank god headphones exist. I just need some type of advice to not lose my anger with her.",04Nov2020,1

And that’s on top of the stuff I’ve overheard my mom talk about. My mom married him at 18 after she got pregnant with me. Then shortly after filed for divorce. It was messy, but afterwards she eventually got custody of me and he only had visitation. Then she fought to have sole custody and won. 

Now I’m 17, and I have a mom and a dad. My mom’s second husband adopted me when I was six/seven and he’s been my dad ever since. I’ve recently talked to my mom and my bio was brought up. My mom decided that she should probably tell me now that she pretty much guarantees the bio is going to reach out to me when I turn 18. After no contact for 13 years. She says that he believes I’ve been brainwashed against him and that when I turn 18 I’ll be able to make my own decisions about things. So pretty much he wants to tell his side of the story. 

Initially my first response was that I want nothing to do with him. I’m happy where I am and with my family. My half-siblings don’t even know that we don’t have the same bio dad. I’ve never once felt like an outsider; 99.9% or the time I don’t even remember that this whole situation is a thing. I’m just a normal girl with a normal family. 

But then after some thought I kind of want to meet him? Maybe? I feel really guilty for it. I mean I still have no desire for him to be in my life. But he is the guy that gave me half my genetics. It’d be nice to know more about him seeing as also at every genetic trait I like about myself came from him. I got my body type from him, my eyes, my smarts. Literally three of my best qualities. He did give me stupid hair though. And tbh I do kind of want to here what he has to say even though I know they’ll probably be twisted truths or lies. 

Does anyone have any thought on this? Is there a right or wrong answer? Why do I feel so guilty for even contemplating meeting him?",04Nov2020,1
686,"So, sorry if this a little TMI, but I(f18) have some trouble with sex. Ive never been able to get out of my head long enough to enjoy it. Like, im always worried about how I look, sound, taste, etc. I sometimes find myself wondering when it'll be over instead of focusing on my own pleasure. And some people have said that it could be because im intimate with the wrong guys but I dont think so. I loved my (now ex) boyfriend very much and trusted him with my body but I still had the same issue. My sex drive isn't a problem either, in fact its very high.. How do I get over myself and just relax and enjoy it?",04Nov2020,1
687,"Hello all, I am planning on buying a new TV before my ps5 arrives because my current TV is about 5 years old and doesn’t have 4K. I don’t have the money to get the absolute top of the line stuff, but looking to spend around $500-600. 

I’ve been doing research to the best of my ability but I am pretty clueless when it comes to this stuff. Would really love some opinions and pointers in which way to go. 

[This](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-X800H-49-Inch-Compatibility/dp/B083R2VJSP) was the first one I really liked seeing as its Sony too and seems to have a really great picture.

[This](https://www.amazon.com/LG-49NANO85UNA-Alexa-Built-Nanocell/dp/B0829RXX2F) one caught my eye later on because it runs 120hz and has the HDMI 2.1 ports for a pretty reasonable price. Not sure what the sony does better but am leaning this one currently ..

Lastly, [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/SAMSUNG-50-Class-4K-Ultra-HD-2160P-HDR-Smart-QLED-TV-QN50Q60T-2020/932218890) was recommend to me by a Walmart employee while I was browsing around earlier today. Only one of the bunch to have QLED and he said specifically it was good for gaming. 

I’m stuck here and would love some input so I can have the best experience.. thanks in advance :)",04Nov2020,1

690,My friends created a group chat a few months ago and everything started out fine. There was one person I didn't know but I've gotten to know them better. At first it was planning what we could all do together and then we were going to get matching pajamas and then it started going weird. They were constantly saying and sending very inappropriate things. I don't want to sound prude or anything but my parents check my phone and if they found that stuff I would most likely never see my phone again.  The final straw was when I told them I wasn't going to open a video they sent and they started calling me names and saying I had to grow up and deal with it. I left the group chat but these people were/are my best friends. I don't know what to do.

i always
- disinfect every pen in my pencil case and every textbook when i come home from school
- sanitize my hands before putting my pyjamas on because i touched my uniform
- avoid sitting at my desk or on the sofa with clothes ive been out in
- wash my masks after wearing them for one day (even if i just went to the shops for 10 minutes or something)
- wash/wipe everything when comes back from the shop (fruit, bread, tins, etc.)

693,"My boyfriend and I have been together 4 months and I’ve honestly never been through a crazier rollercoaster of emotions. When we first met, I almost immediately started catching feelings and then I told myself to calm down before jumping in to anything and doing that may have been my downfall but also my saving grace? We went on a first date after a week and became official another week later, and yes I know that was way too quick and I honestly didn’t want to get into something exclusive so fast but it’s also very difficult for me to say no. Plus I was still feeling us out and didn’t want to turn down a guy that seemed like he had a lot of great qualities that matched my values. One thing that turned me off from the start was how often he’d smoke oui’d when we were hanging out because it made me feel like either I just wasn’t entertaining enough for him to hang with unless he was high, or he was the kind of person who couldn’t enjoy anything sober. Pretty soon he started drinking more often too and it seemed like it was just for fun but I soon realized it was both for fun as well as to escape his reality of emotions and problems. Then, even sooner it turned into the only coping mechanism he knew to be effective. About a month into our relationship he had a heart attack while driving (won’t disclose our ages but he is WAY too young to be having one btw) and his doctor said he had extreme levels of stress that he needed to manage otherwise it would literally kill him. He told me he was going to see a psychiatrist and therapist soon but never did since he couldn’t afford to and went on to drink even more frequently. I ended up getting mad at him for driving while cross-faded and he promised to never do it again and to stop drinking. Surprise, he did it again and drank two days later. Some time after finding that out, he promised to at least never drink before driving. And again about a week later, ‘it wasn’t even a lot, I’m perfectly fine to drive, my boys needed me’. I asked him about 2 months in why he made promises that he doesn’t keep and he couldn’t give me an answer. He literally just said ‘you got me there’ (though not in a joking manner, he was upset). A couple weeks later, he promised his family to stop drinking. Didn’t last 48 hours. I soon asked him if he’d ever stop smoking and drinking (he also smokes nicotine) and he explained that he’d eventually stop drinking, the nicotine would take longer but he hoped to someday quit but that oui’d would probably stay because he has ADHD so it helps him. Around the 2 month mark, he basically got kicked out and so he lived with me for about a month and half and had been sleeping over almost every night before that anyway. But he never asked or anything, he just kind of assumed it was ok and would say ‘What should we make for dinner tonight?’ And ask me to drive him to his house to pick up clothes (did I mention his truck got towed 3 times in 2 months and 2 of those times he got arrested and now he can’t drive it again for a year). Then I let him drive my mom’s car (the only vehicle available) a couple times and suddenly he was making plans to go to the dispensary on his own, to meet up with friends, to go see his family and never asked but simply TOLD me his plans as if it was his car to drive whenever and wherever he wanted until I explained that that wasn’t ok. My mom almost kicked him out when she saw his bong in the bathroom cabinet because we have an impressionable 14 year old here but I told her he’d be gone by Oct 15th and she let him stay. She was also angry that he just started living here without any sort of consultation with her but I didn’t get to explain that I, myself never even okayed that with him. He moved into his dad’s new house until he finds an apartment now and he still wants me there every night or wants to be here every night despite his parents and mine saying they don’t like it and that ‘we’ have separation issues. I’ve legitimately only had a total of 2, maybe 3 days in the past almost five months where I didn’t see him at all. No exaggeration. And although I enjoy our time together, some alone time wouldn’t kill us. There was a very long period (maybe 2 and a half months?) where it felt like I couldn’t go a day without crying because we argued or he said something that he didn’t know would hurt me. We always resolved it but it was draining going through everyday wondering when it would come. Nowadays I don’t cry much but I just get annoyed or angry easily. Mostly because he doesn’t understand when I’m not joking, like when I tell him I’m tired or just not in the mood, he won’t stop trying or he’ll keep touching me where I tell him not to until I get visibly angry and he apologizes and feels bad then I have to comfort HIM. I’d say about 80% of the time when we have sex it’s because he wants to and most of the time I get nothing out of it besides knowing he’s happy. I forgot to mention that he also has anger issues and like 2 days before he moved out of my place, he stepped on his laptop charger and started bleeding a little so he went out the front door, punched the wall three times, screamed F*CK at the top of his lungs multiple times then slammed the door shut. At 3 a.m... Then got mad that I was mad at him for doing that. Now just to add the icing to the cake (thought this isn’t even everything) the entirety of our relationship, there have been two girls from his past that were trying to take him from me and now it’s just the one, who showed up to our workplace then his best friend’s house and called him about a week ago asking if he was single. My intention wasn’t to come here and just bash him because he’s done a lot to help me out like putting gas in the car or food in my stomach when I didn’t have the funds and through all of this, he’s shown me so many new things and made me realize I deserve to be shown as much love as I give and this is his first relationship with real emotions so I just know his love for me is so pure (which must also be why he was so sure that he’s in love with me when we haven’t been together very long). But at the same time, it is so far beyond exhausting being someone’s rock and source of peace when they are not yours. In fact, pretty much our entire relationship I’ve questioned my feelings for him because I do care about him more than most and I would be upset if we broke up and I would be jealous if he was with someone else and he does bring me happiness.......but as soon as I sensed the first red flag, I pretty much knew I was never gonna have those strong feelings for him that are the cause of the honeymoon phase because I never went through it with him. He did though. I also find myself looking at other people and finding them attractive and wanting to talk to them (I’d never cheat, just to be clear) which was not my experience In my last relationship when I was head over heels for that guy, he was the only one on my radar. If we were to break up, I definitely wouldn’t want to leave his side because I wouldn’t mind being his rock still as long as I didn’t feel obligated to be it and he’s told me that he’d always be here for me if that were to happen, but I’m pretty sure if we did he’d want some space because I know how hard it is to see that person after the breakup. I’m also afraid his drinking will worsen if we do and he’s had a very very hard life, probably the worst out of everyone I’ve ever known so it only makes sense that he has all these issues and he’s made it clear that he not only doesn’t fear death but desires it. So I’m almost 99% sure that if we broke up and he got himself (again) into a position of being near death he would do absolutely nothing to stop it. I just don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t see a good ending wether we stay together or not. Someone please tell me what to do",04Nov2020,1

I’m not the one to ask for advice but I’m kinda lost. I don’t wanna bore anyone with long stories but basically I’m 19 and living back at my abusive home. My father has a lot of mental health issues but he’s mainly narcissistic and very mentally abusive (Idek if that’s the right term I’m kinda learning this as I live lmao) I have a recording of an argument from a night when he kicked me out and he incriminates himself ALOT. My main question is this, should I show older more professional adults the tape or should I just leave and let him rot? I understand that may be harsh but he has 0 empathy for my depression, anxiety, or hardships in life going as far as to suggest we both end our lives. He’s been doing that since I was 15 and I’m tired of it. The tape also exposes how he basically enables and started my addiction to marijuana. Any advice is welcome but I’m mainly asking...

699,"Backstory:

I (19M) have decided to finally have a conversation with my father who had cheated on my mother for many years, beaten my brother and I as children and just gave everyone in my family an extremely hard time during the 3 year divorce (controlling mobility out of country becuase we were younger etc). He is truly a deceitful prick from what I remember, coming from me that says a lot because I was the clear favourite out of all his kids (another reason why I don't respect him). He now has a brand new family (with the woman he used to cheat) with new children and all.

I need some advice here, I've been writing rough copies of what I want to say and predicting his responses so I don't get overwhelmed. I want to know HOW and WHY he did the what he did, without any emotional bullcrap on his END. I also want to make sure my emotions don't force me to make a mistake that will effect the rest of my life.  Overall I'm seeing this as a research project... Probably because of what I'm learning in school that's how my brain works. I only want facts in order to formulate my opinion on whether I want him in my life in the future, I'm not an emotional guy at all, I don't care how he felt or feels, I just don't want to look back in 10 years and call myself stupid for missing an opportunity or getting blindsided.

When I was old enough to realize what was going on I cut him put of my life completely for a good 10+ years but about 3 years ago my boyfriend was having some car issues and neither of us could afford to fix it so I ended up reaching out to my dad because he owns a garage and I was hoping he would at least be reasonable price wise. We started to rekindle our relationship after that and he seemed to be trying a lot more to be there and ngl I got excited at the idea of having my dad in my life again. He would still do some flaky shit but nothing compared to what it used to be so I just ignored it.

I shit post a lot on Facebook so maybe I posted something that upset him but Im not sure why he wouldn't talk to me about it instead of just blocking me.

708,"My landlord has completely stopped answering emails about getting a plumber to change the faucet sink that has been continuously leaking water for over a month now. He's always been really slow/inefficient at getting things fixed around the house, but usually he only ignores the smaller/upkeep requests and the major issues eventually get addressed. This faucet does not turn off all the way anymore, so there is a lot of water pouring through 24/7, and he's the one footing the water bill, so I don't understand why he's playing dead. 

He arranged for a plumber to come check it out three times already, and every time the plumber came, looked at it, and said the faucet just needs to be replaced. But when they try to reach him to get his green light to replace it, he doesn't pick up the phone. The house is under contract with them so they cannot do anything without the landlord's approval. The next two times he sent a plumber, he only told them to ""check the drains,"" so they come in, check the drain, conclude the problem is the faucet that needs to be replaced, try to call him, leave a message, anddd all over again. I've sent so many follow-up emails, but he completely stopped answering two weeks ago. 

Is there something else I should do or should I just give up at this point? I'm worried the problem will just become bigger if not fixed.

711,"Hear me out it wasn’t a typical first date or anything...

*Skip This (until ‘to the case’) if you don’t want to go in-depth:*

So, i matched through tinder with this girl i found very cute. We hit it off pretty quickly and we added each other on snap. She asked me what i was looking for, and i told her i take it as it is, i’m Open for any sort of stuff,: friends, fwb, relationship... you name it. In general, i’m pretty large with that kinda stuff. So yeah, she told me that she got out of a 3 year old relationship at the very start of the year, and still didn’t feel like finding a partner. Totally fine with me. 

I ask her if she want to hang at my place and get something to eat, which she agreed to. She lives pretty far from me, so i was kind of surprised she would take such a long way, to meet me for the first time, it was her idea that we met at either my place or somewhere in between us, as her father doesn’t like guys he doesn’t already know lmao. 

After a month texting each other, there she was. 6 pm at my place (This saturday). We made it super casual and got us a family pizza we could share. We had a great time and though it would be fun if we played (in my country, very typical primary School game) truth or dare i guess it is called in english. She asked me why i swiped on her and i told her ofc she’s good looking etc. And she told me i looked way better IRL, which i hope she meant lol.

But later on, i ask her - since we were drinking Wine - what was gonna happen when the bottle’s empty? And she thought we could watch a horror movie since it’s halloween. Great i think, and it that point i know she’s probably gonna stay the Night. 

We watch it in my bed, and i didn’t really get the vibes that she wanted to do anything so i just kept my cool and tried to have a nice time without all that. Then suddenly while Holding hands, she takes my hand to her breast, and squeeze Them with both our hands. Ok so she wanted to anyway lol... so yeah we had sex ofc. My last few sex partners i’ve had such trouble cumming, so i thought i would last long but hell no she took my totally off guard when she gave me the best head i’ve *ever* had. I didn’t cum there but i knew i wouldn’t last later on, which i didn’t, it was too good. So i ofc helped her as Well after that, and we went to sleep. I told her how much off guard it took me and we laughed a bit about that, but i just wanted to tell her how nice it was.

She asked me how many sex partners i’ve had, and i Said i’m not sure but ~20, might be more now. She Said i’m 4th. So i felt like it might had meant i was a bit special idk.

*TO THE CASE*

We slept, cuddled and talked until she got picked up by someone at like 1 pm next Day. I think we’d a blast which i texted her just after she left, she Said she had too and how awful the movie was, which it really was lol.

Well, we texted just a bit more that day (sunday), about next time we find a better movie and bla bla bla... and that’s the last time i’ve heard from her. Tbh i didn’t ask anything about when or tried to be pushy og anything, so idk why she suddenly wouldn’t.

I sometimes just sent snaps to all my friends at once, something like good Night folks/-morning, me doing something og whatever. She used to answer or comment on it, but she doesn’t even respond on that. 

Absolutely nothing... what could i’ve done? Idk if it’s just me, since i think it just went from texting a lot to nothing out of nowhere. Is it me being impatient, or her not wanting to Seem ‘to interested’? I dont get it tbh, i know i don’t want anything serious with her, but i still Think she’s a nice person. This is just weird to me rn.

713,"So earlier this year my friend (23 M) invited me to his wedding, it was going to be on September but he chose to move it to March 2021 due to covid. Everything was right and i(25 M) made plans to mark the day; 2 weeks ago he called me to invite me to his wedding (this weekend), he said since it was just the civil  wedding (not the religious one) they were only inviting a few people to it; he even told me that i could stay in his house or that he could book a hotel room for me,  so i said i was flattered to receive an invite a that i would go.

So here's my dilemma :

I can go to the wedding try to maintain distance from other guests and then isolate myself for two weeks or more if necessary, i really don't want to do this because of the pandemic and because i live with both my parents (60 and 61) also because i have an appointment on the end of November and if i don't go i would have to wait till next year due to the closed agenda, a.

The other option i was contemplating is, to call him and tell him that im just going to the act and stay for photos, give him a good bottle of wine (im planing to paint a portrait of my friend and his fiancé and maybe give him something else if im in a good place financially) and then leave not staying for dinner or anything else. The issue is that i don't know how to tell my friend this in way that he won't think that i don't care about his wedding or him; I've known him for 12 yeas, even though we only saw each other once in the last 5 years i really appreciate him.

So, do you have any advice?",04Nov2020,1

Weekend, I've talked to him about it and told him that I didn't want strangers coming into our house, making a mess and potentially stealing stuff from our apartment, He said he didn't care what I said, I've already spoken to the apartment's office, and they said to try to talk it out with him first.

718,"I just noticed that lately I’ve been getting unbelievably mad at the smallest things. Like a noise on the tv, or someone talking too loud in the grocery store, or Amazon losing my package, or stores prices on certain items! Like not upset in my head, I mean physically MAD. Cursing under my breath, red faced, veiny forehead... MAD. And I believe it’s starting to ruin my relationship with my gf of almost 2 years. 

When we first started talking back in November  of 2018 I was living in GA and a single 21 year old bachelor. I wasn’t hardly ever upset at anyone for any reason. And I’m typically a level headed person, except for lately. Now I would never lay hands on my gf or anyone else for that matter, so I’m not totally out of control with anger. But I’ve started to notice things that she does, that in the past I loved doing (FaceTime, phone calls, car rides, hand holding, pillow talking, etc.) have now started to annoy me instantly. Like as soon as I see her picture pop up for FaceTime, or a phone call. I can feel my blood pressure rising! I answer it because I know she likes to talk to me after work and such. And I use to not have a problem with this. I use to LOVE hearing about her day. But now all I can think in my head is “What does she WANT!?” And from then on out for the next 2 hours I’m annoyed at everything. When we’re sitting on the couch watching tv I will start to feel angry out of nowhere and won’t laugh and funny moments on the tv, or react in an appropriate way to a question she asks me. So she can obviously tell I’m upset. And I want to tell her why I’m upset but, hell, idek why I’m upset. 

I don’t want this to impact my relationship in the long term. I know it has already put a dent on our immediate relationship, but I know she loves me and only want me to get better, but I don’t know how?

I do know that I love her like I have never loved anyone else. I can confined in her and tell her my deepest secrets with no issues. She helps hold my life together and I don’t know what I would do without her! One day soon I do plan on marrying her, but I don’t want to put her through this any longer! I don’t want her to feel responsible or at fault for how damaged I have become recently. Idk what to do!",04Nov2020,1

724,"Okay so basically I have a guy friend, we’ll call him John. So john and I have a lot of mutual friends and we met each other (online) a couple of months ago. 2 weeks ago we found a game that we both really enjoy playing together and we began playing and talking every single day.

A regular day for us would be, either of us would text each other in the morning and we would send a couple of text messages throughout the day. And then after school, we would facetime while doing our homework and then in the evening, we would play video games for about an hour. 

I think the 2nd week of talking to him I developed a tiny crush on him. We said “imy” a couple of times to each other. And we would randomly call each other “bb” sometimes. And we have both complimented each other on our appearances. We would also poke fun at each other all the time and it was fun. It was never only me just reaching out, it was balanced. 

So on Sunday, I asked him what he thinks about me. And he said “You’re funny and cute” and I thanked him and that was the end of that. And then the next day was normal, we sent memes and had small talk. He called me after school and then we talked for like 2 minutes and then he was just like “someones calling me gtg” and he hasn’t texted me since Tuesday evening and it’s Wednesday. 

So like do you think he’s uninterested? What should I do? I sent him a meme this morning and he hasn’t said anything. And I’m kind of stressing a little bit. So please help :)",04Nov2020,1

727,"I'm a 26 year old male and I've had pretty severe anxiety problems from basically since when I was a baby mostly centered around difficulty dealing with any kind of change and social interaction. They've really improved through maturing and exposure but I still struggle. I find the majority of what mainstream, contemporary psychology has to offer in regards to coping with anxiety to be completely useless. I find the whole ""mindfulness"" approach to be infuriatingly unhelpful and yet every single therapist or counselor I've attempted to get help from totally believes it is the only real way to deal with stress and refuses to use any other kind of technique. It could be partly due to me not really being able to afford therapy and going with cheaper student counselors going through their practicum. I also have not found exercise to be helpful when it comes to coping with stress and nor have I  found ""breathing exercises"" to be useful. In general when it comes to current pop. psychology I find it all to be very trite, and everything seems to be aimed at very superficial, generalized, one-size-fits-all approaches aimed at helping people cope with a broad, vague feeling of uneasiness rather than acute and situation specific anxiety. Several years ago I briefly had a therapist who did genuinely help me who was from another country (Scotland) and who had an entirely different approach from what I'm used to (I live in Canada). She did exposure therapy with me and actually physically went out with me into situations that bring on my anxiety and even though I was only with her for about half a year she has permanently fixed several issues I had. All of these myriad approaches that are currently so in vogue right now which attempt to get you to focus on something else, ignore your anxiety, or in some way deal with your anxiety in a round-about way have not worked for me. It does not help my anxiety in the least to \~meditate\~ or try to take my mind off of what is bothering me if I still have to wake up the next morning and deal with it. What actually helped me was dealing with the situation and moving on from it.  However, I can't seem deal with situations very well by myself. When I'm in the moment I deal with them quite well and when they are over with I feel relieved but I avoid them like mad and it seems nearly impossible to motivate myself to do things sometimes.  I feel like if I had had a longer time with her I would be in a much better place now, but since then I have not been able to find anyone like her. I have huge anxiety around driving a car and huge anxiety around working and getting a job and I have large issues around trusting people and becoming close to them. I'm looking for ways to deal with my stress that don't involve mindfulness, that don't involve deep breathing or meditation, that don't involve exercise.  I know they are out there but whenever I look up ways to cope on my own that's all that you are blasted with, they keep trying to shove crap like yoga down your throat at every turn.

I've hit a lull in my semester where, as long as I do all my work at a reasonable pace, I should be fine for weeks to come. but I'm still so damn tired, as if dealing with reality takes up a huge amount of energy and there's absolutely no escape except for sleeping, kinda. but even then, I'm not conscious for that escape.

734,"So I’m not exactly sure on how I should start this off but the title pretty much says it all, my parents are the filthiest people I know and they make me absolutely miserable because of it. I’m currently too young to move out on my own and I’m not sure what to do, living in this house makes me cry almost every other day because of it’s condition, this is super embarrassing but our house has had a really bad roach problem since we moved in (13 years ago) and over time it’s gotten worse there are at least 4 different types (I didn’t even know that a bug problem could be this bad until I saw it myself) including white ones which I see every now and again and it makes me want to vomit every time I see it and has even caused me to have a panic attack (it was a nest.) I also got really depressed over the summer due to some other major things in my life and the bugs didn’t help, it actually contributed to my eating disorder, it got so bad that I could go a whole week without eating shit and actually did many times due to my kitchen being bug ridden, every time I went to get something to eat and I saw a bug I immediately lost my appetite. It also doesn’t help that my parents live across the hall from me and oh boy, Their room is comparable to an alleyway. My parents don’t clean like at all, (they have a dog that they don’t take care of because at one point it was my dog so according to them even if I have another dog and gave their current dog to my mom it’s still mine and I’m expecting to take care of it on top of all the other shit I have to do) the dog constantly pee’s and shits on the floor it’s disgusting (i even step into sometimes because I can’t see it) they have a mini kitchen in their room they they never clean up, hot sauce bottles and ranch covers their dresser which is meant for clothes and a dirty mini fridge that they never clean and even a fucking mini potty that my mom bought when she broke her leg and couldn’t go to the bathroom. (we live in a 4 story house and the bathroom is far) she broke her leg about 5 years ago so her lazy ass doesn’t need it anymore and my father never needed it, but the worst part is their carpet, it’s black and hard due to that disgusting toilet falling over on multiple occasions and not being properly cleaned ON TOP of 4 different breeds of roaches living in their room. This is extremely frustrating to deal with especially since I try so hard to keep my room clean and it seems like it’s always in vain because of their room and they leave dirty dishes in the hallway directly in front of my room whist I’m sleeping so I can take them down in the morning, absolutely no consideration or respect for me. 

Important!!!!
A few weeks ago I had a really bad depression episode I didn’t leave my bed unless it was to pee but since I wasn’t even drinking water that didn’t happen very much, I kept my room clean I just didn’t leave my bed or eat and because I wasn’t cleaning the hallway and dishes were being stacked up outside of my room the bug problem spread to my room and one of them was pregnant (I found the sack after I bug bombed my room) and had a shit ton of “ babies” in my room. It was unbearable so I spent 4 days straight completely gutting my room of all clothes, makeup, electronics anything and everything, whist going to school, exercising and doing my best to keep up my mental health and not kill myself, the bomb kinda worked any bugs it didn’t kill it bought them out so I could kill them and I was satisfied because it was a lot of work I had to do on my own. However today my parents had a refrigerator still in a box that has been in their disgusting room for around 8 months, they basically made me take the refrigerator and not even 5 minutes later after setting it up I fucking roach comes out. I just spent 4 days cleaning my room to the best of my ability so I could bomb it and I’m still sore from that and now they’ve forced me to take a literal nest into my room and I can’t take it out, I’m very frustrated and I don’t know what to do. I realize there might not be a solution to a problem like this but anything would help, I’ve begged and pleaded with my parents for years about cleaning up and hiring an exterminator and they simply won’t, they say they will and to “just have faith in us” but they never do, and I know they have the money to, my mom bought an Apple Watch, $300 chair that she didn’t even take out the package for 4 months, $700 worth of towels, and a bunch of other unnecessary shit but anytime I ask for them to hire an exterminator it’s always about the lack of money they have and how it’s pressure on them, in addition my parents are kind of old and sick so I don’t like to pressure them because it’s bad for their health.

737,"Hi!

It's time for young-adult relationship drama. Enjoy, and please help me :\[\[

I'm part of a sportsteam with members from ages 18 to around 28, and we're all really close - there is however, a tendency to complain A LOT when something doesn't go quite right or isn't exactly how everyone imagined it'd be, and people can be a bit petty. (Which I suppose is normal in elite sports) This is relevant later. Until about five months ago, there were two couples on said team; let's call them Amy and Allan, and Jessica and Joe. Amy and Allan broke up five months ago, and Jessica and Joe split \~four weeks ago. Both couples had been together for a looong time. Five years perhaps. That's context covered, now to the problem; Something is most definitely going on between Amy and Joe. Won't go into detail here, but it's pretty obvious. With Corones everywhere we haven't been on any training camps since this began, but messenger is BOILING with speculations, and people have already began talking about how downright weird it'd be if Amy and Joe go together - as said before: People on this team hold grudges and even though we're all close and enjoy each other's company (I realise all my bashing makes it sound like everyone's pretty shitty, but they're really some of my best friends) it can just be difficult to get back on someone's good side if you've stepped on their toes. People are already starting to pick sides, even though none of the people actually involved has said sh#t about anything. If anything, I've heard less from them than usual. I'm just really worried that this will create an awful environment where everyone has to ""pick a side"". (this has happened before, albeit nothing of this scale) We're such a tight knit group that having no opinion is nearly impossible. I spoke to one from the team this afternoon, and he told me that Allan is pretty pissed that Amy and Joe are seeing each other so much - which he has absolutely no right to be, since he was the one who ended it with Amy, and moving on was hard on her. Also, Jessica is not always Amy's biggest fan and this would definitely add a great big bottle of fuel to that fire. He asked me if I could talk to Joe, since I'm pretty close to him and he's visiting this saturday, and then ask him what's going on. I'm just not sure if I should, since I don't really know how involved I should be in this whole mess. Granted, I'd like to help if I could, but what if Joe tells me there IS something between them; what am I supposed to say? I mean I can't just tell him not to pursue it, that's not my business at all, but at the same time it would do a lot of damage to the structure of the team (which is a national team, so it's pretty darn important that we can talk about stuff and help each other when needed).

What I'd really like advice on is this; should I talk to Joe about it, or mind my own business? And if I ask him, how do I react and what do I advice him to do if he confirms?

I hope you can help.

The MAIN reason why I've made so many positive connections with people is because I've hidden the fact that I'm right-leaning. I've been able to offend no one and instead befriend everyone, no matter their race, gender, sexuality or political views.

After months of comparing and contrasting Joe Biden and Donald Trump, I finally decided that I would vote for Donald Trump, and I did just that yesterday evening.

Today I've been asked multiple times if I voted. When I said yes, a lot of people asked who I voted for. I said I wouldn't share that information and some people left it at that, others pressed for an answer. 

The ones that pressed for an answer said things like ""Haha can I guess? Not Trump right?"" and in the panic of the moment I would just laugh and go ""Haha no who do you think I am?"" which would prompt an answer such as ""Biden for the win! Yeah I could never vote for Trump. I don't even want to be NEAR a Trump voter."" 

So basically, I've lied to multiple people to avoid losing a mass of friends and to avoid my reputation from going down the drain. Oh and also to avoid getting my picture put up on a social media account that publically humiliates and exposes embarassing secrets of people at my high school who voted for Trump.

To put it quite simply, people at my high school do NOT tolerate pro-Trump anything. 

Many people who I care about have posted ""If you support Trump or voted for him, just don't ever talk to me again. Block me on everything.""

My closest friends are all Democrat and while they probably wouldn't stop talking to me or anything like that, I think they would take genuine offense if I told them I voted for Trump. 

I am a little bit stressed out and while I don't regret my vote, I do regret lying to people. On the other hand, I feel really scared that if I do tell people at school that I voted for Trump they'll bully me and the respect people have for me will go down to 0.

Should I tell people the truth?

TLDR; I voted for Trump and lied to people at school to save face. Should I be honest?",04Nov2020,1
744,"So my mom always calls me and I’m the one to answer her. My sister never answer her and my dad has a shitty phone. But he just got a new phone and now I don’t have to go down stairs and tell him to answer the fucking phone. I’m so close with being done with my family. I’m being passed around as a lazy brat but I’m doing the most in the family and I stood up for myself to my parents but they shut me up fast and I still don’t feel bad for standing up. But nothing will change and when I move out I will delete all of my fams numbers. Anyways my mom called me and she said she tried calling my sister and I’m like idk why she didn’t answer cuz she had her phone on her. I’m getting angry cuz she’s literally ignoring the clan and my mom

Won’t stop telling me to tell hers and I’m like call her again and she didn’t answer, my mom kept bitching for me to call her call her call her. Like shit okay????? She’s like a repeating dog barking over and over. I get what she said but I told her to calm down and call my dad then and she’s like he didn’t answer. And I’m more angrier then ever and I yelled at my sister to answer the phone but she said my dad was using HER phone and HIS phone the same time to answer a call. 
And this isn’t my fault cuz my mom wouldn’t stop bitching to me to call them. And I got angry with her repeatedly asking me over and over. 

Like honestly guys, she would not stop. And there wasn’t any emergency either. She could’ve approached it a diff way. The thing I hate about my mother is that when there’s multiple ways she can approach something she would take the most annoying, complaining, naggy choice instead of choosing a more...normal one. Idk what’s wrong with my mother but she’s becoming more over controlling by the second and I can’t take it anymore

745,"I’ve known this girl for about a year now and she’s really cool like I vibe with her on a level that I’ve never had with anyone else and for that reason I had liked her for a while and with time I had confessed my feelings and she said she wanted to wait for the summer so if things didn’t work out it wouldn’t be awkward in our classes and I at the time I didn’t think much of it I was okay with it you know I’ve wanted my chance and during summer we talked for a few weeks and I thought it was going great we were hanging out and having fun and I started working so I couldn’t talk as ymuch but she was also working so it was fine I think, but soon after she tells me about these guys she’s working with and how she had a crush on one of them for a while which meant while we were talking she was crushing on another dude, which threw me for a loop and I thought that was kinda messed up but we were still really good friends except for the fact that she wasn’t talking to me as often and during that time I had obviously lost feeling like why would I want to date someone who acts like that regardless of how cool she was, but We still wanted to be friends so that’s how it continued, then she got a boyfriend some other guy from her work and she was texting me less and less which I understood that’s what happens when you are with someone all the time I didn’t really care I was fine with it just being over at that point because I couldn’t just stop texting her, there is still a attachment that I can’t get rid of I was there for her when she was down and she did the same for me so like I wouldn’t want to give up a friend like that but at the same time the way she’s been treating me just hasn’t been fair like now she only talks to me when it’s at her Convenience and it’s always about her problems and I don’t wanna be rude and not help out because that’s the person I am but if the only thing you’re talking about is her problems I don’t really want to be a part of it it’s not really friendship but I’ve told you this before and so she changed some things and you know she wanted to be reasonable and talk to me more but then after some time the same thing happened again and now it’s just like it’s always about her and her problems so idk what to do I don’t want to drop her because she is having a lot of problems in life and I don’t want to be selfish and make it seem Like it’s all about me and how she isnt caring enough about me and what I do but like it would be nice to know I’m not just her therapist and stuff, so I’m not really sure what to do in this situation Id hate to leave her but I shouldn’t have to be her therapist should I? That’s what her boyfriend is for. I’ve tried leaving her in read and stuff but she does seem to care and want to talk because she’ll send another message but I just don’t know how to deal with it at this point it’s been over a year and I don’t want to be a fucking therapist, so I guess the question is anyone got any advice or a different perspective I should be having or something?",04Nov2020,1

747,"I started work as a door to door salesman in Florida a few weeks ago and the job has me working until 8 when it gets dark. I’m usually by myself in these neighborhoods until my coworkers come to pick me up. I don’t get to pick which neighborhoods I work in. Some of these neighborhoods have no soliciting signs at the front but apparently the company has a permit which overrides this. However some people in these neighborhoods take this no soliciting rule very seriously. 


Usually most of the people are chill or indifferent but sometimes I run into people who are very aggressive and angry. I made another post on this sub a few days ago about running into a person who threatened to shoot me for being in the neighborhood. I find myself underperforming and being less confident in these “no soliciting” neighborhoods because I’m scared of how people will react.


I’m probably going to search for a better job but stick with this until I find another job, but for now does anyone have suggestions about what I can do to keep safe?

756,"I'm a 17 year old girl, junior in highschool. I feel like since middle school I've been nothing but a disappointment to people. My parents are always ashamed of me because they put me on a high pedestal and I always fail to live up to it. When I was little I was a ""gifted"" kid, but now I'm an unmotivated, depressed, mentally ill teen. I've struggled with depression and ADHD for a very long time (was suspected to have them since 6th grade, was diagnosed freshman year). Learning has always been a struggle, so has managing things emotionally. My parents act like they don't believe in mental illness so they paint me as just being lazy. My sister has the same problems and she's 24, they've done the same thing to her. I took a college level class this year just to please them so they wouldn't think that I was taking the easy way out of highschool..well I'm failing and my mom chewed my ass out over it. 

Finding a job is another big thing too. I've been trying really hard to find one but to them I'm not trying hard enough. I just got grounded for failing a class and not having a job, I texted my boyfriend telling him my mom is taking my phone and he sounded really disappointed in me and I feel god awful about it.

759,"(Please hear me out before you hate me)I\[26F\] was engaged to a guy\[30M\](let's call him guy1) after being together for 3 years(3 beautiful, perfect years) and then I moved to another part of the world last year. With different timezones and life situations, we seemed to be drifting apart and broke up several times. However, we still were emotionally connected and continued to talk to each other constantly. We have had such a deep emotional bond(even inter dependability) that it seems impossible to break up completely. 3 months ago, I met another guy(guy2) and started dating him. While it is still casual, we have decided to stay exclusive. My LDR person and I still talk and I talk as if we are still together, but not in any of the exclusive terms, as in we don't say we love each other or anything. For a while I had let them both know that I am exclusive with both of them, I am not. They don't know each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Guy2 is super nice, and that is not super serious about the relationship, because it has only been 3 months, but it could evolve into something more serious. He doesn't want to have sex for religious reasons. We have a great time together on dates and we care deeply about each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I can't have sex with guy1 because he lives in another country. I started doing this(Giving them both the incorrect understanding that I am there for the both of them exclusively) because I  was not sleeping with anybody(in my mind this is how I justified it and I never expected it to ever go on so far), it was nice to have emotional support from the both of them. BUT I FEEL TERRIBLE constantly. It is not fun. It is not funny and I have let it go on for so long I don't even know how to back out of it. I don't think they will find out about each other, but the fear and the guilt is killing me. I have had such deep, honest conversations with the both of them that I don't even know how to face them and this lie is killing me. This mental rut has made me a terrible and constantly sad person. I wish I could afford therapy. What do I do? Do I break up with both of them? Do I die? Wtf do I do?

767,"TW: suicide
Also, this is long.

K and I had been best friends for 13 years when I stopped talking to her. I didn’t give her a reason, and I’d done that in the past, but let me preface this with why: K is a very depressing, attention seeking individual. I love, I guess loved her with my whole heart, but at the times I stopped talking to her I was going through my own hardships and hearing her do nothing but complain and be depressing and tell me that suicide was the best way out... I couldn’t take it. I was in therapy, and I was getting my life back on track after VERY bad postpartum depression and anxiety. 

Then, K did some things I didn’t think I could forgive. She got pregnant unexpectedly, and wanted an abortion. I supported her fully even though it was very hard for her, she begged me to be there for her and swore to me she would be more careful and she wouldn’t take her child’s life in vain— cut to only two months later and she was pregnant again, after all she had cried about having to sacrifice her child for her own life to go on. 

I don’t want to get into the details, but she basically had sex with someone she only wanted attention from and didn’t use protection because it turns guys on and she loves that attention from them. She has admitted to having sex in exchange for meals from places she likes... just sad things. She swore to me up and down that after her abortion she would use protection and value herself more, but at the end of the day she told me she just wanted the attention more than any of that. 

I am not against abortion, but I don’t think it’s a lighthearted topic to be taken so brazenly and especially since she was truly heartbroken about having to do it the first time, I couldn’t bear to watch it happen again. I stopped talking to her. 

It’s been about three years... and I miss her. How could you not miss someone you grew up with? I think about her all of the time and I regret the way I left but I was really looking out for myself, as I said I was in therapy and constantly having her drag me down and depress me and continue to put herself in the worst situations despite all of my efforts to help (going over constantly, buying her and her child groceries, taking her out to have fun, etc) I couldn’t be around that anymore. I want to hope that she’s changed and that she’d understand, but I know she’s probably just mad at me and has resolved to hate me forever... any advice? 

TLDR: my best friend of 13 years engaged in self destructive behavior, and I cut her off when I was in therapy and dealing with my own problems because she refused to change and would constantly depress me and suggest suicide. I want to reach out but I think she might hate me.",04Nov2020,1

I'm trying to act advanced. And no one questions it, yet I'm constantly, fastidiously doubting it, because I know that isn't me.

I say I don't care about my appearance. Other than brushing my hair and showering, I don't care for my appearance at all. Because the ways I want to appear aren't possible, as I don't have the resources to actualize them.

I'm a 14-year-old boy. I have curly, brown hair, an incredibly hairy body, and I'm overweight. I have large hands, a large nose, a small mouth, and facial hair. I hate how I look.

I want to be clean-shaven. I want to be curvy. I want a plump butt, vagina, and breasts. I want long, black flowing hair. I want Asian skin. I don't wear to wear boys clothes. I wanna wear dresses, leggings, makeup, Converse shoes, Vans, heels, boots, skinny jeans, overalls, sweaters, crop tops, makeup, and jewelry.

I hate trying to be who people expect me to be. I'm supposed to be a teenage intellectual, I'm expected to be a rhetorical prodigy. Everyone wants me to be fucking Einstein. I can't take it. I just wanna be a kid. I just wanna have fun.

But they'd never allow that. It would scare them. I was once watching an episode of Adventure Time, and my dad looked at me in bemusement: ""How do you go from Schopenhauer to this?""

People's expectations of me have robbed me of my childhood. All I want in life are the things I never enjoyed as a child: Hopper balls, cartoons, plushies, bounce houses, toys, video games, etc. I just wanna have fun.

Yeah, I'll hold a job, pay taxes, own my own home, of course. But all I want is to take the steps necessary to recreate the childhood I lost to high expectations and a fucking pandemic and be at peace with my body through transitioning and cosmetic surgery.

I feel dirty and disappointing. Everyone in my life expects me to become the author the next Plato's Symposoum, everyone wants me to unlock the key behind psychopolitics, everyone expects me to be a superhuman genius. And I want is to snuggle a teddy bear and watch Steven Universe. All I want is to be a woman.

I'm scared of what my family will think. Their son/nephew/grandchild who could once hold a conversation on the geopolitical buildup to the Russian Revolution is now someone who grew up looking like a Sephardic Jewish male and now looks like a southeast Asian woman, who spends their time off from work riding hopper balls, binging Adventure Time and We Bare Bears, and snuggling plushies.",04Nov2020,1
773,"So, a little bit of background story:

In my second year of uni i started to crush on someone who was in my class. We never really talked but i overheard some of his conversations with his friends and he was really funny, which was the main reason i started crushing on him. He was also my type.

Back then i was still quite inexperienced with relationships and pretty shy, so although i saw him a lot (not just on campus but also in clubs), we still never talked. I do think though, that he had interest in me as well because we exchanged looks often and he always smiled at me when i saw him on campus or while clubbing (he still does).

In my 3rd year at uni i started seeing someone else (friends with benefits) and also started to work. He also changed his course, so i didn't see him that often anymore. I didn't think that much about him but he was still in the back of my mind. When i thought about him, i always regretted not taking a chance because - although i didn't know him that well - i always thought that we were a good match.

Almost 2 years later, things started to end with my f+ really bad. But before the bad part happened, i started to see my crush again more often and also had a match on tinder with him! I was so ecstatic about that! I didn't even care how bad things were with my f+! I was just happy! That faded however because i sent him a massage but got no reply. So i deleted my Tinder account a month later(I'm so stupid). That was about a year ago. 

I recovered this last year from my emotional wounds from my ex f+ and even managed to be in a happy relationship with someone else. However, i still think about that crush a lot. I didn't see him for almost a year (since March) but i still have that longing feeling. I never felt such strong feelings for anyone before and they just don't go away. 

I know that there is a high probability that we wouldn't even be a good match (because i don't know him) and it's just all in my head, but i still want to at least find out how things would be with him.

I don't even know what i should do...

778,"This is a throw-away.

First time ever asking for advice here. Be kind, I'm not Reddit savvy. 

A small town community fb group that I'm part of leans deeply, stupidly redneck. They stand apart from other community fb groups by not limiting topics unless they get out of hand, and members seek it out for that reason (the others kill political threads to keep the peace). The group in questions is the kind of group where people often post low-key racist and homophobic comments (i can provide examples) within the body of threads. No one really fronts these guys who do this too strongly because everyone around here is nervous about physical retaliation: it's all over the news, so why not in this BFE town? I'm not from the area originally, so am fairly anonymous. Which gets me into trouble at times cuz my mouth.

I decided today was the day to reveal to one such guy (Call him Bob) what name-calling and cursing at people revealed: deep insecurity and everyone else knows it. This guy couldn't shut up though, always had to respond. I fucking hate bullies, so I kept responding to his responses. Because that's what hero's do. Turns out this occurred over a 4 hour time frame (I hate bullies). Toward the end some predictable low-key homophobic comments came out, which I of course revealed the meaning of. This of course predictably resulted in his saying ""do you want to settle this like men?"" Where I come from this is a threat to physical violence. 

I called it a threat of physical violence and gave him a chance to delete it, saying that if he didn't I would see that he gets banned from the group and fb (way overkill, I know). No dice. He said no way, not a threat. I says, ""If I misunderstood here's the chance to correct me."" He doubles down and says basically ""eff off,"" you're threatening me. Does it sound like I'm in high school? Cuz I think it sounds like I'm in high school but I'm 40.

After thinking about my life choices, I hit the sole group admin up (call him Frank) via messenger. I've had run ins with Frank before (cuz bullies need to be called out) and know him to also be deeply, stupidly redneck. Frank refers to the very thread I messaged him about before I do, so he obviously watched its progress. I owned that I bird-dogged Bob half the day but that the threat of physical violence blew all kinds of rules. Instead of ban or mute request (cuz overkill), I ask him just to delete the thread and I'll take my lumps another day when Bob surely brings it up again. Frank tells me that Bob is his best friend IRL. Yay for my luck. He agreed to delete the thread, saying we were both in the wrong. I have an issue with this (cuz ....just because) but just end the convo since I'm getting the face-save.

He jumps in the thread and lets Bob know to settle down, even allows Best Friend Bob to get a few licks in at my expense. Half hour passes and the finally deletes the thread.. End of lame story. But I'm still bothered.

Questions: 

\- Is ""want to settle this like men?"" not a thread of physical violence, and should I not report it?

\- Do I leave sleeping dogs lay and continue to confront the jackasses (albeit, more concisely) so that other community members feel more confident in posting too? (Sorry, more context: My wife and I were surprised how many people began posting once we started tag-teaming these bullies earlier this summer, which went away when all the idiots in the news started physically attacking and killing people over masks. This is the reason I also don't just block people: if they bully me, then they bully others and I want to see it.) This is my preferred, level-headed option. Or

\- Should I hunt up all examples of homophobic, racist, bullying, physically threatening behavior and seek sweet sweet justice against all the perpetrators and the group to achieve my original overkill response? This is my unlevel-headed response.

We were never “official” and I think that’s why my ego is preventing me from asking him. We are actually on pretty good terms—I was just really young when we were in the relationship. When I realized he would never love me the way I wanted him to I moved on with my life and moved to another state and we just lost touch. He has reached out to me recently asking if I had been faring well with the wildfires in California. I want to specifically ask him for the art commission because I actually really love his art and think it would represent my image well. Thoughts? Should I suck it up?

I didnt know that what I was going through depression I wasn't sad just felt stressed and over worked and when covid and lockdown happen I felt overwhelmed and had a mental breakdown.
I was medicated for depression and anxiety but the meds really messed with my head. It felt like a battle.(turned out I was allergic to the meds)
And that really messed up whatever chance I had or thought I had every emotional conversation. ""What did you say to me?"" That night plays over and over. 
I want our relationship but they dont or idk what they want.
I stay way when the kids get picked up.
So questions
If you tell someone you cant be around them because it hurt why would they want to come around  still?
Why hug them?
Why lay there with them?


I keep getting the conversation of ""Just be normal "" but how do you keep thing normal when they want to be playful and when you mention it they get mad.
I get the wanted to be friends but how do you stay friends with someone that feels like they are rejecting you.



I realized that I cant do the co parenting. If they get into a relationship it would really hurt because that means I lost the person I wanted to be with for the rest of my life.

My parents forced me into community college for medical radiography. I got rejected from the program twice and was really sick of it. I was sick of retaking classes, I was sick of writing shitty papers, I was sick of trying to impress people, so I just stopped taking the classes. My parents think I'm a lazy bum but in reality, I'm so fucking burnt out at this point. I can't see myself liking any job or doing anything really. I have applied to countless jobs and I keep getting rejected. I was gearing up to join the military but I don't think it's for me anymore.

787,"This’ll be a long one just an FYI. 


So 8 or so months ago I made a very rash decision to break up with my girlfriend. I wanted to be someone I wasn’t, I wanted to be a party guy, meet new people, never really be tied down. I was 18 at the time. Looking back I took everything she gave me for granted, she loved and cared about me and my family unconditionally. She would’ve dropped anything in a heart beat to take care of me. And I was too young and stupid to realize what that meant at the time. After I ended things I tried to hang out with a girl from my middle school/early high school days. I was using her as a rebound to try and get this girl (my ex, we’ll call her Angel) out of my head. I had no idea what love was or how rare it is to find true love, all I wanted was to get her out of my head. This ended up hurting this rebound and from there it’s just downhill. For a while angel would try and get in touch with me and I’d say no, I’d never leave her hanging, I would tel her the truth. I only lied about where I was maybe 3 times just so she’d leave me alone. I never did much sexual with the rebound, she tried but I’ll be honest, I couldn’t get it up. It felt wrong and I just didn’t feel okay with it. Eventually angel came over one day after I was feeling a little lonely, I was house sitting my grandparents place for a bit so we were all alone. One thing lead to another and we had sex. It felt wrong after because me and this rebound had a thing. I was honest with her and told her that angel came over and we had sex. That’s when I hurt the rebound and pretty much ended things, we tried to hang out a few times and it just never felt the same after. I didn’t talk to angel for a while after that, maybe here and there, nothing I can really remember. I was devastated, thinking back these feelings I had were me breaking my own heart, I refused to let angel love me and I feel so stupid for it now. I have learned what love is and I truly love angel to death, I could spend the rest of my life with her and nothing could change that. After a few more months of trying my best to be happy I finally caved, I texted angel and I wanted to se her. We hung out once or twice then I broke the news to her. I poured my heart out and I apologized profusely, I have bought her flowers multiple times, I showed up at her work with flowers, I have said and tried everything she’s willing to let me do to show her how much I regret my decision and it kills me everyday that nothing could change it. She told me that she’s still figuring her stuff out on her own, that she’s still working on being okay with herself. Well come to find out there’s another guy, we’ll call him Doofus. For awhile she claimed doofus was just a “best friend” and that nothing has happened between them. Even though she told me they’ve slept in the same bed multiple times and she’s with him all the time. I knew something was up but I decided to believe her. I continued to try and get her back, we’ve talked a lot and most of the time we’re just repeating ourselves. I left her alone for a while and gave her time to figure out what she truly wants. She even hung out with my mom and talked about us. A few days before that I texted her and said I was thinking about her and that I missed her. Then when she told my mom about that she said that it made her cry, she said she was just about to text me and tell me the same thing, at the same time I was telling her the same thing (catch my drift? That sounds a little confusing). It gave me hope, I knew and still know that there’s something in her that loves me. But then we talked again and it was the same answer, except this time she finally told me that her feelings for doofus were a little more serious than she thought. Broken heart again, I kept trying. I stayed in contact with her and was constantly checking her location on Snapchat (toxic, I know). Everyday all I wanted to do was talk to her and see her. Then one day she posts on her spam account on Instagram saying that her friend gave her number to some cute guy and she was excited about it. My friends finance felt it was right to show me that since I don’t follow her spam and can’t see it. I called her and blew up, I said you’re fucking destroying me and I need an answer, I need to know if I can move on and not wonder if you’d ever come back. She still wouldn’t give me a yes or no. So I gave her even more time, a couple days pass and we have plans to hang out. That whole day I knew what was going to happen and I was prepared to say what I had to say. I can’t lose her. Last night, we hung out, we got some lunch and went shopping for her new apartment. I felt like a couple again, even though I knew what was coming I was still happy to just be with her. We get back to her place and she said she needs to do homework and that she’s gotta kick me out, I say no we need to talk. I repeat my self once again, pouring my heart out, giving her everything I have to convince her that I won’t hurt her again, I’m all in for her. Everything about her I love and want. Still, same answer, “I need to figure my shit out, I don’t know if or when I’ll want to be with you.” I can’t take that as an answer.  I tell her she’s gonna lose me for good if she can’t give me a solid answer, that was a bluff and it didn’t work. She was balling her eyes out saying she can’t lose me but she also can’t give me what I want. I understand, but it just wasn’t fair to either of us. Anyway, a lot of repeating and pleading goes by and it gets me no where. I finally tell her I’m leaving for good, goodbye. She can’t say goodbye to me, she says it can’t be the last time she sees me. She then tries to give me this scrap book she made of our whole relationship and tells me to give it back to her. After that, I broke down. I have never cried so hard in my life, I was broken, I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I fell to the floor in her lap and cried and cried and cried. I’m saying some things that sound a little scary.. suicidal things. She wants me to get help and I think I’m going to, more on that later. I pull myself together and we look through the scrapbook together. Neither of us are crying, we’re just looking at these happy moments we shared. I can’t believe I let her go. I tell her we can have this again, all I need is a chance to earn her love back, and she told me the only thing she can do is be my friend for now, that it doesn’t feel natural. I get up and go to leave for good, I lost her and I felt like there was no getting her back. All she could tell me was “goodnight” but I say “goodbye” and leave. I go to my truck and scream at the top of my lungs, I cry more, i yell things I’ve never said before. Talking to myself I say “I fucking hate you” “you stupid fucking idiot” “what is wrong with you” balling my eyes out. I look up and see she’s still watching me in her window. I drive away, I’m not really driving. I’m not paying attention to anything, To put it frank, I was suicidal. I wanted to die. I felt like I let go of the best thing that’s ever happened to me and it’s all my fault, she fills that hole in my heart that I’ve been trying to fill for months. I stupidly go back, because I can’t take it, I couldn’t bare that being the last time I see her. I wanted to talk to her and tell her, “let’s be friends, let’s work things out and go slow, it’s fair to me because of doofus but whatever let’s do it”.  I knock on her door and she won’t let me in, she tells me to go home, I wouldn’t leave, she said she’s gonna call security and I say that’s fine but I’m not going anywhere. She says her friend Tasha is over and she won’t talk to me while she’s there. Finally she opens the door and it’s not tasha, it’s fucking doofus.  After I melted down in her arms, after she literally shattered me as a person, she calls this dude and has him come over. Not 10 minutes after I left. I was so angry and sad, all i wanted to do was punch doofus in his fucking face but I couldn’t, that’d just make things worse. Doofus leaves and I get to talk to angel again. She says she’s never seen this side of me and it scares her, I apologize for acting crazy (even though I feel I have a right to) and it’s back to square one. I’m just pouring my heart out again. Still, no where.  We both just kinda lay down for a bit, one thing lead to another, we kiss, we make out, then we’re naked. We didn’t actually have sex, the neighbor came and asked if I could move my truck out of his spot.  After that she wouldn’t continue. I also want to add that as we were doing our thing I kept asking if it’s okay, and she said yes.  After I move my truck I go back in and she says that was probably a mistake and that i need to go home because she needs to do homework or some shit. I kept asking to stay, I was so tired all I wanted to do was fall asleep.  She wouldn’t let me and told me she’s taking a shower and I’m welcome to stay until she gets out. While she’s in there I made another toxic and unfair decision and I looked through her phone. I found text messages of her and doofus, clearly they’ve had sex. So when she gets out I tell her it’s time for the truth, I want to know what she’s done with him. And at first she said they’ve only made out, I knew that wasn’t it so I said “what else?” And she finally told me they had sex. A week ago. After I told her I’m falling apart over her and I can’t lose her, after she told me she still loves me and that she’s just confused, she had sex with him. Devastated again, I lash out, I ask her what the fuck is wrong with her. I say this isn’t her, I don’t know who she is anymore, the angel I know would’ve never done anything like that. She’s embarrassed, she can’t even look me in the eye anymore. I ask her “would you have sex with him again?” And she doesn’t say anything, I say “look me in the eyes and tell me you would have sex with him again, after everything” and she couldn’t do it. I tell her I’ve been competing with some random dude you’ve known for 6 months, I’m sittting her breaking down over you and you’re still fucking some other guy and not giving me an answer. After some more of me just being angry and confused and heart broken, she says “I don’t know what to say anymore” so I say “goodnight” and actually leave this time. Keep in mind, she’s been crying and hurt so bad over this situation this whole time. So why she did that to me? I don’t know. Why she lied to me? I don’t know. Anyway, I drive home. Still pretty careless which scares me but I made it. I took some swigs of vodka to see if itd help and it didn’t. I ended up calling her and she answered, then we stayed on the phone the rest of the night, not talking just sleeping. This morning, as she was on the phone still, I was texting my mom telling her what happened. I kept hearing angel move and I kept saying her name because I wanted to talk but she wouldn’t respond. My mom finally says “son I think you need to ghost her, she needs to feel what it actually feels like to lose you again, she has the best of both worlds right now and she can’t have that”. So I tell her on the phone, whether she’s sleeping or not I say “I can’t talk to you anymore angel, goodbye” and I hang up. I remove her from any social media I have, I still have her number. It’s so hard to get rid of it. She hasn’t said anything to me today. Even after all this I still love her with all my heart, nothing would make me happier than being with her. I have never felt anything like this in my whole life, I have never experienced this much pain and it fucking sucks. I have no idea what to do with myself, I can’t sleep and I can’t eat. I feel sick to my stomach constantly. The nice part is I have a caring family and friends that will support me through this. I just felt like I needed to write it out. Every part of me hopes that she realizes who she’s losing, I know I hurt her but she has no right to do this shit to me. I just want her to text me, I just want her to be with me. But I’m not getting anywhere just sitting around waiting for her. So I felt like this was the right decision. 

If you read all this, thank you. This has been such a big event in my life and it’s not a good one. I’m miserable right now and could use a little advice on what I can do to try and get better. I’m missing a part of my self and I took too long to realize it, and it eats me up inside. Please if there’s any questions about what I’ve said feel free to ask, I need to talk about this.

p.s. I’m 19 btw, I’m not sure if that really matters but this has all taken place in about a year.

I overlooked everything.  He broke up with me ,right b4 our 1 year  anniversary  and I  was devastated and depressed. Thanks to my friends, I was able to slowly get over him. 6 months ago, he came to my home(my parents trust him a lot and he is the golden boy in our locality) and he told me that he misses me a lot ,even though he has a new gf and that he is crazy about me and can't stop thinking about me. He apologized for hurting my feelings and for saying that he only have lost for me. he said he only said those bcz he was mad about something  and was trying to hurt me purposely and it didn't mean anything. Later he felt guilty and that's why he is apologizing. But I didn't believed  him and asked him to leave, but then he forcefully kissed me and dryhumped me. I  was too shocked to resist and I  still regret  it . I didn't tell my parents in fear of disappointing them. I am afraid, they will disown me or something.

793,"Hey everyone. As the title says, I am a 22 year old who had the luck of securing a full time job in what I have always believed to be my field - mental health and social services (have wanted to be a therapist for so long but am holding off on grad school to see whats available with a BA) However I am moving in the spring and will have to find a new job.

Currently I'm working as an advocate which is great and at the same time exhausting. However from what I know about myself, helping others is my passion. So is advocating for people. My resume, if you're an employer related to mental health, is gorgeous. 

But what else is out there for me? Do I really want to live a life where I cater to others? How do I discover a passion that is for me? Besides standing in brooks and surrendering? Can't get paid for that and unfortunately I have bills to pay. 

I get really worried about not getting out there and exploring the world and life itself while I'm still young. I am scared that I will fall into the 9-5 pattern and hate my life yet feel too stuck to make a move and get out. I know I have lots of time left (hopefully...) but then it's like what if I don't and I've spent my whole life working and mostly exhausted on my days off? 

I want to cherish my youth. Because when I was younger I didn't and I regret that a lot even though it wasn't necessarily my fault. Can you regret things that aren't your fault?

Part of me says, whatever your next job is, don't let it be mental health. Take a break and see what other jobs are out there.

Another part of me says, uhhh who is going to hire me? Why not just stay with what is more or less guaranteed and i know is a passion of mine?

Another part says, if you keep swimming on this path it is very hard to get out. 

Another part says,, baby,, please. leave everything behind and go. But I love my family too much for that last one, I think. 

I need to step into uncertainty. I am uncertain but don't know how to step into it. Would love advice on working with all these clashing parts of me. 

Would also love advice about different paths and fields of work. I Have a career counseling session next week which will be helpful. Here are my strengths:

- charismatic, gregarious, can definitely smooth talk
- i get shit done no question; very efficient
- good with problem solving and helping people talk through concerns 
- considerate -- always keep people updated
- bilingual 
- a helper, a bridger, a mediator, an advocate
- very integrated with gratitude and mindfulness practices; devoted to life long processes 
- deep. I don't just scratch the surface I really explore whatever is at hand 
- very compassionate. Active listener, great questions, encouraging, empathetic but not in an annoying and/or excessive way
- i love nature a lot
- very open to emotion 
- critical thinking
- good at communicating care and nurture

He proceeded to ask if we were together and we both said yes, I told him that he could leave now (in hindsight I probably should’ve saved myself the headache and waited for him to leave but I was already having a bad day). He sat down instead, I stopped what I was doing and told him to leave and stop being a dickhead, he said no and was generally just trying to act tough infront of his friends sitting on the table behind. After a while my girlfriend said we were leaving as she could see I was getting visibly frustrated, I went over to his friends and told them that he was just being a prick and they said that it should just be left alone now. They seem like decent people, unlike the guy that came over.

I don’t want this to turn into something physical, since I don’t have 6 friends to back me up and since I don’t want to get kicked out of my college. If something like this happens again, I just don’t know what I’m expected to do. How is it that I should approach further situations like this that may occur? I know I definitely could’ve done a few things better but I was a little caught up in the heat of the moment.",04Nov2020,1
795,"Ok
So pretty much I’m not much of a confrontational person
And I’ve been depressed for around 2 years now
So one of my friends called me about a week ago we’ll call him joe
So joe said something that I thought about after and didn’t think of anything in the moment
He said that he was talking to my other friend
We’ll call him bob
Said that I was seeking sympathy going around talking about my problems with people
in The moment I said I guess idk
Later I thought about it and it wasn’t the case
I was not going around telling people my problems so they feel bad for me
So I thought about confronting my friend bob about it
He’s bigger than me and can forsure beat my ass
But I ended up confronting him about it saying that he was talking behind my back assuming that I was doing that when I wasn’t
He said that he didn’t think of anything of it and it was in the moment when they talked and that’s what I looked like in their eyes and other peoples
He understood that I wasn’t doing that but I just looked like that
Things did get heated in the call
And both of my friends were in the call
So the convo ended
After I thought I should ask bob to apologize so I called him back later and he did
And I called joe after and he didn’t apologize and said that I’m taking it way too seriously
Joe then after called bob and told him that I asked him to apologize aswell
Bob called me and just started calling me a bitch and stuff for asking joe to apologize.. I didn’t say anything back because I was questioning whether I was taking the situation too serious
I thought about it and am I tripping and taking the issue way too seriously?",04Nov2020,1

798,"  

This has been weighing heavily on me for the past few days after my friend (let’s call her Suzie) came forward to discuss her assault, which she claims was perpetrated by two of our other mutual friends. We’ll call them Ron and Lisa. Suzie shared with me that she had gotten really drunk at Ron and Lisa’s place a few weeks ago, and that Ron had proceeded to have sex with her while she was passed out and couldn’t give consent. I was initially skeptical of her claims because I wondered what Lisa was doing since Ron and Lisa live in a studio apartment, but Suzie told me that Lisa had been asleep while the assault occurred. I asked for more details, but Suzie revealed that she couldn’t remember any more details because she had blacked out. Truthfully, I just felt sorry for her, and pissed at Ron. I urged her to go to the police, but Suzie didn’t seem amenable to that whatsoever. She was scared of the whole process, so I mostly just listened to her side of things.

Ron had always been sort of a lady’s man before he met Lisa and was always having hookups and one-night stands. After he started a relationship with Lisa, he had mentioned that Lisa was bisexual and was looking to explore, so I had seen him bringing girls home for “threesomes” on many occasions. I finally worked up the courage to confront Ron and asked to meet him and Lisa at their apartment to discuss about things with Suzie.

When I told Ron about what Suzie had shared with me, he seemed surprised. He called Lisa into the room, and they gave me their accounts of what had happened. Their story was completely different from Suzie’s. They both told me that Suzie hadn’t drank much of anything at their place besides a couple of sips of a mixed drink that she didn’t seem to like, and thus didn’t finish. They had both thought she was completely sober. They also shared that it had been Suzie that initiated the sexual contact with Lisa, and that she had been talking about it all night. Ron also shared that he was having issues “getting it up”, and thus couldn’t have had sex with Suzie, which Lisa also confirmed. From their accounts, it was Suzie who had come onto them. Their retelling seemed genuine, and Ron looked really embarrassed when he was retelling the part about his erectile issues. They also claimed to have spoken with Suzie the following day and showed me text messages that they had each exchanged with Suzie. It looked like they were having a friendly chat in the messages. Now, I know the text messages don’t really prove that their story is true, but I just have to wonder why Suzie was chatting it up with them the following day if she felt like the previous night’s encounter had constituted an assault.

I’ve since asked a few people about that evening and about whether Suzie had seemed intoxicated or if they saw anything strange from Ron and Lisa and everyone I spoke to who had been at Ron and Lisa’s apartment the night the incident happened has told me that Suzie was either “completely sober” or “tipsy at most”. Something just isn’t adding up.

I’m writing here to ask for some perspective. I just feel like Suzie may be lying about what really happened, but I don’t know if I’m just being a bad friend by doubting her. She seems pretty broken up about what happened, and we talk about her feelings concerning the incident often. There’s just been this nagging doubt in the back of my mind about everything, so I thought I would just ask what others think.",04Nov2020,1

802,"I [M14] currently live with my parents and brother. My father works at a factory, which produces airplanes/jets for the military. This has allowed us to have a fairly comfortable life, with a nice house, large lawn and a pool. However, my father is the primary provider for our money.


Now, politics have gotten...heated inside our home this year. I am a conservative, but I’d say I’m much more liberal than most. I want public healthcare, military defunding, legal abortion etc. At the same time, my dad is a diehard alt-right conservative. He believes trump is the most amazing president, Obama was basically satan and that Biden is a socialist who will screw everything up. My mother is between us two politically, but tries to act almost like a moderator when we debate, reminding us to keep it civil. I keep my brother out of it, as he’s too young to have an opinion and I don’t want him swayed by me or my dad.


Today, my dad said that Biden is evil because he wants to defund the military and therefore put hundreds of thousands of people out of jobs. Now, I think both candidates suck. However, I mentioned that I agreed with reducing the military budget. When he asked why, I said our budget is currently far too big for not being in a major war and that it can be better spent elsewhere. 


In response he got pretty heated, telling me that he would be out of work and wouldn’t be able to provide bread on the table. In response I said that when discussing politics I try and stay unbiased, and side with whatever helps more people. I think that military defunding would harm a lot of families like us. But it would help the nation as a whole.


He got pissed and basically said that family should always be put first and that I am stupid and ‘too young and inexperienced in life’ to have an opinion. Am I in the wrong here for saying that I try and put the country over my family in political matters?",04Nov2020,1

804,"I'm guessing around five people of my department did a get together without inviting me. I'm not sure since I'm not longer on social media to see their stories.

Regardless, I was bullied when I was younger for a whole school year in lower primary school. The torture was that the bully told everyone in class not to talk to me except for a 30 min break where we'd play tag. So throughout the year, I just sit alone in class getting excluded for most of the time at school.

Fast forward to today, it really bothers me when I get excluded in friend groups or when people don't like me. It's a loop in my head. Logically, I understand that I cannot keep trying to be liked by everyone but I can't seem to process this baggage and get over FOMO.

Anyone been through that? Can you help how you've gotten over it?

Tldr; I have FOMO due to primary school bully asking everyone to exclude me. How can I deal with it as an adult now?",04Nov2020,1

807,"**TLDR: (The post is a bit long, so I'm posting a brief TLDR beforehand, but I do think reading the whole post is well-worth your time and mine :D) I love learning about pretty much everything, but my absolute academic love is history; however, I also love languages and literature. I come from a science-based family, so the natural sciences (biology and chemistry) aren't out of the question. My weakest point academically is anything related to mathematics and engineering, but I would not be absolutely opposed to studying them, if not at least getting a minor in a mathematics-related field.**

After learning that my university was going to implement online teaching for the entire year and was also going to place heavy strictures on social life, I decided to take a gap year, so I am currently working for my dad, which has given me a lot of extra time to think about what I actually want to study at university (I've already been admitted to my university; we don't have to choose what we want to study until much later in our university careers). 

I come from a family that's extremely science-based -- my father is a surgeon/businessman, my mother has a PhD, my eldest brother is a medical student, and my other brother majored in biology at university -- so the sciences have always been emphasized in my household. While I do like the sciences, the course that really keeps me up at night constantly researching and making new discoveries is history. 

While history isn't the most practical major to study, I think it has a lot of benefits in that it teaches you how to thoroughly research a topic from multiple angles and consider multiple perspectives and contexts. In addition, the grind of writing weekly papers and (at least at the university I will be attending) having to do weekly tutorials and seminars with a small cohort of students teaches public speaking, thinking on one's feet, and effectively communicating one's point of a view in a potentially contentious environment. If this were an absolutely perfect world, I would absolutely study history and probably purse history for the rest of my life, both as a career and as a hobby. Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world.

To start, the history major at my school isn't entirely appealing to me, but luckily, the history and literature major appeals to me incredibly, so that isn't too much of stress for me. However, as I've said before, history and literature isn't the most practical major to study, so there is a small side to me that's questioning what my career prospects are after university. 

Now, I will be attending one of those universities that people say ""You can do whatever you want with that school's name on your degree"" but, naturally, I'm still worried that I won't get the job that I want. If I'm being truly self-reflective, I don't have an ardent passion for any one career. As you can probably tell, however, I do have a burning passion for studying history. I think for me, what I want in a career is something fulfilling enough that will also sustain me and my future family extremely well financially, which brings me to my next topic. 

I come from a pretty well-off family. The class system and whatnot is so murky and not precise, especially here in the US, that I want to avoid those terms, but I think what I'm about to say is distinct and accurate enough (side note: not saying this to boast or to do anything besides provide the utmost context surrounding my situation to allow you to give the best advice possible): my parents will be paying for all of my college tuition and room and board and any expenses related to college, whether it be study abroad or other experiences. However, we are not wealthy enough that I will not have to work a day in my life; in fact, I'm working for my dad right now (however that also goes to show the privileged position into which I've been born that my dad had a job lined up for me). All this to say that I would like to have a high-paying job in the future (maybe even in my first-year out of university, which isn't all too uncommon at my university), one even more high-paying than my father. 

Given that history and literature is a pretty liberal arts degree and doesn't have a clear job prospect right after (although a lot of graduates from that major tend to go toward consulting, finance, or public policy after finishing at my university), I've also considered economics because, in my mind, history and economics are some of the most classic and traditional majors (just goes to show you I'm obsessed with everything related to history, even if it's what successful people historically studied at university). I've also considered statistics because the finance and consulting worlds seem to be over-saturated with economics majors, and I think the skills learned in statistics are actually the ones that are better suited for finance and banking and consulting, despite many graduates believing economics to be the course that provides the most skills for those career prospects. 

Aside from those, I wouldn't be opposed to other things as well, especially more concrete subjects and less theoretical ones, but it really does not matter to me (I love the humanities -- the classics, languages, art, etc). My school is famous for our government major, which I believe to be a bit more concrete and applicable than history and literature. In addition, as I said in the TLDR, the sciences have been embedded in my mind since I was a kid (but I think my interest in the sciences stems less from actually being passionate about them and more so from my family's interest in it and also from a traditional ""STEM is good"" mentality).

To cap it all off, I think, while writing this, I've also been able to reflect on what I should study, but any extra academic and/or career advice that I might not have thought of would be extremely appreciated. And, even if you don't have any advice to give, the fact that you made it this far is extremely admirable and extremely appreciated.",04Nov2020,1

No luck in the past 6 months.. can’t compound or accumulate because i am living off of what i make. 

Couple things to keep in mind
1. Where i am from, banking loans aren’t an option unless you have a firm with local presence (office[s])
2. People are tricky and usually you are seen as a fraud unless you wear a watch that costs at least the same as an average car lol
3. Rarely anyone gets forex and their impression is bad just because those who get it do their thing silently and those who fuck it up are loud in their misery
4. Photos videos etc are easily doctored anyways so let’s not even bother about it. 
5. I don’t have an online presence as well
