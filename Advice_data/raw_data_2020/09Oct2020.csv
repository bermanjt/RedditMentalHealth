0,Yes this may seem like a stupid question but I really want to educate myself and I don’t know who to ask. Today me and my friends got into a heated conversation about this and they said that I invalidated their exsistence since I said there were only 2 genders and I really want to apologize but I want to educate myself before I do,09Oct2020,1
1,"I asked my best friend today what she felt like I should work on as a person since I’ve been working on myself over the past couple of months. And she just responded with I can’t tell you that you need to realize what’s wrong in order to fix them. So I revised the question and I said to her how do you feel like I’ve been doing as a better person over the past couple of months. And that more or less got the question answered.

She had told me that I am being nicer to her than I was in the past but I’m still an asshole. The other thing she said as well was that since I’ve been opening up and working on emotional availability I let my emotions take over a lot now and I will take out my anger on her at times as well as being a giant baby with issues that arise with me and said I need to learn how to deal with a lot of my life issues on my own while being able to deal with emotions at the same time.

So how do I work on both of these things??",09Oct2020,1

5,"My friends are depressed. I don’t have other friends. I’m close with these guys but talking about feelings is always hard. Especially when it’s dark feelings of death and sadness and negativity and depression. I am normally positive. I don’t have to face the negativity around life that depression brings. When some of these feelings came out very strongly today I found myself very low; low energy; low positivity; low confidence in these people. I want to help but I know I can’t. I can’t change how people feel no matter how much persuasion and positivity I give to them. They’re not going to change because of me. Depression cannot be changed. I know it’s sounds selfish but when all this depression is around me, it spreads to me and I seem to lose some hope as well. I don’t want to have to deal with other peoples problems because I’m terrible at it, it makes me uncomfortable, and it’s awkward but I have no other choice. How do I remain positive and how do I help people I love?",09Oct2020,1
6,"For the past week or two I have been unable to do the amount of work I need to be doing in order to not fall behind in my classes. I've always struggled with motivation but now not even my constant fear and anxiety of failure is making power though. 

Not only that but for the past few days my perception of time has been getting increasingly off. Sometimes I will feel as if a few minutes have gone by but when I check the time its actually been close to two hours. And when trying to remember things that happened in the past couple of days they all just blend together the events that happened on Monday and Tuesday feel like they happened on the same day but when I really concentrate and think about it I realize they didn't.

7,"Our relationship was nothing special, just boring... very boring. We talked for about a year no facetimes, no meetups, no hanging out just text. I’m not exactly the type of guy to open up quickly, which is my fault for not having the courage to even try to do anything in the relationship, if you would even call it that. However having known the relationship wasn’t gonna work I still texted her EVERY SINGLE DAY. It felt painful at first but soon it was more of a chore than even trying to get to know her. I didn’t even try I just asked her uninteresting questions like how was your day, what are you doing, whats your plans, etc. Of course I didn’t do that in the beginning but after a while I really couldn’t find anything to ask because I drowned her out with my enormous amount of questions. She wouldn’t really ask me too many questions as well in fact she never even hit me up first. She still however answered all my questions and gave responses to all of them which made me quite confused in the relationship. I did it everyday to the point where I assumed we were dating, I’m such a stupid guy. After that painfully excruciating year of pain and confusion I finally got the courage to put my foot down and just ask what relationship we had because we practically dodged the question whenever it was even brought up. Of course like the coward she was she asked me what I thought. I said we were “talking” and she said “oh yeah” with nothing else attached just those two words. That’s when I understood that she was using me. I don’t talk to her anymore and it’s been a week and she hasn’t messaged me (nor have I) and I think we went our separate ways. I still feel down about it though, I hate the ideology of myself thinking I had that fantasy for that long and didn’t come to my senses. I think about her and how I could’ve been better how I could’ve possibly made work. I don’t wanna think like that because it’ll just hold me back from moving on. Do you know any methods to just make the pain stop?

8,"Hi, 

I have a really weird constant heartburn after having sex. After sex, I felt like I was going to pass out and my hands were shaking but I did not feel the heart burn or anything. I felt like I was going to throw up, so I sat down and drank some water. Fast forward an hour later, and I really need to use the bathroom. I go to the bathroom, it is the usual business - but I have a really weird severe heartburn. 

Now, a few hours later, I still have that severe heartburn. I also feel dizzy, my stomach hurts (near groin and belly button area), my mouth feels dry, my stomach is making a lot of noises and I threw up a few minutes ago. I do have GERD (acid reflux) and I ate some semi-spicy shrimp yesterday for dinner and had an avocado sandwich for lunch today; however, I have not felt those symptoms in a few months - and nothing like this, it hurts so much. I did miss out on my medication for a few days, but I do that frequently anyways because I just forget sometimes - it usually does not cause problems. I took a tums two hours ago and it has not improved my condition. I am using a heating pad right now and it does feel a little bit better, but I still feel really not great. 

My girlfriend thinks I should go to the ER (maybe she is just worried about me) and I also asked my mother to look at my stomach for any bulges, as she always told me when I was a kid that there'd be a bulge if you had a hernia - she said there were no bulges and that it was probably just my GERD. I am in conflict, as my brain is telling me everything is probably fine but my stomach is telling me I need to freeze my stomach in Antarctica so it stops hurting. 

Hernia or just GERD symptoms?",09Oct2020,1
9,Met this guy online. We flirted a little but otherwise just have been getting to know each other. I don’t know where we stand which I didn’t really care either way but I never know how to stop talking to someone when we are in this limbo. He seemed nice but the conversation has gotten somewhat condescending lately. I don’t like being told that my actions are irresponsible (working and going to school at the same time).

10,"I'm a 17 yo highschool student, pretty attractive according the the ladies and my experiences.  But unfortunately I have a lot of girls I dont like who are obviously hitting on me, and I'm a chill guy and shit but these chicks are so high energy and idk how to act like I like them. I was walking home today and a chick saw me walking, pulled over, gave me a hug, and said, ""love you, text me!"" Me being the not asswhole guy I am was like sure, but previous to this we didn't even talk other than school and each time she sees me she goes wild. I'm genuinely thinking that maybe I'm being to uptight, the reason of this is because of the shows I watch. Where the chill guy gets with some high energy chick and they end up liking each other. And my mother tells me I should give people more of a chance instead of judging them. The chick is a horse girl and they have reputations of being a little crazy. She's not ugly but she's a good 6 at best. I could easily pull. Its not that I hate her I just dont know how to deal with high energy people. Should I just grow balls and go for her as friends? Im not sure i just hate not knowing how to deal with these people because I can LITERALLY feel my face change when im around them, or I just become silent.

12,"Hello!

I need help &amp; some advice and/or opinions.

I had this friend growing up when I first moved house to a new town. She was very welcoming and we became very close friends very quickly from the age of ~6.

She lived straight across the street so we were together pretty much every single day.. she was like a sister to me. But as I grew up I was teased for being friends with her and was told the old phrase ""boys and girls can't be friends"" and I actually listened to that shit.

About a year or 2 in to high school.. that's when we drifted. I basically pushed away our friendship because I was trying so hard to fit in with a crowd she wasn't comfortable with. ~8 years of an amazing friendship ruined, because of me!

Anyways to try and cut this short.. I check her social medias regularly to check how she's getting on because I still really care about her. 

I'm at an all time low right now with loneliness &amp; I dunno I guess I miss her a lot. It's been a good couple of years since we've spoke and the friendship is dead in the water.

Is there any way I can try to salvage this or at least have a conversation with her without being awkward or should I just forget and move on?

Thanks peeps.",09Oct2020,1
14,"So I'm in college and a lot of the places where I would usually see this person are closed. However as far as I'm aware they are still in the college town and I am too, even though I haven't made that explicitly clear to them. I got them something for their birthday  but I wasn't able to give it to them during the summer because we're from two different towns. I've been at school for a little bit now and I was looking through my stuff and found the thing I wanted to give them. They don't know what it is but I told them I had something to show them back when I first got it. When I found it I texted them saying I still had something to show them and when they asked what it was I said I would have to show it to them the next time I saw them in person. Instead of asking when I could see them or something like that, they just said okay and that they had no clue when that would be. I'm not going to lie that kind of pissed me off. I get it's a pandemic and people are busy and everything, but I could literally just give it to them in person outside, wearing masks, and it would take two seconds.

15,"My partner and I recently began fostering a female hound. When we went to meet her, she was afraid. Deficating and urinating all over herself. And her owner insists this behavior started out of no where. She jumps and runs away from the smallest noise and cowers in fear around men and new people. For the first week, she slept on a bed all day in our kitchen, too afraid to come out or play. Over the past few weeks, we have worked to build her confidence and now she is playing with our dogs, sleeping in our room and generally much more at ease. She still jumps at the smallest noises, but she no longer messes herself from fear. Her owner has been on the fence about having us adopt her or keeping her himself. Today he contacted me to tell me he’d like to bring her home at the end of the month. I want to reunite them, but am terrified because I don’t know what made her so fearful and she’s finally so happy. What is the moral thing to do here? I have literally no understanding for her fear, because her owner insists that it began out of the blue a few months back. He’s already admitted to keeping her outside on all lead alone during the day, and kenneled at night (apparently for her comfort, but she has avoided her kennel since we got her).

16,"Some background: I come from a very competitive Asian family.  My parents want me to go to a top university like Harvard and get a good job like my siblings did.  I'm a teenager, so I'm looking at it now, but I don't think I'll be able to.  I'm ""gifted"", but I'm also very irresponsible, lethargic, lazy, and only function off my ability to catch onto things quick.  After that, though, I start to fall off hard.    

A while ago in class we did several depression and anxiety scannings as part of our mental health unit.  They all showed indicative, but I was told these tests aren't accurate so I put it aside.  But the more I think about it, I realize some things I experience daily and consider normal are major symptoms of depression.  

I'm constantly in a mood where I feel like a hopeless disappointment to my family and uninterested in things I used to enjoy.  My sleep has also not been the greatest.  I wake up randomly in the middle of the night or say, an hour after my alarm is supposed to go off.  During the day, I can't concentrate and am extremely, *extremely* irritable, to the point where I would yell at my brother if he put my laptop on the wrong side of the table, or get mad at my friends for answering my text late.  I also feel the need to lie about my achievements to my peers, who at least work harder than I do.

 I hope this isn't anything major, but I want to make sure. There is no doctor I can get in contact with in real life both because of COVID and my parents, who I don't want to know about this.  Last time I was feeling terrible, they berated me because ""as a kid I shouldn't have anything to worry about and I should just put it aside"".

18,"The title says it all, really. 

We were together for several years. We had our whole lives planned out. We wanted to get married, have kids, we had their names picked out. He always wanted a family and I wanted it with him. We've been through a lot together and I felt like we could tackle anything. 

Then he cheated. He couldn't tell me why he'd done it. 
He said he told me because he wanted to work through it. He said I did nothing wrong, nothing to deserve it, he didn't know why he was unhappy, but he knew now that he loved me. He said he only told me so we could work through it, but I was devastated. I told him to leave, at least for a few days until we could work out what to do. He said he'd regret what he'd done forever. I told him I hoped he did. 

Without a further word, a few days later, he told me we were over. I said that was what I wanted too. Then, in the days that followed, he became aggressive, screaming, making threats, acting in a way I'd never seen before. It scared me. He told me I was a child, a bitch, that he had been the mature and nice one through all of it. We arranged for him to take his stuff and go, and now he's cut all contact.

It's still pretty raw having happened just days ago, but I'm just stunned at the cold and heartless way he's treated me, who he claimed to love. He gave me no explanation, apologies, or remorse and now he's just gone. I'm unlikely to get any further answers, and I'm not going to get any kind of closure. 

I know it's best for me that our relationship is over and, though I am upset at the loss of what I thought was my ideal partner and the future we had planned together, I know I could never forgive him for what he's done. I'm not wanting to get back together, I just want some genuine remorse and some answers - and I don't think I'll get that.

20,"I work at a data entry job 8-5 and there are two types of assignments; the ones directly given, and the work basket.

I do the assignments as fast as possible, but also carefully as possible. I’m usually done with my assignments and I work with my department to have the workbasket complete by the end of the day.

But there’s a good handful of people that are godlike with their production.

Every day there’s a productivity report for all workers to see. Most of us are decent with around 80-90% efficiency rate. But there are those who are at 120-130% on their work efficiency. Each person has a higher cleared workbasket count. 

I’m at the lowest at 80% efficiency while the highest today was 125%. We were both hired/trained at the same time yet I can’t keep up with him.

The highest and I are actually both contracted workers from the same organization, so now I feel that they will extend his contract and leave me out.

The simple answers would be “Get better” or “Suck it up and do what you can” but I feel like I’m at the best of my ability already. 

I also can’t muster up the courage to ask a supervisor cause that’s just admitting “He is a better worker than me.”

23,"So I recently made a career shift into education. I already have my master's degree, but in another field. I want to become a teacher, and I am starting out as a teaching assistant while I get certified to become a teacher.

I have struggled with social anxiety a bit for a while now, especially when I see people I went to high school with. High school and middle school were very hard for me. I was bullied a lot, I was extremely quiet. And even though I still have a touch of social anxiety, well, it was MUCH worse back then. I was incredibly awkward, and barely ever spoke.

I recently got a job offer for a teaching assistant position. But I found out through looking at the school's facebook page that someone I went to high school with has the same position at the school, in the same group of students. My stomach immediately went into knots. I hadn't known this person very well- I had some classes with her- we didn't talk much. but she was friends with my bullies.

It has been 5 years since we all graduated...but I still find myself hiding in grocery stores and when I see people in public... so now I am worried about how I would cope with working side by side someone form high school, who was there for my past that I'm ashamed of. I even considered not taking the job...but I was very excited about it until I heard this.

24,"My best friend and I have lived together for about 3 years now. It was great for a while and then a little over a year ago she got a dog. This was after I had explicitly shared with her that I don't like living with people's dogs because they are often untrained. I have had many terrible experiences with roommate's dogs and this has got to be one of the worst. Out of nowhere she told me that she needed a dog for her mental health and had wanted one for a while (which is true). She told me she couldn't wait any longer and the day after my birthday she went and adopted a dog.

I told her time and time again that I hated when people don't train their dogs and I honestly am not a fan of incredibly hyper dogs. She ended up adopting a German Shepard who had never been trained in his life. He has terrible separation anxiety and for most of the year would howl and bark if he was left alone. If he was left alone out in the house he would ruin things. To this day he is still barely trained and she doesn't exercise him AT ALL. He is so crazy because he isn't receiving the proper attention and exercise needed. He makes my life miserable and when I told my roommate that she said she would get rid of her dog and kill herself instead. Obviously the dog stayed. 

I've wanted to leave for a while but she ends up doing something really nice and then I remember why we are friends. After she got this dog it has felt like a big F U to our friendship. She knew how much I didn't want to live with a dog and got one anyway. She also knew she had to put forth a lot of effort with this dog and hasn't. I get serious anxiety just being around him. 

More recently, she got a boyfriend and he is here all of the time. Most weeks he has spent 3-4 days a week at our house. My friend also constantly wants me to hang out with them because she wants me to be friends with her boyfriend. He is an alcoholic and has come to our house a handful of times on other drugs. Every time I have seen him he is wasted. I feel incredibly uncomfortable in my own house. 

That being said, how do I transition out of living here, and maybe out of this friendship? I don't think it's worth it anymore. The problem is, I don't think I will be able to afford to move for at least 8 months and that is a crazy amount of time left to continue dealing with this.

My partner &amp; I are moving to a big city in about a couple of weeks. We have 3 cats. Right now, we have a house with a huge backyard and a safe neighborhood. My oldest cat — Ace likes to be outside. If he could, he would probably stay outdoors. We have a kitty door installed to where the cats can go in and out as they please. I bring them in for dinner (about 7 pm) and lock the door. Even with that, Ace constantly complains about going out and after a while calms down. 
Now the problem is: we will be moving into a smaller apartment on the fourth floor. How do I train (if that is a correct word) to let them know that they can no longer go out? If Ace keeps crying and meowing like that, I know we’ll have complains. He is very very loud, vocal and stubborn. 
The other two cats are pretty mellow, and while they enjoy being out, they do it occasionally. Ace on the other hand rules the neighborhood. He has been to everyone’s houses and yards and just loves being out and about. He is coming close to being a year old. The other two are about 6-7 months.

After I got off of work, I logged back on and saw a few strange messages from my boyfriend. From his perspective, he saw me opening his messages and not responding for hours, while getting notifications that I was saving dozens of my own photos and videos from the chat to my camera role. After I called him, and cleared everything up I came to an awful realization; I’d been hacked. Over quarantine, I sent him tons of nude photos and videos to keep the spark alive while maintaining a safe distance. I trust my boyfriend more than anyone, and I never thought that sending him explicit photos would ever bite me in the ass. I’ve changed all my passwords to absolutely everything (I have never shared them with anyone to begin with) but I still don’t feel safe. I have tons of questions. Could it be someone I know? If it was a random person, why was I targeted? Is there anything I can do? Is it possible to contact Snapchat and find the IP address of whoever accessed my account? How likely is it that my images will end up online? How will I know if they’re online?

35,"I'm 15, and I'm an only child. My mom is 47, and my dad is 62. They seem to never get along. Maybe it's their age difference, or maybe it's my dad's bad behavior. He seems to get angry all the time over the smallest things. When he's angry, he vents his anger on others by yelling and stomping around. He has a hard time forgiving others, and he always stares at people when he's angry.

He has really bad manners as well. Every time my dad sits in the living room, he puts his feet up on the table. His feet are really stinky, and he has yellow toenails. He also drinks milk and orange juice straight out of the carton, which is really gross. When my mom cooks something like Brussel sprouts or cauliflower, my dad doesn't even touch it because he doesn't like them. But if we eat something like tacos or a pizza, my dad eats literally 90% of it, which explains why he weighs 260 pounds. He burps and farts really loud, and he lets out a burp every 15 seconds.

He snores really loud. I would be about to fall asleep and suddenly I wake up because of my dad's snoring. I can't go back to asleep for another 30 minutes. Right when I'm about to fall asleep again, I hear loud snoring again. Another thing is that my dad is really sloppy. He often wears pants with holes in them, and he sometimes walks around the house shirtless. He has a bulgy potbelly and a ton of wrinkles, and it's disgusting to see him shirtless. However, he does it because he says it helps him cool off.

He has horrible shower etiquette. He spends about 2 hours in the shower, and he leaves the shampoo bottle open. He throws his dirty razor on the shower floor, and he sings non-stop in the shower. And he scrubs his butt with a sponge that's supposed to be for scrubbing your arms and legs, and he pees in the shower. He leaves his dirty clothes on the shower floor, and he uses 7 or 8 towels each time he showers. 

He has gas issues as well. For example, once we were at a burger place, and after drinking about 30 milkshakes, he ripped out a gigantic fart that lasted about a minute. Everyone, including my mom and I, freaked out and ran away. Another time, we were at a neighborhood barbecue potluck. My dad walked past the meats and released a silent but deadly fart. Everyone thought that the meat was rotten.

The worst part is that my dad gives me a panic attack when he's angry. He yells really loud, and he storms up and down the stairs. He burps and farts non-stop, and he jumps up and down and wiggles his head, while pounding his chest. He also slams doors and smashes the kitchen table with a book. Then he throws furniture around the house, and he goes up to people and punches the table with his fists while lecturing them about stupid things. He sometimes slouches on the couch, puts his feet up in the air, and screams at the top of his lungs. This happens about 20 times a month because my dad has horrible anger issues.",09Oct2020,1

I love the guy but currently I can't count on him for advice, for diverse reasons. One of them being that he's a common ''friend'' or something close to that anyways to my ex, which is the main reason why I am here.

\[This is mostly likely venting/ background \]

Anyways this year has had me replanting my life choices all over, You see, in 2017 the girl of my nightmares come to life, it was a girl I knew when I was a teenager and had a romantic relationship from distance, she eventually realized she would had to wait far too long before we could meet in person and decided to dump me, after doing so, she acted like we weren't friends anymore and I decided to close all my ties with her in 2009. 10 Years into the future she finds my only friend facebook and decides to re encounter herself with me. Chit chat, she decides to start seducing me and like the fool I am I fell for it, once again I committed the HORRIBLE mistake of thinking with my heart rather than my head. 

So after coming back together we had a plant, I would finish college, and we would immigrate together to a better country ( we are south american ). Thing is I always had problem studying, it's damn hard to me because no matter how much did I study I ended up forgetting stuff and that frustrated me as hell ( I've kinda resolved that problem now after discovering mnemonics, turns out my problem was that I didn't knew how to use spaced memory and other memory techniques. ) 

Problem is, I was taking too long in finishing college, at that moment I hadn't resolved my studying issues, and my ex didn't wanted to give me the time I asked of her at the beginning of the relationship. She gave me an ultimatum to change careers at the end of 2019 or leaving me, once again like a fool I accepted, all to not loose her. I changed from college to a trade school and learnt how to be a professional chef. I was doing pretty good in it, by next year I was gonna be in a position to ask her to come live with me. 

However, she choose to leave me anyways, now she made up this sobby history about how I didn't really loved her and how I wasn't willing to sacrifice for her the way she did for me , in order to justify herself as morally superior for leaving me while I was in an extreme situation ( one family member of mine was in a hospital fighting for his life and I wasn't almost incapable of sleeping for taking care of him in a hospital ). I sound spiteful right ? Well, that's because later on I found out she lied to me about all that and in reality is that she found a replacement for me that was in her city, and decided to go with this guy without telling me nothing. i know I'm a looser, but I was nothing but honest with her, never lied to her, and I get lies all over, in fact I've found she lied to me many times in our relationship.

I can't continue with the course chef , every class, every second there I want to run away screaming, every time I stay late sucking up to the teachers to better my grades, I feel like crying, knowing that the reason I was there, to build a life with her, it's not there anymore, and I'm doing this out of stupid sense of duty and mild desire for revenge of showing her she was wrong about me. 

\[End of venting and background \]

But I'm done with that. I don't have any reason to fulfill my promises to her after what she has done, after she has broken up EVERY SINGLE promise she made to me. I want to choose my own path, I want to change my life, but I fear is too late, and yes I know the it's never too late motivational phrase but that's not what I'm looking for here. I still have no trade skills nor job. I feel the weight of having to take care of my family but I have no means, I feel alone, I have no more friends than that guy who barely speaks to me lately and my ex, who has taken the moral ground to justify every action she has done to hurt me ( and I'm not talking of breaking up with me but about other stuff she has done ). 

So I need someone to judge my plans, to tell me if they are sound, to tell me if I can achieve my goals with them or should I change my direction. 

Currently I'm a bachelor in accounting, however I barely have 1st year done. I still want to leave my country because it's every day worse, however as a public accountant I don't know how well will that work out for me. So my plan is this, I want I want to change to myself, perhaps maybe in revenge against my ex for saying I'm not with numbers , to a Computer Science degree and become a software developer. I know this is a VERY well paid career, and it's universal, I can work of this anywhere in the world, I can even work from home. If I'm able to finish this in 2 years ( the bachelor here is 5 years ), perhaps I'm still in time of achieving my goals.

Now my goals in life, are being a merchant and business owner and investor, however I need capital for this. I want to create jobs and better society by giving people a living. I need capital for this, in theory as a software developer, I should be able to acquire it with this career in the future.

Having a farm that sells hydroponic products and rabbit meat. In my childhood my family had a farm, however due to corrupt bureaucrats in my country we lost it , I yearn for those gold days in which we spend as family, eating together, hoarding the sheeps, I want to live that life again. I don't want a big farm tho, just a place to retire and be at pece. Again I need capital for this, hence computer programmer ? 

And perhaps the goal in my life that has me the most worried is being able to find a wife which I can love and who I can share an active sexual life. However my fear is that I'm too old for that, I'm 27, I still need 2 more years minimum to finish my bachelor, maybe more. How can I reconcile the loss and wasting of my youngness with immigrating with a good paying job that will allow me to have a good life ? 

Could a Computer Science degree and learning programming be the answers I'm seeking for my life ? Or should I consider another path ?",09Oct2020,1
40,"I got a better paying job that I’ll be starting soon and I haven’t told my current employer about it, and I’m not going to. I contemplated keeping both jobs and just cutting hours at my current one, but it logically didn’t make sense and I’m 100% sure my manager would deny that request. I would die of exhaustion and lack of sleep if I decided to do both. I don’t know why, but I’m afraid of formally quitting. For reference, I’ve only been at this job for about a month and the overall experience has been very uneasy for me. My colleagues there just gave me really bad vibes, especially the managers. I have no idea how to quit, and I don’t want to just stop showing up because it’s super unprofessional. I’ve never been comfortable with confrontation and I’m really conflicted right now.

41,"Im currently in college, living alone, which due to lockdown has left me alone with my thoughts alot. Unfortunately, a lot of those thoughts keep on going back to my mom, and our relationship during my middle through high school years. She was getting divorced with my dad at the time, and under alot of stress which she took out on me. Stuff like yelling at me when I forgot to ask my dad for child support money, her constantly trash talking him and stuff like her mood shifting from jovial to angry quite quickly. Some moments in particular stand out, like when she got mad at me for coming home late from visitation with my dad, so she kept on yelling at me causing me to have a panic attack and locking myself in the bathroom. I refused to open the door, so she kept on banging on it and eventually kicked a hole in it, I was terrified. Once I tried to impress her by cooking her breakfast, and she thought I was insulting her because it was a simple omlette, and yelled at me again. Lots of stuff like that. And the typical asian stereotypes stuff like rude comments about my weight (I was quite chubby since I stress ate) while also making fun of me if I expressed the want to diet. Or getting mad at me for not getting into an ivy league school despite the fact that she never helped me with the application process, had no clue what my high school GPA was or even read my college app essays. And threatening to kick me out if she got really mad. 

 

So yeah, Im trying to do schoolwork, but these memories keep on coming back and are making me cry alone in my room, a huge hamper on my productivity. I tried confronting her, asking her what I did to for her to be so mean. I thought I did everything right, I got decent grades, worked afterschool, stayed out of trouble, and got a full scholarship for my current uni. She basically started saying that she loved me, I was her only source of joy, that it was ok for me to be angry, and that what she did was insensitive and horrible. She also said that she was under alot of stress, and reminded me that she was so stressed that she used to take cough medicine as sleeping pills, and that she was mad that I sometimes had fun with my dad. (I really didnt lol, but I couldn't tell either of them because it would backfire on me). There were a lot more excuses coming from her, to be honest, and her trying to justify herself by saying that at least she provided a place for me to stay and food. All I wanted was an apology, I think, but she said she already gave one (she did not). Plus, I dont think shes changed much even though shes in a more stable situation now. Last time I saw her, I started (irrationally) tearing up a but because she got mad at me for chewing too loudly in the car. She laughed at me for crying, I got another panic attack, which made her angry and she left me alone in the car. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im also really confused. Shes really nice now, texting me a lot to make sure I ate, and telling me to get snacks with her credit card even though Im financially independent. Im confused, I dont know if I should trust her or not.

52,"I think I’m very self-aware to the point that I know my strengths and my weaknesses as a human being. The thing is I don’t voice my strengths or weaknesses until needed given a situation (e.g., job interviews, literal questions, etc.) I tend to get insecure and indecisive at times which is fine. I’m willing to accept and work on at the given moment. I’ve heard over and over again in multiple situations that “you’re worth more than you think.” I simply don’t get it? And here’s why:

Usually I get this phrase in the context that I’m voicing my worries or troubles of a particular situation. I don’t know why people say this because I really don’t need reassurance unless it’s about my self worth. Have I given them the impression that somewhere I’ve undermined myself? Should I voice my strengths more? Should I take it as a compliment? Is it the way I’m wording things? I know at some points in my life when I’m weak and vulnerable I tend to share those problems more easily to look for help, but I never really update anyone on my improvement and how I did unless asked. I really feel misunderstood and I’m not sure whether to take a direct approach since I’m used to doing things silently. I’m very strong but a lot of the times others get the impression that I think I’m weak. I feel like at times I’m taken seriously, and other times, not. Maybe it’s just the matter of stating my strengths and voicing how I’m fixing the problem. 

On the opposite end, my family only thinks I’m worth anything when I’m in school or working. This doesn’t bother me personally because I’m sure those are projected Asian traditional beliefs. I have a pretty strong sense of who I am and I’ve built it enough to not let their negative beliefs affect me.

54,"This is a long backstory, sorry about the length of it.

So my brother (23 years old) is typically lazy and only motivated to be an adult for some things and has been living with my sister for a few years, paying rent and helping around the house when needed. I (24 years old) would even help him just to get chores done, but got told by my sister and others that I was encouraging his laziness. So I try not to even when it’s painfully obvious that he won’t get stuff done that he needs to. Well, he recently got into real estate and just got a house for a good price. It’s a house that needs some fixing, but it’s a good place. He moved into it the beginning of this year, and got a few things done (like replace wood floor, get a new washer and dryer) and fix the bathtub. It seemed like he was finally being an adult and taking care of things like he should. 
A month later, he asks me to live with him. I thought it was great because I was also living with my sister and her family (have been paying rent and helping around the house there) and thought it would be good for me to give her some space and have some room for myself. There was also the fact that it cuts my driving time to work by 20 minutes. But I also was hesitant because I didn’t want to deal with his laziness (like dishes and other things). I eventually relented and moved in with him.

It was great to have my own room and a kitchen as well as a living room that wasn’t so crowded. And I’ll give him some credit, he’s done some things to fix up the house like replacing lights and door hinges. However, after living with him for about 8 months, he has started to get really lazy. I would help with dishes and even mow the lawn so it doesn’t get so long. I would tell him of these things that he should be doing regularly, but he tells me “I have a million things to do, I’m not concerned with my yard”. Okay, I ask him what I can do to help. Nothing, he says. Saying that it’s stuff he needs to figure out. But nothing really gets done, and plays his video games and watches TV. I ask my Mom about this, and she is concern about his laziness. She tells him that he’s an adult and an homeowner and he has a responsibility to his house and how it presents to the rest of the neighborhood. He heard her, but doesn’t do anything about it. He continues to play video games and watch TV while ordering take out or premade stuff from King Soopers. He would use dishes and not wash them (irritating, but fine with doing them because he doesn’t clean them properly anyhow and I know how to). But the yard continues to not be a problem for him. 
I have the urge to do the yard and help out, but I didn’t want to encourage him to continue being lazy. Instead, I try talking to him about my concerns and how his yard is looking. He gets a little pissy with me, telling me it’s not my concern. I’m frustrated, and I try not to let it bother me.
Well today, a neighbor came by and yelled at him for how his yard (now with leaves and weeds) is unmanaged and making the value of the neighborhood look bad. He tells the neighbor that “he’s got a million things to do” and will get on it when he can. The neighbor left, and my brother goes into his office to play video games with his girlfriend.

55,"My dad is really tough to shop for. The man will spend 45 minutes in a Tommy Bahama and not buy anything. I’ve learned that as people get older, gifts are better when they’re experienced rather than bought. So I set up a special little date for myself and my dad to go to a wine tasting tomorrow and then to a nice restaurant for his 60th birthday (Oct.13) and I really wanted it to just be him and me doing this, I’ve been doing really well recently and I love spending time with him as adults.

He invited to take my older sister with us since she’s not working tomorrow and that’s fine, I really wanted it to be just the two of us, but hey, it’s his birthday so it’s always his choice. 

The only issue is that my sister is terrible at getting gifts for people and usually just throws in a gift card or signs her name on a card our mom buys. She’s also not in a great place mentally right now, and she and I aren’t talking much at the moment due to some other issues. To be Frank, she’s really immature and right now just isn’t a great time for the two of us to be around each other.

She texted me this afternoon saying “what’s the plan for tomorrow? Are we still doing the watch thing?” (Which was something my mom suggested for Christmas for a different family member) and I told her the plan. This is what makes me upset. She just decided to jump into this thing, and she doesn’t even know what the plan even is.... 

I feel like she’s piggybacking off of *my* idea that I thought about for weeks and took time setting up. I called my brother and he agreed. I told her I was hoping she’d come up with something for herself since I’d put so much thought into this. She didn’t even respond to it and just asked what the plan was again.

I'll get straight to the point and say I cried today on my second day of work and it was pretty humiliating.

She is a very nice person but was frustrated I couldn't do this simple task right. She mainly speaks Spanish, and I only speak English... and basically I began to cry. I really tried to stop but I just couldn't.  Ridiculous, I know.

I know that being into girls isn’t a curse, but I’m scared of what will happen to me. Firstly, she’s probably straight, and if I told her how I feel she might not like swimming around me. I don’t want to make her uncomfortable. Secondly, I might make the rest of the swim team uncomfortable by coming out as someone who likes girls. The swim team is really important to me, it’d end me if I felt like the swim team didn’t accept me. And thirdly, my parents are Christian (I live in a mostly Christian/Catholic area). I have a strong feeling they won’t like a bisexual daughter. What if they kick me out? What if they cast me aside or make me get therapy?

If you’ve gotten this far, thanks for reading. What do I do? I think I shouldn’t come out, it might literally ruin my swimming. My parents might cast me aside more then they already have. I should snap out of it and just don’t think about crushes and liking girls... This is the first time I’ve ever crushed on a girl, I’ve only really been into guys prior to her.",09Oct2020,1

She will call me anywhere from 7 am to 9 pm and during weekends - and I am but a lowly office admin so I don't need to be this intensely on call.

Unfortunately she manages a lot of projects that I work in. And she is just an awful manager. After a long week where I spent around 60 hrs working on an issue that was HER problem, I decided to reclaim my evenings.
 She texted me last night at 6:40 ""call me"" - that's how she does it, never any context - and I was so done. So i texted back ""hey Kim, after a long week last week of working late into the night every night, I'd really like to have my evenings to myself this week. If it is urgent please text me what the topic is, otherwise please send me an email and I'll address it first thing tomorrow morning."" 
Today there was a situation that caused a lot of confusion on my end and other people as well - it was a bit of a mess, and a lot of it was because she just pulled me into a project without briefing me on it at all. I have NO idea what is going on with this project and naturally it led to a miscommunication. She and I hopped on the phone and it became a heated argument where she told me she ""didn't appreciate"" my text response last night and all this other crap. I was like, Kim, that was me setting a boundary, I'm just a 9-5 office admin, I can't be available anytime of the night to talk to you, and she didn't take that well. The conversation ended with both of us feeling frustrated.

My mom is aware of how shitty she is (eeeeeveeryone has a problem with this woman) and is trying to fire her - she just needs a project manager with skills to replace her. 

I feel gross. I feel icky. I feel like I probably didn't manage that conversation as well as I could have, because she really pushes my buttons, but I also feel that familiar feeling where one sets a boundary and the other person gets upset about it - which triggers me because frankly it's bullshit. 

Tldr I'm looking for advice about 
- how to decompress after having a shitty conversation with a shitty person (I feel ICKY)
- how to communicate with a project manager who SUCKS",09Oct2020,1
61,"I work 6 days a week and my hours fall opposite of my wife. My wife is a substance abuse and recovery specialist that works through the week. During the week by the time my wife gets home or a little after I have to begin work. My friend does not work so he goes to bed when he like, wakes up when he likes etc. Anything I need to get done I have to get done early in the morning and he never wakes up before noon to 5 pm in which case I have no time to do anything. The only day I have off is Sunday. This is the time I have with my wife and we try our best to get things done. He keeps complaining that I am ""flaking out"" on him. I have invited him to go fishing in the morning or to the range for some archery or shooting or to just hang out but he is never awake. How am I flaking out on him?

Back in the 9th grade, I listened to the audiobook ""48 laws of power"". In 9th grade I think I often got jealous of others having friends and influence. I wish, I wish I could just get back at all the dickheads who wronged me. The people who've made fun of me, the family who has wronged me. I want to look down upon all of them like mice, as they used to see me like.

Around the 9th grade I used to do scummy shit which i've gotten rid of, I used to collect info and blackmail on some people, especially one specific person who I hate.

Instead of being an incel ranting on about how bad people are, i've exercised and i'm getting strong, gained some confidence and there's like this feeling inside that wants to gain strength and power, beat the fuck outta so many people.

So I was hanging out with a group of friends, I’m not the most popular guy but I’ve tried being more social with the “popular” ppl. So this new girl shows up, she’s really nice, and I think she took a slight interest in me. So when she left, I told two people in the group that I thought she liked me (bad idea, one of the had a bad history with me) one was a boy and the other was a girl. The girl was the one I didn’t like. I always feel like I’m feeling judged by them. So I tell them and they seem doubtful and kind of laugh a bit, I tell them to not to tell anyone and they promise not to. 

BUT
The girl goes over to the group of other girls that just arrived, tells them, and they all laugh like it’s the most hilarious and unlikely thing ever. I don’t want to exaggerate but I’m not exactly doing too well right now, so that basically destroyed my confidence. She came over to me and tried to tell me some bullshit reason that she did it, can’t remember what she said but I know it was bullshit. I left shortly after that.

We have discussed this in depth and we both agree she has anxiety, depression, she has key symptoms of being on the autism scale and she has OCD  (Not bs OCD like actually OCD) we both has studied psych.   shes reverting back to unhealthy coping mechanisms (drinking, suicidal ideation, thinking of self harm). I have tried to get her to see a doctor in the past but she refuses to.     She says she doesn't want to be medicated for life and be a guinea pig. 

Being medicated for my mental disabilities saved my life.  Im the best version of me I've ever been.  It took a few years to get my meds just right but it was worth every step. I take 8+ pills daily, if I miss a day its bad but not nearly as bad as being uneducated.

68,"A little over a week ago, I had terrible luck and dropped my phone through that crack between the elevator doors and down an elevator shaft down one floor in the building I live in. I immediately filed an insurance claim for a new phone as I was certain it was not possible to retrieve. I listed on the claim that it was lost/stolen. 

I went to speak with my apartment management the next morning, and I was told by two employees that I would be responsible for paying for the elevator company to come out and help retrieve it. I felt like I would just be better off at eating the cost of the insurance deductible and get my new phone the next day. 

Cut to today, I receive an email that’s sent to all residents of the apartment complex that said they found my phone. 

Is there anything I can do that would allow me to A. Keep the phone for future use if God forbid something happens to the one I have now or B. Return my old or new phone (depending on if it’s damaged, I haven’t seen it yet) and get the $250 back? Or C.

69,"So, I (23M) need to know if IATA... My mother and I are constantly fighting... Our relationship have always been like that, at least since my preadolescence. I have a kind of angry trigger talking to her, and I don't know why... For the last couple of months I have decided to be better and improved in many aspects, but this relationship is still stagnated. There are some things that I remember be always complaining about in our relationship, that I'll list here:
    If I'm upset or if I have a problem, she doesn't listen to me, she's too reactive, often she has a opinion that come out of her mouth before she thinks about it, mostly she says that she can't do anything about it, or she just spits some black and white opinion. I never open up with her, I can't since I was a kid, because I'm afraid of the consequences, we probably end up fighting again over nothing. 
    Always telling the truth was a thing that she always reinforced at home, I have been faithful to that, but I started omitting and avoiding her. Since at age of 10yo I stopped talking to her, and she doesn't even noticed until I was heading to college.
     She punished me when I was a teen for trying marijuana even though she told me these days that she had smoked (for the 4th time in her life) two years before that. She said many times ""Do it as I say, but not as I do"" when I confronted her with some issues of the past.
     She doesn't uses direct communication: she always ask if I want to do something, when she wants me to do it;  she asks me if I have cleaned the house, when she notice that I did... And so on.. This examples are not the usual fighting starter stuff, but this way of communicating really bothers me in many situations... Because she speaks always in a subtle and indirect ways...
   Last week, I had a presentation in english (to my english class for non native students), and I said clearly that I didn't want her to hear me speaking. Later she said that she liked to listen to me (behind the door), plus she put my sister on the phone to hear it too. This is a small issue, but I feel that when she wants or do something, the means are always justifiable to her.
    I could mentioned other things that happens between us but I don't want to make this longer than it is by now.
    everyday, she comes home after work, I don't want to talk to her, and she comes in a very passive way, ""did you eat?"", ""what are you cooking?"", ""did you cleaned the house?"". Then I just get angry and avoidant, and I can't look her in the eyes..
      I don't think that it's just a normal issue, like "" this angry is normal at your age"", or ""just mother's stuff"". It's not a bad relationship like she wants to kill me or something, but the problems are very subtles, and hard to speak about, and the relationship is very draining because of that. I'm often confused if I exaggerated in my angry responses or if she actually have part in the problem and I'm not the crazy, spoiled son and this is not just regular mom stuff.
     I'm currently considering that she and/or me have BPD/NPD traits.

I'd appreciate an input about this situation",09Oct2020,1
70,"Alright, so here's the deal. Moved about a year ago in a duplex, well triplex. I have one half of a house and the other side is split into up stairs down stairs. Either way, on the bottom floor is this older guy, seems normal and friendly. Whatever, makes me food every once in awhile brings it over no big deal. I've spoken with when I see him or whatever. No big deal. 

Now, it didn't take me long to guess he was probably gay. Certain mannerisms and just generally seemed gay. I don't care, nothing wrong with that. I thought initially maybe he was just being nice to me cause he had had a son who died a few years back.

Continuing on tho, I had agreed to come over to dinner because he had invited a couple older ladies over as well. One of which son's was currently dying, so it was like a support thing I guess. This went on a few times a week for I dunno a month or two? 

Growing quite tired of spending time with these people, due to be extremely introverted and not being able to handle that much interaction, I skipped a couple times. Pretended to be asleep after work, because I'm also terrible at saying no.

One night I actually napped and agreed to stop by to be. He wouldn't shut up and went on for way longer than I wanted him to, either way I stuck it out. Mentioned something about being tired and he made a comment similar to ""oh, I could take you to bed"". Now, b6e did it in a joking manner, but I knew this was a red flag. 

I didn't make much of it though at the time, played it off and left shortly after.

Now, here comes the where things get weird. He figures out who I am on grindr. Yes, I'm not openly gay, I'm at that age where I'm trying to figure myself out I guess. Either way, tries to message me I don't think I said anything. 

Few weeks later sort of been ignoring him, because I didn't enjoy talking to him in general before. Now it's just weird. My car was having terrible one day and he happened to be coming outside around the same time. Really didn't want to have him take me to work, but I didn't have any other option. Blah blah admits that's he's gay and he knows I know black blah. Says he doesn't care of whatever I'm just trying to get to work. 

Later that day or the next or whatever he knocks and says he's glad we cleared the air or whatever. Then goes on about how he thinks I wanna play with him cause I guess I made some sort of flirtatious gesture with my hands in my shorts pocket or something. I dunno.

Either way that was the end of it for me and I have avoided him at all costs for probably a month now. He keeps leaving me letters and other random shit I don't really want. Finally opened one he left like an hour ago and there's a $1500 check inside. 

Not gonna read the letters cause I don't care about what he has to say. Now, the right thing I feel is to return them check to his mailbox and make a statement that I'm not gonna be bought. But $1500 is a lot of money I could do something important with. But I really don't want it and I just need someone to tell me that's the smart move.

Tl;dr old creepy gay neighbor gave me $1500 as an apology",09Oct2020,1
71,"My dad is extremely gassy. He drinks milk and soda right out of the container, and he farts nastily. He rips about 5000 farts every day. When he walks down the stairs in the morning, he stomps really heavily, and I can hear him squeezing out squeaky farts. When he is watching TV, he just farts loud stink bombs, and I can hear it from the other side of the house. He farts really loud in the bathroom, and the sound echoes across the house. When he showers, he farts a lot as well.

He drinks a lot of milk, and he is lactose intolerant. I can't imagine why someone would purposely irritate their digestive system. I bet he's just doing it to make other people angry. For example, he would walk past someone, squat down, and release several gross farts. Or maybe he is in front of someone, and he lifts his butt up and farts in their face. I don't know why my dad has to be so disgusting. 

Every time my family goes out to eat at the local restaurant, my dad orders about 40 hamburgers, 80 slices of pizza, 50 steaks, 100 milkshakes, 400 bottles of beer, and 30 slices of cake. After he eats, he rips out an enormous fart that resonates for about 10 minutes. It's so loud and expensive to do that. I don't even know what is wrong with the wiring in his brain.

Finally, his clothes smell terrible. His underwear and pants smell nasty due to his farts. My mom often throws away his underwear because they stink. When my dad sits on the couch, he farts really aggressively, and the odor sinks in the fabric. It's really hard to remove the odor, so we just buy a new couch every day.",09Oct2020,1

74,"Hi guys! Just in need of a bit of advice or what worked best for you if you have ever experienced something similar!
it’s about body image and plz lmk if I need to put a TW. 

So basically I am a bit upset about how my body has become to look over the last few months. I’ve gained some weight and I’m at my heaviest I’ve ever been. I’ve developed stretch marks on my stomach and arms as well as inner thighs. I know this is normal so most times I’m not too fussed about it nor will I call them imperfections, I have just never had them before. The issue is that I’m currently living back at home (thanks Rona 🙄) and my family are always the ones to comment on my body. They will point out how I need to lose weight and how I need to eat better and what not. They’ve done this for YEARS so I’ve never truly been happy with my body since the age of like 13/14. I am a naturally curvy person, so a part of it is genetics too. Sometimes I look at the photos of myself when I was 12-19 and I can’t believe how much I should’ve loved my body then but I was also receiving those “you should lose weight” comments then too. So basically regardless of my size or weight they will unnecessarily comment on it. The thing is that I’ve always been a person who eats moderately well and goes to the gym regularly (I just came back from HIIT Rn). I don’t diet nor restrict food nor do I eat junk food like every day. I want to love my body more and I’m starting to day by day, but it just hurts me when they say unnecessary comments. Like Especiqlly since it’s becoming summer and I hate wearing shorts bc they don’t make them to suit my body fit (slim waist, big hips) so I’m becoming a bit insecure about it. I really really want to move out again bc I find that I felt probably more confident and I didn’t have someone nit picking it everything I did or ate. Also I sometimes yell at them to stop commenting on my body bc it’s mine not there’s and so thankfully they haven’t said anything for the last few weeks but looking into the mirror sometimes and/or deciding what to wear makes me feel sad. 

Also I should add I have PCOS so it’s harder for me to lose weight, if you guys know what that is.",09Oct2020,1

76,"Hello
I am in need of some advice... some back story about me. I love dogs. I am the type of person that will tear up when I see a dog on the street. I have wanted to get a dog of my own for as long as I can remember, and my partner of 9 years wants to get one as well.

We are currently living with my partners mother and his two brothers, what with COVID making it impossible to move out and my partner has taken a pay cut. We pay all of the bills as rent is expensive, as well as buy groceries occasionally.

Now more then ever, my partner and I are looking to buy a dog, as we are both at home. 

Over this past week, my mother in law has been pushing us to buy a dog, saying it would be great to have a family dog and that she will take it with her everywhere etc.

Here is where I am not sure if I am overreacting...

My mother in law is the type of person that would love to play with the dog, but will do nothing to help take care of it- basically getting all the fun parts of having a dog without having any responsibility.

Also, she owned a dog about 4 years ago that she neglected to no end (stayed on a small balcony, never walked, shown no attention) and she was happy when it died because, her words “she wouldn’t need to look after it any more”

Don’t get me wrong, I am very grateful she is letting us stay with her during this time, but I have waited my whole life to have a dog that is just mine, and have been waiting till I am financially stable enough to look after a dog correctly. 

Am i over reacting about this???",09Oct2020,1
77,"Never taken drugs/alcohol. No smoking. Don’t do any sports or physical activities really. 

After months of tests and scans I finally got told I might have bell clapper syndrome (?). I was told that I should be okay and they did a final physical exam to check if the fat tissue around my testicles were enough and they said it was.

Im just worried because he said if I do experience dull aches I don’t need to worry but if I experience a severe pain that causes vomiting or nausea or makes it difficult to walk I should go to A and E ASAP. 

He mentioned getting surgery to fix it but explained the risks of surgery are basically the same risks if I don’t get surgery. I could experience a pain my entire life, a discomfort due to the stitches and infertility. 

I don’t know if I want the surgery. It’s been a day since the appointment and I’m already experience the pains again. And I’m also panicking because what qualifies as a dull ache and what qualifies as severe? What if it is severe but I don’t feel like it is? What if it’s a dull ache but it’s actually doing a lot of damage and i ignore it? 

I also don’t want to go to the hospital again. I’m so exhausted of it. Every few weeks for the past 6 months I went to A and E or to an appointment only for them to check and say I’m fine and there’s no torsion. Nothing wrong. I’m sick of feeling like an idiot. Sick of feeling the pains and sick of doctors looking at me as if I’m fucking lying to them. I’m just so sick of it all. 

Part of me really would like to just get the surgery, who gives a shit if I become infertile, not getting surgery could also result in infertility and I’ve never had an interest in having kids. I just want the pain to stop but I’d hate to get the surgery onto to experience a NEW life long pain. The doctor told me around my age is when it usually stops for people and if I still have the pains in a few months or years then we can rediscuss the surgery. 

I’m so scared that what if the pain will go away and stop but I get the surgery before it does and then live with a different pain? What if I just sit and wait for it to go away but it never does? What if my testicle dies because I didn’t find the pain that bad? I just wanna fucking sleep. With the stress of my health, the stress of school and the stress of family issues piling up it’s all becoming too much. I hate it so much.",09Oct2020,1
78,"I'm a veteran and have been struggling with being suicidal for nearly 2 weeks. A week and a half ago I reached out to my best friend and told her I was suicidal and needed a friend. Her response was, ""I'm so sorry. I wish you would have told me sooner."" I've been in touch with my therapist and the Veterans Crisis Line but have been struggling because of what has happened with this friend of mine. You see, she recently had a friend from out of state come down and visit her and during that time I spoke to her once via FaceTime. I initiated it. It was very brief because as she said ""she had to get back to"" her friend and would talk to me later. That was the last I heard from her. That was nearly a week ago. I know nothing bad has happened to her because of all the posts she's been posting on Facebook and Instagram. Her friend went home a few days ago.

79,"I’ve been in a 18-month long distance relationship with my exgf. I’m in Europe and she’s in California. The relationship was always rocky and on/off with breaks initiated on her end.

Prior to her, I never had a girlfriend but I did have friends with benefits, as well as one night stands. My ex lost her virginity to me at age 24 (she had been Christian, then deconverted and met me around the same time). She always felt resentful of my “promiscuous” and “colorful” past, while she had been holding out for her future husband, and felt “betrayed” that I had not waited for her.

When we first met in person, the sex was mind blowing because there was such an emotional connection. She was the first woman I’ve ever loved, and the first time I’ve made love to someone, not just fucked. It was bonding and unforgettable.

I know during that first trip, however, she felt dissatisfied with the lack of physical affection, especially in public. It’s embarrassing but she’s actually the first woman I ever held hands with in public at age 29.. the first woman I’ve gone on true dates with, etc. I’m not naturally good with physical affection like that, especially since I never had a gf or truly dated someone. I did do my best to please her but I could tell she wasn’t fully satisfied.

After I went back home, the relationship got a bit rocky for several reasons, but I never stopped loving her.

A few months after the first trip, I went back to California to visit her for 9 days. During that second trip she was more vocal about her complaints about me.. especially the lack of physical affection. I’m new at a relationship so I did do my best but some things don’t come naturally to me, like holding hands all the time.

I felt unappreciated and taken for granted, so sometimes I wasn’t in the mood for sex. I think she initiated like 2-3 times but I turned her down gently. But one time she actually broke down crying, asking if I didn’t find her attractive or desirable, which wasn’t the case. I was physically attracted to my exgf, but I just wasn’t in the mood because we had been arguing and I felt like she treated me poorly.. I felt unloved.

When I returned home again, that’s when shit hit the fan. She started digging in my past if i desired my previous fwbs more than her, that I couldn’t satisfy her sexually, that I was selfish in bed, etc.

Ultimately she broke up with me. During that breakup, I really missed her and didn’t even think about being with anyone else. I was trying to move on but I couldn’t. About 3 weeks after, I reached out to her again, only to find out she had actually fucked another guy and they were casually dating.

We sort of mended things, she broke things off with that guy. The next months were brutal. She kept digging in my past again and started hurling abusive words towards me, comparing me to this recent guy. How he was a “sex machine” and how he made her cum every time, how he was generous in bed and how I was lazy. How they had multiple sessions while I rejected her. How he was all over her and made her feel beautiful and desired.

Eventually she broke up with me again... then fucked a new guy. I found this out when again, I reached out to her hoping to mend things, and then she told me what she did. During all this time, even during the breaks, I have never been with anyone else.

Tldr: exgf blames me for breaking up and fucking other guys because I didn’t please her enough with affection and intimacy, and she felt undesirable. Is what she said valid? Am I to blame for her breaking up with me and then fucking other dudes? Is it because I didn’t give her enough affection and intimacy?",09Oct2020,1

I took her to the same park I always take her when I walk her, on the other side of the block. On the way back home, this older man, who was also walking his dog, started talking to me, asking me questions about my dog and cracking jokes. His humour and sense of character was exotic, for lack of a better term. He was cooky, and had this round, crystal-like glasses that looked trippy when you put them on. He just looked cool, I suppose, like a hippie, and had an eccentric personality. We got caught up in conversation, talking about our dogs, then talking about our life experiences and all sorts of stuff. 

He was 63yo, and he asked me how old I was, and I told him I was 18yo. I just turned 18 in March this year, and I live on my own with my roommate, who's pregnant and has a 10 month old baby already. He asked me to pull my mask down, if I felt comfortable, so he could see my face, so I did. He wasn't wearing a mask. And he told me I looked really cute for a young girl, and I just. Shifted uncomfortable and corrected him, ""Uhm.. I'm, uh, actually a boy."" ""Oh you are?"" ""Y-yeah."" ""Really??"" ""Yes, I'm a boy."" ""Oh, I didn't know that. I'm sorry, it's just that you look so feminine!"" And then I told him I was trans ftm, bc I thought I needed to defend why I'm feminine and explain that it's bc I'm trans. Which was stupid bc I don't like or want to tell people I'm trans like that, especially people idk bc it's dangerous, and idky I felt the need to tell him. But I told him, and then he made a joke and said, ""Once you get your new equipment (referring to once I get lower surgery), maybe I can test it out for you. Haha, I'm just kidding!"" 

We continued our conversation and talked there on the street for at least an hour or so, and then he said, ""Man, I gotta get home, I feel like I'm gonna pass out on the street. So I'll talk to you later."" And I nodded and just said, ""Alrighty,"" and thought that that would be the end of our interaction, but he didn't leave, he kept talking. He bent down and tried to pet my dog but she was timid of him, as she is with every stranger and people she doesn't know very well. And then we were both sitting on the ground of the sidewalk, still talking. Then he said, ""I'm probably boring you. I should let you get going."" I just laughed a little bit and said, ""Well, I'm enjoying the conversation,"" bc I felt bad that he thought that I was bored. I did thoroughly and genuinely enjoy the conversation we were having, and didn't wanna be rude in any way, so I said that to reassure him that he wasn't boring me. And then he asked, ""Are you busy right now?"" I said no. Then he asked, ""Do you wanna come back to my place to continue the conversation? We can have a couple of beers if you want."" I just said, ""Yeah, sure,"" despite the red flags and the alarms that were blaring loudly in the back of my mind. 

I wanted to say no. I was screaming at myself to say no, and that I wanted to go home, but everything I wanted to actually say to him, the exact opposite is what left my mouth. It felt like the conversation was going by too fast for me to actually process and fully understand what was happening. 

So, I go back with him to his house, which wasn't far. He lived right in front of the park that I take Cali to. He took me into his room bc he said, ""You might feel more comfortable in my room than in the living room. At least, I feel more comfortable. That way you don't have to interact with my roommate if he comes out."" I just went with it. He took me into his room, and I sat on the ground, Cali wedging herself into my lap. She was tense and shaking and kept growling at the man a few times, then looking back up at me and whining. She didn't wanna be there. She wanted to go home. But I stayed with him. He offered me a beer, handing me the can. I took the can, but didn't open it. I just kept staring at it and picking the tab. I never drank before. Alcohol makes me nervous. I didn't wanna start drinking and I didn't want this to be the story of the first time I drank. So, I just set it aside, but he kept insisting that I at least give it a sip and try it. But I refused, and told him I was too nervous to do it, since I had never drank before. Idk what to expect, and idk how much it would take to even get me buzzed, and I didn't want to accidentally get drunk. Idk what I'm like when I'm drunk, and there's the risk that I could wake up the next day and not remember anything. Not remembering gives me anxiety, and I told him that. He did still press it a little bit, but seemed to be patient with it, adding a, ""I'm not gonna force you."" And then he also said, after I expressed to him my nervousness with alcohol, he said, ""I wonder if it's bc you're not comfortable with me. But I mean, I'm not gonna do anything to you, I hope you know that."" I told him, ""I know that. I mean, I trust you and I feel comfortable with you. I don't think you'd do anything to me, but I think maybe it's bc we're still acquaintances. I would probably be more comfortable to drink with my friends, instead, bc I don't know how I am with alcohol, at all. But I do know weed. I think maybe if it were weed, that'd be another story."" Bc I have done weed before, and I know what I'm like when I'm high, and I know I wouldn't forget anything and I'd still remember everything. I didn't expected him to pull out some bud and a pot brownie, but he did, and we shared a pipe and I ate some of the pot brownie. 

While we were getting high, he emphasized again, ""I'm not getting you drugged up to knock you up, so I hope you're not thinking that."" I shook my head and said, ""No, I'm not. I know that."" He kept making subtle hints towards that same topic throughout the night, mad even said, ""I'm not going to do anything to you (translation: I'm not going to have sex with you), unless you want me to,"" holding his hands up the way one would when the cops tell you to put your hands up. At some point in the night, he asked me, ""Do you still have your female junk?"" I said, yeah, I did, and that I was debating whether or not to get bottom surgery bc I'm still unsure about if that's something I want, and he said, ""I would just go for the full thing. That way, when you meet a girl, you can have good sex with her."" He was supportive and encouraging the surgery. 

We continued to talk and talk, going in depth in conversation, him showing me all his knickknacks and talking about his interests, and I opened up to him and told him my whole life story. This man knows more about me than I would feel comfortable with a stranger knowing. He knows how my bio parents abused me and all sorts of shit like that. He knows a good 90% of it. At some point, I had to put the conversation on pause bc I had to text my boyfriend. I texted him earlier in the night, telling him I was in a stranger's home, and didn't respond to him for several hours bc I was too caught up in talking to this dude, and he was worried. So I explained to the guy, ""I have to text my bf bc he's worried about me and wants to make sure I'm safe."" And he said, ""Oh, you have a bf?"" I said, ""Yeah, I do."" ""Oh, that's great. I'm so happy for you. I'm so glad that you found someone, bc it's so hard to find a good mate in this world.""

Time passed by so quickly, that it was now 3am, and I was high off my ass. I didn't feel comfortable walking the streets to get back home by myself while high off my ass bc I didn't wanna risk someone else stopping me and taking advantage of the fact that I was high, so I asked this dude to walk me home, bc I figured I'd be safer with him walking me home than by myself. When we get the steps that lead to the front door of my apartment, he started to say, ""Wow, it's just so crazy how we connected so well. It's like we're best friends who have t seen each other in a long time, and we're finally meeting and catching up. Man, can I hug you?"" And he hugged me like 3 times. His hugs were soft and gentle, and he hugged me around my shoulders, no lower. And when I looked him in the face, making direct eye contact, his eyes looked soft and caring, holding some sense of a genuine feeling behind them. And he gave me his number to contact him whenever I want, and told me that if anyone in this town ever fucks with me or tries to give me any problems, to call him, that he would protect me. Something about his face reminded me of my biological father, and I don't know why. And then I got inside, went to my room, and then that's when I started to process what happened. Regardless if I'm high or not, I can never process things that are happening while they're happening, in the moment. It's always afterwards that I can understand it. It was only when I got back to my room that I realized that I could have been in a dangerous situation and that I put my roommate and her babies in danger by showing him where we lived. In the moment, I had the thought in the back of my mind that, maybe, I shouldn't be doing this. I kept thinking, ""What am I doing? Am I really doing this rn? I feel like I shouldn't be doing this. Haven't your parents taught you not to talk to strangers?"" while it was happening, but I couldn't fully process or understand those thoughts until afterwards. Despite that running in the back of my mind, int he moment, I felt like I trust him. I felt comfortable around him. I didn't see or feel anything that necessarily told me I was in danger. It wasn't until after I got home that I realized I could have been in danger, or I could have been preyed on. 

I tried to talk to my friends about it afterwards, but no one wanted to talk to me bc I was high. The next day, in the morning, I told my roommate what had happened, and she told me that I was in danger, that he was preying on me, or trying to prey on me, that he was making an attempt at grooming me bc, ""He doesn't see you as a guy. He sees you as a girl, bc you have a female body, and he just wants to get inside your pants bc he's a predator. He was trying to reassure you to make you trust him. He making those jokes to test the waters to see what you were comfortable with, and then gradually over time, he'll try to coerce you into having sex with him, to get you to consent, bc people like him wanna do it on your terms."" 

Later on in the day, I was still talking to my roommate about it. I had been talking about it all day with her, bc it was still on my mind and it was upsetting me. While, I was talking to her, the guy showed up to our place unannounced. We had our door open to cool off the house inside, so he was standing in the doorway, and I was in the hallway in plain sight. And he said hi to me, told me he was gonna head to the 99¢ store, and then to Vons, and asked me if wanted to come and walk with him.  I told him that I was hanging out with my roommate, and that's when she stepped in between us and told him, ""Listen, I don't want you showing up here unannounced like this. I don't want you here, I don't know you, there's a pandemic. I don't want you at my house."" And he got all defensive at that, saying, ""Well, I've got my mask,"" and, ""SHE's got my number, SHE can contact me whenever SHE wants,"" and then told my roommate his name, as if that would solve the issue, and when my roommate told him, ""I'm not debating you, I want you to leave,"" he said, ""I'll leave when I wanna leave!"" Then he just continued to yell and cuss at her, and then left, I guess. But my roommate called the cops on him, which made me have a panic attack bc I hate police and, y'know, ACAB. The police didn't provide any solace when they showed up bc the guy had already left, and they just told me, ""Just tell them to fuck off next time that happens."" And then they left. But he hasn't showed his face here again, thankfully. 

But I feel guilty bc I feel like it was my fault, that I put myself in this situation, that I put my roommate and her babies in danger, that I LET it happen, and I'm blaming myself bc I fucking KNEW better than to do that shit. I'm SMARTER than that, I knew not to do that shit before it happened, and I always try to prepare and plan what I'm gonna say for in case something like that does happen, and my preparation failed me. But also, what if he was being genuine about not doing anything, and that it was just two dudes having a smoke? Idk, it's so fucking confusing and I can't get my head wrapped around it. I feel guilty for being honest with the police, I feel guilty that the police even showed up at all, I feel guilty for putting myself in this predicament and doing this to myself, I feel guilty for potential putting my roommate and her babies at risk, I feel guilty for texting my friends and bf while I was high, I just feel like shit all around, and I feel like it's entirely my own fault. No one's mad at me. My roommate and bf are understanding and don't blame me or out me at fault in the slightest and have been telling me that it was something out of my control. My friends just didn't wanna talk to me while I was high, despite the fact that I was as present as I would have been while sober, but I can understand their reasoning behind it, it just hurt bc I really needed someone to talk to, and it just made me feel guilty for being high.

82,"I am posting this on behalf of my girlfriend as we are both looking for advice on what to do.

So, my girlfriend 25F told me, when she's never told anyone before, that she was molested by her grandfather and her adoptive father until the age of 15. Her mother did not know any of what happened until about June when my gf told her mom just about her grandfather. 

She reacted out of anger at first and was ready to call the cops but as time passed she grew to forgive him and sort of move on from it. Fast forward, a month or two later my gf finally told her mother about her husband and what he had done. The mother first reacted out of pure anger which was expected, but the next day, she was acting like everything was fine and that she forgives her husband. 

She is now acting like my gf and myself are to blame and everyone but her ""husband"" is in the wrong and how her husband ""is so relieved that this secret is all out and can finally be at peace."" Apparently her husband has made peace with God and my girlfriend and himself. 

Her mom does not want my gf to tell anyone especially  her siblings or her church(p.s the molester pedophile husband is a lead elder at their church).. She is saying to my girlfriend ""how would you like it if I went out and aired your dirty  laundry, people that need to know about this already know ""

We were hoping to get some normal people's  reaction to this and how my gf should go about handling this. She has blocked her mom and ""dad"" from trying to reach her but her mom is persistent by making multiple Instagram accounts and calling from different phone numbers.",09Oct2020,1

I often feel intensely frustrated with myself and envious of other people for being more awesome than me. I’m not bitter or resentful just... pained. I feel regret and longing. 

I don’t know why I can’t just be happy and grateful. I have a lot going for me. But I’m not anywhere near where I want to be or who I want to be. 

It’s so stupid of me because I know that all the people I envy, whether  for their so called “talent,” their job, their clothes, their perfect body, their artistic or creative skills, their wit, their resilience, their people skills, etc., worked their asses of to achieve that stuff while I wasted time and did nothing. I totally get that but it doesn’t motivate me. I just feel embarrassed and upset and painfully disappointed (in my self), aware that they are better, did better in life than me. They earned it and they deserve it but that just makes me feel worse. They have become and have achieved things I just fantasized and longed for.

It’s not usually for their status or money or family or life circumstances. It’s usually more intangible qualities, like who they are, their brilliance, wit, sense of style, or humor, or their talents or work ethic or hard earned success, their seemingly better personality, virtues, coolness, and just the life that THEY HAVE CULTIVATED AND EARNED. I don’t know It’s not like the kind of jealousy where I feel it’s unfair but it feels like a painful wistful longing combined with anger at myself knowing full well I could have had that had I put in the work. But I still fantasize about how I wish I could change everything.

It’s not that I think those people are just lucky. I know they worked hard and face their own challenges but that doesn’t help me not feel jealous it just makes me feel even more upset because not only do I not have what they have but it’s my fault. It’s not that I don’t believe I can change it’s just that I know it will take a long time and they are so far ahead. It’s also that I am jealous, not just their accomplishments, but of the admiration, attention, praise and “love” they receive for their success/accomplishments. I know they deserve it and earned it but I want it too nonetheless. Well it feels like I need it. And now. But that’s irrational and greedy, I know.",09Oct2020,1

I did not answer. I regret my decision. Only five people saw the story (possibly six) and I don’t know what to do.

85,"Basically, I (15F) was planning on dressing up as a member of a very well known Asian band, even though I myself am not Asian. I'm only basing my costume off of an outfit that this member wore in the group's most recent music video. I'm not changing anything about my appearance, such as my skin color, hair, eye shape, etc. Said outfit isn't any clothing specific to that culture, such as a kimono. It's just matching shirt, pants, and baseball cap with a pair of sunglasses and white shoes. 

I want to know whether or not this would be considered cultural appropriation and/or an offensive costume. I've done research, but I couldn't really find anything specific to answer my question, so I am still unsure and want some clarification. Halloween is still a couple weeks away, so I just want to make sure that my costume is okay so that I have time to change it if it isn't.

87,"My cousin and I are close in age and get along pretty well.  Since we live in different countries, we don't see each other often but text/talk a lot. Last week I was telling him about this really nice guy I matched with on a dating app and he 'jokingly' asked me not to talk to him because he was Muslim (I am a non-religious Hindu). I didn't want to start an argument so brushed it off but did express my disapproval. Well I brought this guy up again yesterday and my cousin says 'Don't talk with that Muslim (n-word)'. I was so taken aback and disgusted but I simply said 'Don't be racist' so he would back off. Well my cousin 'jokingly' says 'yea I'm racist'. He has always been anti-muslim but never so bluntly and he isn't homophobic, sexist etc i.e- otherwise a pretty normal person. I haven't responded to him for a couple of days and he keeps messaging me (out of guilt maybe?)

Im wondering if it would be petty to move in with friends or family until he gets better (optimism). Im given food and shelter so I dont know if this is just me being privileged and over-reacting, or if its a genuine issue that I should get away from. Feel free to ask any questions :)",09Oct2020,1

I don’t mind that my content goes to other countries but my engagement is so low, it gets like 3000+ views but I get maybe 30 likes and those 30 people that liked my vid are all obviously not from the US(which is were I am) so they don’t even understand what I’m saying or doing cause of the language difference. It’s been like 3 days of this. I checked my analytics and it’s not even just 25% it’s like 85% of my “audience reached” that’s just from Pakistani. I’m getting so frustrated because it’s really disheartening. I puts so much effort into my vids and it’s like it doesn’t matter cause no one even knows what I’m saying.

90,"The reasons why I hate working out are:
- It reminds me of my naturally skinny friends, who all also had histories of anorexia. I have also had a history of them making fun of me for my stomach. (I am not as skinny as them, as I have no waist, large torso, and I'm short, however, compared to a lot of the population, I am quite skinny.)

- I am also Asian, and grew in a toxic community continually being compared with other Asian girls who were skinnier than myself.

- I know that I have to do this to be HEALTHY, not necessarily because I have to lose weight or have a slimmer figure. Despite this, I keep thinking that I have get skinnier whenever I workout, which makes me angry and hate the rest of my workout.

Any ideas on how to pull away from the resentment that I'm somehow associating with working out? I really just want to workout just to be healthy, but by the end of it, I end up crying and angry and in a bad mood for the rest of the night.",09Oct2020,1

97,"I’ve been in a 18-month long distance relationship with my exgf. I’m in Europe and she’s in California. The relationship was always rocky and on/off with breaks initiated on her end.

Prior to her, I never had a girlfriend but I did have friends with benefits, as well as one night stands. My ex lost her virginity to me at age 24 (she had been Christian, then deconverted and met me around the same time). She always felt resentful of my “promiscuous” and “colorful” past, while she had been holding out for her future husband, and felt “betrayed” that I had not waited for her.

When we first met in person, the sex was mind blowing because there was such an emotional connection. She was the first woman I’ve ever loved, and the first time I’ve made love to someone, not just fucked. It was bonding and unforgettable.

I know during that first trip, however, she felt dissatisfied with the lack of physical affection, especially in public. It’s embarrassing but she’s actually the first woman I ever held hands with in public at age 29.. the first woman I’ve gone on true dates with, etc. I’m not naturally good with physical affection like that, especially since I never had a gf or truly dated someone. I did do my best to please her but I could tell she wasn’t fully satisfied.

After I went back home, the relationship got a bit rocky for several reasons, but I never stopped loving her.

A few months after the first trip, I went back to California to visit her for 9 days. During that second trip she was more vocal about her complaints about me.. especially the lack of physical affection. I’m new at a relationship so I did do my best but some things don’t come naturally to me, like holding hands all the time.

I felt unappreciated and taken for granted, so sometimes I wasn’t in the mood for sex. I think she initiated like 2-3 times but I turned her down gently. But one time she actually broke down crying, asking if I didn’t find her attractive or desirable, which wasn’t the case. I was physically attracted to my exgf, but I just wasn’t in the mood because we had been arguing and I felt like she treated me poorly.. I felt unloved.

When I returned home again, that’s when shit hit the fan. She started digging in my past if i desired my previous fwbs more than her, that I couldn’t satisfy her sexually, that I was selfish in bed, etc.

Ultimately she broke up with me. During that breakup, I really missed her and didn’t even think about being with anyone else. I was trying to move on but I couldn’t. About 3 weeks after, I reached out to her again, only to find out she had actually fucked another guy and they were casually dating.

We sort of mended things, she broke things off with that guy. The next months were brutal. She kept digging in my past again and started hurling abusive words towards me, comparing me to this recent guy. How he was a “sex machine” and how he made her cum every time, how he was generous in bed and how I was lazy. How they had multiple sessions while I rejected her. How he was all over her and made her feel beautiful and desired.

Eventually she broke up with me again... then fucked a new guy. I found this out when again, I reached out to her hoping to mend things, and then she told me what she did. During all this time, even during the breaks, I have never been with anyone else.

Tldr: exgf blames me for breaking up and fucking other guys because I didn’t please her enough with affection and intimacy, and she felt undesirable. Is what she said valid? Am I to blame for her breaking up with me and then fucking other dudes? Is it because I didn’t give her enough affection and intimacy?",09Oct2020,1
98,"Okay so I'm a 29(f) 

I drink a fair amount socially with family and friends and I smoke weed on a somewhat regular basis. 

 Have done since the age of about 16. I'm from the UK, u know we like to drink lol. 
 So anyway, I've been offered cocaine loads of times over the years and always have had a slight curiosity but never felt comfortable around the people to actually give it a go. So have always refused  

Well that was up until last year when a new freind of mine came over for drinks and after a few became very open about the fact that she dabbles from time to time and would I mind if she got some. So I trust her, I like her, I'm like cool. Watch her do a few hits and think fuckit. I'll give it a go. Instantly I felt like the love struck emoji on what's app looool I was instantly buzzed. I loved it. Well the thing is, I think I liked it to much because we ended up ""on it"" for 2 days straight. Easily spent around £300 

Since then, I've done it a few times but not alot alot defo less then 10 separate occasions. But when I do it I get so angry when its finished. And I always seem to have a bender for a few days. 
It's never just a line or 2. It's like bang bang bang I feel SO in control and confident. I love this version of myself

But I have a very addictive nature and sometimes when I'm in a bad emotional state it's the first thing i want to do, i haven't YET which I'm glad for but now I've admitted to doing it it's become a social thing, i didnt realise how many people around me was into it. it's like I've been admitted into some sort of secret society. Now it's being suggested most nights which makes me nervous because I dont want to say no deep down. 

What shall I do  ? Continue to control myself and just have my random binges or just test myself and try and stay away or start doing it by myself in smaller sessions so I dont keep bindgeing out",09Oct2020,1

101,"About 8 months ago my partner of 8 years left me for her boss. I don’t blame her, I was a mess. Depressed gaining tons of weight, stressed, overworked, not communicating in any way. Pretty much just vacant and trying to get through each day in one piece. I do blame her for the gaslighting, lying and probable cheating that I could never confirm 100%. But whatever I know I played a large part in its failure. So I had to move out and not ever see our cat again and basically had nothing to take with me. Then I lost my job. One of the biggest reasons I started failing in our relationship so much. Then COVID hits and my industry basically dies overnight.

So moved back with parents and started a weight loss journey and tried everyday not to fall into a black hole of despair. Fast forward a few months getting some massive weight loss  and some semblance of normalcy. and I get a puppy. He’s the shining light of happiness and I adore him. First time I had a dog since I was a teen. We are inseparable and as I get into shape I decide to finally take this cross country bike trip I’d wanted to do for years. What could be better then taking my best bud along with me. 3 months on the road biking and camping and hangin out. He is adventure pup, now 5 months old adjusted to his bike trailer, loves kayaking and riding on my back and is chill with everything so long as he with me. Leave on my trip. Day 3 he yanks on leash and runs into traffic and dies. I watch the whole thing. Horrifying. Can’t get the images out of my head. Trip of my dreams is now my worst nightmare and I’m not sure I can experience pain any more severe then this chasm of loneliness. 

It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have put him into a situation where he could get hurt. I failed him and he’s dead now. He was only 5 months but I felt like he was the best part of me. 

That was today.",09Oct2020,1

103,"Hello.

I want to get help for someone in my family. He’s been struggling for the past 5 years.
I just want to live a free life. I don’t want to be prisoned. I’m young too.

I’m just scared of the fact that If I try, I can make it worse. Worsen my life at the same time and harm my family even more. 

I have to be the one most likely trying to solve my family member’s mental issue.

He’s unpredictable.  He’s not a normal person. 

My family is continually being deprived of our time, energy, and our own money. 

He’s practically killing himself with the life style he has. (junk food, no exercise, internet dweller, cannot take constructive criticism, always leaves me and my mom, dad to do his own shit)

I’m fed up. However. I’m just disappointed.

I just need advice on how I can solve my family members’s mental illness, without potentially worsening the situation.
Please ask for any clarification, I will do anything to resolve my brother, he’s the future of my family.

108,"My Dad died in June. Im 21. He was my biggest supporter and my confidant. My entire world. Despite the fact that he was a little estranged and a heavy drinker, he was my favorite man on this earth. I really couldn't handle it when he died and had no idea how to react or what to do. I ended up leaving my girlfriend in the wake of it all because I didn't want anyone to be there in support of me, didn't want to burden anyone. I don't even remember doing it.

She and I started dating last June. Our first kiss and ""unofficial"" anniversary was also my birthday. I fell head over heels for her IMMEDIATELY. In July we went on an amazing trip to NYC, where we went shopping at the designer stores, stayed in a beautiful hotel, she surprised me with a crazy cool restaurant, and we got her work visa filed at the Chinese Consulate. We told each other we loved each other on this trip. It was so early but felt so real. In August, she went to China for 6 weeks to work as an au pair. I dropped her off at the airport to leave and we were both bawling as she walked down the line through the airport security. I walked back to her car myself getting ready to drive home, crying. I just fell in love with this girl now she's leaving for 6 weeks?

That's when my phone rang. It was my sister. My dad's liver had failed and he was in the hospital. It was about 4:30 in the morning and I had about 2.5 hours to drive home, so I jumped in the car and hauled ass. I arrived at the airport about 7 where I ran into the room my dad was supposed to be in, only to hear him puking and moaning in the bathroom. After two hours of listening to this he came out and laid down, yellow as Homer Simpson. I sat there and cried with him and held him for another hour or two, when I realized I had been up for 24 hours and really needed some rest.

I drove back to my girls house to switch cars, and ended up just falling asleep in her bed without her. I woke up and consoled in her Mom, for I'm not close with my own and wasn't sure who to talk to, and she offered to pay me for some property work to keep my mind off it. Unless I was visiting my Dad, I was at her house. Stacking wood, weed whacking, mowing the lawn, whatever needed to get done.

The day after I found out about my Dad's liver failure I went back at the hospital, this time with my sister who's two years younger than me. We both found out here that he had stage 4 liver cirrhosis and approximately 3-6 months to live. I had NO idea how to process that information. Hence why I drowned myself in work for my girl's mom.

He was out of the hospital by the time my girl came home. I remember picking her up at the airport like it was yesterday. I knew right then and there I wanted to go on many more road trips with this one. We immediately spent every day together unless I was bugging my Dad. She began working again, I went to college finally and she continued her studies, she was pursuing her music career and I was supportive of it, shit was good. I had to balance all of that with my Dad, checking in, and making sure he was okay. Also trying to make sure his girlfriend wasn't trying to take advantage of the situation.

I should also mention - my Dad's girlfriend is a cunt. and I don't use that term lightly. She enabled his drinking habit, ended up attempting to redraft a fake will giving herself almost everything, and consistently bossed him around from place to place convincing him to leave the state and stay at his condo whenever she had issues with his kids, just to separate him from us.

In October I lost my license, then I knocked up my girl. She was on birth control and it was actually a entopic pregnancy or something, (essentially the fetus was growing within her fallopian tube, according to the doctor the equivalent of a tumor). But it certainly didn't feel like that. We found out because she had REALLY bad cramps and abdomen pain. She didn't want to drive and I couldn't anymore, so she turned down my offer for an Uber and called her Mom. I didn't object at first, but her mom has a slight problem with attention. That was supposed to my me and my girl's experience but instead I was third wheeling on my own not-a-kid-thing's abortion. and that really fucking hurt. and she sees it as I wasn't there for her, but I was shut out quick and never really got past that.

We admittedly never dealt with that emotionally and life went on. Big regret there. Thanksgiving and Christmas were great, I had two of my friends living in my house who were irresponsible and co-dependent on me so she got to play the Mom to my Dad. Shit really woulda been great but I struggled with this impending feeling of doom in the back of my head. I couldn't shake the feeling everything was gonna end abruptly. I couldn't never place the blame of that feeling on my Dad's life as I was supposed to, so I consistently argued that it's unlikely this relationship would go anywhere due to us being young - also a fear based around my parents chaotic divorce, and the failure of every other marriage on both sides of my family. This was really frustrating too, cause I wouldn't have hesitated to propose to this girl in the future if the time was right. I just falsely placed my emotions.

Skip ahead - we broke up briefly in April. I didn't want to spend 100% of my time with her in quarantine if we were going to be so at each other's throats as we had been, so I told her I wanted her to move her shit back into her house. She broke up with me basically for not being the support she needed and for me overly expressing a lack of future between us, not to mention shutting her out in the quarantine. We decided we both really wanted to fix things and work on everything, make it better, and got back together shortly after.

In June we got in a fight, took some time apart and I wasn't invited to a party she was throwing at her family's vacation home the weekend before my birthday so I got pretty upset. I shut down any ideas she had to make up for my birthday, including some really thoughtful and amazing ideas and offers. I shut them all down just cause I was salty both she had been difficult around it, and also my Dad wouldn't come home from Florida for my birthday. I just wasn't having a good time.

My Dad died at the end of June. I didn't know how to handle it and really snapped off emotionally. I've blacked out the months of July and August from my memory, and September is bits and pieces. I remember the 4th of July, his birthday the 5th of Aug, and his funeral on the 22nd, nothing in-between. Just before his funeral in August, I really broke it off with her. She had never met him which really fucked me up. I told her I never wanted kids, never wanted marriage, that I couldn't see this going anywhere in the future. I told her I wanted to be young and single, anything to get her to not care about me anymore so I could have space and burden no one in this time. In reality I didn't want kids cause my Dad could never be a Grandpa, marriage was scary cause divorce sparked his downfall, I didn't see myself moving on without my Dad. I saw a future in nothing, I shouldn't have blamed the relationship. And I didn't want to be young and single, I wanted my Dad back and I wanted to be irresponsible and drown myself in drugs to feel nothing - which luckily I didn't fall back on.

At the end of September I lost two of my childhood friends in a fiery car accident. Watching how their families grieved that loss snapped me back into place in a way, showed me where I fucked up and how I should have opened up more instead of trying to be everyone else's support in my time of need. And that's when I realized how much I'd neglected her. and how much I needed to make up for and fix. So I reached back out to her, begging to fix this and get back together, in my mind it was an easy fix, I just wanted space it would be be over right? But she said no. I gave her a full month to focus on herself and decide what she wants for herself and now she doesn't want a relationship.

I broke down and BLEW UP her phone over the next few days after realizing I couldn't just ask for her back. I didn't even realize it had been so long, and I'd thought I'd given myself security, told her I wanted to revisit this soon I just wanted space. I admitted everything I'd done wrong, brought up ways to fix It, things I wanted to do together. Also ALL of my exes have fucked ""friends"" of mine immediately after we break up, so my paranoia was definitely disrespectfully high. I heavily overwhelmed her.

I convinced her to come see me one more time where I introduced her to my Dad at his grave. She took this as like an argument for us to get back together, not just me being weak striving for closure, and began shutting me down IN FRONT OF HIM. Then we came back to my house where I begged for her to take me back, and apologized for so much, and thanked her for more, and really tried to prove to her I had and would take the steps to make this better the ever before. She didn't believe I'd suppressed all that time due to trauma. She thought I was coming back because too much was changing and I was scared. Here she told me directly it wasn't fixable. She told me we'd never go on another road trip, I'd never go to her vacation house, she said she knows the next person she dates won't be me. Something about actually having fun with someone without all the shared trauma ""or at least someone who doesn't talk about it all the time"". Granted, it got that she doesn't want me through my head, it broke me down more.

Now I text her every few hours with thoughts, apologies, memes, etc, anything I think I can do to either make her think about me or even just smile. I don't understand how I went a month without talking to her without thinking about it. I don't understand how I don't remember leaving her. I just want to hold her and have her tell me it's going to be okay. I'm so weak without my dad and never should have given up my best friend. She'll respond occasionally hoping I'm okay and encouraging that the future will be good regardless if we're together or not, but I'm not ready to lose her yet. I feel like she and I entered a dark tunnel together, and at some point I broke and ran. The light in within view, but I feel like I left her in the tunnel behind me, and I don't want to leave her there. or did she leave me in the tunnel and already escape? Sometimes I wonder if she was always above the tunnel and I was just in love with her shadow. I wish I could draw out that analogy but my lack of artistic skill stops me.

How do I get her to take me back? This girl was the one, my forever, and I fought myself on that for so long because of fear. Now I know more than ever. Fear kills hope. and I need to prove to her I really didn't mean what I said when I was just pushing her away so I could be alone and feel nothing. I want to grow old with this girl. I want her to ACTUALLY be the Mom to my Dad. I'm not ready to let her be the one that got away just cause I couldn't handle the grief of my Dad dying. I'm not ready to let what we had go and I can't accept I did it - and I don't remember doing it.",09Oct2020,1

110,"A former colleague who I hang out with occasionally has been posting images on Instagram and heavily suggesting that they are her own work/capture her personal experiences.

This person is not an influencer but has a few hundred followers and seems happy to accept praise in the comments for photos that she did not take herself. I chose to mute her posts because they just make me angry. Beyond my irritation with her dishonesty, I'm worried about the intellectual property rights of the original photographers. I know that stuff gets shared on Instagram all the time, but why not just repost with credit?

113,"I feel like I'm making a mistake by buying a laptop for this situation. My parents got divorced and it would be a pain to move my desktop back and forth. Having to unplug it from all the screens and move it once a week sounds a bit like a pain. On the other hand though, it is a five minute ""chore"" once a week. 

&amp;nbsp;

On the other hand, I am going to college soon. I will want a nice laptop for taking notes, coding, etc. That doesn't mean however that it would have to be a gaming laptop. I was reading a thread that made me realize it's not like I game outside the house- so why have this mobile laptop that can game. It's a risk to breaking / being stolen when I'm out and about, and is more money for worse performance than a comparable desktop.

&amp;nbsp;

Part of me wants to build a smaller form factor pc and bring that back and forth, and get a nice laptop that just works for school. I likely will save a good amount of the parts from my current pc, assuming I can find a micro-atx or similar case that fits them. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have a budget around $2000, so I really could buy the parts I would need to transform my current desktop and get a pretty decent laptop for browsing, coding, notes, etc.

114,"Figured I should post this here, not really sure where else it might be appropriate to post it on. Hope you guys can help me on this issue but it definitely is a very specific situation I doubt most people know about. Since it is so specific, it requires some context so that it makes sense, so this will be kind of long. Thank you in advance!

I (17M) am from a central american country that is still in the middle of starting to open up again due to the pandemic. I live with my parents and my 27 year old sister. During this quarantine, I've picked up the habit of reading a ton of ""self help"" that goes way beyond the usual romantic advice of just saying ""you can do whatever you want"" and such. I've gone big on Jordan Peterson's lectures and David Goggins's talks and texts that explain the real, more precise nature of what getting your life together is really like in the real world. I've benefited a lot in my personal life and am in the process of leaving my addictions and shortcomings behind me to strive towards achieving my full potential and the fact that we've been in quarantine for half a year now means I've had plenty of time to think about my situation and really get to know myself deeply as well as apply some of that knowledge as best as I can to my everyday life.

Now, I live in a household where my father is the main provider of resources, kind of, because he is the face of the whole operation. He runs an independent business that, so as to not dox myself, does not tether him to any other company directly so he has no boss but he depends on his image to fuel his essential relations with the businesses he associates with that provide him with the actual work. The way those other businesses see him will determine whether they give him work or not. He's pretty good at that and has been doing it for decades, but it doesn't come free of consequences. As you can imagine, this is a very stressful line of work and he has to be available all the time to his (fortunately) highly demanding but broad clientele. My parents work together but the money comes as compensation from the realization of that work, so the more jobs you accomplish, the more times they  pay you. The more complicated or larger the work, the higher the pay.

The kind of work he does requires a rather large foundation of semi-repeatable tasks to be done before the skilled training unique to him is required, however, and it is there where the employees but mostly my mother and, recently, me come in to play. My mother kind of leads the quality control of this department and it has always been very underappreciated by my father. Since he is the one that fulfills the ""most important"" aspects of the job, the skilled ones, and since he expedites every job, he tends to be rather absolutist on his overall perception of his company. Since he is rather disagreeable in temper, or so I've come to believe, you might start drawing a few conclusions on what my parents' marriage is like and how that has affected me, the child.

My dad is an asshole to my mother and has been so since ""5 years into the relationship"", as my mother told me. He has a humongous history of cheating that dates back to 20 damn years ago and it includes having a child with another woman (a child YOUNGER than me). They have cycled through different side chicks and my mother has stuck to him by bottling up her emotions for my sake.

It is also intuitive that quarantine did nobody any favors and just intensified the hate she has been bottling up until it exploded silently. She started to snap at him; she started to ""disobey"" orders at work and revolted, not doing as much as she knows she can do at work out of pure spite of him. And no wonder, really. Dad has screamed at her in front of me and has told me to my face that ""the only alternative now is for them to split."" He no longer cares about being polite with me and it's just adding more resentment on my mom. And no wonder.

So my mom has always been pretty open with me. She says things for what they are but she is nice enough to choose her words carefully, which is not what my dad does. He finds all the best, most colorful words on the entire spanish dictionary to tell you what he wants you to hear in such a way that it elevates him over you and humiliates you as much as possible, in the hopes of ""giving advice authoritatively so that you LEARN FROM SOMEONE MORE EXPERIENCED THAN YOU."" I think I see straight through this because I am his son, after all, and I've seen that same behavior in myself and I know that I do it because I want to feel smart when I don't really know what I'm talking about.

Those last few sentences are what I've told my mom lately and she said she was surprised I could look at it that way. Okay, based on that, I've started sharing the philosophy I've learned (from the internet) with my mom and... argh... it breaks my heart to say it, but it puts into evidence how... gullible she is. My mom didn't have that much education and she was a struggling independent woman with a huge heart and a remarkable intellect but her lack of theoretical education really shows. She got pregnant twice over a man that left her without a trace until she found my father and had me before really getting to know my father and not knowing what she really deserved. But, to be honest, how could she have known? We take our education for granted and our way of thinking seems so rational to us that we don't notice we wouldn't know jack if it weren't for the sharing of life experiences passed on to us in the present after thousands of years since writing was first invented and we started to think about future generations further than figuring out what we were going to eat this week.

My mom starting to treat me as his best friend in the sense that she tells me everything and just vents about her problems with my father. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem listening to her and there are a few funny things she has told me and I love her to death and love spending time with her especially because I dislike my father but I know this is just not normal at all. I should not be telling her what to do. I should not be giving her advice on anything, especially over such unstable sources such as the internet that I haven't tried in practice on myself at all. I should be guided by her, but instead she is... stuck in the mind of a resentful teenager in a sense. God... it hurts to type that.

Please tell me what to do, this is driving me crazy. And don't worry about me, I'm fine, I've put behind me the childhood issues of living with a distant asshole but not abusive father and living with a part-time mom (it may not seem like it but trust me, I have), but I want her to be happy and not live in a miserably hopeless situation as this marriage with my father is being, but I also shouldn't be putting the burden of basically saving her onto myself because I'm just her son and she should know better but she doesn't and my latino genes and high agreeableness have kept this overwhelming sense of commitment and I feel like I have to do something about it because she has done so much for me and I have to help her just as much and argh now my head hurts...",09Oct2020,1

116,"I know, I feel like a piece of shit. I am a piece of shit, and the perspective on his end probably isn’t any better. This happened a few hours ago as I ran into my cousins house. I’ve seen his neighbor before and said hi a few times, but my cousin and I have always had this terrible long running joke of the n-word. I know, It is terrible, I have personally never said that horrific word to anyone in a way that would degrade or devalue their life because of the color of their skin, I condemn racists and racism as a whole, I know what it is, my family has experienced it, My own father has dark skin but I was lucky enough to be born with whiter skin. I know it’s wrong, I don’t want to justify it, I don’t want to give some stupid excuse like “Oh it slipped” or “I have black friends therefore... etc” It’s so cliche that these statements are common among racists. The full story goes like this, My cousin and I had just returned from a family gathering and he and I were walking into the house. He was a few feet in front of me, and I asked a question, I don’t remember what it was but he ignored me but as we were walking apparently his downstairs neighbor who was not in my line of sight said, “What’s up” and my cousin replied with something similar. I heard and saw none of this. As I said he was a few feet in front of me so I had no clue and thought he was just ignoring me which he has done before so right after the greeting I missed, I said loudly enough for them both to hear, “You fucking n-word” I am embarrassed and ashamed for not only saying this but saying it in front of someone who has known this family for years and lived here under not even my house. It was terrible, Not a second later I made eye contact, He clearly heard me, and the only thing I could muster out of my stupid and shitty mind was, “My bad man” I was shocked, I began to cry when we got upstairs, not for sympathy or pity but because I had just sullied my families reputation with this man who was nice enough to greet us all the time. He looked at me for a solid 2 seconds in the face and I’m not sure but I think he looked down at his phone right as I went in. I went down to apologize but froze before I even left the apartment. I couldn’t do it, I was too scared, not that I would get my ass beat but that he would hate me and the confrontation was too serious. I know I need to do something and my family was talking about me too, My aunt was saying on the phone to my cousin that she didn’t want me there and my dickhead cousin who has said the word more than me and around his friends at school threw me under the bus saying “I never say it in public” when he has too me and his friends many times. My older cousin lectured me and I’m glad she did, I deserved it, I deserved worse. I am finally going to make an effort to cut those words out of my dictionary but I really need help on reconciliation, ideally from someone who may have experienced this from any point of view. I don’t know if the guy wants to let it air out or if he would like me to apologize or what I should say. I want to apologize but I am genuinely scared of accepting the horrible thing I did. I don’t know how he’ll react to seeing me. I don’t want to make some bullshit celebrity apology. I just want him to know that first, It wasn’t directed at him, second, I’ve never used that word harmfully and third, I am deeply sorry for that and that I am aware of the power and history but I have heard that word In my culture so much and even a few hours before the incident my family was saying racial slurs at a tv so the word has little to know value, to me it is equivalent to bitch, or fucker, or dickhead. But I know how he feels about it. It’s a word that was made by and for oppression. Please help.",09Oct2020,1
117,"Hello, this is a lengthy post, but I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read and offer advice.

I (20m) have struggled with loneliness, depression, and anxiety throughout my life. I find it difficult to make friends a lot of the time, partially due to my social anxiety, and partially (according to people close to me) as I sometimes come off as very quiet and intimidating (6'4, muscular, ""strong-silent"" stereotype). Thinking back all the way to high-school, the only friends I ever made were the girls I dated after stepping away from my increasingly criminal middle-school friend group when I began high-school. As I didn't have many friends, I turned to gaming, and then later, to a combination of working full-time and taking college courses on top of my high-school coursework to stay busy. All of this set me up well for my future, but was hard on my nonexistant social-life.

When I got to college, I instantly struggled making friends. The people on my dorm floor were nice, however I go to school in the middle of Missouri, and most of the people I met really didn't have too much in common with me (athiest, liberal, stoner, vegetarian, gamer, literary nerd who likes working out). It's been like this my whole life, always a struggle to find people with similar interests who I can connect with on a deep and meaningful level.

Eventually, I met my current best friend by chance-both stoned in the elevator at 2am. He asked if I was stoned (I certainly looked stoned) to which I replied yes. We exchanged info, and started hanging out almost every day. I hadn't met anyone quite like him before. He shared nearly all of the same interests, loved having deep, intellectual conversations, and I opened up to him more than I've ever opened up to anyone in my life. 

Our friendship was good for the most part, however he's an extremely insecure individual, and this often shows itself in his attemps to ""assert dominance"" over every small situation. At first, I brushed it off as I was happy to have made a close friend for the first time ever, but eventually, it really started to bug me. Oftentimes he'll say things that passive-aggressively put me down. For example, I might be talking about a girl that I met-before he starts telling me about all the girls he's slept with recently, or talk about how said girl was ""giving him looks"" as kind of a ""one-up"". He also constantly talks about how attractive he is, and then couples that with speaking bad about his body in what often seems like a convoluted way to fish for compliments (he's got amazing genetics and has been working out for years. He's probably a 9-10 on the attractiveness scale). Another example is every time we hang out with someone. In all honesty, just having one solid friend is enough for me, but I'm always up for hanging out with new people. The problem is that every single time, without fail, he'll bring up how he's so ""popular"" or how I never bring anyone to hang out with us and ""he's gotta do all the work"". All of these things I took with a grain of salt, as he has many other good qualities, and most of the time we're together, we have a great time.

In recent months the dynamic of the friendship has seemingly changed for some reason. He's either started doing the above-mentioned things much more, or I'm really starting to notice to where it's bothering me. Additionally, in the past two weeks (after hanging out every couple days for the past year without fail) he's contacted me three times, each time asking for help with moving things from a storage unit or checking on his bike which he had to leave outside the storage unit (which is a 7 minute drive for me, a 12 minute drive for him). He hasn't asked me to hang out at all, and I've texted him every few days or so asking him if he's down to hang out (which hasn't yet happened). Yesterday, I gave him a ride back from the storage unit where he dropped off his motorcycle, and he said we should hang out after I took my cat to the vet. I contacted him after, but he said he had a small assignment for one of his classes. Three hours later, I asked if he was ready to hang out, but he said it still wasn't done. I didn't hear from him the rest of the night. A few days prior I'd also mentioned that I had a job interview, which was a big deal to me. He never asked how it went, which seems like common courtesy to me and kind of bugged me a bit.

In reading this post, I feel like the comments could either go two ways. I'm not sure if I'm being needy and overthinking things, or if my friend is just a total douchebag that makes me feel like shit about myself constantly. I'm not sure how to even go about cutting someone out, and I'm not sure if it would be better for my mental health to keep the one friend I have, or drop him based on these negative qualities and experiences. Additionally, I really worry about being able to make new friends, as It's something I've struggled with in the past. I'm completely open-minded to all criticism and advice that may come from this post, and I really need an outside perspective to help me make sense of these things.

If you've gotten this far, you have no idea how much it means to me. Sorry for being a melodramatic internet ranter, but these things have been weighing on me heavily in recent months.            

Thank you.",09Oct2020,1
118,"My best friend and I have been friends for 19 years. I’ve been there for her through pretty much anything and while we’ve had our ups and downs, I’m always there for her. The problem is that it just isn’t reciprocated. For instance, I give her rides whenever she needs one, but any time I ask her for one or need a favor, she acts like I am committing a crime by asking. I help her with errands all the time. I listen to her problems and relationship issues all the time, but when I ask for support for something in my life she gets annoyed. If she says something mean to me, she claims it never happened, that it wasn’t mean, or that it was justified. She is a poly substance addict with no intent on stopping and even when I told her I want to be sober and would like her to maybe try and be sober when we hang out she said how dare I ask her to do that, that it shouldn’t be her responsibility. Most recently though, I decided to unpack my body image issues with her. I have pale skin, light brown hair, light blue-green eyes and just a few freckles. I think I am a generally pretty person. I am curvy and I wear a size 6. I am 140 pounds at 5’3. She for a very long time has criticized the way I look to the point where I thought it was reality. I always looked to her for validation. If I asked if I was attractive, she might say something like “when you lose more weight I think you’ll look really good” or “I think sharp cheekbones are attractive, being thin is attractive. You’ll look better when you lose weight.”
She’s 110 pounds and 5’7. If she’s ever insecure, I always, ALWAYS remind her that she’s pretty. I finally brought up this issue to her, as it’s been an issue for maybe around 8 years. Her response was that she’s never done that, and I don’t need to project my insecurities on her. That she has nothing to do with it. I can’t deal with it anymore. She’s emotionally abusive as a friend and won’t acknowledge it. I just don’t know how to walk away. She’s been my best friend basically since toddlerhood and we’ve been so close the whole time. I can’t keep being a good friend to someone who doesn’t care about me at all. What do I do?",09Oct2020,1

121,"Hi all, I need some help. This is my first time on this sub so please forgive me for any unintentional faux paux. Also, it’s going to be long, sorry. 

My (36f) partner (40m) and I just had our first (only?) child. We live in a city on the west coast about five hours driving from my parents and about three hours from his. Now-my son has become the light in my parent’s life. They have said to me separately that they have never seen the other one so happy. They drive up to see him once a month (so eight times since Little Man was born, YOU try telling them they are in their 70s and there is a pandemic). Beyond the usual grandparent excitement (I am an only child) this is an unexpected baby-I am a recovering alcoholic and spent 20 years at the bottom of a vodka bottle and ten in an unhappy marriage. Now, with almost four years sober I am in a happy relationship with this sweet little baby. The time they spend with us makes them so happy -it’s like they got me back, a baby AND my wonderful partner. Partner’s parents love little man, too, but it’s different. He’s their 6th of 7 grand babies (sometimes I do think babies are like the Borg but I digress).

Here’s the issue. My job is having some major downsizing. I am the primary provider for our family as my partner is a SAHD. Usually this wouldn’t be a HUGE issue as in most cities you have many potential options in your field. That’s not the case for me, we’re the only game in town. If I were to be laid off I’d have to magically become a doctor or engineer or lawyer to get a similar salary to what I currently make. What makes sense to do (potentially even if I am not laid off) is to find a position in a company somewhere where there are lots of similar companies (there are at least ten major hubs in the US). The closest are Seattle and Boulder-both of which are very expensive. What makes sense is to move to NC-there are SO MANY job opportunities for me there (as well as opportunities in my partner’s industry, when he goes back to work) that it would be much ‘safer’, financially. Even if one company had layoffs there are ten others around. Plus, cost of living is low there so we could save up for 5-10 years and then move somewhere closer to family/that we actually wanted to live.

But...the idea of ‘taking’ my son from my parents just breaks my heart. Yes, they could come to visit (once they are comfortable flying again) and we could come to visit them but that’s taking 12 visits a year down to four, maybe six, max. It’s 3500 miles, not a 300 mile car ride. They tell me to do what’s best for my family but...they are my family, too! Plus, I almost had them talked into moving here so I can keep an eye on them as they get older. I can’t keep an eye on shit from the east coast. My partner is a gem and supports whatever I decide we need to do. All options seem terrible. Stay in a job where if I’m laid off I have to uproot my family, move to an expensive city I don’t really like, or move across country, changing my son’s relationship with his family and their experience with him. I have put them through so much already.

I feel like I’m too close to this, that I’m missing other options or over simplifying or something. Anyone have any perspective on this they can share? Thank you so much, even typing it all out helps.",09Oct2020,1
123,"This is a throwaway account. I wont drop any names cuz of reasons.

Imma have to be honest with you guys. My life sucks. Ive been involved with a gang in my area since I was 12. I had to see and do shit no one my age shouldve done. My parents were immigrants and came here to give me and my little brother a better chance. My dad died from lung cancer when i was 6 so I hardly have any memories of him. My mom works 2 jobs seven days a week so i hardly ever get to see her. Cuz of all of this its just me and my brother. We live in the one of the worst areas in my city so of course theres alot of gang activity around me. I remember being approached by one of the older guys when I was twelve and him offering to buy me some food and new shoes since mine werent in good shape. 

He was around 20 and lived in the building next to me (He's locked right now over gun charges). I thought of this guy as a sort of a father figure cuz he would give me free shit like good shoes and he gave me my first phone. I started chilling with him and other kids around my age. After a while he started asking favours (he would say take this bag to that place for me) and I would get paid like fifty dollars on it. The olders then started taking me and the other boys to help them in the trap (a house where they sell drugs). We thought we were cool and doing something with ourselves but these guys were just using us. 

Just to let you guys know my area got beef with another block thats been frying before I was even born. We would start carrying knives and shit on us even though were werent rlly ready to use them. Shit got real for me when one of my friends nearly died. Some kids our age from the other block saw us and we got into a fight. He got stabbed in his back twice. He was fourteen and is still in a wheelchair. The olders said we couldn't let that slide so we had to do something about it. So we started riding for our ""family"". I myself have stabbed people and been stabbed (they werent big injuries). I sold stuff like crack and dark (heroin). Ive been arrested by feds a couple times. I had to do four months in a yoi and got released a few months ago. I dont feel good about what I do but I would just smoke up a zoot to forget about what was making me feel like shit.

I'll be honest and say that the only reason I haven't completely dropped out of school is cuz I actually like to learn. Stuff like science and history is interesting you know. I feel like Im lucky tho. I got three friends about to go to trial over a murder, four doing 5 or more years, one in a wheelchair, and 2 that are dead. One of them got shot in the neck while we were together. The thing I hate the most though is that I left him. I just saw the car pull up and ran. I feel like shit cuz I know he died feeling betrayed and it makes me mad sad and hopeless. I even said I didnt know who done it when police questioned me. And no they havent been caught.

My mom has said she wouldve taken me back to her home country for my safety a long time ago if she could afford it. I tried to offer her the money I make but she refuses it. She cursed me once cuz my little brother is starting to do what I do. I want to change but I dont know how. I cant talk to feds cuz they would try to incriminate me on some stuff that happened. I dont really trust the teahers at my school enough either. Most of my relatives are back in our home country. We cant afford to move out and I cant just say that Im not involved anymore. My own ""guys"" wouldnt allow that and the other block would still get me for shit I done in the past. 

I want to change before I go to jail or end up dead. I also want to change for my brother and mother. I dont want my lil bro to end up dead or a killer and I dont want my mom to have both her sons being peices of shit. Please I could really use any suggestions you guys can give me cuz right now i dont know what the fuck I should do. Thanks.",09Oct2020,1
124,"About two months ago I had a really happy and solid relationship with  a girl I felt I really loved. It was the first relationship I'd ever been in and I made a few mistakes, but we were both happy and she was very supportive and I didn't really doubt she had those feelings change. 

One morning I woke up to a text where she confessed this: ""I need to tell you this because it’s been eating me up inside so lastnight I was just chilling with one of my friends we were just talking n listening to music then when we stopped talking we kissed I’m sorry 😐 I feel like a complete asshole I didn’t mean for it happen it was just a spur of the moment thing""

She was apologetic and said she didnt have feeling for the guy but it broke my heart, and I didnt feel very comfortable staying with her. So i broke things of then and there. She seemed upset but didnt protest or ask for a second chance or anything. I was hurt. 

Then comes about a month later in which she posts her happy new relationship with the very same guy she kissed. Obviously i unfriended her and try avoiding her social media. But theres a part of me always coming back and wishing things had been different. I feel almost a sense of anger and betrayal. I want to confront her on it.

129,"Ok this is starting to piss me off, and i really have started to hate ppl more and more for it. Why do people have to bring race into everything ever since George Floyd died. I mean sure he’s dead and it’s sad right? But guys he’s gone, he’s not on this earth anymore. So why must people bring race INTO EVERYTHING just because they let one thing stay with them from the past on.

People are so entitled i swear, also not to rant but i fucking hate politics. There’s no point in having a presidential election if people are going to shoot each-other over it. Guess what, if you don’t like the president, fine by me. But it’s not like you can do anything in the world about it, there are 8.7 BILLION people on this Earth AND MILLIONS in the United States 🇺🇸. You are one tiny person who is not going to be able to change any of what the president does, or what others think of him. 

Back to the race thing, i just saw an Instagram Disney post and happened to be scrolling through the comments and do you wanna know what i saw? 2/3rds of every comment was “Why are they all White?” Or “Why is there only one Black, this doesn’t feel right.” Well, i’m sorry that you’re complaining about what animals would look like if they were human. My god, i can’t even type right because it’s so infuriating to me how so many people (plus the crazy ppl) always include race in every situation. GUESS WHAT PEOPLE, NOT EVERY SITUATION IS GOING TO MATTER. 

If you’re arguing with someone random on the internet, just stop. Just stop. I know you probably want to “keep it going” 🥱 but in reality one day you’re going to die. One die that person is going to die. So in the long run a tiny blip of an argument you may have had with someone (even if they bring up race) isn’t going to matter at all. 

I posted something yesterday, “Why argue with someone online when you don’t even know them?” 
And one person said “Well, say something as offensive and vulgar as you can to the person to get them upset, then just leave em alone.” I’m sorry kid but thats not what i was asking at all. I never said “How to start an argument online?” 

Say you accidentally hit someones car (a fender bender per say) and they get out, you do too. As you and them go back and forth and start getting heated, then, they say “You’re White privileged” Or “You’re so racist” when you and the other driver are both White. WHAT DOES RACE HAVE TO DO WITH HITTING SOMEONES CAR?! See where i’m going with this. So this is just my message to the world, i know some people aren’t going to agree or have different opinions. But just because you don’t like someone opinions doesn’t mean that they’re different.",09Oct2020,1
130,"Okay, so I generally stay out of other peoples' business and do my best to give other people the space and freedom to live their lives without imposing. So figuring out how to handle this situation is troubling me.. 

My landlords are currently living in Budapest. They have the house I live in now, and the backyard garage that was renovated into a studio. I guy renting the studio is in his 20’s and a nice guy. My fiancé and I rent the house. Our leases are separate, and our utilities are combined. 

We do not have a personal issue with the guy, but a few weeks ago I started hearing a baby cry every evening when I was near the back of my house. I thought it was another neighbor, but I got curious and I went into the yard to see where it was coming from.  I walked towards the studio and realized the baby was in there. At the same time, a lady walked into our yard; I tried to greet her by saying, ""Hello"" but she quickly turned into the house and did not acknowledge me. 

I called the guy to ask about the baby, and a short bit later he came over to the house to talk to me. He informed me that this lady needed a place to hide because of an abusive situation. First, the story was told as though the lady's mother was abusive, and later he said it was the lady's husband. He then told me that she paid him $1000 in return, and that he was staying at his girlfriends house. 

It is not really my business, but I do think the financial piece was weird because he only pays 650 for his place... but maybe she just volunteered that payment? And along these lines, I also know that our state currently has a mandated eviction cancellation because of covid, so he hasn’t been paying rent. 

Anyway, he assured me that she was very nice, and that he had known her for years. We decided to leave it and try to let it play out, but truthfully none of this has been settling well with us. 

I asked that he please our landlords know, because with them living so far away, they obviously wouldn’t know, but he refused and said that they would kick him out if they knew. (He knows them though his family) 

A few days later we spoke on the phone and I repeated that we really wanted him to notify our landlords, but then shared with me that he spoke with the lady and as he was telling her to move out, she told him that she has 6 months to live,and that she needs someone to adopt her baby. He said that he was going to the Godfather  and she was going to pay off all of his debt, so he really didn’t want to hurt their relationship. The story keeps getting more complex and I don't truthfully know what's going on, but something feels off about it. 

All-in-all, we have been battling with what to do with this situation. If this woman truly needs help, we would HATE to bring more stress to her and her baby. 

We also realize that something like this could happen if we lived in an apartment, and we would not have any say in the matter. However, we also realize that in that case, a housing manager would be present.. 

Does anyone have any thoughts?? I would LOVE some advice... should we keep our nose out of his business or let our landlords know that something is up?",09Oct2020,1
131,"okay so this may be a long read. however, i am so confused right now. I moved into my new house back in March, 4 months after splitting with my abusive ex. My new neighbour flirted with me for months, but i was quite ignorant to these signs, i just didnt spot them. After 3 months of my ignorance things started taking off a little bit, we were seeing eachother. This went well for about a month but i could never really figure him out. At the end of that month he pulled me for a chat and explained that he thought he was ready for a relationship but he wasn't. Now he is quite a shy bloke and he is also a kind hearted bloke, i know he will not sleep with multiple women at once and he's had another girl since me. This was obviously disheartening but it's life. Now this is where things begin to get confusing. I am quite an anxious person so we haven't spoken properly in months (mainly because i avoid him like the plague, again, my own anxiety). However, recently he's made it physically impossible to avoid him. (i never had any struggle previously) now i don't know if i'm misreading signals or not this is why i'm asking for advice.

I always chatted but it was short and sweet, but a few days ago i physically could not get away. he has recently been more interested in me than he was when i was seeing him. asked me if me and my daughter wanted to go to an event with him on bonfire night and if we wanted to go to his parents with him at christmas and he was surrounded by friends and i was allowing my little girl to walk up and down the street with me to burn some energy, rather than talking to his friends he shouted up to see what i was doing for the rest of the day and then he was asking how my studies with my law degree were going and he is not my little girls dad, her dad is my abusive ex but my neighbour and daughter have such a good bond and they had that before anything happened with me and him.

135,"I don't mean like, ridiculous attention seeking behaviors but as a kid (and even now as an adult) it seemed like every time I reached out to someone else for even a normal amount of attention I was turned away or treated like an inconvenience.

My dad always got really involved in his own stuff and would obviously be annoyed, or at least not thrilled to be interrupted when I was little and needed something or had a question (and there wasn't much luck in waiting for him to be done either, he would keep going right up until bedtime or he switched to something else). He never explicitly said I was bothering him and always told me to ask if I needed something but it was clear when I did he'd rather go back to doing his own thing. I was really close with my sister growing up too and we hung out a lot but only on her own terms, if I ever approached her I was usually just told to go away or wait until later. Even now she'll text or call me and be upset if I don't answer but every time I reach out to her she keeps the conversation short or seems flat out annoyed if I ask a question. Occasionally she doesn't even answer at all.

Even when I was a little older and my friends called me on the phone they would talk for an hour or more, but if I ever tried to call them (even at the exact same time of day, after not seeing/talking to them for a while) they generally seemed uninterested and would find an excuse to cut the call short.

Now I'm an adult in my 20s and at this point I've just given up. I don't text people first and I rarely approach anyone in person either to start a conversation. As a result I don't really have close friends, just peripheral, situational sorts of people. Hell I could probably count on one hand the times I've sent a friend request on Facebook, I just can't bring myself to reach out for fear of bothering someone.

I don't really know what I'm asking here, I guess just if this is normal? Am I being dramatic or is this something other people actually deal with?

TLDR: People seem disinterested when I reach out to them, even though they seem fine during the times they approach me and it's honestly kind of tearing me apart.",09Oct2020,1
138,"Hey guys, I’m a 20yo male who is studying to become a primary school teacher. However, I had a really troubled childhood and that meant that I never learned a lot of the basic life skills. I’m starting to recognise this as I’m working at a Before and After School Care. I have no idea how to swim, ride a bicycle, cook, basic names to vegetables, animals, insects. My lack of experience has really perpetuated my anxiety. I am fearful of doing anything unfamiliar. I’m afraid of running science experiments such as planting, simply because I’ve never done it before. I have never ordered a coffee from a cafe until today, simply because I’ve never done it before. 

The worst part about this is, I would tell my co workers that I have never made cupcakes before. Or that I have never made popcorn before. And that I’m eager to learn. But they would just make fun of me. I hate it because it’s not completely my fault. I had a really bad childhood where I didn’t learn anything for a long time.

Of course, the easy solution is simply for me to learn these things. But my heart and mind are trapped with anxiety. Can someone please tell me the mindset I should be adopting, and how can I improve these skills most efficiently? 

Thank you!!",09Oct2020,1

The problem begun some few hours ago, when I was talking to a native german speaker who lives in canada. He told me things like that he regretted haven't studied French while he was younger, or that not even the germans speak their language in the country.

After hearing this, some ideas came to my mind, and I wanted you all to help me to decide what am I going to do:


+Considering that I have still two years before finishing school, I could finish to learning German during the rest of this year, and dedicate my last year before immigrating to the french

+I could retire from my german studies and focus on french, dumping all the advances I've made by now

She posted a new story about an hour ago. It's a picture of herself in the mirror and her room is shown behind her. Now obviously I don't want to be that creep ass dude and comment on her looks, that's a fast way to get blocked or something I'm sure. But...

I left almost a year ago and during that time the merged company (Company C) has been working on its renaming, brand updates, contracts, care, coverage, etc. 

As an employee there, we did a marketing project capturing current employees positive views along with members who received our care (All people who worked for and received care from Company A). Now an entirely new entity that offers new programs, has new staff, and runs completely differently, Company C has taken the all stories from Company A, and changed *direct quotes* anytime Company A was mentioned to Company C. 

Is it ethical to change employee and healthcare member quotes without their prior permission, especially if they now describe a new company? This seems incredibly problematic as an ex-employee and seeing that this could affect people’s decisions with their healthcare coverage.

While she makes minimum wage at a laundromat. Anyways, she wants to strive to be better, acheive her goals, etc etc but this guy shes with is holdong her back. Shes talked to me about it. She usually texts me but ive always tried not to over-do it. I respected what they have going on so far, regardless of my feelings for her. But right now shes stressed, she wants him to get a job, and if he doesnt, shes planning on moving to her sisters like 4 states away. Me and her talked about this today.

155,"We got our dog when he was 2.5 months old. He’s now a little over four. Since getting home we’ve brought two children (2.5yo and 2mo) into our family. The pressure on my wife to care for the kids full time is getting to her. I’m busy at work and she’s stuck at home all day.

The dog is a giant breed so everything about him is magnified. More shedding, more dirt on his paws, more food necessary. He’s above average at obedience for his breed which is not a very obedient breed. My wife derives no joy from him and I can’t honestly say that I do either. I used to, but with the kids and more stress at work he’s just one more chore. I bathe him weekly, trim his nails, walk him every night.

It all came to a head tonight because we’re heading out of town tomorrow. We downsized to a new car with the intention of selling our older larger car. We knew it would be a tight fit, but we don’t take the dog much anymore. As my wife was planning everything she realized the dog won’t fit in the car with the stroller which means loading up the kids and then the dog, taking him to the sitter, and coming home for the stroller.

158,"I'm 18/f and just started college this year. Neither of my parents went to college and I also have no friends so no one I know went to college. I barely graduated high school, I'm serious, the only reason I graduated is because showing up was no longer mandatory after covid. I wasn't planning on going to college, but I decided to on a whim. I enrolled in two online classes at my local community college over the phone in August, and paid $310 as the first part of a payment plan to cover the $900 something I owe for one of the classes, the other was covered by a grant. I havent paid the next part yet. I am honesty considering just leaving it and having them drop me out automatically when it's not paid or whatever. 

The classes arent things I'm interested in whatsoever. If I am honest I feel like there is nothing in the real world that I am interested in. The things I care about dont actually matter and aren't applicable to real life. Maybe it would be easier to do my classwork if I actually cared about it, but the issue is that I don't, and its an immense struggle just to force myself to do a single assignment. I don't have ""post graduation plans"". I dont have any plans. 

I work full time 35-40hrs a week at a grocery store. I absolutely hate my job. I lost my old job because of covid and I didn't know how good I had it there until I lost it and started working here. It's exhausting, even though its nowhere near the amount of physical labor my last job was. I hate almost everyone there. My coworkers, the customers. I just hate everything about it. I was planning to quit and look for work elsewhere but I'm having second thoughts about it now. 

Most of my days go like this: wake up 1-2pm, head to work around 2pm, leave at 7:30 or 10pm depending on the shift, come home, eat something, lay in bed and fck around on my phone or whatever, then go to sleep around 2am. Its the time after I get home that I should be doing assignments, but When am i supposed to do the bare minimum to just keep my soul alive? 

College was going okay for the first week, and I did some assignments, but then suddenly it was like I just blinked my eyes and I missed a whole week of assignments. Then another week passed, and another. A lot of things happening in my personal life are probably to blame for that, and I only just started to get the time to think about them again recently. But I'm so tired. Im so exhausted. I can barely keep going even without college. I don't think I can continue.

But then, I'm trapped. I cant get higher education to make more money. I don't have chances at better jobs to try and pull myself out of this hole. Even if I put my all into it, I can only afford 2 classes a semester. It would take me so many years to just get an associates degree. And I don't even have a career that I'm interested in, so I dont know what the degree would be.

On top of all of this, my seasonal depression is starting to kick in and im starting to feel like throwing myself in front of my train. I feel like this life is a complete trap that my soul is being wasted on. Theres nowhere up or out. Theres no better life. This is it, forever. Regardless of what I want just to pay my bills I will have to keep working full time even if I continue college. I'm just stuck. Im trapped. Theres no way out unless its six years of agony like this just to get a chance.",09Oct2020,1

For context we live together him and me 

You see he is smart but its like he has no motivation whatsoever. He doesn't look after good schools, im a senior i've told him i wanted to get into the Ivy Leagues and he asked me what where those, it's obvious that by his age he should know of things like that.

I wake up at 6 to 7 am to check my online classes(he has too) he sleeps very late maybe 1 in the morning and doesn't wake up until 2pm so i do my best to wake him up at 9 or 10 am 

He doesn't take responsibilities i take them even WITH MY FULL OCCUPIED SCHEDULE. He should do stuff like wash dishes, sweep the house, clean rooms, bathroom, toilet, sweep carpet instead I do all of those which he doesn't even feel bad about

I cant work because im busy with school literally full time schedule specially with house duties, but know this, if i were in his place i know i would take the time working to get money because were on a tight budget

In total he completes his classes in about 1 hour if he really wished for it he would work to get money

Ive talked to him about how he should be getting a job but he just says ""I know"" repetitively keep in mind this has been going on for 3 months and still nothing.  There's no Initiative from his part, he understands we need one but he doesn't want to

It's not limited to this aspect, he also provides no information what so ever (advice on school for me ) when i ask him he gives me answers so vague That are distasteful so i have to go to my cousins

Id prefer to ask him without hurting his feelings,
Keep in mind 
~He gets annoyed whenever you bring up the conversation,( so listening from his part is not guaranteed )
~ he is sorta suicidal(he says hes thought about commiting it, though i doubt he really feels that way because even i've thought about that for some small time)
~ hes one of those persons that prefer to ignore the problem than facing it
~he needs a reality check

I just wish I could look up to him :/

I don’t want this to be my life, I’m not even 30 yet and the thought of every single day just feels exhausting and defeating. Anyone ever find themselves in this shit spot in life they finally overcame? It’s getting really really bad mentally for me and I can’t even afford a therapist. I just feel so lost and helpless.",09Oct2020,1
175,"Me and my friend are college students, and we’ve been living together for awhile now. Overall, things are great. He’s my best friend, and I wouldn’t trade him for the world. But as time goes on I find it increasingly difficult to live with him. I need advice on how to be able to sit down with him and communicate my issues.

A little bit of background. He’s struggling with a lot of issues mentally right now, and I’ve been there to support him through a lot of it. I can’t tell you how many nights him and I have stayed up past 11:00 while he vents to me about what’s happening his life.

So that’s one thing, but there are other things happening that bug me. He never washes his dishes so I always have to wash them. He forgot to pay a portion of his rent one time, so I had to pay it for him (and he never payed me back for that. It was only $13 so I don’t care too much about getting the money back but it’s still frustrating that he hasn’t repayed that.)

After all of this, I have never heard him say “thank you” to me.

My whole life I’ve been a pretty passive guy. I hate confrontation. Everytime I prepare to talk to him about how unappreciated I feel for what I do for him I just chicken out. I do care about him a lot, and I understand that the longer I hold off communication with him the worse things will be. However, I can never actually bring myself to start the conversation because I don’t want to upset him.

Thanks for any advice. Much appreciated.",09Oct2020,1

178,"I (18f) just moved into college about 4 weeks ago. In that time I’ve become pretty close with my (18f) roommate. In the past few weeks getting to know each other she’s disclosed that she’s suffered through emotional/physical abuse from her parents, past and most likely current depression/anxiety, past suicidal thoughts and an abortion at the age of 14(grade 7). During the few weeks we’ve been here she’s had sex with about 7 guys, some un-protected and, all while not being on birth control. It was no surprise to me and I don’t feel much sympathy for her at this point. However, she’s still my friend and I want her to make the right choice. She wants to keep the baby but, considering she is a student with a life ahead of her and does not have the mental/financial stability to support a child, she plans to abort it. Initially, I was relieved to hear that she was set on abortion but, she’s insistent on waiting until after an ultrasound where the gender is revealed. I strongly disagree with this and I have advised her not to wait the 9-12 weeks. Obviously waiting this long is going to give her more time to become attached and knowing the gender will just give her more to hold on to. I’ve expressed my opinion to her but she is very persistent that the curiosity about the gender will always bother her and she’ll regret it forever if she aborts it too early. I’ve said that she’s setting herself up for more pain and grief than necessary but she is very aware and accepting of that. How else can I get through to her and tell her that the wait is not worth it? Is there anything else I should say or do?



TLDR: My roomate who previously had an abortion at 14 is now 2 weeks pregnant but refuses to abort until the gender is known. How do I convince her waiting is not worth it?",09Oct2020,1

180,"Does anyone happen to know this answer to this question about tinder

So i’ve been banned from tinder a few times, and before you think that i must be disrespectful or rude toward people you’re mistaken and i’ll explain why. i believe a few of my ex’s keep reporting me whenever they see my profile and it gets me banned. if you know tinder you’d know that this is a reoccurring problem for people getting randomly banned for no actual reason, and you can’t ask or request any sort of appeal because when you do they hit you with a generic “you broke our terms of service” email. 

i’m only explaining this because before i ask my question i want people to know it’s not for malicious purposes. i’ve used bumble, hinge, and facebook dating for very long without my accounts having any problem it’s only with tinder. and the reason i really keep wanting to use tinder is it simply has the most people. i use the gay options on these apps and there are a very limited amount of people who use the other ones. tinder always has people. i’m honestly just looking for someone to go on cute dates with ://

my question is does anyone know about what data tinder collects?  because when i make a new account with a new phone number, sometimes it will still know and ban that account as well. when i deleted facebook i seemed to pass the problem however now it’s still happening without facebook and i’d really appreciate any help anyone can give me. i just want to know what app or data on my phone could possibly be connecting me. thanks",09Oct2020,1
181,"there’s a man who makes me uncomfortable at my local dog park and i don’t know how to handle the situation. 

i’m a young woman and college student. i take my dog to the park one or two times a day because i don’t have a yard and it’s a nice break from school work. since i go so often, i know most of the people who bring their dogs to this park. for the most part everybody is nice. but there is a retired man who is there almost as often as me. 

the first time i saw him i was leery because the park is right next to my school and almost everyone at the park is a student. but i try to give people the benefit of the doubt so i tried to put it out of my mind. i noticed he was talking to a girl. she kind of roped me into the conversation. he’s very talkative. the first few times i spoke to him i wasn’t sure what to think but i was hopeful he was just friendly. maybe he was so talkative because he’s retired and this is one of the only places he gets to see people. my hopeful thinking was proven wrong. 

the first thing that rubbed me wrong was something i overheard him telling other girls. he was saying how he brings his dog, Spot, to the hospital as a therapy dog and all the nurses love on Spot. he said something like “they all say how they want to take him home and cuddle and i’m like -hey! i’m single! what about me!” after hearing that i went back to being leery of him but i was still friendly and talked to him. 

i’d spoken to a few girls that said he makes them uneasy too. one girl pointed out that he only ever speaks to women, they’ve never seen him talking to one of the many young men at the park. since she said that i’ve noticed that too. 

one time he gave me his business card. it’s literally just his name, email, and phone number. he’s retired, there’s no reason for him to have a business card in the first place and there’s certainly no reason for him to give it to me. he’s brought it up several times since then since i haven’t contacted him. when he gave it to me he said “you don’t have to text me if you think it’s too creepy or whatever but here just in case” so like he knows it’s weird. and said it was fine if i didn’t contact him yet he keeps bringing it up. 

i’ve had other uncomfortable moments and i won’t share them all but today he said many things that upset me so here’s just a few more from today. he said something about tattoos then asked if i had any. i said no but i want a lily. he asked why and i told him then he asked where i wanted it. i said i didn’t know which is why i haven’t gotten it yet. he proceeds to say “as a man i can tell you where no man likes a woman to have a tattoo: anywhere visible in normal clothes” -i cut in to say i don’t really care about that- “and on the boobs” and i didn’t really know how to respond. i tried to change the subject by saying “i don’t care what anyone thinks, heck-i don’t even shave my legs!” he went on about that for a while then brought it back around to “so no tattoos on your boobs”. needless to say i was incredibly uncomfortable. later he brought up the business card again. he said he had jumper cables so i should call him if i ever get in a bind. i said i don’t drive so that won’t be an issue. then he pointed out that i must live close enough to walk. i’ve always known anybody could conclude that by the fact that i don’t arrive to the park in a car and they could even figure out what direction i lived if they watched me leave so i’ve always made sure i’m not followed or watched. but him verbally pointing out that i live close made me feel very unsafe. then he offered to give me rides if i ever need it. i told him i wouldn’t need that. he got a call at that point and i went to the small dog section of the park to get away. i made sure to wait until he was gone to leave. 

i don’t want to keep feeling uncomfortable and unsafe. i’d love to just tell him not to speak to me but i also have major social anxiety. i see him all the time and i’ll continue to so i don’t want to cause a scene or whatever. i mean i’ve only been talking to him because of social etiquette this whole time and i can’t bring myself to be “rude”. my friends say to just walk away when he approaches and make it obvious that i don’t want to speak to him. i find it hard to do that. they say if i do that then he’ll be the one to be uncomfortable. that’s great but so would i. i’m bound by arbitrary rules of being polite. if someone had told me all this i would tell them to tell him off and not feel bad about it for a second. but it’s not that easy. he’s someone i encounter often so afterward i’d always be super anxious if i was there at the same time as him (i mean i am now but then it would be like an elephant in the room felt on both sides). and mustering up the courage in the first place is incredibly difficult. i don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR a man at the dog park keeps saying things that make me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. i don’t know how to get out of the situation and i feel bound by rules of politeness. please help.",09Oct2020,1
182,"I’ve had severe arachnophobia my entire life. I don’t know why, or what could have caused it, but it’s taking a toll on me. About an hour ago, I was laying in my bed about to go to sleep. I sat up to go to the bathroom and I see a spider on the wall next to the headboard on my bed. It was pretty close to my face so I screamed and took several steps back. I would’ve just ran and left them room, but I Wanted to keep an eye on the spider, so I could make sure it didn’t scurry off somewhere and then I wouldn’t know where it was. I kept my eye on it while I pulled out my phone and called my dad. I was hyperventilating and my heart was racing, my throat felt closed up, I was on the verge of tears, and my hands were shaking.


As I was standing there staring at the spider, it quickly crawled somewhere behind the headboard of my bed. Eventually my dad came in my room and searched everywhere for it, but never found it. He could tell how distraught I was so he tried his best to find it, even went as far as moving the whole damn mattress and taking all of the pillows and taking the cases off of them. After he was done searching for it he went and got some bug spray and sprayed my entire room. 

Right after he left my room, I grabbed some clothes, my laptop, my phone, my dog, and got the fuck out of there. I’m currently staying in the guest bedroom right now. Still a bit on edge. I don’t know how long it’ll take for me to be able to step into my bedroom again, and that makes me feel so weak and childish. All because of one spider, I’m having a panic attack, and staying in a entirely different room for God knows how long. 

I can’t keep living like this. All it takes for me to have a complete meltdown and crumble apart is a spider. A fucking spider. Having arachnophobia has always been a struggle for me, but this is just ridiculous. I’m an adult who’s crying over seeing a spider on a wall. It’s embarrassing.

Recently my family and have had a lot of arguments over my room, not helped by the Covid-19 quarantine.

186,"This is gonna be long so I apologize before hand. 

Over the past weekend my bf and I attended what was supposed to be a beach birthday party for my best friend of the last 10 years that was 100 miles from my home. Me being having extremely severe depression and social anxiety, dont drink, but do smoke (I'm 22 and its legal in Oregon) had some severe reservations about going since my bff is a very social person and has a tendency to befriend high class judgmental ones. (Any laid back chill girl knows what I mean: like the bitches that are snobby immediately.) Anyways my bf hasn't gotten to party for a while since and really wants to go. My best friend is insisting I have to come because Im her best friend so after hesitating I agree. My bff and I spend a month planning this party, we rent a 2 bed room suite since 5 of us were staying the night; my bff, her brother, his bff, my bf and I. We agreed multiple times during the process and the when we got to the hotel she would give us a few hours heads up before leaving so we could call our ride and not be stranded with a bunch of stuff. My bff got her own room, my bf and I got the the other room so I put our back packs in the bedroom wardrobe, and the guys got the living room. Everything was chill we were all having hella fun. Then first 3 guests arrive; 2 boujee ass chicks walk in with some dude and immediately give me a dirty ass look. At this point I ask my bf to go outside to smoke a cig with me (no smoking property) which worked out cuz my bffs brother and his friend were headed down to meet their guests. On our way down the elevator we all acknowledged how weird the energy got and then went our separate ways. I smoke and go back up and its even weirder of a vibe now and sent me into a straight up panic attack so I went into my room took one of my doctor prescribed xanax that were hidden deep in my backpack put them back and finally my nerves calm and I'm able to enjoy the party. Everyone who wasn't staying the night goes home and the rest of us go to our respective areas and pass out. In the morning my bf starts by waking the guys up first, then my bff and then me (I'm a bitch when I wake up so I don't blame him). We check out like regular and then plan to hit up some lunch and then finally the beach since we hadn't gone at all since we got there. We eat have fun just like normal and right when were walking to the car to head to the beach my bff pulls both mine and my bfs back packs out of the trunk, set them on the ground and say ""Well, me, C, and S are leaving right now so what are you gonna do?"" I got upset and asked what happened to the warning and she just looked at me like she had no idea what I was talking about says ""Now I'm fucking pissed"" they all 3 got in the car and ditched us 100 miles for home. We had to wait 2 hours for my dad to get us. Not to mention we were 50 miles father than we originally started. They also stole over $150 of unopened food, a brand new gram of oil and someone found my prescriptions and took 4 pills. And now shes telling a bunch of our mutual friends I'm this massive pill head for taking my PRESCRIPTION. She made fun of me for my depression even saying I'm faking it.

It started this past summer and I honestly thought it was stress and depression. I was working constantly and frequently had entire weeks when the sight of food made me want to vomit, even food I liked. There were other times when I would binge and shove all of my food for the day into this narrow window when I wasn't busy working.

Now I hardly eat at all. I've lost weight now to the point my family members have started asking me about it. To be perfectly honest I like to cook but my cabinets are almost empty (money is tight) and when I make something I usually end up eating maybe half of it before I start to feel sick. I can usually do one meal a day with coffee, and I drink a lot of water and juice, but eating feels like an inconvenience and have a hard time making myself do it.

We both find the other rude and disrespectful/dismissive at times. We have both made a concerted effort in recent times though. 

We did a presentation together today, and while I hoped she would present more, she was a lot more confident in what she did present, it was engaging, it went well, and I was really proud of how far she had come in a short time. There was plenty of development opportunity still but I was super focused on the good. We ran 5 min over but we had a few min of technical issues at the start so I wasn’t overly troubled by that. 

I had a check in with our manager afterwards and absolutely sang her praises and said how I hoped for her to present further into the material next time. 

Then I get an email. An email which basically said we ran out of time by a long way, and here are all her ideas for completely changing the presentation, content, structure, and style. The thing is, I created the pack, quite recently. I’m very proud of it, and I created and presented it regularly alongside a senior coworker and mentor of mine who no longer works with us. He and I covered these packs smoothly and successfully within the given time frame many times. 

Having had an awful day for person reasons, I wrote a response. It was clear about how I felt, and it would have been disingenuous to pretend I didn’t feel that way. I was hurt, I was disappointed, I felt like it was unfair. That email was not long but it was extremely blunt. 

I wrote the email, ready to edit and send later when I wasn’t so hurt by it, and saved it in my drafts to read and edit later. Not 5min later I received a document back to attach and send to some other emails I had saved in drafts. While trying to do other things as well (multitasking is not my strength) I sent two of the right emails, and sent my draft reply. I realised as soon as there was only one email left. 

I immediately went back to my sent emails, apologising. I explained I had accidentally sent it from drafts where I had saved it to edit before sending, that I knew how blunt that email was would have been hurtful, and that I would have put things much differently before actually replying. I explained the content was how I felt, but that I would have done better before actually sending. 

The email from her effectively called out that there was too much information in the presentation, that it should have content removed so we could be on time. 
She wanted to toss the packs my mentor and I had worked on for weeks in favour of something she had created, when she hadn’t yet learned to present it in its current format. We had an hour to get through 32 slides. She left me half an hour to get through 27 of them, knowing it was the heavier material. I was godsmacked and offended - I would never have dreamed of asking to remake something I hadn’t learned yet, and I certainly would never have critiqued running 5 minutes over if I spent 30min on introductions at the beginning and left the rest to the other presenter. 

I felt so stupid for having spoken so highly of her improvement to our manager and having mentioned none of the development points. I’m our team’s senior and I thought I’d just focus on celebrating the win today. Instead I got the wind knocked out of me, and then made a mistake to letting my emotional response go out instead of my professional one. 

I have apologised and explained honestly. I don’t know what else to do.",09Oct2020,1
204,"I work in amazon, and besides the fact that the job is 10 hours of constant walking/lifting/moving ect, they also have very strict policies for anyone showing symptoms of COVID19. MY shift pattern is monday tuesday,then thursday friday.. I called in sick monday till today saying i had a stomach bug, becuase If I said it was a cold then i would have been told to stay off work for 2 weeks or until I got a covid test done and the testing system is terrible at the moment.

Im on contract work so Im loosing money for every day I dont go in, and I just cant afford to miss 2 weeks for what Im sure is just a comon cold, ive had many times in the past.

So im wondering on this last day I have 1 hour before I have to leave for work, should I just call in sick for the last day and go back on monday fully normal? I still feel a bit shit but I could work, its just that my voice is still rough and I do still have a runny nose and a cough, so i wouldnt want to get caught by someone there with that and sent home for a further 2 weeks, i cant afford to loose that much money..

but at the same time I dont want to loose another days pay, and more importantly, this cold has come only 2 weeks into me starting a job with the company, so it looks terrible on me taking off a whole week within my first month. I dont have any kind of permanent contract and they are constantly employing so they may just see me as unreliable and let me go,

206,"Hey all, this ones kind of a mess. 

Backstory on how they even met each other. My neighbor and I chill sometimes. (Literally like once every few months) He’s annoying as hell, always bragging and flaunting about shit in his life so I don’t see him often, but one of these times we hung out and my sister and her friend were over. 

It was a weird vibe off the bat because he didn’t tell me his 30 year old drunk as fuck friend would be there, and they just kept talking about “getting bitches at the bar” and stuff. I didn’t want to be rude, so I figured we’d chill for a couple minutes and I’d make an excuse to go. In that time, they got talking about TikTok and stuff. He kept flexing about how TikTok famous he was (4000 followers) and insisting the girls add him on TikTok and hype him up to all the teenagers for follows. That was kind of a red flag for me, but they didn’t care and I figured maybe that’s normal for tiktok. (I’m not active on it)

This motherfucker manages to find my sisters Instagram and Snapchat name and follow her. My sister lets me know the next time I see her that he was sending her videos of porn and hitting her up for nudes and saying he didn’t care about the age gap. Of course she didn’t get screenshots or anything to prove it, so I had her unadd him in front of me and that’s about all we could do without some kind of evidence. 

This was last night. About an hour ago, my sister sent me a screenshot of him adding her on snap AGAIN. She decided she wanted to accept and try and get some evidence of him saying something creepy to her and then immediately unadd him again. I’m not a fan of this but if she gets something it would be really helpful. 

Is there something else that we should be doing here? Other than blocking him when she unadds him this time. Should we just leave it after that or tell someone about it? 

Extra info: my sister doesn’t live with me and he doesn’t know where she lives as far as I know so she’s good there.

214,"Hi! 
So a while ago during quarantine- I went through a really rough time. I’m pretty sure I have depression and anxiety thathad went untreated and I crashed during quarantine due to extreme stress. It happened when I heard A loud noise early in the morning and jolted awake with anxiety and it persisted for months after that.  I was waking up from jolts because of anxiety, didn’t sleep well for countless nights, super out of it. for a good 3/4 months everything  was a daze, and just felt sick the whole time, super unhappy and scared because of how I was feeling . Fast forward, I feel a lot better, but not normal- I still need to work on things as far as my diet, reducing anxiety, and figuring out what is the best for me. I would like to hear things that make you guys feel better, just for perspective and because I enjoying reading what other people have to say ! 

Secondly- 
Along with all of this, I’m super lost in life which I just turned 21- but the pressure of trying to go to school and work is super hard. I do want to continue school, but my parents don’t pay for anything so it’s really hard affording co pays for doctors visits, full amount of dental visits now because my parents didn’t take me in 7 years or get my tooth implant when I was a freshman when I couldn’t drive or afford it at that time, I was so young . Just a bunch of BS and I find that when I work and go to school- I end up having to drop out of the class because I didn’t get the grade I wanted because I would have to work a lot to afford these things. But I can’t get out of my house if I don’t work a shit ton. I don’t want to be here much longer because of my family and the shit they do and say. 
My childhood consisted of my dad going out and drinking and me calling him and asking him when he was coming home, we had great times but the bad times far outweigh the good times, my dad calls my mom fat, ugly, bitch, everything he can do to tear her down.
Has tried breaking down doors to get to his children because we called him an asshole (at separate times)
Then my mom, she’s sweet at times- but when she gets worked up it’s a lot, she’s broke a plate in front of my brother and I because she was upset, started grabbing her hair on another occasion and just being whack as fuck, has thrown me to the ground once because she thought I hit her (I was literally fucking 9 and was grabbing something hanging from the door), and one time when I was young my dad gave me a fat lip by “slapped you with two fingers and hit you in the wrong spot” (because I was hyper and wouldn’t go to sleep I was younggg) basically he said he didn’t mean harm by it.

For the past 2-3 months my dad has been living at the cottage with his mom (my grandma) which is about 3 hours away from us. He’d come by about once a week for a few minutes to collect some things from his bedroom and then he’d leave again.

Last week he came by again to collect some things, and he tells my mom that he’s “officially moved out” which didn’t come as any surprise to us. We don’t know why he felt the need to announce that since it was a kinda obvious that he was living at the cottage now. But I feel like his announcement made it feel more real in a sense.

I don’t know if I love my dad. I think I love him for the memories I have of him from when I was a child. Little things like how he’d take me to the grocery store and he’d put both of his hands behind his back for me to hold onto, when he decided to take us all on a family vacation to a waterpark when I was 11 (our first and only ever family vacation), and when he and I went to the movie theatre together for the first and only time to watch War Horse.

I have been trying not to think about it, the fact that he’s basically removed himself from our house and our lives. I talk to him on the phone about once a week but it feels so strange for me. I remember one recent phone conversation in particular where I told him “I love you” and he didn’t say it back to me. Which really hurt.

Not gonna lie, it’s been really quiet at home without him here — there hasn’t been anymore screaming matches and petty arguments between my parents. But I feel like he’s abandoned us, and abandoned me.

Again, any response that helps my situation is greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

So over the past year or so I have made a bunch of friends in a server  centered around nothing in particular. The list of at least 10 friends  includes people ranging from 13 to people in their early to mid 20s,  though most are just in high school and college. I am around the same age as these people. Obviously I won't give me actual age, but hopefully that helps. 

Now  I have quite a bit of trust in these people, not the same as my irl  friends, but enough to talk to them and share my inner feelings and  emotions with them, as well as my ethnicity and age/birthday. I have  only shared my face with a very close few of them and never given out  anything regarding my name, city, or any other personal information that  (correct me if I'm wrong) can be traced back to me, other than my voice  and general location (e.g. Southeast Quebec). Now I  have not revealed any of this to my parents, as they would likely  separate me from my friends of almost a year at this point. I am  hesitant to tell to them about this naturally. I understand their  concerns about pedophiles and stalkers on the internet. However, none of  their interactions have indicated any illicit behavior or anything  predatory. They have shared stories about their losses, accomplishments,  frustrations, and mental health issues. They have also shared their  voices, faces, and whatnot throughout these months (admittedly, I can't  really explain how that helps my case but that might be cause I'm bad at  explaining these things). My questions are 1. Whether I should be  worried about pedophilia in a server with approximately 20 people all of  whom are relatively active and who I've known for a long time and trust  (although my judgement could very much be wrong), and 2. If I have  enough, let's say, proof to show that I can trust these people, how  would I go about approaching and explaining to my parents that these  people can be trusted, judging by how my parents always tell me to talk  to my irl friends despite me having spent far more hours on this server  than with them, as guilty as that may make me feel, and their valid, if in this case (imo) false worries about pedophilia?

Huge  apologies if my wording has been vague here. I don't want this post to  be traceable for the sake of my friends and myself. And I'm also sorry  that I left the questions to the very end of the message, I just felt  like enough backstory was needed to clarify any questions ahead of time.

Any  help would be greatly appreciated. I have had these friends for a long  time, and I would not like to break up with them anytime soon, as  admittedly annoying as their shitposts and arguments can get at times.

237,"Am I obligated to make up a sick day at work? (USA)

I called-off due to a mental disorder I have documentation for. This is the first I've called off at this job. My employer is making me ""make-up"" for my sick day (i.e. was scheduled off Sunday but now working Sunday to make up for Tuesday, the day I called off). Which I understand, if I miss a day, it's my responsibility to make it up.
Except no one else at my job has had to do this. There's an employee with the same condition I have and he didn't have to make up his sick days. He had a doctor's note. When I asked my employer if my documentation or doc note would make a difference, meaning I wont have to come in on my scheduled off day, he said no unless it's Covid.

238,"This has been bothering me (20f) for a while, my parents recently got divorced (3 years ago) and since then my dad’s family has completely cut me off, they haven’t invited me to birthdays, christmas, celebrations or anything of the sort since then, its like since he stopped being married to my I don’t exist anymore, I have always been very quiet and polite, never cause any trouble during celebrations, helped with cooking and cleaning and while yes i did spend most of the party watching christmas movies and playing video games (christmas parties were usually held at my dad’s house so my console)I always thanked everyone for coming and said I enjoyed the celebrations, I have always known my dad and his family could be narcissistic and cruel but to cut ME off because my mom divorced him was beyond my imagination.

They still cut me off tho and it made me deeply hurt, I feel basically orphaned, my mom has no family (my grandparents died before I was born when she was a teenager/young adult) and she has been spending holidays with her dead first husband’s family, I don’t really like to tag along in those because I don’t know anyone and it feels uncomfortable, like im not really supposed to be there.

I have no friends available during the holidays and im currently single so no in laws to go to, my mom has offered to rent a cabin and have a camping holiday but it feels a bit selfish to take her away from her celebration just so I won’t be alone again, im not sure about volunteering either because my mom feels like it isn’t very safe for me to go alone to do something like since im not really involved in any communities around here.

243,"Throwaway account. I moved into a new apartment about a month ago, and things seemed okay at first. My roommate introduced me to a group of girls living next door, and for the first two weeks, things were perfectly fine. My roommate and I were socializing (safely) with our neighbors, and the connection was amicable. This all changed pretty suddenly. To cut a long story short, I offended one of the women, our brief relationship soured, and then I was no longer invited to their functions; my roommate continued to go. I fully admit I screwed things up, and I've been willing to make amends, but no such progress has occurred. Now, another roommate showed up at our residence a week ago, and then stuff started to get more complicated. Before, it had been my roommate heading next door and hanging out, but now the girls next door, including the person I'm having tension with, are coming over frequently, and this is creating what I think is a supremely awkward situation, where there is a person in my apartment socializing with my roommates while essentially giving me the silent treatment. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've talked to my roommate about this (the first one), and my understanding is that the other neighbors are fine with me, but the one girl is still pissed. Because of this, I'm not allowed over there, but she comes in here whenever she likes. I think this is a weird situation, and I'd like to just move past it, but I'm feeling pessimistic, mostly because I don't really know these people really well (roommates and neighbors). I don't want to keep having this awkward, unbalanced dynamic, so I'm considering telling my roommates that if things aren't going to improve, I don't want this person to come over anymore. I guess I need advice because I have some doubts about whether this is reasonable or not.",09Oct2020,1

I use it as an escape from things that make me uncomfortable. It's gotten to the point now where it takes so much energy to even think, it's like I'm addicted to being brainless. When I converse with people I can barely create sentences, and sometimes I cant. I hate that my brain is always off and I can't turn it on. I feel so crippled when I have to talk to anyone and it impacts my life so much now that I'm afraid I might end up losing my job cause I avoid talking to everyone.

258,"Hi everyone, i just wanna rant some things here...

So my Grade 11 sister transferred from a “traditional“ school to Homeschooling last month because we were supposed to move to Thailand for 2 years. But because of the travel restrictions, only my mom was able to go there (her quarantine is already done and she’s working there already) and my sister and I were left here in the PH, waiting for a go signal from the embassy. 

I’m doing online classes with modules and Zoom calls from my university and I’m pretty good at time management so I have no problem adjusting with online classes. However, my sister, from the traditional school setup to being enrolled in a Homeschool program, is currently struggling. In the program, they have a website called Quipper where all the subjects, lectures, lessons and topics are already compiled. She just have to answer all the quizzes every chapter. You know like the one in Khan Academy where he will just discuss and then a quiz pops up after, like that. Aside from that, she just needs to make a Research Paper at the end of the year. That’s it.

However, I am supposed to be her “parent-teacher” but I’m having lots of arguments with her whilst explaining how things are. Her first complaint is that the quizzes are so “hard” because there are no keywords from the video lectures. There are choices but for me, it seems that you need to analyze first before you can answer it. (Like for example, A is both correct, B a is correct but b is wrong, C both are incorrect). Something like that. It confuses her so much, and her scores averages from 5-7 over 10. And so I told her to learn ”how to think for herself” and to “start using her brain” because i noticed that when she was on a traditional school, she only depends on her classmates and what the teacher instructed her. She also complained how she wanna do Zoom calls also and that she wanna hav classmates too. Because in the Homeschool, she has a shitty learning advisor who doesnt reply and she has no classmates. Just literally a website where you should answer quizzes.

So I talked to her about it and her third complaint is that. She doesn’t wanna study anymore. (well i felt this too before hahah) Because the Homeschooling module is just about answering quizzes and not applying it it real life. She explained how she wanted to make a blog after the video lecture on Media and Information Literacy (because her previous classmates enrolled in other school does it) but the Homeschool program doesnt have any instructions on how to make a blog. And i told her to just make a blog and search it on YouTube, and be creative on making one. But she refused to do so because she always points out how her previous classmates are learning how to make a blog but her Homeschool isn’t teaching her. Then she suddenly said she wanna transfer school. Like wtff, her tuition fee is already paid like wthhh.

ASDSFGDSJAJKKL NOW IM SO CONFUSEDT  🤦🏽I understand how she is still adjusting but for me, she’s already complaining waaayy too much instead of just reading and learning and all. For me, she thinks life is so easy after Highschool and that it’s easy to make a living. I asked her what her ambitions are, she wanted to be a Content Creator, i wanna support her but I challenged her to make weekly contents and post a lot on Tiktok and platforms (like what GaryVee advices)... but then, still she doesn’t wanna do it , and just procrastinates.

I love her and I want good things for her, but I don’t wanna advise her like how boomers do. I dont wanna discourage her in her passion and creative endeavors, but I also want her to finish her Homeschooling. So in this case, if you were her sister, what would you do and what would you tell her?

261,"I’m a 19 year old girl attending a university and living in an apartment alone for the first time with my dog. A few weeks ago, I met the guy who lives across the hall. He’s a 25 year old student getting his second degree from our university. When I met the guy, he seemed nice enough, and I thought it’d be nice to know someone who lived close by in case I ever had any questions about things going on in the building. 
We started having casual conversation through a group chat on Snapchat, which didn’t really bother me at first as I didn’t talk very much in it. Maybe a week after the creation of that group chat, I messaged my neighbor privately, as my fire alarm was going off and I didn’t know if his was as well. After that, he continued to start conversations with me which again, I didn’t see too much of a problem with. 
Then, things took a turn. I started noticing that when I’d take my dog outside, my neighbor would happen to show up in front of the building to smoke a cigarette. Other times, I’d return from letting my dog out, and my neighbor would be leaving his apartment at the same time. Now, there have been a few times that I have just coincidentally run into my neighbor, but the issue is that he starts conversations that last from 20 to 45 minutes and every time I try walking away and say that I need to go, he asks another question to continue the conversation. This became very frustrating, as I felt like I needed to sprint with my dog to the stairwell to avoid having a 45 minute conversation. He’d also open his apartment door to get my dog to run out of my apartment and into his to let him sniff around while we were talking in the hallway, which made me uncomfortable, and he’d use my dog as an excuse to continue the conversation.
Eventually, he admitted that he would listen to me leave my apartment so he could go outside to “pet my dog,” and followed up by saying “I’m sorry if that’s creepy!” To this I just awkwardly laughed because I knew he’d been doing it. 
Tonight, the neighbor asked if I was singing earlier in the evening, to which I responded “I don’t know, probably,” because I had been, VERY quietly. He responded saying I had a great voice, and asked out of no where if I could give him a guitar lesson. I told him no because I wasn’t very good, to which he replied “I could come over now to plunk a few chords and pet your dog”. Might I add, it was 12:15 am. This really got under my skin, as he was listening to me sing, presumably while he was standing in the hallway, and was insisting on going into a 19 year old’s room at midnight. (Note: he has also asked me to go to dinner twice now to which I’ve declined.)

Now, my question is, what should I do? Other than him following me outside when he hears me leave my apartment, he isn’t exactly committing a crime and is just being creepy and not taking social cues that I’m not interested. I left him on read once on Snapchat, to which he called me out for when he saw me in the hallway, so I’m afraid to block him, as that’s not even the majority of the issue. I’m also looking into soundproofing my door. I’m not planning on signing my lease for another year, but I have until August of 2021 to live directly across from him, and I’m not sure how to go about this situation. Right now I’m going to stop opening his messages and try harder to cut off any conversations he starts in the hallway or outside, but I don’t know if that will make him get the hint that I’m not interested. Any tips?",09Oct2020,1

265," To sum everything up, I (15) auditioned for an acting scholarship at an acting academy by sending in a self tape.

After getting a text asking if they could call me, I got a call where basically I was told that they really enjoyed my performance, asked if I'd had any pervious experience, and told me that, while I hadn't won the scholarship, I had won the runner up prize, and that she'd send me through the details.

I told my dad who asked if it was free, and said if it wasn't, it's a popular marketing scam where they get people to sign up for a discounted price.

I just checked the details and yup, they're giving it to me for half price.

I'm honestly so devastated as I was so excited and it all seemed so real and genuine. I've done some googling and have found from their old face book posts that they do a scholarship every term, which makes sense as it's a term long scholarship. I did some more googling and found out that the lady who called me has taken lots of classes at the academy if that helps.

Has anyone had experience with this? Am I just being tricked into buying the class? I really can't tell and don't want to throw away this opportunity if it's real. Thanks!",09Oct2020,1

Hey reddit, I was wondering if I could have some advice from you guys. Here’s some backstory: I’ve known this girl since third grade and we’ve always been pretty solid friends, recently she’s gotten into an opioid addiction which I’ve been trying and trying to tell her to stop. There are four main characters I guess you could say, Me, my friend, My friends cousin, and my friends cousins friend. Anyway yeah she’s been having a problem with drugs pretty recently and I’ve tried to give her the best advice I can, which in hindsight probably isn’t very good advice. Anyways, so one day I see that my friends cousin added me on Snapchat, my friend says not to add him because he probably wants to fight me. Keep in mind I have never talked nor even heard of this guy before this. He tried adding me on snap but I declined. Tonight I saw that a girl had added me on Snapchat, I was skeptical but I accepted the friend request. I ask my friend if they know this person and she says yes. She tells me that it’s probably her cousin. I blocked them immediately after I heard that. Then ANOTHER person adds me on snap, apparently it’s this cousins friend I guess. I accept stupidly because I’m an idiot. They add me to a group chat with the cousin and his friend, and they immediately start harassing and threatening me. 

Here’s how it started: I join
• cousin: “so I heard you tellin my cousin to take sum pills?”
• I respond saying “yeah cause I definitely said that huh”
• Crazy cousins friend responds saying he’ll “pop a 9mm in my head” 

I pretty much left the group and blocked both of them after that

I don’t have snap maps on so there’s probably no way for them to know where I live. But yeah I ask my friend why she would give her cousin my snap and she doesn’t really have a reply. So I say that I’m gonna in-add her for my own safety because I’m uncomfortable with the situation I’m in. 

This was the right thing to do right? Should I delete Snapchat altogether?
Could they get my sisters snap and harass her somehow? I’m have a lot of questions and I don’t want to bring this up with an adult because these kids are from a part of town where people get shot a ton. I just have a lot of questions that I need answered",09Oct2020,1

I told my classmates, whom I had sat close to, of my sudden symptoms and lazily attempted to go home ( one works with old people, and one is immunocompromised), butvwas told that it was, essentially, ""no big deal"". I should also mention that, like an idiot, I was not wearing a mask (none of us were). I know it's fuckin stupid. 

This morning I woke up with a fever, a cough, a headache, and soreness. With the exception of being tested tomorrow, I have decided to stay home. My ex has agreed to buy me food and leave it at the door. I'm trying to be productive and study, but at the same time I don't know what to do. 

The truth is that I was careless about all this. I was going out, meeting people, going to classes, and all of that before I felt sick. I was even training at a dojo and hitting the gym. Now I'm frantic because I can't shake this feeling that, somewhere down the line, my negligence could get someone killed. I didn't want to put my life on hold, and if I test positive tomorrow then I'll never know whether this act of selfishness was someone's death warrant. 

I told my classmates that I woke up feeling sick. I haven't called the many places I've been in the last few weeks, and I don't know if I should. I really don't know what to do here, and I can't stop thinking about it. I know I'm an idiot. Now what?",09Oct2020,1

About a year ago she let herself out of her own cage by repeatedly smacking the cage door handle with her paw and that was pretty weird but I understand how she did it. 

But yesterday was the weirdest thing that’s ever happened, her and I were sleeping in my bed. My door is always completely shut btw. And I wake up at 3 in the morning and notice she’s not in my room anymore. I just assumed my mom or dad let her out in the middle of the night because she might have been scratching at the door to let her out, but when I asked them they said mom dad was passed out and my mom was in the bathroom at the time.

Right now she's battling a really bad lung infection &amp; has lots of fluid in her lungs. She's been sedated and made comfortable, the doctor is saying she has around 1-2 weeks left.

I have no idea how to be supportive &amp; I'm so scared that I won't be there good enough for him though this.

279,"Hi everyone,

Back story: I'm currently two months in my first year of university for CS. It's a pretty prestigious program and university where I live, and it was competitive to get into. Throughout high school, I've worked so hard to get into this program. But I felt like the reason why I got in was because they were lenient bc of covid &amp; because of my extracurriculars, not really bc of my grades.

Anyways now I'm having such a hard time in school. Like I'm keeping up with lectures, I read textbook everyday, but when I'm doing the quizzes, I don't understand. I even hired tutors which does improve my grades a bit, but I'm still averaging at 60s. 

I really want to transfer out into another program, but I'm not sure what. Even when I bring up the idea to transfer out, my parents were kinda against it, which makes sense because I don't even know what I want to transfer to.

I feel so bad because my parents move to this country just so I can get good education, but I felt like I'm really not good enough in this program and I tried really hard but I just don't understand the courses.

I was also considering of taking the next term off but my parents really doesn't want me to and I know if I do take the semester off, my parents will be very disappointed.

Any advice on what I should do? Right now my step is just to finish the term and see where I'm at and how I do. If it's really bad, then I'll have to look for another alternatives.",09Oct2020,1

284,"So, I'm trying to decide on an apartment to move into and found two options that I believe are pretty equal, with a few differences. I'm a college junior trying to move back out of my parent's house because I'm finding it pretty difficult to do well in classes with the distractions of being at home and miss having my own space. Living at my mom's house makes this difficult since I'm the oldest of eight kids and there's practically no more space for me here. *Here are my options:*

**Apartment 1:** $765/month + utilities, 1br/1ba. This one is a ground floor apartment. It's a pretty decent size, but I don't need much space since I'll be living alone mostly. It has a living room, small kitchen, bathroom, and a bedroom. It's in a pretty nice (and affluent lol) neighborhood and is relatively close to campus. It's also in a safer neighborhood than apartment 2 (smaller crime rate from what I found in online crime databases). This one is directly across the street from the city's biggest park; I don't know the area too well, but I saw some small shops lined up at the end of the street. It's also relatively close to a grocery store but further away from public transportation (I mostly take the train around and I believe that there's only a bus stop near this one). I took my mom with me to go look at this one and she thinks this one is better. 

**Apartment 2:** $725/month + utilities, 1br/1ba. This one is a top-floor apartment (the building has three floors). This one is much bigger than apartment 1; it has a kitchen, living room, dining room, bathroom, bedroom, and I believe that it also has a balcony off the bedroom. So, alot of space. It's in a neighborhood behind a really busy section of the city; it's located on a street with a lot of restaurants, small businesses, an international food market/grocery store, etc. This one is pretty close to campus and I know that there is a good amount of students living in those areas. The area has slightly more crime than the other area, but I believe that that's due to how busy the area can be. This one isn't very close to public transportation either, but since I know the area, I can walk towards campus to get on the train. This is somewhat true for the other apartment as well, I just don't know that area as well. 

Both places seem great. They are both with the same rental company and have the same lease terms too. I find myself getting stuck because I really like the aesthetics of apartment 2 and have been told by everyone (except my mom lol) to go with this choice since it's bigger and cheaper, and is in an area that I'm very familiar with. Affordability isn't too much of a problem given that this is being paid for by my university, I just have to manage the money given to me for the duration of my lease which shouldn't be a problem. I also have to purchase furniture since I don't own things like a bed or couch. The places are also virtually the same distance from campus, they are just on opposite sides of it (on e is more south, the other is more north). Part of my problem also comes from trying to picture life in each apartment, I can picture myself living in apartment 1 but not so much apartment 2. When I think about going with #2, I feel slightly unsettled like I should choose the #1. So, I feel stuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this may be slightly long, but does anyone have any advice? This will be my ""first"" apartment, so I'm kinda looking for all the advice and guidance I can get. Any help is appreciated, so thank you!!!",09Oct2020,1

288,"This incident happened around 1 year ago. It was one of those things that are super painful in the moment, but you just ignore it and hope the pain goes away. However, with this, it never did, and I think I am understanding more and more about why the pain is still there. 

I dated this guy when I was 15. He was my first “love.” I really REALLY liked him. Our relationship lasted about a year, but it was on and off. The main reason why it was on and off was because I personally didn’t want anything serious. Despite having very strong feelings for him, none of my friends were in relationships and I just genuinely loved hanging out with my friends. My friends were my #1 priority, and I felt that having a serious boyfriend would take up too much of my time. I think that in my 15 year old head I was hoping to be more serious with him once I reached an age where I felt ready for a serious relationship. When we weren’t dating, we were extremely close friends. 

Then, I entered an abusive relationship that was absolutely terrible. I really felt that nothing I did during that time was my own decision. I don’t even consider it to be my own decision to date my abusive ex boyfriend, he was one of those guys who just said “you’re mine” and expected you to comply. If you don’t comply, then it gets scary. And that’s what happened to me. I still liked my ex boyfriend while entering the relationship with my abuser. However, I learned pretty quickly that I had to stifle those feelings if I wanted to avoid verbal, emotional, or physical abuse. I just got myself to “forget” about him. 

It wasn’t until I entered college that I noticed my feelings for my first ex began to creep back. I was still with my abuser, but the distance was allowing me to think for myself again. However, I soon met my current boyfriend and completely forgot about him. 

Then about a year ago, my sister randomly gets an invitation to a party from my first ex boyfriend. He tells her to invite me and anyone else she wants. This is weird to me because my sister is about 2 years older than him and I. They have also never talked before according to my sister. Anyway, her, a few friends, and I go this party and I soon found out that it would be a terrible experience for me. For some reason, I was expecting my ex boyfriend to be happy to see me again. He wasn’t, or at least I couldn’t tell because he didn’t say one word to me. However, he was ALL over my sister. I was sitting on a couch with my friend and my sister, and my ex was just following my sister around. He was on the couch talking to her, and he was close enough for me to hear. He was touching her flirtatiously, saying how beautiful she is, etc. I also want to note that this was super odd. It may have been because he was drunk, but he never talked to her before. He was also not acknowledging that this was literally his ex girlfriend’s sister but whatever. 

Actually, I lied. He DID say one thing to me that night, and it was asking me if my sister could sleepover his house and that he would drive her home. I was listening to the entire conversation to know my sister did not lead him on to say that at all, she was just as confused as I was. 

That night was super painful for me, and I never knew why but I think I know now. I never felt that the breakup between him and I was “consensual.” It just happened, it was forced by an outside party (my abuser). I also never got to process those feelings because I was too busy dealing with the abuse, and now I’m dealing with the emotional consequences. 

It still hurts to think about it. For example, I heard him mentioning things that I told him while we dated. For example, my sister owned a small business and she started it while him and I were together. I remember at age 15 I was so proud of my sister, and I told him because I was excited for her. Then, at the party he mentioned her business. She doesn’t even have the business anymore, so it was weird. I felt sad that he was using that to flirt with my sister, and I just imagine the 15 year old me who really liked him and told him out of excitement. 15 year old me would have never imagined him using that information to get with my sister. 

I don’t know, I hope this makes sense but I don’t know if it does. I know for a fact I don’t miss him and I don’t want to get back with him. There was even a time after I broke up with my abuser for good, and I saw him on tinder. I ended up never swiping right or left on him, but I specifically didn’t care because I had no intention to talk to him again. It’s just the sadness I feel for my 15 year old self. How can I deal with the hurt feelings? Has anyone else dealt with something like this? How do you completely get over old feelings?",09Oct2020,1
289,"Hi Reddit, this is my first ever post. Obligatory sorry for any format issues as I am on mobile. Anyways, down to the main issue, I will try to keep it as short as possible. 

I (21,M) am a third year law student. The way a law degree works in my country is, you have three options; a four-year bachelor of laws degree, or a five-year bachelor of commerce or bachelor of arts law degree, after which you have to intern for two years at a law firm before you are allowed to practice. I chose the four-year degree, so ideally next year would be my final year. The thing is, and I understand this is coming from a very privileged position so I do apologize for that, but I hate it so much. These past three years have been absolutely hell, and have made me realize that this is definitely not what I want to do with my life. The reason I chose to do a law degree initially, I am somewhat ashamed to admit, was for the money. I grew up poor, my mom is a single-parent to my brother and I, my dad was around despite the divorce, but was unemployed for most of my upbringing but contributed financially when he could. I’m not trying to garner sympathy, just trying to put into context the reason I chose to do law; to me it seemed the easiest way to make a decent living and not be poor anymore. However I can’t continue doing something I know I don’t want to do. Both my parents are obviously dead set on me becoming a lawyer. I have expressed to them my unwillingness to continue, and they have both acknowledged it, but have urged me to at least finish the degree as I am in my penultimate year, which of course seems like the practical thing to do. However they still brag at family functions and say things along the lines of “...when you become a lawyer...” which is frustrating to say the least. I am very conflicted as to what I should do, as I definitely don’t want to continue the law degree, but dropping out would also make me liable to pay back the student loans I took out to study immediately. I have spoken to a couple of friends within the law faculty about my situation, and they empathize, a good few of them have also decided not to continue, however, all of them are doing the five-year commerce-law degree combination, which means that when they finish this year, they will at least have their bachelor of commerce qualifications. The same cannot be said for me however, I would essentially be leaving with no qualifications. 

I have also considered maybe switching degrees. The thing I am passionate about and what I’d ideally want to go into is racing and cars in general. I have tried to become a racing driver myself, however, and those reading who know anything about motorsports can attest to this, it is very expensive, and my financial situation cannot support this, and COVID didn’t help my plans at all either. My maths marks in high school weren’t anything spectacular, so mechanical engineering isn’t something plausible for me either, and it’s not something I see myself doing if I’m being completely honest. The plan I have if I do leave or change, is to take a course to become a mechanic, but at this point I’m not even sure anymore. 

I don’t want to sound all doom-and-gloom and complain the entire the time, but I have watched  my dream fade right in front of my eyes without me being able to do anything about it, and am now stuck doing something I hate, and at 21 years old, I feel like my life is over. I know that sounds irrational and that I shouldn’t feel like that, and every person around me keeps telling me “you’re young! You have your whole life ahead of you!” But at this point I guess it’s difficult to see that as being true. 

I guess what I’m getting at is, what do you think I should do? Should I continue with what I’m doing now, or should I drop everything and pursue something else? I’m sorry if this came off as more of a rant than anything else, and again I’m sorry if this comes off as very privileged, I do understand that there are millions of people who would kill for the opportunities I have. But I really just need some advice on what I should do going forward, as I feel lost. Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated, and thanks to those who actually read all this, I know it’s a lot.

293,"**TW- brief mention of mental health and s**cide (marked w “**” so you can skip that paragraph)

Hey everyone! Okay so I have a main group of friends whom I am really close with of 7 people. We share so many secrets, plans, etc, and I know they genuinely care about me. I have known them for 3 years and we all go to the same school so we see each other a lot.

For my 18th birthday party, I invited them all and picked them up in a bus, we got drunk, ate heaps, and had a super good time. The “party” was 4-ish days long, as we had to drive to the location, which was 3 hours away, but I paid for ALL the transport, food, alcohol, everything, bc that’s what you do. Everyone said they loved it, etc. However, my party was three days before my ACTUAL BIRTHDAY, meaning we wouldn’t be together for my bday. Note that all of my friends KNEW THIS. 

On my actual birthday, when we were all apart, I got wished happy birthday by acquaintances, casual friends, close friends, family friends, even a guy who’s into me (but I’m p sure I’m a lesbian so whatever). But all of my seven “closest” friends FORGOT. I waited and waited but none of them called me, messaged, or anything. I feel like they don’t give a shit about me, considering how much fun we had at my party.

**TW SUICIDE/MENTAL HEALTH MENTION** Bit of a side note, but still relevant: I am going through a super tough time, mentally and otherwise. I won’t get into it, but it’s been hell. It includes someone very close to me having a major relapse in mental health and attempting suicide multiple times, which triggers my own suicidal tendencies, which I’ve struggled w for years. My friends knew about this, and know I am suffering, so I really just don’t know why they wouldn’t spend two seconds to say happy birthday to me when I am having the worst time in my life right now. ****

I just feel super hurt, rejected and abandoned. I have self worth, trust, and abandonment issues, which have just been elevated by this. I go to great lengths for each of their birthdays, getting them good gifts and always saying happy birthday and making them feel special, because I love them. Additionally, my party was so much fun and so expensive, so I feel so shit that they didn’t even remember my actual fucking birthday.

Them not wishing happy birthday just made me feel like shit. My mental health is always terrible, but I just feel so much worse and like I’ve lost all my support systems. I cried so much on my birthday and I really NEVER cry (some of the crying was bc of stress and not wanting to be 18, but this incident definitely added to it).

None of them fucking noticed until I messaged the group chat saying “I’m kinda hurt y’all forgot about my bday today but yea”. I wanted to be casual and kinda play it off, but I feel like an idiot. I want to be harsher but idk what to do bc I don’t know if I’m overreacting. Out of the seven ppl who saw the message, one played it off like some kind of fucking joke w some shitty excuse that she was “working” (when she constantly sends me pics of her art and commentary on the book she’s reading,,, and like working??? Seriously, it’s not hard to say happy bday), and one (the one I’m closest with who calls me their best friend) DMed me and said they were so stressed about exams that they were studying extra hard to get it out of the way. They also said they “almost had a meltdown” when I reminded them they forgot my bday but I’m so upset I can’t find it within myself to A) care B) actually feel guilty. How tf do you forget your best friend’s birthday?!? Then they asked how my day went. I haven’t replied to the group chat or my best friend bc I’m just so mad and I have a bad tendency to blow up at people. I feel like I’ll snap and I don’t want to be called “selfish”.

I don’t know what to do. Another friend has a party tomorrow (a sleepover too) but I’m so angry and embarrassed I even call them friends that I don’t want to go, but I have to, bc I care about them all and I already said I would go.

What do you think I should do? Am I overreacting?? WHAT SHOULD I DO AT THE PARTY??? I don’t want to take all the attention, be selfish, or whatever but I don’t want to sweep this under the rug. Sorry it was a bit of a rant, thank you for reading and for giving me any feedback :) pls respond ASAP if you can, bc I can’t work I’m just so hurt and frustrated.

294,"tldr; my brother (23M) and i (18F) think its time to move out. we cant deal with my moms toxicity, anger, or her tight grip on her anymore. i dont know how to budget for this or if its even a good idea. should i just go for it and move into my college dorms?

i (18F) think it's time for me to move out. i cant live at home like this anymore and neither can my brother (23M). now let me be clear, my brother and i arent perfect angels or anything,we have our shit too, but we honestly cant deal with my mom anymore. here's some background information:

let me tell you a bit about my brother and myself first. as i said im 18F and i just started at a university. technically though im a junior in college because i did a program in high school that helped me earn my Associate's Degree, so im ahead. i also work part time like 3-4 days a week in retail and just started in august. i have a scholarship that pays 75% of my fees plus grants and financial aid. my brother is 23M and works part time like 2 days a week in retail as well and does college part time. he doesn't have a degree but he started at 18. i dont think he has any aid or scholarships because he failed several classes

anyway, we live in a toxic environment. my mom is constantly breathing down our necks. shes always angry and stressed about everything and takes it out on us. my brother and i have become different: we talk back now. we never used to do that before because its disrespectful, but when we try to be calm and rational she doesnt listen. we've had several conversations about this and it gets better for a couple weeks then turns into a shitshow again

let me try to bring up some examples of what she gets mad about that actually start arguments:

\- today my brother told my mom i was up until 6am the previous night. she got pissed at the both of us (mainly me) and said im throwing my life away, that i wonder why im depressed when i stay up like that, that i should get a full time job and do school part time instead since im throwing my life away, and that im lazy and will lose my scholarships since i have 2 Cs and an A

\- she found me awake about an hour ago and my brother as well and yelled at us. she said that shes gonna take both of us off of her insurance, that she's going to turn the wifi off so we cant be up at night, that she doesnt wanna deal with us anymore, and then some of the other stuff again like that that we're throwing our lives away, and that we should work full time and do college part time so we dont have any free time to stay up. she told both of us to go to bed. why is she telling my brother to go to bed when hes 23 years old?

\- last week we lost power and my brothers gf got worried and he wanted to get in contact with her and go for a drive to mcdonalds (which is like 3 minutes from our house) to get reception. my mom said no (hes 23 years old why is she controlling him) and got **extremely** pissed off when i defended him saying that hes an adult. he left anyway but she yelled at me until the power came back on (about an hour) and him as well when he came back

\- she gets mad at us when my brother and i get along. when we have fun she tells us to stop which makes no sense

\- she got mad at me for even **considering** moving out then proceeded to guilt trip me

\- she gets mad if i ask to go out

\- when i use my headphones since theyre noise canceling

\- when i buy stuff online

\- when i express my feelings to her (if im sad or mad)

\- when my brother and i disagree with her on something and ""gang up"" on her. are we not allowed to have differing opinions?

\- she gets mad when i sleep in even if i dont have anything to do

\- if i have days where im extra tired or sad she gets mad that i dont feel like talking

\- when i have days where im very depressed and dont want to do anything, eat , talk, or leave my bed

thats not even everything. and when i say mad i mean like pissed off to the point where she starts yelling and cursing and arguing

on top of the anger she doesnt understand or listen to us as people or even to our feelings. she says she does but then she chooses not to listen to us. she'll get pissed off with us then later on say shes sorry and she understands but does the same shit over and over. i try to tell her my point of view and what i think but she doesnt listen so i dont say it nicely anymore, not that it works but im tired of being silenced and ignored. its difficult trying to get her to listen. im beginning to ice her out. its never been as bad as it has this year. my mom and i have been best friends my entire life since im the youngest but this year has been horrible with her. i dont know if part of it is corona since she works at home and i go to school at home so we're stuck together (my brother as well of course)

i honestly just cant do this anymore. like i said, even talking to her about it is a problem. she **refuses** to listen to my brother and i. i know we could be nicer but even before we started talking back she was already like this. i guess since we're older now we've gotten tired of standing down to her so the back talking made it worse. but in reality we shouldnt be treated like we're children. we dont act like it, or i dont at least since my brother is different

my brother and i also both struggle with our mental health. we both have depression and i have an anxiety disorder as well. ive been suicidal and almost self harmed before. its harder to deal with this when im already so mentally tired and depressed all the time. ive lost a bit of motivation and struggle to stay happy and relaxed

and we have 3 older siblings: 45F, 43M, 39F. the older 2 woul take my moms side honestly but 39F has already told me even before any of this that she thinks i should live in a dorm instead so at least she might support me and help me budget since shes super smart

but anyway now that you have the background information, im thinking i should move on campus. i was going back and forth about it before because on the one hand its more expensive, i dont have a car or drivers license, my mom has babied me my whole life so i dont know how id live alone, and i dont want to live with a stranger who could be snooping in my stuff. we also just started redecorating my room and got all new furniture but isnt there already furniture in dorms? on the other hand i can do student loans, i can depend on friends and uber for rides i guess?, everyone has to learn life skills at some point, and maybe ill get roomed with a nice person. i just cant continue to live this way. i really think it might be time for me to leave

i have no clue how to budget for this or if should start working full time if i move into a dorm. im doing research on the dorms so i can figure out what to do. i also dont know how to tell my mom without her blowing up at me. she already said when this semester is over she wants us to work full time and just go to college part time so maybe ill add onto that

i really just feel like this is too much for me. its hurting my mental health and my relationship with my mom. i dont want to ruin what we have and i cant deal with all of this. please any advice/guidance/ideas are welcomed. thank you if you read all of this",09Oct2020,1
295,"So, I was just hired two weeks ago by a company that has to take security pretty seriously. 

We always lock the door at 6 pm so customers don't continue to walk in. 

Before we leave at night, we set an alarm system. 

I just remembered that a customer came in just before 6. My coworker who is training me, talked to me for several minutes afterward, giving me tips. I think we walked back into the warehouse without locking the front! He's always so security conscious I didn't even think about it.

I live 30 min away from work and we set an alarm. This was the first night he let me do everything on my own. Should I:

text him now at 3am to ask him if he locked the door (he's, like, 60 btw which makes me feel extra weird about it).

drive the half hour myself and try to see if the door is locked without tripping the alarm.

Set an alarm to wake up at 6 and text him then.

or

Just allow my boss to come into work to find the door potentially unlocked (she gets there first) and take the hit.

I feel so nerved up and sick to my stomach. I was just doing good! I'm scared if I go up there, I'll set the alarm off on accident.",09Oct2020,1

299,"*Quick version at the bottom. Details in between.*

So, this advice is for my fiance. During our relationship, he has always had a strained relationship with his family. His dad is abusive and his mom had always put all of her issues on him even as a young child. He was a kid dealing with very adult issues. His sister was was super close with the dad as he always wanted a girl and everyone treated her like gold and still does. His brother acts very similar to the dad, but they used to be close as kids. Him and I got into a relationship a little over 2 years ago and got engaged on our one year anniversary. During the entire process, his family treated him and myself like shit. I tried repeatedly to get him and his brother to reconnect, however his brother always turned down the offers to hang out with him. Later, his mother confided in me that it was because he couldn't stand to even be around my fiance because he owed his brother money. They even ruined our engagement day when they knew he had it planned and insisted he stay in town to be close in case they needed anything. (He was planning a big rose garden proposal in the next city over, but instead we got engaged at a restaurant because of them. They knew he had it planned too.) Once we were engaged, everyone acted off and said it's too soon to get engaged. His sister asked if he is sure he wants to get married to me etc. 

Well, the brother finally found his first girlfriend ever and they got engaged in under 6 months. Everyone was over the moon excited. The parents had a party, put the engagement in the newspaper, etc. This bothered both my fiance and I as we were treated so differently. Especially since then his brother finally spoke to him for the first time in a long time and asked him to be his best man. He finally couldn't take it and confronted his mom. She said she would reply when she had the time. So we waited weeks for a reply. She finally said she's sorry. That's all. He confronted his brother who admitted that his mom is leery of me because I'm disabled and don't bring in a ton of money because of it. He also said that he thinks we are moving too fast yet he has even sped up his wedding from being to next February to being this Saturday. We confronted his mom again and she tried to guilt trip us.

My fiance wants to go to his brother's first wedding, but he's hurt. He's been treated less than his siblings all idc his life. He was kicked out of his mom's house at one point for not having a job and was homeless, yet his little brother has always been allowed to live there he finally moved in with his first every girlfriend.

One moment I’m worried about this and then life just keeps going on. I just want to fit in with somebody, SOMETHING that can make me feel comfortable. Or maybe I don’t know what I want.

303,"Hi everyone. I’m second year university student now, I lived in residence first year and I  barely made any friends. I lied to my mom, she thinks I made so many and had a great time. In reality, I avoided the dining hall as much as I could (ate alone when I didn’t), I spent my Fridays and Saturday nights alone in my dorm watching movies or walking around the city. 

The second week of first year I was sexually assaulted by a guy who was on my floor and I completely shutdown. I didn’t tell anyone and after the incident, I just felt so incredibly uncomfortable and unsafe being around people who I didn’t know all my life (especially guys). I also avoided leaving my dorm as much as I could that way I wouldn’t run into him (and when I did leave, it would either be very early morning and I'd stay out all day, or late at night on weekdays). Not knowing who anyone was, what they were like in high school, where they are from etc. I realized that I TRULY didn’t know anyone and what their intentions were. 

Obviously I made a few friends, mainly in class. The people I became close to were commuter students, they didn’t live in my dorm. And even then, they felt more like “class friends”, I didn’t really vibe or click with any of them. So I haven’t really stayed in touch since I moved out. I don’t want to play victim, but I also found that a lot of girls in my dorm didn’t really seem approachable or nice. I would smile at them and they would make a confused or mean face to me. One time I asked a girl if I could sit with her in the dining hall and she told me that she’s saving the seats around her for her friends. All these situations just caused me so much embarrassment and I think discouraged me from wanting to put myself out there. 

You know how in high school everyone knows everyone, looking back I think I found comfort in the fact that I was always surrounded by people I grew up with. Literally starting fresh and having to be in a new city, away from home, with no one from high school with me, I was completely alone and didn’t have a friend prior to go to orientation or do things with. I don’t want to feel self pity, because I know I brought the loneliness on myself. I am just very sad about it and have never felt more regret in my life. I look at my older sisters and brother, and they have so many friends and crazy stories from university, I just can’t relate and feel like I wasted it all. 

The year was cut short because of covid, I moved out in march and since then I have been living at home with my mom. I am doing the entire school year online in my childhood home, in my hometown. I’m a 5 minute walk away from my old high school, I am surrounded by old neighbours and people who I used to know. It’s like all these memories and nostalgia has built up over the last few months. Though I’m still friends with lots of people from high school, they have moved on and we all are different people now. My best friends from high school, I went from seeing them everyday to probably like once or twice a year. One of them lives on the other side of the country.

I just feel like I don’t even have a specific home I don’t know how to explain it, like being in my childhood home it makes me feel like a fkn loser for some reason. I love my mom and I love being home, but I made a shitty life for myself back at school and even though I have no friends there I still miss it. But at the same time I am so terrified to go back and leave my hometown again (next school year). I feel so confused and lost and stagnant. 

I think about how much easier and amazing life was while I was in high school, and I am scared to death that I am one of those people who hit their prime in high school (socially, academically, overall life). Life hasn’t felt real for me ever since I graduated. It’s like as If I have no way of knowing what the future holds. In high school it is so definitive, that the goal is to graduate. Now university feels more trivial, and I feel very sad for younger me. Thinking about the fact that around this time last year, my naive grade 12 self had so many expectations for first year of university. Now, hindsight 20/20, it was seriously the worst few months of my life. Being at home with my mom now I feel secure and sheltered. Also I don’t even wanna think about how hard its gonna be for me to make friends once I’m back on campus, I feel like trying to approach someone wearing a face mask, or talking to someone in the library with one on will make me seem creepy lol.

I am considering transferring schools and trying it all again, or doing a year abroad next year. I just feel worthless and I don’t know what I’m doing most of the time anymore. I think this past year or so has taught me that it is SO true, that life doesnt mean much if you don’t have people to share it with. 

Anyways I guess I just wanted a place to vent and some advice. I am curious if any of you have felt this way about high school too? Or living in their childhood home again and feel lost? Or have had a similar experience with transitioning to university from hs. If so, how did you deal with the nostalgia, regret or just longing for a different part of your life?

306,"So I am not in the lease at the place I’m currently at. When I first moved in, I gave my housemate/friend half the bond which is $720. Over the year we stayed together, I’ve paid my rent on time every fortnight as well as my share in any of the bills he requested. Now that it’s time to move out, I’ve discovered that we most likely won’t get the bond back due to the faults of my housemate. His bank account was overdrawn a few times and he missed some rental payments so they are charging him an extra two weeks rent (which he mah not pay). As well as this, he has missed other bills that incurred overdue fees. Things like the dishwasher suddenly being broken and the air con remote going missing don’t help either. These things are his fault, not mine. At this point I’m over it all and just want to leave without paying him the extra bills, cleaning fees etc and just him use up the $720 he owes me (he’d probably have some left over) .

It started with him just forgetting things and me voicing how that hurt/annoyed me. We went back and forth arguing all day. He at one point called me a bitch. 

He said, “when you’re around me you’re nice when you’re not you’re a bitch.” Given I’ve been stressed with work, school, car trouble and that’s no excuse. But I didn’t purposely go out of my way to be a “bitch” to him. 

He also for the last 3 months has been dealing with baby mama drama (Jerry Springer-esk, I know). He for these last few months has not known if the baby is his. The mother apparently won’t let him see the child/get a paternity test (which sounds sketchy). A lot of drama was hashed out over Facebook and many people publicly slandered him.

I have a habit of dropping connections. One minute I'm comfortable with communicating then the next I'm ghost. A recent encounter with an old high school friend may have just put why I do this into perspective and I don't know how to take it.

After not meeting for a while my friend hit me up saying let's hang. Throughout this hang I realised that the only reason my friend suggested we hang was to vent. It really took me back to high-school because everyone would vent to me. I knew most people's issues and concerns but no one ever knew mine. 
I think it was at this point that I started to go ghost because no one truly asked about me. They would superficially ask and then go back to venting bout themselves without really listening to anything I'd said. I've realised that this may be the reason why I seldom ever talk about myself anymore and even questions like ""what are you up to"" or ""how's your day"" sound meaningless to me. I can't even respond to texts without having an internal anxiety struggle.  Always thinking about how to respond to not offend the other person or trigger a vent session. I now have a habit of keeping people at arms length, even those I consider close friends. 

I'm now trying to break this habit because I do wanna form new connections but everytime I try, I fall back into the safety of ghosting. I guess so as to not get hurt or feel like I'm being used.

315,"So, I've been working from home for the past several months. This week I decided it was time to go back in 2 days a week to do the other part of my job that I can't do from home.

When I got there, nobody was wearing masks (not a SINGLE PERSON) or taking any kind of covid precautions. Everyone was acting like covid didn't exist. They can stay reasonably far away while working so I get it but nobody was wearing one when around eachother or in common areas (which is required by the health area here). I had multiple people get very close to me and talk. Another person came in and coughed multiple times without covering his mouth. 

The symptom check procedure only checked for severe covid symptoms that would put someone in a hospital and make them unable to even drive there. 
I was massively uncomfortable.

So I worked in a closed room by myself and then emailed my boss later that I was not comfortable with the situation and would like to keep working from home every day instead, since I live with my dad who is very high risk for covid complications. I was very polite in my email and did my best to not point any fingers, despite the company clearly just ignoring the requirements for operating in my area. My county is still in very high risk (and is one of the worst counties in California right now).

After several hours of no reply, I got a weird response after sending a message to make sure he got my email that I don't know how to interpret. The tone came off as annoyed. My boss said he was ""unable to comment on it right now"" and will get back to me with ""options"" next week. 

The response was really off-putting and now I'm just really disappointed in them for disobeying health orders. I loved this company so so much.

And basically, a bunch of things just happened and they decided that they want to go now. But the issue is is that I just got together with a guy not too long ago, certainly not long enough to ask him to move cross country with me. But I really like this guy a lot. 

I have no other friends here, they’re like my family. I mean actually I have more friends that already live there rather than here. And I’m terrified that if they move I’ll never really be able to see them again. Sure maybe like once a year if that that I’d be able to. But I just don’t know how well I can do that. 

So basically it just leaves me between the options of break up with my boyfriend and just leave, or say goodbye to my best friends and probably hardly ever see them again. But I don’t want to do either of those things. Though it seems I have to. 

And then what if it were to happen that they leave and I stay here for my relationship and then him and I break up anyways? Then I’m left with absolutely nothing at all?

I don’t even know what I am asking here honestly, but I’m just so all over the place right now I just really need some advice.",09Oct2020,1

324,"I am a female 16, currently living alone with only my brother (18) as both my parents had to go to my grandparent's place due to a family emergency. the person who works for me as my live-in help (H) has been bringing people inside my house to show them my puppy without my knowledge or permission. I find this quite uncomforting and I feel kind of mad. 

H lives just behind my house along with other live-in help for other apartments, and they have direct access to my house through the backdoor in the kitchen. My brother is barely ever home so its usually just me my puppy (2 months old, only recently bought) and H. since I have school in the morning,  I am too busy to keep an eye on the person for the majority of the time they are working at my place. Today, however, was an off day and i ""caught""  them bringing someone else into my house while going into the kitchen to get a water bottle. (the kitchen is my pup's fav spot to scavenge, also where he spends his time when I'm busy) 

I was caught off guard as H had invited a small girl (G) into the house to meet my pup. I wouldn't have had a problem with this as long as I was informed and present when  G came to meet him. But the thing is that the breed of my dog is quite wary of strangers and he gets afraid quite easily upon meeting a stranger. And as the situation would present itself, my dag was scared of G hiding behind H's legs. I am certain that if I was present I could have made the experience better for my dog. 

Moreover, I believe that H is only doing this because my parents aren't home, if my mother or father were home, H would keep the back kitchen door locked at all times. nonetheless, now, she keeps the door open and people living behind our house have a clear view of inside my house. it's safe to say I feel violated.  I had my suspicions about H bringing people into my house and they were finally confirmed today.

the dilemma is that I don't like confrontation and I like to avoid it at all cost, given my rather vulnerable situation, I feel more uncomfortable being alone with H knowing that someone could freely move through my house. I also no longer feel comfortable letting my dog stay alone ith H in the kitchen while I'm busy. I am quite angry at H for the way she has been - for lack of a better term- taking advantage of my situation. 

should I confront her or wait till my parents get back (not very soon). and is my feeling this way justifiable or am I just being paranoid and stupid and this isn't even a big deal?

329,"Hey guys! I'm 15 years old, male, and from Australia.  
So I have an online friend who added me to a group chat a few months ago. It's progressively gotten more toxic over time, but I'm not personally close to anyone other than the friend who added me. Many incidents have happened before, but everyone seems to forget about them. It's frustrating, but this is hardly a problem haha.  
The problem began when a 22 year old guy from India was added a few months back. He can't speak English well, but I think he's pretty cool. It's difficult to judge whether he's a good person or not, but we occasionally talk about casual stuff like movies and all. A few months ago, some members of the group chat accused him of being a creep (or pedophile) due to a comment he left on someones photo. He took great offense to this, so my friend and I had to apologize and explain that they are young and don't understand what a great impact it had.  

So that was forgotten about for a while. But last night I think he may have gotten drunk or high on drugs, as he started spamming extremely weird messages. He shared his login details, said he hates Christians, and he doesn't care about anything anymore so he's gonna become a 'bad guy'. Then he said that he wants to die without pain due to personal problems and then logged off. I privately messaged him and said 'Hi. How are you bro?'. Luckily he replied this morning and said 'good'. He then messaged the group chat, saying that when he gets depressed he acts like that sometimes. By now he's calmed down, but it was really odd behavior. I'm worried that he's he's mentally ill, but it's very difficult to do anything given that he can't understand English well, we're barely friends, and he's all the way in India. My friend and I would like to just show that we care and support him if he needs anything. Look, I'm not trying to act as if we're saints, but we're the only ones who seemed to care when it happened. So far all we've thought of doing is continuing to message him every now and then, be extra nice, and try to show we care. He's not going to open up emotionally to a bunch of 15 year olds, and I don't know if it's a good idea to ask him to. Even if we tried, he'd likely misunderstand what we're asking him. Should we do something more drastic? Do any of you have any advice for a situation like this?

Thanks for reading guys. If you've got some advice, literally anything will help. The fact that someone is willing to help is legendary, so I thank you a lot. Thank you so much.",09Oct2020,1

Then, when he found some online sexy photos of me, he blocked me from his profiles and church content after telling me several times how beautiful I am.  

But, a couple days later he was back only on the site where the sexy photos are, and we started chatting. He said he is getting sex at home and is totally happy but he kept telling me I’m hot and tantalizing. But he kept saying he doesn’t want to mess up his marriage and isn’t looking for sex or too much “dangerous” talk.  

But, then he’d keep escalating our conversations sexually, to the point now where we have exchanged nude photos, sexted, and had sex on webcam. We have two meet ups planned. He tells me he’s addicted. He has two daughters. He likes for me to call him Daddy and wear pigtails and bows. 

There was another girl six years ago he thought he loved but they only had some sexual flirting by text and hugs in person at church.

4. I feel like I don't want - ever - to argue about anything with anyone, because its pointless. After YEARS over the internet, there is no way in hell that a discussion can be constructive.

I let him down easy as I really do like him as a friend and didn't want to hurt his feelings, but after talking, he told me he is suicidal and last attempted just a week ago. This was news to me. And I didn't know about this until after I told him I don't return his feelings, which was about an hour ago. I've only known him for about four months now, so I don't know him incredibly well, but we have been hanging out a lot with our circle of coworkers outside of work together and from those interactions I can tell he's had a rough childhood and things haven't been easy for him recently either.

He said he's glad I told him, but I feel absolutely awful.

I have also been trying to get over my crush after being rejected from them while having depression, but everyone is different and for him to have just recently attempted suicide is deeply concerning to me. I would not have thrown this at him had I known that he was struggling, but again, he didn't mention anything to me or our friends about this before I told him.

I told him that I truly do care about him and that if he ever needs someone to talk to then he can come to me, but I'm still worried. 

What would be the best thing to do in this situation? Does anyone have any similar experiences to this? I needed to express to him my feelings to be completely transparent, but I care about him and I obviously don't want him to hurt himself. If there was something I did wrong in this situation or if anyone has any advice as to how I can help him if he needs it, please let me know.

355,"So recently I've been reconnecting with a friend I haven't talked to in about 2 years. We hung out a lot together from elementary school until he moved away at 23, we're now both 26.

We were both in bad situations in life, smoked a lot of weed together, played videogames all day and did nothing with our lives. I got a girlfriend, got into self improvement and became a dad. He continued wasting time and descended mentally. He's basically me if I didn't get my shit together.

The last time I met him was 2 years ago when he and his current girlfriend visited me and my girlfriend. He drunk a LOT of alcohol that night and got sloppy drunk. It ended with him accidentally hitting me and a confrontation, he profusely apologized and we left it at that.

As I said we've reconnected lately and have talked a lot on discord and played together. We planned me taking a trip to visit him and his girlfriend where they live and I was hyped for the trip and we both hyped it up.

However after talking more with him I realize he's in an extremely bad place in his life. He's became an alcoholic, he gets drunk several days a week, has no job, just found out he's going a short time to prison for a DUI. His girlfriend tells me he's been violent to her while drunk and shit. He's a complete mess and have even said while drunk he's suicidal. I obviously don't want to visit them anymore.

However here's the issue: From the behaviour I've seen and what his girlfriend has told me I'm certain he has a mental disorder, he can sometimes seem schizophrenic, as in he switches and becomes a different person, she's also told me he has talked to someone he sees that is not in the room. I also understand that he looks up to me a lot since I sorted my life out and me coming to visit is like the highlight of his year. I'm honestly afraid that if I cancel the trip he might do something extreme and fucking kill himself or him and her, or even come here and do something crazy. He knows where I live, and I have a 2 year old daughter in the house.

I've never dealt with someone with these kind of mental issues and I'm really worried and not sure how to deal with the situation.",09Oct2020,1

362,"I recently transferred to my new college and needed to ask for a student ID card. The administrator who replied asked for images and ID and I emailed them same. They got back to me saying that I had sent the images in the wrong format even though I had sent them the images in the correct format (.jpg). I just assumed that my Macbook had done something weird with the attachment and sent them another email with an apology and the images attached. 

That was 10 days ago, and I've received no communication since. I sent a reminder email 2 days ago simply asking had they made any progress. They haven't replied to that either. Should I just keep badgering them? How do I send *another* reminder without seeming impolite? I'm also worried that they've processed the info and haven't told me, and that I'll just randomly get the card in the post.",09Oct2020,1
363,"^this has become a serious problem with me right now. I have several 'friendly acquaintances' ,but when it comes to actually crossing over to the good friend part, it just doesn't happen.

 
Also, long post warning, I'm on mobile, and English ain't my native language. (Sorry). I will mention however, that unlike other reddit posts I see often, this post is not going to ask about how to meet people. I'm basically asking for how to be more entertaining and get people to want to know me ( I guess). 


(I'm 23F, just finished college, and will be joining grad school in spring.)

Here's how a general meeting with new person goes:

Almost all my conversations basically progress in the same way - start off with general introduction stuff. At this point, someone mentions their hobbies. (I don't have any hobbies as such myself). 99.98% of the times I'll not have much idea about the said hobby, and then we'll spend the next 15-20 mins talking about the hobby. After this, the person and me has generally run out of time , and has to attend another class etc etc. So that's cool. 

Here's what I generally feel like I do next : I approach that same person next time we meet. Say hi, how's your day. Since I'm in college, people will say something about studies/ professors. I talk about that. I'm generally amongst the top in my class so I help people out with homework. Else there's casual talk in the group of people around us.


So, that's all fine, and at this rate, it's mostly just people meeting and sitting together in class, and going for lunch in the canteen together.


Now for my trouble:

How do you cross the next line ? How do you have friends whom you text all evening, and chat and plan stuff with ? And how tf do people relate funny incidents about themselves without sounding boring ? I have very few really funny incidents in my boring life, and I'm a terrible story teller, so it becomes really awkward talking about that. Whenever I've had to go out alone with someone else to eat/something, I literally can't find anything to talk about. There's only so much I can ask and talk about the other person's life without being nosy. I just feel like I'm incredibly boring alone, which means that nobody actually wants to hang out with me alone, and this is preventing me from getting to know others very well personally.",09Oct2020,1
364,"So back story, I had to drop out of school for a year because I was diagnosed with severe depression a couple of months after I lost important people. A therapist was actually brought to my house because I just couldn't move my body or anything. It was the darkest moment of my life because I lost everything. All I can remember is feeling blank, looking at the ceiling, crying whenever parents went to the grocery store.

I used to be a straight A student, had a good memory, I could even remember dreams when I was 4. But during that dark time, I forgot passwords, basic math, words, etc.

After I picked myself up, I can still feel the lingering effects of it. I can remember things a little bit now but I still can't remember what I ate in a day or something.

365,"im thinking back on this whole thing and feeling really awful
when i was 11-14 i was in a friend group... we would hit each other a lot as a joke and tease each other a lot in 7th grade so me and another friend would tease our friend constantly cause she was the easiest to get a funny reaction out of, whenever i treated her nicely tho she would tell me to eat shit or something so that to me sounded like a reasonable argument at the time be horrible to her or she'll be horrible to you. thinking back maybe i exaggerated a little bit... of course i was bullied and teased too and at the time that was the group's dynamic. we would ""roast each other"" and even pull each other's hair sometimes i look back and feel like i was humiliated as a joke, and because we were all 11-14 i don't hold much of a grudge on any of those past friends now that i'm 20.
so when i was 16 i reunited with her in the same school and at 16 i kind of like seperated myself from that group cause i was growing out of it and they were still childish. she was all nice at first but she kept reminding me of the times she ""stood up to me"" i don't even remember any of them and telling everyone i meet in an passive aggressive way how i used to bully her...? i apologized to her multiple times and tried to explain to her that i was teased too and that was the group's dynamic and to let the past go now that we're older she would mock me and make a sarcastic remark.
her friends wouldn't even look at me or speak to me all through out high school and even tho she was nice and chatty when i talked to her upfront i'd catch her staring at me like she'll beat me up or something, i once even said to her to hurry up or something and she stared at me like she'll put me in my place and at the time i felt like it was karma so i just took it because i felt guilty for what i did to her. at graduation she told me to keep in touch but never talked me ever except once to tell me someone is trying to get my number and if she should give it to me.
it's nice gestures like introducing me to her friends, asking me for my permission to hand my number out, just overall stay with me, not ghosting me even tho i used to drive her nuts in middle school that made me put up with her weird ""RemEmBEr  tHaT tImE when YoU hIt Me"" in front of people.
i used to hang around her out of guilt and shame and thinking back the whole relationship was an awkward mess 
i don't know how to feel about it, i feel like she did that because she was having a bit of fun out of me i was in such a bad mental state in high school and she took an advantage of that. but at the same time i feel like i deserved that type of treatment because i did tease her for fun as a kid. we go to the same college now and i don't even know what i'll do if i run into her, ignore her? say hi?

366,"I feel like most people know of the Trolley Morality Problem, or at least some variation of it. Would you rather actively end one life to save five lives or not end that one life and allow the five others to pass by other means. If we're focusing on numbers alone I usually feel like losing one to save five just makes sense, though I know in the moment it could be a lot more difficult and complex than that. 

I was watching a video of someone else going through the question, so I decided to give it more thought, that's when I caught myself thinking ""well, how would other people perceive me afterwards"". This immediately made me more self-aware of how often I think this way. Instead of really thinking of the hypothetical lives at stake, I was thinking of whether people would hate me more for playing god and choosing who lives and who dies, or hate me for allowing a catastrophe of that size to occur. I realized that there is no real big political or social topic I'm all that passionate about, there are stances I have, but no real opinions or times I've made a stand. Topics like The Death Penalty, I switch sides on this debate so much, but I realized that I only care about this topic as much as the person I'm talking to does. When I was religious I bought into everything the church told me and I went the extra mile because I wanted people to see me as a good christian. When I transitioned into a ""free thinking progressive atheist"" all of my opinions were just the opinions of other free thinking progressive atheists I surrounded myself with, because even in a free thinking space, I was afraid of having ""the wrong opinion"". 

I'm lucky enough to not really have to deal with many moral dilemmas on a regular basis. I just go to work, do my job and then go home. From the big topics like The Death Penalty, to small things like whether or not I should hold the door open for someone, I never think whether something is objectively wrong or right, I never think of whether I feel if something is wrong or right, I think of what other people would want me to do, what other people have told me and how people will perceive me. Is this an issue or is this somewhat normal?",09Oct2020,1

So. I have just completed my one month at a digital marketing agency as a content marketing intern. I am M/23.

I have made it a priority to maintain good relationship with my boss while not compromising on the quality of my content ( people, i feel, get complacent when they start getting positive feedback from the higher ups )

So far, I have worked/ written for a CRM, 2 Real Estate Websites, around 5 ad copies while constantly managing the whole content department all by myself. ( Yes, I am an intern who doesn't have a direct content marketing Sr. Basically it's a one man show ) There lies the problem. I am worried that I might not get to learn and explore more in this field without a proper guidance here. I just graduated and writing has been a passion of mine for the longest time and seeing the potential I have and the positive feedback that I have received here, I feel that maybe if i get more exposure I would one day be able to open my own agency. ( That's the plan right now)

I am confused as to what I should do next. I am underpaid for the amount of work I put out. I put more content when my interest is more towards strategy and stuff.

What do you noble guys recommend I should do next?

Should I look for some other work at a different place?

Is freelancing a viable option here?

Should I start my own website/ blog and have a digital portfolio?

Thank you in advance.

368,"Buckle up bois, gals, and non-binary pals, it's a long read. TLDR at the bottom.

So I'm a 20 year old graduate who recently got a job. Additionally, I enjoy smoking up and drinking, and apparently that's a problem for some reasons which in turn have put me in a conundrum. 

I've been smoking weed for about 3 years now, and I've been drinking alcohol for about 4 years. Initially it was just something to try out but later on though, it became an unhealthy escape for me. I have the common sense to admit that, as I began to use alcohol and weed as a coping mechanism thanks to a history of being abused - physically by parents &amp; sexually by others - and as a way of dealing with my depression and my parent's separation and multiple attempts. I used to do it because I still haven't learnt how to process emotion right. It didn't help that I went to a psych ward for therapy where the psychiatrists told me I was making up my past and none of my suffering is real because I smoke pot and I'm probably hallucinating. 

It caught up to me in a shitty way as in April of this year as I was admitted in the same psychiatric ward for paranoid schizophrenia and psychosis as I genuinely believed friends and family were dead and I was next. A few things that led to this was that I was smoking up 3-4 times a day and I had stopped talking to people while staying alone at home. My friends along with my mom went through a lot to get me to the psych ward and cover for my treatment, and after few months I was back to normal with the psychiatrists telling me to quit drinking and weed as it could trigger my mental state.

But I broke after a month and smoked a joint and it's different. It's different because I'm no longer abusing it as in smoking up or drinking multiple times, crying or only showing emotion after substances and so on. I just do it ocassionally with friends and I'm in a much better state of mind right now, limiting my intake and just jolly shit. I feel I won't slip back into that same state as I'm happier now.

But then my friends on the other hand, are equal parts pissed and disappointed in me and the latter's worse to deal with. They're upset that I've gone back to substances after all the crap with the psych ward and at me for endangering my mental state, with my main circle telling that they've given up on me because no matter how much they talk I don't seem to quit or understand that substances are bad. 

And I'm unsure. I'm just 20, I don't want to quit drinking and smoking up at the start of my fun years I guess. It's scary and like everyone I've met socially is through drinks or drugs, even the current friends who are disappointed in me. I feel I can handle it, but then I don't want to lose my friends and I hate that I've disappointed them. 

Am I the cunt or just trying to have fun and balance my recreational substances or I dunno should I change myself? 

TLDR: I used to abuse alcohol and weed due to trauma which led to paranoid schizophrenia which my friends got me out of after rehab and psychological treatment and said friends are very disappointed and upset because I've returned to the same things with a different mindset.",09Oct2020,1
369,"I apologize if this sounds redundant. I (22M) really need advice on building my social life. My whole life I have considered myself to socially anxious. I don’t necessarily struggle to carry a conversation and don’t feel like I’m awkward, but I have built a habit of avoiding it and staying to myself. I used to have a severe speech impediment which I think contributed a lot to my personality, and even though I  fixed it over the past year I can’t seem to break the anxiety it caused me. I work in a restaurant which gives me a bit of social interaction, but I don’t know how to build and maintain many relationships. I have no social media at all, but am open to using maybe Instagram to stay connected to people (even though it seems a lot of people are against it).

374,"So I live with two roommates along with my boyfriend. The two roommates used to date, if that helps.

So recently my boyfriend had found out somebody had stolen $50 worth of coins from his coin jar. Shortly after expressing his concerns to our roommates, one immediately moved out after hearing about this (and probably was not able to afford rent). The other stayed.
It’s not even 24 hours later and she’s back, sleeping over day after day. This is her third time sleeping over within four days of moving out. I expressed this very, very uncomfortable situation to my boyfriend and he seemed to be in full agreement with me that since she’s paying money to live with somebody else now, why is she sleeping over here? It would make sense to sleep... where you’re paying to stay. 
His mind was set that this wasn’t right. Until he got a second opinion from his boss. (We are in our early twenties)
His boss said that a couple of days is no big deal but a week is something to keep into consideration if she does it. (Maybe she doesn’t have a bed yet, etc)
Well, I don’t really want to wait a week to find this out myself. But now my boyfriend doesn’t agree with me anymore, and I’m still voicing my unease with this because I know she’s going to keep doing this if we don’t stop it now.
I’m trying to think about this rationally. If she needed a bed to move out with, why did she move out so soon then if she wasn’t prepared? Why is she still over here? (The exes are still physically engaged with one another, but sleeping over is another level for me)
I don’t want to come off as a bitch and now the roommate who stayed says I’m babying or parenting him when I ask him when she’s going to be leaving. (For context, he would text me that she’ll be leaving at 3, then three comes along and they’re both dead asleep). 
Boyfriend thinks that if this will happen frequently enough, the roommate who stayed will catch onto this and voice his concerns with us about this. I told my boyfriend to never assume what somebody may or may not do... because this is really weird behavior and my voice doesn’t matter anymore.

377,"How do I deal with a deadbeat infidel father? My father and I have had a bumpy relationship over these past few years. He is a very troubled adult having survived heinous child abuse. My mother and him married each other through a love marriage which is uncommon from where they are from. My mother initially planned on leaving him but unfortunately discovered she was pregnant with me. Being a christian and carrying a lot of emotional pain she decided to go through with the pregnancy. For the past few years our entire family has been a big mess. My father has made it a living hell for us ever since my mother decided to build a large house for her parents in our home country. Keep in mind my mother came from a very poor family, she is their only child and neither of her parents have pension. Whereas my father came from a very well off family, has 3 other siblings and both his parents earn pension. Every fucking day he won't go to bed without cussing out my mother's parents for ""stealing her money"". He was upset that she apparently wasn't spending enough money for the family. Keep in mind my father flunked his college years and works low wage jobs with no sense of savings or money handling. My mother was actually amazing at handling the money, we had great food to eat, stationary, a tv, xbox and many other unnecessary luxuries. Oh did I mention that he didn't contribute basically anything towards our family? My mother was the one paying rent and all the bills. My father initially just wanted access to her bank details. My father is also a raging atheist. He constantly tries to argue with my mother about her christian faith and tells her that her beliefs are bullshit and nothing. I for one wouldn't exactly call myself a true christian but I 100% respect every religion and culture. He advises me to ""stay away from muslims"", because apparently they'll try to poison my mind. I have SEVERAL muslim friends and I love their culture and religion, but not once did they persuade me into that. I myself could not follow Islam, but I respect it. A few years ago while we were taking a vacation to our home country (My mother and I, my father was back in the other country) I noticed a few strange apps being downloaded through our connected Icloud. My dad had started downloading apps like Zoosk and Second Arranged Marriage Arrangement websites. I noticed this and told my mum who did not understand technology like I did. I was only 8 at the time so it would have to start snowing in the middle east for her to take my opinion and word seriously. A few years later I noticed a few notifications on his phone like ""This lady is a single mother from \[OUR HOMETOWN\]"". I checked the profile and sure enough it was a dating site. I still cannot process whether or not my dad is a pathetic cheater or if this ""evidence"" could just be a normal thing. He has caused living hell to my mother and has also hit her many times resulting in police involvement. He's a Nicotine addict and a short tempered alcoholic. Yet after all of this I still loved my father unconditionally and believed my father had my back and that this was just his behaviour. It took me 4 years of emotional abuse to understand that this man never loved me like a true daughter. These past years I went day by day oh he's just like that he'll come around he loves me deep down. A few weeks ago my father cussed me out for not making dinner on time. I came out of the room after studying and told him, look I will complete it I was just coming outside. He just started relently yelling at me while intoxicated, and then I really couldn't hold it in any longer and started crying. Every other girl had the perfect father, the man who says he'd shoot any guy that tried to ""break your heart"", the man who walks you down the aisle of your wedding day, the man you see in those pictures holding you as a little baby. After I burst into tears he just yelled at me asking me why I was crying and my heart broke into a million different pieces because even after all these years he just doesn't get it. That night I cried for 7 hours non stop without eating dinner and not once did he come and check on me. He's always telling me I'm a failure, I'm never going to get anywhere. He doesn't let me go outside with friends, dislikes me calling others and constantly berates me. Even when I achieve something great that I have been struggling with its always ""Get full A+ then come to me"". He looks forward to my success for the wrong reasons. One time he was piss drunk and asked me to pour him a drink. I refused and told me I had too much assignments and homework. His response? ""You go and study so you can make a lot of cash for me"". This statement will forever stick with me in my life, I promise you I won't forget it till the day I die. I used to think ""Oh he's just controlling because he cares about me"". He only cares about me because he hopes one day his bullying will procure a nice salary and a comfy lifestyle from me. 

I'm really sorry for this huge story but I really can't hold this inside of myself anymore and needed to ask someone advice as I am currently devastated and cannot function or socialize properly without spilling tears. How would I overcome this? Thank you- Anon (F, 14)",09Oct2020,1
378,"I’m not sure if this is the right place for this kind of post, but I’m hoping to maybe get some insight about this situation. Any advice or insight would be much appreciated.

So lately I’ve been experiencing a severe meat aversion to the point that even smelling meat makes me nauseous. I’ve been a meat eater most of my life and have done fine. I only had one 3 year period when I was younger (between 15-18yo) when I was attempting to follow a vegetarian lifestyle. Other than that, I have had meat consistently in my daily diet (now late 20s). For the past couple of months, i have developed a severe distaste for meat and it has been getting worse to the point that it has even become difficult to cook meat for my partner. I don’t want to limit his diet (I am the one who always cooks) so I’ve been trying to make recipes that don’t require me to constantly stand near the meat while it’s cooking (like putting it in the air fryer or the oven). However, I generally have to be a decent distance away from it so it doesn’t make me want to upchuck. I know I’m not pregnant and, as far as I know, my health is okay. I plan on going to the docs if this doesn’t get better just to be sure since it’s been a pretty drastic change and it’s causing me to feel sick. Also, fish seems to be the only protein I can choke down. This is my first time experiencing this, has anyone else has had this or a similar issue?",09Oct2020,1

381,"In the beginning of the semester I enrolled in a computer science class to see if I would like it. Throughout the past 8 weeks I’ve hated it more and more. I do not understand the concept 70% of the time and it does not intrigue me whatsoever. Yesterday I spent about 3 hours with my TA (teaching assistant) doing a lab which I absolutely hate. The course had literally devoured my life. I hate it. I have a 97% in the class but that’s simply because I cheat on the quizzes and my friends or TAs help me through the Labs. This week they gave us a s**t ton of hw for the course and I’m contemplating dropping it because I literally do not understand it. I’ve been cheating the whole time so I was eventually going to face reality. I’m also a straight A student so I do even more work to make sure I understand at least some material. I want to clarify that I do all the hw and assignments, I simply just use chegg sometimes on the quizzes. Idk if I’m just simply overwhelmed this week because of the assignments and should power through or drop the course. One week I like the course and the next week it’s giving me depression. I knew I wouldn’t be able to sleep because my brains keeps thinking about how much work I have for the class. I hate this class so much and I’m scared that it’s only going to get harder and I won’t receive at least a portion of my money if I drop out. I’ve been able to ride my way for the past 8 weeks but idk if I’ll be able to do this for the last 7. Maybe I’m just stressed. What do y’all think???",09Oct2020,1
383,"I'm a high school senior, and I'm working on college apps at the moment. My parents control every aspect of my life: the amount of food I eat, the stuff I do every day, when I get home, how many times I can shower, and when I sleep. Like many kids with controlling parents do, I've learned to do stuff I want behind their backs. However, the one thing I haven't been able to influence was how much I had to eat.

Here's what my parent-mandated meal schedule is. At 6:30, I eat what my parents think is a hearty breakfast. In reality, I'm just shoveling down two eggs, a million apple slices, bread, and pork that I hardly have the appetite for so that my father doesn't shout at me for ""wanting to lose weight."" I eat a small lunch at school at 11. After school ends, I have tennis practice at 3:40. While an energy bar would do, my mother makes me eat a crap ton of fruit and cookies along with the energy bar. I get home at 6 P.M., I eat dinner, and my parents always make me eat more than I want to. Although I've had to overeat during breakfast and dinner, it's fine until now. However, because I can't sleep earlier than 2 A.M., my parents tell me that I'll get tired around 11 P.M. or 12 A.M., somehow not realizing that the fact that I sleep less than 5 hours is why I get tired rather than the fact that I didn't eat enough. They give me another meal that changes in nature but not in volume. For example, I received a plate full of frozen dumplings and fruit. That's about 12 dumplings, two whole oranges, and half of a kiwi. If I refuse to eat it, my father screams at me. Sometimes, they give me a burger they put in the refrigerator. During junior year, I had been allowed to exercise for at most 15 minutes, which I'm not allowed to do anymore.

My parents seem to have this strange aversion to me losing weight. When I skimp on the outrageous portions by refusing to eat more, they forcibly fatten me up, telling me that I should be fat when I'm studying. I'm usually 85 kg. Now I'm 92 kg. What should I do?",09Oct2020,1
384,"So a couple days ago my friend was fired from a job we both work at and keep in mind she is past her probationary period. I asked her why she was fired and the reason she was given was “she just wasn’t pulling her weight.” At the time she wasn’t really given specific examples but I later questioned the manager about this and was told that there were tasks specifically for her to do that were not completed by her. In my work environment, whenever we see tasks that need to be done we do them, my friend was unaware that there were specific tasks laid out for her and did other tasks, ie customer service while I ended up doing the other task because I just saw it needed to be done and did it which is normal in our workplace. They may argue for insubordination but there are no real examples of this occurring other than an incident in which my supervisor and a few other employees were breaking down boxes and my friend said she was going to work on another task but the supervisor barked that the boxes needed to be broken down when there were four people doing that task (6 people working that night) and we still needed people for actual customer service. Now she didn’t actually hear him so she just went about doing other tasks that needed to get done that night. Now keep in mind these were reasons she was fired without warning when other co workers have: 
-drawn genitalia on bags that were given out to customers who then came back angry telling us they had to explain the drawing to their child (supervisor was aware of this happening but didn’t say anything)
-supervisor left work early multiple times and on the busy days
-supervisor has been on his phone in the office when he couldn’t find tasks to complete
- supervisor and other co workers have made inappropriate comments around her which could technically be sexual harassment but was waived off as “locker room talk”
-co workers have come in to work high
-service to intoxicated individuals (we work at a liquor store and it’s actually illegal to serve people past the point of intoxication but they waive it off because “they know that guy”
-repeatedly leave the store without telling anyone 

But all they’ve ever gotten was a mere slap on the wrist.

389,"Some background info:
I (26M) moved back in with my parents before the pandemic broke out to take care of my ill mother. Half her siblings are nearby, my fathers siblings are all abroad.

The issue: As far as I can remember, my mother has always been a victim in every situation. No, not the actual victim, she's just addicted to using the victim card. My mother has been manipulating everything and everyone into doing as she pleases, if things don't go her way, she throws a tantrum or starts to cry. Keeps saying, ""I'm sick, I have Parkinsons"" as an excuse for her shitty behavior. She has had surgery for it, doctors told her to relax for at least 2 weeks. So for 2 weeks long me and my father have tried being the best caretakers possible while juggling our fulltime jobs working from home. But she's not the type to listen to us or what doctors say, so she invited people over almost everyday because she's bored just to have us run around like maids, back and forth in serving her visitors and going back to work.

Yesterday I overheard them talking, or rather her cornering my father.

Her: let's always be open with each other
Father: can you really do that?
Her: yes, watch me! I ordered more golden bracelets, my brother will bring them here in a few weeks so now you owe him €10k.

My father: what?
Her: yes! Hahahah told you I can be open!
He: I don't even have that kinda money ready lying around!
Her: well that's not my problem.


A week ago, I had a had a huge argument with her. When my father was little, he was beaten up a lot by his parents and then vowed never to hit his own family if he were to have one. He's been keeping himself to his word, but I just snapped when my mother questioned his manliness for not being violent. Ever since, we've been ignoring each other, and it's the most peace I've had in months.

Hope you are well,

I have started seeing a guy who I really enjoy spending time with. Only thing is his been here for a year and a half and is on a visa. His trying to get residency here and has his own business to sponsor himself (listed on the needed jobs).  
On our first date I asked how he was planning to stay here. He said that he wanted to get it by himself through his business and joked about marrying an Australian girl.  
I later sent him a msg asking about it and he said that he felt comfortable to joke about that and wants to get residency by himself. I told him I wouldn't be helping with sponsorship and residency, he responded he wants to do it by himself and doesn't know how to prove it to me. He still wants to go out after saying that. My brother had a bad experience with being used for a green card so I'm pretty cautious.

We have had these cats for about four years now. We got them when my sister was young and while we do love them, things have taken a turn for the worse.

We have tried putting things in boxes or drawers but nothing works against her. This has made my mom lose her mind to the ends of the earth and she has demanded that we get rid of them. It pains me so much because they have given me love and attention when I needed it, but at the end of the day I don’t have any power over my parent’s word.

416,"So my mom had a really shitty childhood and it was her parenets' fault. Her dad is dead and her mom is living with us. She has been for years.

The thing is, they fight almost every single night. I used to think that it was because my mom didn't have much patience and they just didn't get along well, until I realised it was a bit more deep than that.
When they fight, my mom sometimes reminds my grandma all the fucked up shit she did, said and allowed. She says a lot of terrible insults too. And most of the time, I'd even say always, my grandma starts crying (my mom cries too sometimes but my grandma does more often).

They day after the fight, while my mom is at work, my grandma tells me how sorry she is about everything she's done to my mom. How guilty she feels. And it was until yesterday until she told me things about her childhood and adulthood that I understood how big the problem was (yes I'm pretty dumb).

She asked ""So what do you think?"" and I answered that both of them needed a psychologist. I mean, I'm not a professional and I'm really damn young (I'm 14 years old) but you know, there's gotta be some trauma behind all this, right? I actually already told my grandma that she should see one, but this was the first time she agreed. So then I knew that the only one that could convince my mom would be me.

And I'm so fucking scared.

What if she gets mad? What if she gets REALLY mad? What if she says no? You can't force someone into therapy. And you know this is not even for me, because I honestly don't feel much about the fights anymore, I just want them to be happy. I want them to let go and move on. I thought about asking someone else but then I realised, who? And would it even work? How do I ask them anyway? Ugh I'm such a mess.

How can I even approach her? What do I tell her? Actually, does she really need therapy? What if I'm wrong? Well, that's pretty much why I'm asking for help here.

Can anyone help me out?

TL;DR: my mom and grandma went through some really shitty things and my mom can't forgive my grandma for it, which results in a lot of heated up arguments where she reminds her of everything she's done. I think they should see someone about this but I don't know how to ask my mom or if I even should.",09Oct2020,1

It was fantastic because for one of the first time in my life I felt connected to this point with someone else. I was finally able to be intimate with someone without being shy of my emotions. In my head it was almost a done deal that we were gonna be a couple and nothing bad.could happen cause I really had the feeling it was mutual. But then, a little bit after college started, I felt like she was more and more distant with me. My first thought was that it was a bad mood only that would came back to normal but days after days it was worse and worse. So I asked her what was happening and that's when she announce me that it was nothing against me but she didn't had the time to be in a relashionship and that she needed to take distance for a while. I was destroyed. I rarely felt so bad about myself and I was struggling dealing with this through the days. I been depressed and I was stuck with depressing thoughts all day long thinking about this. Recently, 3 weeks after she dumped me, she texted me again. It's feeling great but we ain't talking about our relashionship yet so I am stuck with the hapiness to talk with her again but also with the fact that maybe nothing will happen and that I will be back with all these negative thoughts and right now I really don't know what to do!

422,"Hello Reddit. Today was the last straw with my father’s antics.

A bit of background. I am 19 year old, currently still living with my parents in Italy (I am Italian). I am looking for a job and work as an artist as hobby.

For a few years, ever since my father lost his job, he’s been rather nervous. He already was, but it got to a point where he is insufferable. He used to sometimes emotionally abuse me and mom, but recently it’s a daily basis. I am treated like a failure and called such by him, no matter all my life achievements. Nothing satisfies him, he always demands more from me and mom.

I believe he has repressed anger, because he loses his shit over small things, and that can lead to him damaging things. He never hurt us physically, only emotionally. He has broken a lot of things in his bursts of anger. He once destroyed a camera simply because it took too long to connect to his phone. His hand bled profusely but he refused to medicate it.

Today he kicked the kitchen table three times, while we were having dinner, because his mother did not hang up the phone. That caused a lot of food to spill on the table, and my mother to burst into tears and say “This is disgusting.” Mom tried to tell him what he did was idiotic, so he...pointed out she forgot to add tuna to his beans, and he threatened to kick the table again if she forgets again.

And yes, my mother cries a lot whenever he has these bursts of anger. But he does not apologize or comfort her. Instead, he yells at her too, and tells her to shut up. He is also incredibly rude.

Always, after all his bursts of anger, after a deafening silence, he resumes things as if nothing happened. If you address to him about what happened, he’ll either act naive, or insult you and say “Oh it’s not your fault so why do you care?”

Before you guys say he needs a therapist, I am aware of that. But he refuses help. If you tell him he should get a therapist, not only does he berate you, but he insults the idea too, saying they are useless.

I want my mother to divorce with him and kick him out of our house because I cannot see my mother cry anymore. I want her to live a normal life and not be on edge every time, fearing she’d make a mistake that will anger dad.",09Oct2020,1
423,"Long post. Firstly, I\`m sorry for the mistakes, this is not my native language. Secondly, this is my first post here. Thirdly, I will try to be as short as I can. Fourth, do not judge strictly please.

Male, 24 years old, I have 2 diplomas.

Hello. I am in despair for 9 months already. I cry, go to a psychologist, I have no strength at all. I ask your advice, maybe someone was in a similar situation.

I am from Russia, finished my master's degree this year. A year ago I went to France for an exchange semester. I have never been abroad before. An innocent idea, right? It is impossible to explain how much it changed my life. Lovely people from all over the world, parties, non-stop communication, wonderful weather, I\`ve learned French and English with native speakers. I had interesting education. I traveled a lot, tried different food, experienced new culture. I had my own room in a great student\`s dorm, saw a cozy towns. I\`ve been seeing with a wonderful girl for whom I did a lot. That was a completely different life; I have never had something like this, ever. Wthout any exaggeration, it was a paradise for me, every day something new. It is impossible to describe all the emotions that I experienced there or the experience that I received.

I returned to Russia. In an old, rotten dormitory with cockroaches, with gray clouds overhead, completely disappointed in Russia, in the state, in the path I had chosen earlier, about the wasted years of study (that I had not found what I really wanted to do before). Envious of the Europeans that they have absolutely everything better - beautiful cities, roads, freedom to travel, languages ​​from childhood, seas, even ending with the fact that the Romance and Germanic languages ​​have much more similarities and it is easier for them to learn each other's language. I cannot describe everything. The most appropriate words are total frustration, disappointment and anger.

Three weeks after arriving in Russia, this girl broke up with me, despite all the words of ""love"" and promises. I really thought it was serious, naive fool. This was my second relationship at the age of 24. You can imagine my reaction.

In other words, the first strike I got is the country, the state, the luck of culture in Russia. We are isolated. I haven\`t known that a life might be so different.

The second strike is my mistakes of the past. I never knew what I really want to do, that languages ​​are so interesting. That programming is so interesting.

The third strike is betrayal of that girl. She is already with someone else and I cannot forget her (cultural difference? Are they more open and don't get attached to people?). I remember the words she taught me in English and in Italian, all that we went through. French and English remind me all the time and it hurts so much. I have no any substitution in terms of a girl. There are no resources, even no desire to start something new. I'm not a guy for one-night-stand, too.

The fourth strike is that everything won’t be repeated - neither those people, nor those emotions. It won't come back, never.

The fifth strike - I was faced with the realities of changing the profession in the shortest possible time. I thought I would find a job as an economist. But I had some interviews and ridiculous money had been proposed. And this will not bring me closer to the goal of leaving Russia.

The sixth strike is the necessity of rebuilding the life: where and how to move, how to live, who I am, what I want. The Past. The Future. I\`ve been thinking a lot about this rotten society, a hot mess going around.

For 8 months I have been crying, smoking and thinking how tor rearrange my life, how to get back to the normal condition. Nightmares became my best friends. Fortunately, it have already passed away. I asked myself over and over again - why did I get into this position? I thought about everything, starting with the mistakes of my parents, the USSR (after the collapse of the Union, the parents of my generation survived, they had no time for raising a family. They quickly created families and then almost all got divorced. What kind of upbringing can we talk about? They\`ve betrayed as well for government: in the one moment there no county, ideology, savings, bandits came in to the power), ending with women: what I\`ve done wrong towards her. Why is everything ""serious"" with him, but I was wasted as a toy for a good time spending? Is it a society now?

I took antidepressants and regularly have appointments with psychologist now. I understand that I am just wasting my life away. I come back over and over again to that time in my mind - there was a happiness. Here - no. I don\`t have the strength to cope with everything that happened. I really don't remember the last time I enjoyed a coffee in the morning. No, I remember, in France with her.

You can say that everything is fine. This is the growing up phase. I\`ve found myself, a path. That I just have to work and I\`ll get back to Europe in 4-5 years. That I am young and I can overcome it. That I can find a decent girl, who will love me and whom I will love, too. Doesn\`t work. I am frightened by the amount of efforts that need to be put into it. And at the same time they enjoy life, making love with one another.

I desperately don’t want to wait; I don’t want everything that is happening around. Why are they enjoying and I am not? Why is their culture more open? Why do they travel a lot? Why do they have access to the warm sea all year round? Why does their state care about them? Why didn't I understand this before? Why didn't my parents open this world to me before? Why didn't my father explain that I can't get attached to women and their words often don't coincide with their actions? Ah, yes, because he was not up to it - he received paltry money working days and nights.

During these 8 months I completed my master's degree. I bought a programming course (this will allow me to find a work placement remotely (it is an absolute new sphere for me)). I am learning English and French. I finished 2 semester of additional education as translator. I subscribed to the gym. But I\`m doing it through the hardest efforts. I have a feeling that no one understands me and I\`m alone at this war. That the goals are unattainable. That I have nothing good ahead of me, that I have already experienced the best in life. I started having suicidal thoughts.

I was leaving Russia with the vision of the world, the country, the culture and the language. I knew what I want. I knew how I will develop myself. I knew who I\`m, that I\`m strong Russian guy. I wasn't worried. Once I had returned I became a zero. Am I an idiot? Am I hyper emotional? Is it a stage of growing up? Is there something better ahead of me? Should I and how to struggle with all of it now? I don't understand anything either in the world, or in myself, women, in the future. How to struggle with the best memories with that girl, knowing she makes love with a new guy? I feel absolutely miserable.

I try to convince myself that people also work hard everywhere. That other people experience braking up, too. That the girl I was with is not the most beautiful and ideal one. That I have time, health, brain, hands and legs to do everything I want. That it\`s a good thing that I realized all of it now, not in the middle forties. It doesn’t really work. I just don't know what to do with everything that's going on. Yes, I know – work hard.

2020, stop please!

Please share the stories of people (or yours) who moved, completely changed their lives, who were in a similar state or worse, where can I get a strength,inspiration, tell me that life at 30 is also exists and everything is achievable. That there is one good, beautiful, loyal girl in this world is waiting for me in Europe. And nothing is really haven\`t missed yet.

Thank you for your attention.",09Oct2020,1

Sorry if this isn’t the right place. I need to get this out 

I have to go to work.this week went by too fucking fast.  I only work fri/sat/sun bc of college.I’m tripping though but everyone at works hates me but this one lady is nice and gifts me things but she just has pity for me.

Now this point I’m scared of talking to my parents and sister. They hate me too except my nephews but they probably will once they get older.

It’s draining going to work I have bad social anxiety and act like a dumbass and it hurts my body now. I want to call off but I can’t. I want to make myself sick or die or something so I don’t have to go. I don’t talk I don’t know what to say, what am I supposed to say? I try to make shit up but then I stumble all over my words because I’m scared of talk.

I can’t do this I’m shaking it. I have to stay their for 12 hrs and it’s agonizing because I don’t know how to talk to people and have a conversation. I make everything awkward. Why did I have to be born like this. My gpa is tanking bc I have lost motivation for everything.  I have to go to work in 5hrs. I’m shaking. I’m so selfish for being like this nothing terrible has happened to me. Why do I burden people. I should have died instead of the other baby my mom had before me. They would have been better.",09Oct2020,1
425,"I knew I should have left like 2 months into dating. We dated for 4.5 years.

Extremely abusive. I housed her, fed her, took her to Disneyland and on a cruise (started dating at 16 and 18, broke up at 20 and 22). She occasionally slapped my arm, threw things at me and tried to break my pinkie. Extreme anger. Would spiral into fits where she would scream and call me names and a piece of shit. ""Fuck you"", ""asshole"" and ""prick"" were her favorites. Isolated me from friends/family. Dragged me on social media during her fits. I must have had Stockholm syndrome or something. I was just too weak-willed to leave.

It's caused a lot of psychological damage and turned me into a toxic person. I talked to a girl for 2 weeks and she blocked me out of the blue on Snapchat without saying anything and even though it was disrespectful I should have moved on. Was just tired of being treated like shit, dehumanized and discarded and I went off on her. I said hurtful things. I've become an angry drunk and I drank and texted her (should not drink, period).

I feel absolutely guilty and terrible and I realized, this is how my ex made me feel. The cycle of abuse is real. I am an asshole and I radiate and attract toxicity.

I need to be a better person and forgive myself. I just don't know how. I'm thinking about doing volunteer work to make up for the horrible shit I just did. Even though she was mean, and said not so friendly things when I asked why she blocked me... that was uncalled for, and I hurt another human being.

426,"Hi, so with the covid my school hasn’t done the official first day when we go take a picture, the parents pay their bills and chose which activities we’ll go to etc... but it’s gonna be this weekend

I don’t like how she dresses and it makes me uncomfortable. She’s the sweetest most caring mom but she doesn’t dress like one. She wears like high heels (the ones that with red soles, to be even more flashy) she has a great body so she wears like mini dresses, tight pants things like that, she has super long hair, lipstick etc.. She turned 45 in August so she’s also not young anymore

Everytime there’s like other dads or even guys in my classes hitting on her!!! It makes me super uncomfortable and the boys in my year call her Sugar Mama (she doesn’t know that) so if we have like an after school football match, all the guys ask me if « Sugar Mama » will be there..

434,"TDLR; boyfriend and me are hurt over a hoodie argument, he wants to hold things from me because I was upset and choose to not want to accept his hoodies due to him cursing at me for having it in the first place.


Recently we've gotten into a argument about his hoodie, it's such a stupid argument but it's taken a huge hurt toll. In the summer he gave me his hoodie and then life got busy and covid so I couldn't give it back. And he would tell me how much he wanted it back that it was his favorite hoodie and I was guilty for having it for the amount of time that I did. I didnt mean to keep it for so long but he had given it to me voluntarily. That was months ago. 

Last week he gave me that same hoodie and we were on the phone and he told me how he wanted it back and in a teasing voice I said nope mine, there was clear joking in my tone. But he started raising his voice and cursing at me that he wanted his hoodie back, that the other day he was very cold because he didn't have it. And I was very hurt by it, I started crying because he has never done that to me. I told him after that night that I no longer want anymore of his hoodies because it was the second time hes reacted like this and now its escalated to cursing at me and now 

Skip forward days later we talked about this an he felt that it was wrong that I had internalized this and made my decision to not accept anything he gives me again. He said he felt bad because all I do is shower him with gifts, and I have nothing from him. But I dont care about that, I love giving him gifts it makes me so happy and he said it made him happy that he had my hoodie that I should understand. Though if he treats the situation like that he clearly did not want me to have it too *long* but I had only had it for a two or three days. 

Last night he brought it up again and I told him I wouldnt change my mind and he was upset that I was ""compartmentalizing"" his yelling into guilt and never taking anything from him again. I feel like I dont have the right to be upset about this.

His resolution for this is to keep things from me that could potentionally upset me. He said he thought about how I'm going to react to something, to prevent me from overthinking his words, to prevent from making my mental health worse. And that just hurt me even more. I dont want him to do that and he said that he cant keep dealing with this. ""This"" being the way I handle my emotions, the constant patience he needs to have with me, the fact that I need to seek mental health help.

I dont know where to go with this. I dont know if my emotions are going about this the wrong way or if they are even valid in the slightest. I dont know if this is the way I should be reacting. I could use some advice on what to do with this.

Sick of life right now. Maybe it’s just Covid getting to me but I really have no clue. Look, I’ll be as transparent as possible, so that I can get the best advice possible. I’m 17 years old, male from the U.S and life has been shit for a while now. Me and my dad don’t really talk anymore and had a huge falling out about a year ago after he cheated on my mom, and I confronted him about his gambling and alcohol addictions. He left.

I’m 17 years old, I’m healthy, I have a healthy social life, friends, I write, and as far as I’m concerned not weird toward girls. I even asked my friends because I was starting to think maybe I’m the problem. And I still do. Clearly, something is wrong with me to get the same answers from girls “you’re so sweet but no I don’t wanna hurt you”.

439," So I (18 F) joined college this year, and I've got to know this guy (18 M). Before entering college, I swore that I wouldn't date or like anyone and only concentrate on my studies. Also, I'm older than most people in my batch, so I thought I would never like anyone anyway because I don't want to date boys younger than me. It's not that I'm against it; it's just a personal choice. This guy that I started talking to is six months younger than me, but I guess I'm starting to like him. He's smart, and he knows what he's doing. But, in the one month that I've known him, it seems like he's an emotional person and might not lightly take my sarcastic jokes. I think maybe he's the clingy kind and on the dangerous side, so that's another reason why I should stay away from him. I usually don't like people who're like that, but I can't seem to stop thinking about him. Maybe it's because he's smart and cute.  
The problem is that I've started waiting for his messages and am not studying as much as before. I'm deviating from my goal, no matter how much I want to focus.

I admit that I contributed to this (always thought i was right when arguing, passive-aggressiveness, shared everything with my friends, had sex with a guy after we broke up then got together with ex a day later), but it wasnt nearly as bad as the things he did. 

I caught him going through my phone several times, told me i was a horrible person, told me that he had never self harmed before he met me, gaslit me, got angry when i didnt want to have sex w/ him and accused me of not loving him, punching my walls and punched a hole in his own wall and much much more. At the worst he was ignoring me two weeks at a time - came back for one week - repeat. 
To top it off, he cheated on me twice. The second time he groped and tried to put his hand in the girls' pants while she was black out drunk.

After this i broke up with him for the third and final time. He harassed me on all my social medias and i had to block him everywhere, he even sent me messages on Teams. He also logged into my snapchat, instagram amd facebook on valentines to find out where i was and if i were having sex with other people.

NOW:

He has started dating/is together with this sweet girl that goes to our school. I am worried that he will hurt her mentally and worst case scenario, physically (he never hit me). I dont want to be ""the crazy ex"" by telling her.

If I say it will be something like this: ""it seems like you and my ex have started dating. I wish you the best but i feel like i have a responsibility of warning you. My relationship with him was pretty fucked up and he did many horrible things to both me and the people around him. You need to be clear about your boundaries and demand to be treated right. If he shows many red flags you need to leave as fast as you can. He will say that hes changed. He also said that to me thoughout us being together, but he never did. I hope he never hurts you the way he hurt me.""

You guys have to understand that im not jealous at all and dont want to break them up because of that. Should i say something or will i just make it worse?",09Oct2020,1

This has been a problem with trying to tell my parents about anything important, when I'm trying to make a point when emotional, and when I try to share my ideas and passions with my girlfriend.

444,"I've posted here before, about how the second shift crew in my old department was basically making me feel like I could never do any right. Now that I've moved to my new position, one of the gals that was on second shift took my spot. She has been texting me (or, if I'm at work around 2/3pm, calling my extension) almost daily for questions and asking for help. 

This may seem petty of me, but given the attitude I'd gotten from her over the past three years, I want nothing to do with helping them out. They have plenty of other resources to reach out to. This morning I was sent yet another text asking for assistance. 

I don't want to come off as rude, but I am no longer in that department and I want nothing to do with helping them after the crap I went through. Would it be wiser to just pretend I don't see these texts - I'm not at work, therefore don't bother me? Or am I going to need to put my foot down?

446,"Is it possible to have your sexuality change?

Hi, growing up I identified as straight until I realized I started having sexual feelings towards women, but I was still predominantly attracted to men and rarely had thoughts about women. Now that I’m in my early 20s I’ve become extremely confused. My thoughts about women are intense and often and now I hardly think of men at all and feel little to no attraction towards them. I’m in a loving relationship with a man and I am attracted to him, but I can’t explain it, he’s literally the only man I have interest in besides that I fantasize about women, not just sexually, but emotionally. I crave cuddling them, holding hands, smelling their hair, kissing, etc. I used to think I was bisexual now I’m not too sure. Is it possible to have your sexuality change in your late teens/early twenties? I feel almost scared and confused. I fully support the LGBT community and I’m a proud member, all of this has just been overwhelming to experience. I thought I would just know and understand my sexuality but apparently I don’t.",09Oct2020,1
447,"So title explains most of it. But ltdr its illegal in my country not to wear a mask in public but for some reason clubs are ignored. You have to walk into a club wearing a mask but when u get inside everyone takes it off. 

I always wear a mask. It’s already stupid of me going to a club but my girlfriend wants to go and sometimes it is fun. If it’s safe. I always ask her to wear a mask when we go because it’s safer. There’s never been an issue (this is like our 2nd time going) but last night some stupid guy started speaking to me saying he can’t take me seriously because I’m wearing a mask, so I sold him to fu**k off... my girlfriend said “he has a point, there is no point to wear a mask”. If someone in this club has COVID we are going to get it anyways. 

Already at this point I was pissed off. My grandfather died of this shit and her saying no point really pisses me off. 

On top of that. We have this friend who is rather off the rails. She gives no fuks about masks. But she wanted to sleep over at our house after the club. I said of course you can but could u wear a mask, she said fine. But when we arrived she made plans with someone else to sleep at their house just so she does not need to wear a mask.  

I really struggle to understand this logic it’s baffles me that some people are like this.",09Oct2020,1
448," This is the only time I'll be using this account, and I'll respond to the most amount of people I can.

I'm 13 years old, and my mother is a huge conspiracy theorist, she thinks that Bill Gates is Satan and 5G is causing COVID-19 and that the government is a sex offender group.

I'll be using a VPN just in case some weirdo decides to try and find the city I live in then called CPS.

So Since COVID-19 started, my mom has cooked up some wild conspiracy theories on it. She pulled me out of school for ""home schooling"" (AKA: Not doing anything and just drinking at night while you fight with your husband). Issue with this is that I actually want to have a proper diploma, and I want to actually make friends with people my age, which is hard because I can rarely find people my age that I can actually be friends with.

I've suffered through many traumatic events, those events have shaped me into who I am today. I also think about those events, so it's hard to find someone who is like me? I sound like an asshole but I can't find people who are as smart at me... So someone who isn't a complete moron that can be sympathetic. So because I don't really go to school anymore, or even online classes. I have a hard time finding friends, so I usually have to lie about my age (around 16) just so I can have some friends.

I just want to go to online school, yet there's absolutely NOTHING I can do without her screaming at me saying something like ""You Bill Gates government supporter! God damn sheeple!"" (Slightly overexaggerated). I just need advice on what to do in this situation.",09Oct2020,1

Last year was amazing until covid 19 hit, I went home and finished the year virtually and spent a pretty boring summer at home. I got to spend time with my boyfriend but that was the highlight. I kept wishing I was back at school overseas. 

I got back just over 4 weeks ago. School is mainly online, we go in person one day a week. Covid restrictions prevent me from getting the most out of my education, traveling Europe, even seeing most of my friends here. I keep catching myself wishing I was back home with my boyfriend (and family).

452,"Living with 2 other women. Neither own the house, we each rent a room and bathroom directly from the homeowner.

They seem very nice, chill and clean for the most part. However, the fridge is smelly, stove and the kitchen drawers are sticky/dirty and the pantry has a strong cat food smell as one keeps their cat things in there. Prior to me moving in she said she would be happy to move the cat stuff but hasn’t yet (was there today moving some stuff in, so I may have to remind her). 

I am a very clean person (which I told them when I came to inspect the place) and I know not everyone cares as much as me so I am trying to be very aware of this, to chill out a bit and be more easy going. But I draw the line at smells and grime because I find it unsanitary. To me that’s not something I can ignore and I won’t be able to use the kitchen to cook. I understand that if my standards of cleanliness are higher than them, I will have to maintain the extra steps of cleanliness, which is fine.

So a little background first. My friend and I met in junior year of college and we've been texting ever since (literally every single day). It started off with just regular, boring small talk. But eventually he started opening up to me about everything that was going on in his life. I genuinely just wanted to be there for him and help him in any way possible and I tried my best. 

We got pretty close in terms of how easy it felt to talk about things we normally wouldn't share with anyone else. But the thing is. We only text. I don't think there's ever been an occasion where we sat down in person and spoke to each other. This continued for the next 2 or 3 years. And recently it hit me that I really like this person. But I know that it can never turn into anything. Why, you ask? Well, first the whole 'only texting' thing we have going on and second, I don't think he'll ever get over the girl he used to like. And it really kills me every time he brings up her name. Its really beginning to affect my mental health and I feel so lost. For the first time I don't have someone to talk about these feelings to because he's the one I normally open up to.

I am currently living in Japan. Been here for almost 12 years now. I have 2 kids from 1 failed marriage which I have been struggling to give child support to. I had a new daughter born August 31 but she was 2 months early. She finally came home 2 days ago. 
I finally found a well paying job. Unfortunately I ended up paired with a guy who is impossible to work with. He is a Japanese guy who definitely did not like working with a foreigner. After a particularly shitty shift I end up getting drunk and calling the guy telling him how I really felt (this is my bad, I do not condone drinking and feeling expression but I guess my limit had been reached). 
So now I have a new born baby daughter and no job. And right now in Japan finding a new job is almost impossible unless you have fluency and qualifications for skilled jobs. I have no idea what to do. 
I put on a brave face for my partner every day but I am honestly fearing for the future. What on earth can I do?
I have started a twitch channel to try give myself something I can do inbetween finding a new job but hit the usual roadblock of not having enough viewers haha.

460,"my ex uses Facebook messenger to contact the boys(aged: 5, 3 and 2 years) the other night we had a fight which led to me telling him to not contact me until we get a legit plan set in place and that he will not be taking the boys out alone. I promise I have my reasons, he is very unstable and according to the person he lives with; drinks non-stop and is always picking fights with people whilst out which has resulted in him getting life time bans in some places. There's so much more to it but I can't post here as my post will be removed(if you'll like to know more so you can 'judge' better just DM me) - we've been broken up for 7 months; in those 7 months he has been very inconsistant with the kid's and hardly see's them or calls. We have been to mediation but that just isn't working (he keeps letting them down or changing our days / times) he wanted to try that instead of court so I said why not but it clearly isn't working so... 

I've also been told by the person that he lives with that even  she thinks he is so unstable that if he does take the boys out, even shes not sure he'll bring them back. 
After him sending me a MASSIVE paragrapth basically threatening me and being very passive aggressive, I blocked him. I texted his house mate telling her to ask him to ""please stop"" apparently he laughed and said ""i'm only just getting started"" she even told me that maybe I ahould just block him.  

I understand that maybe me telling him not to come near the kids was abit too far and I regret saying that; I know he loves his kids and has rights as their father. I just don't feel comfortable him being alone with them and really want to express that to him, I don't want him to think i'm keeping the kids from him and just said that out of frustration.

He threw the biggest fit and said she needed to stand up for him and he should be invited to family events. They had two fights before our trip where she came over hysterically crying. Eventually we went on trip. They’ve broken up several times after that and it’s always him starting fights over the phone while she’s with people. He’s threaten suicide and says he has health problems or other things to make her feel sorry for him. He’s made fake Facebook profiles to stalk me.

Imagine I have something to do like study. And I barely study for 10 minutes at a time, or so having real trouble having focused time. But then one day I have scheduled to meet with a friend at 4 pm. On that day at 2 pm I will have this burst of energy and motivation, usually with guilt and anxiety in the mix, but it could also be lots of excitement. It's like my brain knows I'll only be able to work until that time, so it decides to focus.

Sometimes I'll be so focused I'll think it's best to delay the thing with the friend. Like let's do it later or another day. Or I do it late.

It's like my brain goes ""life doesn't last forever, time is ticking"", but it doesn't in normal circumstances. It's not that I have to finish doing what I'm doing before the appointment; it's just that I'm afraid to lose the focus after the appointment is done?

Does anyone relate to this, and how do you deal with it? You just keep the appointment and ditch the motivation?

I am 18 (F) and I live in a very disturbed household. My uncle and aunt fight constantly and my aunt often leaves the house for weeks and doesn't come back, she's the only earning member of our family. My mom and dad have a very rocky relationship (he has cheated on her multiple times) and they sometimes take out their frustration on me. 
I always feel super down these days and don't feel like staying so I put up an SOS on Instagram for help. An activist reached out and she has made arrangements for me to have accomodations, a lawyer and has started an online fundraiser for me untill I find a job. 

I told my dad that I want to leave and he started emotionally blackmailing me, told me all my friends will use me and dump me. I don't even have friends, the activist is just doing this out of kindness and he even says I am ruining the family and he told me that I would never be able to survive alone. Family is a really important thing in my country, you have to stay with them regardless of how they are. I am super worried for my dog too. He's just a baby and I don't think my dad will take care of him (He won't let me take him with me or put him in foster care). I don't think my parents will be able to pay for my college either, so I'll have to take an education loan for that. The activist said she'll help me.

I really, really need to know if I'll be a bad person for leaving. I think the activist is exasperated with me because I constantly keep delaying everything. She has never expressed this however, she has always been very kind and patient, I just feel this way.

At the same time, a lady walked into our yard; I tried to greet her by saying, ""Hello"" but she quickly turned into the house and did not acknowledge me. 

I called the guy to ask about the baby, and a short bit later he came over to the house to talk to me. He informed me that this lady needed a place to hide because of an abusive situation. First, the story was told as though the lady's mother was abusive, and later he said it was the lady's husband. He then told me that she paid him $1000 in return, and that he was just staying at his girlfriends house so she could stay there. 

It is not really my business, but I do think the financial piece was weird because he only pays 650 for his place... but maybe she just volunteered that payment? And along these lines, I also know that our state currently has a mandated eviction cancellation because of covid, so he hasn’t been paying rent. 

Anyway, he assured me that she was very nice, and that he had known her for years. We decided to leave it and try to let it play out, but truthfully none of this has been settling well with us. 

I asked that he please our landlords know, because with them living so far away, they obviously wouldn’t know, but he refused and said that they would kick him out if they knew. (He knows them though his family) 

A few days later we spoke on the phone and I repeated that we really wanted him to notify our landlords, but then shared with me that he spoke with the lady and as he was telling her to move out, she told him that she has 6 months to live,and that she needs someone to adopt her baby. He said that he was going to the Godfather  and she was going to pay off all of his debt, so he really didn’t want to hurt their relationship. The story keeps getting more complex and I don't truthfully know what's going on, but something feels off about it. 

All-in-all, we have been battling with what to do with this situation. If this woman truly needs help, we would HATE to bring more stress to her and her baby. 

We also realize that something like this could happen if we lived in an apartment, and we would not have any say in the matter. However, we also realize that in that case, a housing manager would be present.. 

Does anyone have any thoughts?? I would LOVE some advice... should we keep our nose out of his business or let our landlords know that something is up?",09Oct2020,1

477,"19 y/o F from the United States. I moved to another country for school and I’ve been here for two weeks. I’ve been preparing to come here for months but I was never able to lock down an apartment beforehand, so my mom reserved a room for me at a “foyer.” Foyer translates to “big house” so it’s basically just a college dorm that people in my town rent a room out of while they’re going to school, but it’s not connected to any school in specific.

Everyone here is really nice, I love the location and my room. Free WiFi, they provide breakfast and dinner during the week, there’s a communal kitchen, and everyone has their own bathroom. After I accepted that I wasn’t getting my own place, I decided that I’d wait until after Christmas to move out.

It’s just really damn expensive. I pay the most out of all my new friends in this town. It’s more than any studio apartment I wanted to rent; the food is terrible and I can barely bring myself to eat it; I have to buy all my cooking stuff and cleaning stuff because despite it being a pandemic no one disinfects anything in the communal kitchen; the WiFi is so crappy that I’ve burnt through most of the 20 gigs of data I paid for when I got here so I wouldn’t have to wait so damn long for stuff to load. I thought I could roll with it but I know I could be so much happier if I buy everything I need for my own studio where I can make my own FOOD (it’s just a royal pain to do it here). So I sped up my moving out process and made an appointment to go see an apartment... in 20 minutes.

I just talked to the director and told her that I wanted my own apartment before and I was still looking for one to move into as soon as possible. She told me I have to stay till the end of the semester. Not “pay this months rent and a fee,” she said I have to stay till February.

So, I ordered PC parts from outside my country and used a p.o box to deliver it but I might’ve made a mistake by doing that. Because the p.o box belongs to my older sister, I don’t have any access to it. The only reason I did the p.o box because the delivery fee was expensive. 

I ordered my parts around 14 September, it arrived in the p.o box 23 September. Told my sister to order the parts to deliver here, and she told it “I ordered it, just wait 7 days”.

But days passed, and we started October

I talked to her again about it, and she said “Oh the delivery cost 700 dollars” So I went to my friends and family to ask them for 700 and pay them later but nobody had anything to give sadly, So I talked to her again about it and asked does it really cost 700? She replied with “Fine pay me later, they don’t need it now” while ordering the parts again. 

I’m like wait didn’t she order them already? Why she did it again, I asked her if she canceled the order before, but she said the company itself did it. Search up about the company and turns out they don’t do that, they just put it on hold instead of canceling. Few days passed and i asked her again about the delivery, but she screamed at me and said “Where my 700?”  

What?? But I thought they didn’t want it?? I don’t know what to do. It’s been half 2 months since I ordered my parts. Should I contact the company about this In email? Or Should I tell my mother about this? cause my mom told me she lied about the 700.

She attends a chriropractor twice a month, she's seen 2 different orthopedics who also don't know how to fix it (one reccomended Cymbalta??). She's had x-rays but the doctors never noticed anything abnormal. Her shoulder blade makes 3-5 deep uncomfortable pop noises when she rolls it.

487,"Two Wednesdays ago I was driving my car on my way to work, enjoying some music with the windows down. I live in the rural Midwest so this time of year often sees lots of farm equipment on the road. 

I pulled up to a stopsign as I regularly do, and as I was doing so a giant silver tanker was pulling up to turn left onto the road I was on. It made a very close turn and was clearly going to hit me even though I was perfectly in my lane, so I backed up. This all happened within about 5 seconds so I didn't even register what kind of tanker it was, and I was just being polite to make sure it could get through.  

Its still really close to hitting me in my lane and I'm about as far over as I can be, when all of a sudden I hear a steam-whistling noise and s**t from the top of the truck starts spewing at me. It painted the side of my car and, you remembered correctly, my window was down. I got random excrement all over my work clothes and my body and the interior of my car. 

At this point I couldn't see out of my left-hand side, and some of it got in my left eye, so i was unable to tell if the truck was stopped or waiting for me to move so he can avoid hitting me still. I felt like I was doing something wrong and had no clue what to do, so I drove off somewhere where I wouldn't get hit so I could regain my vision. 

I didn't get the truck company as it all happened so fast and I was blind half the time,  plus farming equipment is very regular here. There's like 15 farms in just a 5 mile radius in that direction so I don't think I could track it. If they're supposed to report spills, maybe I could start with the biggest farm. 

ADDITIONALLY: I am a rather poor person and this caused me to be late for work. Yes, I cleaned the outside of my car and showered while the inside was still soaking with feces and went to work. I was also fixing up my car to hopefully sell soon but I definitely don't have the money to re-detail the interior now. 

What should I do? Would local farms be the way to go? I doubt they reported anything though, as I'm not even sure the truck stopped. I was briefly considering a GoFundMe but was told that was a bad idea...

I know I should have gotten out and gotten the truck ID, so please anything other than ""should've gotten the ID"".",09Oct2020,1

Prior to this I was a straight A student who generally didn’t need to study for anything and got all their work done on time. When quarantine began during spring of my sophomore year, my work ethic decreased dramatically and I started falling behind on assignments. I believe by the last few weeks of school I had around 30 missing assignments that I got done the last week. Now that junior year has started, I’ve already missed around 1/3 of school and am obviously falling behind in assignments and grades. I’m in high level classes and am not used to being so rebellious (if that’s the right word?). My grades are failing and my attendance is shit. I know what I’m doing is only going to hurt me but the thought of going to school is far worse than the thought of any consequences of missing. I don’t know what to do. I talked with my sis about me maybe being depressed but she told me I’m fine when I’m not doing anything academic. Am I burnt out? How do I even fix that?

1. He has a record, he didn’t steal anything or physically hurt anybody, but has a felony.
2. The arrest and a childhood of emotional abuse left him truamatized because he had control taken away repeatedly, and sometimes rather violently. He has had job offered but they didn’t last this ties back to his trauma and a feeling of a total lack of control.
3. He is married with kids, two of which are autistic, and two have a seizure disorder, so they require two eyes, as often as one can spare them.
4. He has tried to find work he could do online, but either the income is a few dollars a month, or of questionable legality, so to avoid committing a crime he has passed on such opportunities.
5. He did write a book series, after a lengthy duration he was able to save enough money to hire an editor who backed out citing the work wasn’t worth the money, despite seeing the whole of the manuscript prior to accepting the job, he had to settle for Grammarly to edit. Unfortunately nobody is buying it, and he doesn’t know how to get people reading it, or even talking about it.
6. He has gone to workforce services, vocational rehab, literally every program within a hundred miles he has taken classes on improving his situation from everyone that will teach him, he has even reached out to the state governor, any number of influencers, even the President asking for a means to stand on his own two feet, but nothing has helped and he is convinced he is cursed. In all honesty I am inclined to agree with him.

493,"My mom and I (23 Nonbinary) moved my cousin C (19M) into our townhouse apartment in the beginning of this year due to major familiar issues (long story short my mom's half sister and her husband who were taking care of him were abusing drugs and alcohol and the house my cousin was living in was essentially a biohazard after years of neglect from C and my late grandfather's lack of cleaning.) 

Now C has ASD and has been diagnosed when he was very young. My late grandparents essentially did everything for him and let him do as he pleased to avoid meltdowns (and whenever he was told do to something and faces the consequences for doing something he wasn't supposed to do or not doing something he was supposed to do, he had really bad meltdowns.) Now that he is older, with a lot of talking to and discipline from our older cousins who did come over to clean and take care of our grandfather when he was alive and C didn't help like he was asked to. He is fairly self efficient now, and has a nice job at one of the local plants doing maintenance and such. 

The issue now is that his yelling on his headset. Because my mom and I are constantly working due to recent events, we have yet to find anytime to move into an available 3 bedroom apartment in the complex, so until then, his space is the living room. So even if my second story bedroom door is shut, I can still hear him. I am talking full volume screaming and yelling. 

I have chronic headaches and migraines everyday, with migraine episodes around 3 times a week (more so if I am stressed or my period is coming up), so this really affects me. I do take a prescription migraine medication, but that only does so much. And with my mom and I always working overtime, I am twice as exhausted. 

I have asked him in the past, and have been direct with him, like I was told to be. Typically the conversation goes on my end like this: 

""Hey C (or Bud as that is what I call him) I need you to tune the yelling down. I'm having a migraine right now, and I can hear you from my room."" 

That is responded with him yelling at me and then going back to his game, proceeding to get louder out of frustration of me interrupting his game. He also does this is I have friends over to play DnD, and because he is only a few feet in front of us, it is really loud and makes my friends who have anxiety disorders very anxious. I have approached him with 'Hey C, you need to stop yelling. You are making us anxious and interrupting our game.' Same response. 

My mom also has asked him to tone the yelling down if she is working from home one evening or I am suffering too much in my room to bother. He even yells at her. I am at the point of just telling him to turn off the games or just doing myself after he just yells at him after asking. 

Am I going all wrong about asking him? How can I set those boundaries with him, and should I place consequences if he does not follow through? I don't want to take away an outlet of his but I physically cannot stand it anymore.",09Oct2020,1
495,"For context, I recently turned 20 (F) and am engaged. I left everything behind and moved halfway across the country to be with my fiancé, with no experience in being an independent adult. 

Lately, I have been experiencing both severe physical and mental health issues. The doctors here are an hour drive away, and not only can I not drive for very long because of my health, but we also share a car. Also, my externships for school are coming up within the next few months and those are an hour drive away as well, which would have to be done every day for at least 2 months. At home, all of these things are more accessible and much easier on me to complete. 

So, after thinking it over for so long I made the hard decision of putting myself first and going home temporarily to allow myself to do all of these things without all of the added stress. However.. when I brought this up to him, he told me what I wanted was unrealistic &amp; that I was being selfish for not considering him. He said that if I go home for a year (that's how much school I have left) that i'm throwing the relationship / engagement away. 

I've been told that a person's health comes first, above a relationship. This is my first serious one, though, and I don't know what to think. He also said that my mother must have been saying things in my ear to convince me to come home when she's done nothing but try to help, and not just me (she's bought us both necessities when he was running low on money and I was out of a job)

I've been struggling a lot because of everything he's said and I don't want to make the wrong decision here and ruin everything. He said he would help me with everything if I stay here but I know that's even less realistic for multiple reasons.",09Oct2020,1

Pretty soon, my student loans will start back up again and I'll need health insurance. I calculated my bills and necessities and I'll only have about 200 left per month for groceries, gas, supplies, anything fun and to attempt to save. Ive kind of been living off savings and not realizing how little money I was making in comparison to my bills. I only have 200 in savings right now and 1000 left over which I need for a down payment on a car. (I do have a credit card with a remaining 6000 in case of an emergency though I'd hate to use that.

My rent and utilities and internet are 680 so if I moved back home I'd have an extra 680 to save.

The cons are that:
1.) My dads house is super messy all the time and its hard to control (my sister stays there sometimes and is reaaaally messy....the baths also have mold all over them
2.) I'll be alone during the week there but not alone on the weekend (when I usually have people over.)
3.) I currently only see my bf once per week for half a day. This would cut 2 hours off our time in driving and he probably wouldn't be able to make it every week anymore either. (Biggest drawback...)
4.) My work office is 50 mins away (although I only have to go in once per week during non covid times.
5.) I'll have less a feeling of freedom and independence
6.) My room there is very small and I'd have no separate work space
7.) I have 2 cats and he already has 1 cat and 1 dog. Theres not enough space for enough litter boxes, plus my cats are shy, and my dad's cat has exhibited aggression toward a different kitten before when we catsat her.

In fourth grade I attended this tutoring program because I was failing math and English. I rode the bus home from that program. One day I was wearing a dress with straps on them and I stretched my arms. Suddenly these girls start to burst out laughing and I was very confused. Suddenly one of the girls says “hey OP! Stretch!!” So I stretch my arms again and they start laughing again. At this point I’m super confused and asked why they were laughing and they say it’s because of my hairy armpits. For many weeks and I’m pretty sure months these girls made fun of my armpits until I tell the Vice Principal and they get in trouble. To this day I still think about it. Now for my chest. Back in 6th grade I didn’t wear bras (yes I’m female) and bunches of girls started to notice. My “friend” bothered me about wearing them and when I said that they were too uncomfortable she claimed that I didn’t want to “grow up” but no I just didn’t like wearing bras. It got so bad that girls started looking down my shirt to see if I was wearing one. So to this day I can’t even sit in my own home without wearing a bra in fear that people will judge me.

I feel completely lost right now, if I’m being honest I don’t really feel happy, I feel very emotionally disconnected and anxious. A part of me wants to just leave life here behind and move and start over. But I’m in college here and my family is here. I have a bad feeling my long term boyfriend is gonna break up with me too, I really believed he was gonna be the one I was gonna marry as we talked about it so many times. Maybe it’s just me being anxious I don’t know. I know I shouldn’t feel like this, I have a good job, I have 2 close friends, I’m in college, I have a family who sometimes makes me feel worthless but overall they love me. Yet I can’t help but feel lost, i feel so trapped.

511," 

In the past 2 to 3 weeks, I have been in my lowest of lows. I could hardly smile and I barely ate.

**Backstory:**

In 1st grade i got tested positive for ADHD and I was at few physicians to help me.

Four  years ago my parents went through a divorce (Currently 16M). It  affected me a lot. I held all of my emotions and struggles in and I  never liked sharing them with others. In 2019 I took on Salsa dancing  and bachata and I have felt the best I have ever been. I have gone to 2  Salsa festivals.

When 2020 come  and everything went to lock down I couldn't go anywhere. I was stuck  inside and my grades fell because of it and I got barely any motivation  for school. These have affected me a lot nut I never was good sharing my  emotions and held it all inside me and I never shared my feelings with  even my closest of friends and family.

I have finally taken a decision to talk to my dad about it and I'm going to therapy on this upcoming Tuesday.

I still find doing my assignments hard to do and can't find any motivation. I talked to my teacher about it today.

**TLDR:**  Parents went through a divorce and mental health suffered Took on  dancing and can't do that because of COVID-19. Going to therapy on  Tuesday.

**Current events:**

I  revealed to my teacher that I might have ADHD and that I'm having a lot  of stress and being overwhelmed. and he just said that its all inside  my head and I'm making these things up and my therapy is just a waste of  money and that I should relax.

Is my teacher right? Am I wasting money on it? or am I doing the right thing?",09Oct2020,1

513,"So, during the isolation of the last year, I rediscovered my joy of woodworking. This was one of my favorite subjects in high school, as I have a great love for making things, so I borrowed some power tools and made a couple of really nice night stands. This has got my wife all excited (not needing to hire someone to install custom closet shelves, new dressers, a bed frame with sliding drawers, many more visions of home improvement projects sparkling in her eyes) and now she’s talking about buying me my own power tools.

And now that’s got me thinking, how can I turn something I love doing into a profitable side business? There’s no way I’m going to quit my day job (I’m a direct employee of a global Fortune 500 company and my insurance and benefits packages are too good to abandon) but I think I could make a good bit of supplemental income doing things like custom shelves, cabinets and the like.

I'm driving her home one night and the topic of our families come up... I'm already uncomfortable cuz I don't like talking about my family... She says she wants me to meet her family, cool sounds great I'm always down... Then she says she wants to meet mine too, boom pump the brakes, I start thinking up excuses, they hate meeting people, they got a health condition, they all live in a farm up I'm montana. But she is religious and didn't care she wants to meet them cuz that's what you do... I'm dead last time I dated a black girl they gave her such a hard time, I broke up with her just so she wouldn't have to go through that... 

My family loves me and everything and don't want to make them come off as complete racists but they really just don't want me to date outside my race... If she was anything else they would probably do something similar... And they have. 

Her family doesn't really like me either... They think all latino men are wishy washy and cheaters.... That words ""(blanks) are trash come up often"". I don't really care though I like her anyway

515,"Long story short, I went back to school to be a nurse.
I failed my second semester twice, kicking me out of the program. Now my GPA is slightly too low to even get back in. However if I up my grade in one of my pre-requisite classes I will meet the minimum GPA requirement again.
But this would mean I can’t reapply to the program until next fall for spring admission in 2022. Which means I won’t graduate until December 2024.

Meaning I would be 30 years old by the time I graduate. I wouldn’t be able to live alone until probably 31. And quite frankly I’m just tired of school.

However, the job I’m presently working is willing to help me get certified as a medical assistant. Optimistically doing this, I make 10$ less an hour versus what I would potentially make as a nurse.
But I can afford to live as a medical assistant
Not really to the point I can afford lavish vacations or even a vacation at all, but I can move out on my own and reasonably pay my bills. 

My older sister is about to lose her mind at the thought of me giving up nursing, because why would I settle when if I push through I can make essentially twice the money? 
But I’m just tired.
I love the thought of nursing, but I’m not in love with nursing school (no nurse ever was) and I’m not in love with the thought of having to stay with her or my parents until I’m 30 because I failed nursing school just working part time, much less trying to go to school and work full time as well. 

I dunno. I know I sound like I’ve made up my mind and I suppose I really have, but I just need someone to tell me it’s okay to settle, even if it means living life a little more frugally.",09Oct2020,1

After the divorce I was back to square one. I was searching for a secure job, and a place to stay.

Seeing the state of life I was in, an old friend hooked me up with a job, and a temporary place to stay for the time being. I basically lived rent free at one of his rental property for a year. 

After I got back on my feet, I wanted to thank him so I took him out for dinner. We talked about a lot of stuff. We then started meeting for dinners every month or so, then months turned into weeks. 

We basically fell in love with each other, but I know he was married. We both wanted each other very badly, but I know that wasn't going to happen because he was married. 

Last week he called me up, and said he is going to divorce his wife for me. I was happy, but also felt guilty that I was ruining his marriage, I am conflicted.

Should I let him go ahead with his divorce or tell him to stay with his wife, and be miserable all alone for the rest of my life!?

**Please be gentle and kind. Since knowing this I've been feeling so restless, depressed and anxious...**

Long story short: He (47, M, Canada, on disabled aid, PTSDs and chronic depression) sent me (29, F, Hong Kong, GAD and depression, on psychotropic medication and TB pills) and emails telling me he needs to move out of his mom's apt this month as she's going to live in a nursing home and the apt will be on sale afterwards. What can I possibly do? Ask him to seek help from the government organizations and that's it?

Details:

I've written it down for a while but been not able to read it back:

We met online. I was doing the last semester of my first degree. He was on the edge of being broke, homeless and hopeless (he decided to kill himself when he gets too old and has lots of physical pain). As a friend, I suggested him that he should give a try in China. This was a suggestion based on his 15 years of living in Korea. He got married with a Korean and they had their own school there. He described his ex-wife as a workaholic, and a crazy and materialistic person. He said the business was great but they were burnt out so they closed the business and went to Canada to live. He said they spent too much time together and argued a lot so they divorced, He did not fight for anything as he knew she would do everything to get everything they made together. He went back to live with his mother who was in need of being taken cared of.

He went to Beijing in November, 2016. Due to a number of reasons, he did not like the city and job when he first came to the city where was far away from me. He then came to Shenzhen and had great difficulty of being employed due to his hearing problem and physical health conditions. We dealt with his visa problem for half a year (during January to May in 2017). Finally, we made it. Also as a non degree holder, he worked as an online teacher. The teaching hours however were not enough to support his living. After a period of hard time, he had been gradually rebuilding his life this year since June. Before that I had been offering lots of financial help. It was not asked by him at all.

In mid October I received his call and he told a bunch of police came to his place out of sudden. We lost contact very soon. I then contacted the local consulate. The next day they told me they were informed that he was in administrative detention as he did not hold the appropriate work permit. They also told me that the period of detention shall be within 15 to 30 days according to the law(s). Last Friday was his 30th day. The consulate sent some people to visit him to know more about the matter. They got informed by the local authorities that his investigation has been extended since they think his case is complicated.

I thought I could get an answer last Friday but it turned out to be very unexpected. It has been an ordeal for me for more than a month. I spent time on thinking about what else I could do to 'help' me and him. It took me lots of time to find out his mom's address in Canada as well as his ex-wife's information (contact number, e-mail and how she's doing generally). I did contact his mom on phone but did not contact his ex-wife as according to what I have known she's married to someone else in Canada and got her citizenship there. There is no point of contacting her though I was desperately looking for some possible help in any kind.

I finished my postgraduate programme in May this year. I had been taking several part-time jobs, including tutoring kids in a private center, at their home, and adults, and some other gigs.

In April I found I had more and more physical discomfort. In mid May I was sent to a hospital and diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression. I tried the antidepressant given by the hospital for a week but got lots of severe side effects, including high frequency of panic attacks lasting for at least two to three hours. I stopped taking it in May. Gradually got a bit better in June, and better in July but in August I had a bad cough. My breathing difficulty appeared a lot more often in August. September is my birthday month and I thought I would be a lot better in Sept. when I first knew I had this issue in May. I inwardly set time for my recovery, which was very stupid. I got physically very ill in September and mentally collapsed. He had been affected by my health issues. He got so depressed. He went to drink very often during August to October. I was back to medication last month. I have been taking stabilizer and antidepressant. I have choking anxiety and an OCD of cough (esp. after eating and whenever I feel 'suffocated'). I have been seeing different therapists as well since July.

I deeply knew I should prioritize my physical and mental health first but I cannot help let the negativity of everything about him go.

Edited in 16 Nov, 2018 (the above)

After 35 days of being in a detention house he was released and requested to leave mainland China within 24 hours. He left Shenzhen in 24th October and went to Hong Kong to rest for a few days before taking a long-hour flight back to his home country.

I did not know anything about these until he told me. He told me for 35 days everyone in the detention house could be only allowed to stay in the house. Sometimes it was very crowed. Every day they could only sit on a bench after waking up. Everyone was only given a thin blanket to stay warm at night. There were only squat toilets with no walls or doors. The odor was lousy at the time. Only Chinese foods were given. There were many homosexuals, and it was often seen that some sexual moments under their blankets. Some even touched him, and it reminded him of a misery happened in his childhood. He was raped by his elder brother when he was little up to 15 years old. When staying there he always banged his forehead to the wall or bars to kill himself. He had no idea about when he would be released. He had a bad cold for a few weeks. He was always smacked by some light sleepers there when he got into deeper sleep and snored. He did not shower or brushed for 35 days, like everyone there.

After staying for a few days in Hong Kong, he took a flight back to Vancouver. The first week he held a positive attitude about bettering himself. However after the first week he has been very depressed. He has zero desire to talk to me. Even I sent him emails that contained information about mental health resources that he could try to get help from in his place, he has not replied me at all. I understand that he is now undergoing jail and rape traumas but I already helped him search information that he could seek help from. I do not understand why it would be that hard for him to make phone calls to those centers to book appointments. He also needs a physical health check but he has not asked his doctor (nurse practitioner) to arrange one for him. I asked him to call some other doctors who can receive new patients but he has not done that yet.

Since weed has been legalized throughout Canada, he has been taking weed for two week at least and drinks a lot to try to numb himself. I feel so disappointed as he promised me he would not do that when he was back to Vancouver.

He left me no choice but only said, 'concentrate on myself''. I am really feeling despondent.

Something more about myself:

I had breathing difficulty and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder since May. My OCD has been developing (and changing a bit from time to time). First I had choking anxiety so I ate very slowly and kept silent for the entire time of having a meal. Later I was afraid I did not consume adequate amount of calories and I might feel uncomfortable easily. I forced myself to eat something between meals. Now I cough after I eat something. Very often I cough to puke. I have kind of managed myself that I do not cough to vomit but I still cough a lot after eating. If I do not cough I feel so uncomfortable and anxious. Even I cough I do not feel a sense of instant relief but a bit ""better"".

So I was a fresh grad last year and my supervisor/boss(M) was 9 years older than me. He would sometimes pat my head but tbh I disassociated every time he did that and would just forget about it the next day. Ps he only did it 3 times in the span of 6 months. And also tbh I hate ppl touching me even if it's my family. My ex boss has a fiancé and he would always talk about her and he said he view me as his sister. Ps he does have a sis around my age.

So she has paid a fortune for internet. 
We have constantly suggested that we would do the research for her. Then we would sort it all out for her. But she tells us it is WAY to complicated.  
So she pays over £50 a month for internet.  
She recently got a hive thing which has cute he internet. So we can't use it for simple things like Netflix and YouTube. There is no way that we can even attempt to play games. 
We worked out that if we unplug the hive that is attached to the internet. Then it works. But his mum is too fucking think to work it out. 
She is currently calling us stupid and unintelligent for looking things up. It is like a one sided argument that she won't let us talk so we can't explain what is wrong and how to fix it. 
How can we explain this all to his mum?? Please help",09Oct2020,1
527,"On mobile. English is not my first language.

My personal situation is not great at the moment. I have some performance difficulties at work (though I am still employed). Last month my boyfriend told me he is moving back home (different continent) and although he cares for me very much, and I for him, we're not ready for a next step in that direction together. Today my mom called me crying confessing that on Monday my dad will go to the hospital, his condition is quite critical. We don't know yet for sure, but they are afraid it might be the worst. (They're doctors, so not the 'I googled it' fear, a realistic one) 

I am trying to be strong for my parents and I am trying to be their rock, but I am in a fragile moment, and I have quite a lot on my shoulders.

I live abroad on my own, it was a career choice and I moved a lot and I was quite successful initially. As a result, I do have some friends, but not too many. It's difficult in adult life, especially so if you move around. I started going back to therapy recently so I hope that will help.

I am not a person that opens up easily, especially not to strangers. This boyfriend I had is a very kind soul and he managed to make me feel comfortable around him and open up. Of course in exchange I've done the same for him. We left in amicable terms and told each other how much we meant to one another, and how much respect we have for each other and a few other nice things. Our life choices got us in different directions, and although I'm not happy about it I understand it and accept it. We considered it, I suggested that maybe in the future my circumstances may change and I could move there too, but he said that he would suffer a great deal if we kept things going on without a clear future, and he would rather take the cut now. I think it is a very mature view, and I agree that it is easier like this. We agreed to eventually stay in touch as friends, but not acted on it just yet.

Given the latest bad news about dad I am thinking that I would really like to still have the ex boyfriend in my life right now, in friendly terms. He knows me well, he knows my family, and I would like to be able to talk to him sometimes in this difficult situation.

I would like to ask him if it's OK if I give him a call sometimes. I don't mean getting a hug or even meeting in persone at all. I definitely don't have any romantic intentions and so on. I am just hurting so much on the inside and I would appreciate so much to have someone I can talk to without having to explain my whole life story from the beginning. 

I am afraid that getting in touch with him might give him the wrong impression, or that he'll be annoyed. On the other side I think he's a good man and I've seen him in more than one occasion offering his support even when not asked (even to me). 

I feel ashamed that I let myself grow old without many friends, following my career and nothing else, and ending up with not having even that anymore.

I also feel ashamed to ask him for help, when I can offer nothing in exchange. I am so used to bear it all on my shoulders, and I am not used to ask for help, it comes with this sense of guilt and fear of bothering the other person, especially more so that he's been out of my life for a little bit now.

I know it’s a problem, but I can’t keep working 8 hour shifts with kids/babies when I’m on the verge of falling asleep. Weed seemed like the better option than just... not sleeping and missing work.

I’ve realized it’s due to something psychological, so I finally texted her asking for a session. I assume that weed will somehow be brought up, and I don’t like lying to her because I want to solve whatever is bothering me. I’m just worried she’ll enroll me in some rehab program? Call the police? Inform someone I don’t want her to?

533,"I had to re-write this a million times because I'm upset and ranting. I really need advice on how to handle this - if there's a more specific helpful sub, please let me know. Questions are below at the bottom:

To keep it short, step-dad and mom split 10 years ago. I kinda hate the dude because he's a compulsive liar and if not lying, exaggerates the truth a lot. Half brother is close with him. Family has this weird thing where parents would tell us pretty heavy things but tell us to keep it quiet (which, we always knew anyway), other wise there'd be a lot of guilt. Brother always was the main person for this. 


Current situation: Brother text me Monday saying he needed to talk to me about something serious and needs to be trusted that it stays between us. Dad told him he talked to mom, and she apparently told him shes very sick. He ""doesnt know how bad it is, but keeps saying it isn't good"". I asked what kind of sick, and he said cancer. She's only in her 40's... Mom apparently ONLY told dad, and didnt want him to say anything. 

I wont go into the rant I want to about this, but basically I'm upset that my stepdad put this burden on brother where he'd have to suffer wandering if his mom is going to die by himself. I convinced brother that this is more serious than any other situation before, and we NEED to talk to her directly and get the truth. I suggested I be with him (and I want to talk to her) but always want to give him the choice. He said he would yesterday, but couldnt. So, I'm thinking we're going to talk to her tomorrow. 


**What I need advice on**
I want to ask her whats going on, but I dont know how to bring it up. If it is what dad says, I want to let her know that we, her adult children (I'm 28, brothers 24. I have another whos 21... I have no idea if he knows), NEED to know these things... But I dont know if thats really right or just my feelings getting in the way. 

* Should we gently confront her on this?
* How should we go about bringing it up? What should we say or ask?
* Do we really have the 'right' to mention that she 'needs' to tell us stuff like this? Like, at the end of the day, should it really just be her choice?


I'm worried about her telling us its not a big deal if it is - she's always been the ""I'm ok, don't worry about me, let me take care of you"" and never wants to look 'vulnerable' in front of us. If it truly is a miscommunication, I'm also really considering confronting my step-dad and tearing him a new one because, imo, if you're going to spread news THAT serious to someone's kids, you better be damn sure its correct. Should I? If I should, I feel like I would wait a bit because I know mom doesnt want more drama.",09Oct2020,1
534,"Hi everyone, I’ve (25F) been talking to this guy (27M). A point in time last year we had been quite close, we flirted a bit and he had expressed interest in me. I was confused because we were so similar, but I had a boyfriend so we eventually put a stop to it. 

We’re quite similar in terms of our aspirations, career, character, and I guess that’s how we’re drawn to each other. We reconnected a few months back (I was single already), I knew he was seeing a girl that wasn’t very similar to him. They kept arguing and their relationship wasn’t in a good place. Because we’re so drawn to each other I admitted I flirted with him and initiated a lot of conversations. He flirted back and commented that we were more similar than he and his gf, but he wanted to give his gf a chance. He was confused about his current r/s, and would say things to me that were misleading, like how because we both wanted to visit Norway we could go to Norway together if we were single when we’re 35. He ghosted me a few times when his r/s was going well, and when they quarrelled he’d text me again. It went on for a few weeks I guess, the ghosting happened several times. 

After a few weeks they broke up due to their differences. Once they broke up he asked me out, and we had watched several movies virtually, I.e. we press play at the same time, and would just chat via text on the movie. He video called his gf in the past though, when they watched movies together. It seemed like he wanted something more with me once he broke up, and everything was just happening too quickly. I was taken aback. During this time he did mention he was sad about the breakup, and he’d say he’s contemplating if he should ask her to get back together with him. 

Eventually we both stopped talking, and he texted me 3 months later saying he got back together with his gf and he stopped talking to me as a commitment to her. I don’t understand his behaviour - what was I? What was his gf to him? Later on his gf found out exactly what he did, and she was angry. He texted me asking if he had crossed the line, I said he did and that was why I was pressing him to choose but he was kinda insensitive about the fact that he had also hurt me and said things like “what do you mean by choose? I thought it was clear I was attached”, “when did I say we were on off? I only asked you out when I broke up”, and it just confuses me. 

He says he was just attracted to how easily we could understand each other, and that was it. But from the way we texted, understood each other, the way he asked me to watch shows with him, which we both like and his gf doesn’t quite enjoy, I felt like there was something more between us. He’s a sincere guy who doesn’t play around, so he must have liked me right? Was I the one or was it his gf who had been taken for a ride?

Tl;dr guy keeps ghosting and coming back when he fought with his gf, but flirts with me at the same time. I’m not sure what he wanted.",09Oct2020,1
535,"My boyfriend has a terrible habit of putting his foot in it. He has said stuff that really hurts my feelings in the past. He apologsies and compliments me 20× as much as he accidentally insults me. But I'm getting resentful from hearing all this crap and it's either making me insecure or angry with him. He has this weird guilt complex where he just *has to* confess any mean thoughts he has about me or bad things he does. He used to do this to his mom. He will confess stuff like enjoying sexual thoughts about women we know when they're around or how he sometimes wishes he was single so he had more alone time. One time he even chuckled and said ""Oh I remembered masterbating to that picture before we started dating"" (a woman we know, bare in mind). Or that he finds 2 or 3 women in our social circle hotter than me. Or that I'm more cute than sexy. Or that once thought what would've happened if he just waited a few months into college before getting a girlfriend. I know these are normal thoughts but that really hurt and make me angry. I know he's just honest. I tend to focus on these a lot in my head, as opposed to the sweet, loving stuff like kissing me and calling me beautiful after I throw up or spoiling me for my birthday. How do I stop overthinking these things?",09Oct2020,1
536,"Need advice on how to preemptively turn down a job offer and ask about other positions

I’m a full time employee at a state agency. Due to COVID, there are a number of project positions for a brand new program in my agency being hired right now. They already went through a first round of hiring and still need to hire about half the people they want. I am extremely interested in moving into the field that they’re hiring for. I don’t have direct experience in it, but enough in an allied field to qualify. I would absolutely love to have a career in this new field, and a project position would be amazing experience to add to my resume and be able to do so. I’m also getting a bit unhappy in my current position, which is another motivating factor. 

I applied to the listing advertising 2-year project positions and was contacted for an interview on Tuesday and interviewed on Wednesday. At the end of the interview, I was told I was interviewing for a 1-year project job. 

I’m not sure how the interview went because I’m very self critical. Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself, but if they do offer me the job I think I no longer want it purely due to its duration. I would already be taking a huge risk leaving my permanent position for a 2-year project, but having it only be 1 year sounds insane. There’s also the complicating factor that I’m trying to get pregnant. Taking a 4-month maternity leave during a 2-year position sounds okay; but if it’s just a year starting now then I could give birth 9/10/11 months in, take some maternity leave, then my position would end while I’m on leave, and I’d be out of a job/no paid leave. I’m worried that because I applied after the first round of hiring, they may have run out of 2-year positions. 

Should I wait and see if they offer me the job, turn it down, and ask about 2-year positions? Or should I preemptively turn it down today and ask about 2-year positions?",09Oct2020,1
537,"This guy and I have known each other for over 7 years. We’ve been good friends almost the whole time. We have had feelings for each other at multiple different times in the past but haven’t ever really dated because the timing was never right. We have also had fights and cut each other off and stuff for a while but we have eventually always made up and been there for each other. 
The last two years have especially been great between us. We’re in different places in our lives and doing different things but we seem to have a very special bond and it’s hard to fight it. We go to schools on opposite ends of the country but we’re currently home for a few months because of corona. So we started linking up and hanging out recently(once things got better). Sometimes we flirt with each other but I never really thought anything of it until this one night we hooked up at my parents’ house. I snuck him in after midnight and we were just chilling and then he made a move on me. Not gonna lie, it’s something we’ve both wanted to do for a long time so I just went with it. He left soon after because my parents were about to wake up. After that, there was some awkwardness for a while and I guess we were both being distant. He eventually broke the ice and said he wanted to talk. We did end up talking but didn’t exactly define what happened. A few days later, we were just talking late at night and he suddenly called me and told me he liked me and found me extremely attractive. He said he would wanna do it again if I were comfortable with it. The next day we were just driving around and he made coffee from home and brought cute little cups for us to drink it in (almost felt like a date). We ended up making out in his car and idk I felt like there were a few genuinely sweet moments that day. 
We have this chemistry and we can’t keep our hands off each other. But then we also have a deep emotional connection due to our friendship. Sometimes it’s hard to distinguish between that and romantic feelings. He’s definitely one of the most important people in my life and I wouldn’t wanna lose him. He does know me better than most people. Practically, we can’t actually be together in the long run because we don’t fit into each other’s lives and it doesn’t make sense. He even made it clear that he’s not looking for anything serious. But I’m not sure it can be strictly physical either because we’re really close as friends already and he’s usually pretty sweet to me. Sometimes I mistake our friendship for romance. I told him I’m down to keep doing it too but I wanna be careful because I don’t wanna make it weird between us. He reassured me he wants to protect our friendship too but I don’t know why I just feel like I care way more about our friendship than he does. I don’t wanna sound clingy but he seems to be ok with risking whatever we have just for sex. In the end, I feel like i care way too much about him and him feelings and don’t feel the same energy being reciprocated. Which is fine because I don’t expect anything in return when I do nice things for my friends. But with our situation, it’s  complicated because hooking up has sort of created a gray area. I guess we both have our guards up and that’s making it harder for us to connect right now. In general, I’m a pretty sensitive person and get hurt just as easily as I get attached.",09Oct2020,1

540,"Hey everyone,
I’m currently a year 12 student about to sit the hsc (Australian equivalent of final high school examinations). A summary of how it works is you sit school assessments —&gt; get a rank —&gt; rank determines internal mark (50%) —&gt; sit final exams (50%) —&gt; average internal mark and final exam mark and receive a hsc mark which forms an aggregate by adding hsc marks for each subject that determines your rank within the state I.e. 99 means that your aggregate is within the top 1% of the state. All throughout high school and especially during this year, I’ve never really felt like I’ve truly applied myself to studying with purpose. All of my friends and peers seem to be so dedicated and rigorous when it comes to study, but despite me last minuting and cramming for exams and assessments, I’ve still managed to maintain relatively good ranks in my cohort. Despite all of this, I feel hopelessly inadequate - everyone thinks I’m naturally smart or for those who don’t know me as well they think I work myself to the bone to get those marks, but I feel the complete opposite. I feel as though I’m a sort of fraud and got easier markers for those tasks or managed to get by with sheer luck; the final exams begin in 9 days and I feel completely hopeless and underprepared. It’s gotten to the point where I have serious self doubt when I attempt practice questions and can’t do them, because my mind automatically reverts to questioning my own ability and why I’m ranked higher than somebody else who could probably solve it. I’m sorry if this all sounds convoluted and if it’s formatted horribly - it’s 3am over here and this is my first ever post, so I’m completely new to this. Any sort of advice would be appreciated, thank you :)",09Oct2020,1
541," I  (26F) have been sinking more and more into a period of depression  lately and I'm worried how it's affecting my lovely partner. I have no  local support network because I wasn't able to make one as I moved to a  new town for my partner's job right before the quarantine hit. Other  support networks are not robust at all, and I work from home so every  day. I have no friends, no community, no ability to do the things I once  loved, and I feel like I'm drowning. I do have a therapist but  appointments seem few and far between. Antidepressants made me 10000%  worse when I tried them, and I'm gun shy of them now.

The  only person I have to talk to regularly is my partner, and they're  amazing. They genuinely try to listen and support me, but I can tell I'm  draining on them and their support network isn't the best in the first  place. How can I be a better partner while still being depressed? I cry  all the time and try to eat enough and exercise and volunteer in ways I  can but nothing seems to be helping, I'm slipping further, and I'm  worried I'm wearing out their generous support or causing an unhealthy  relationship.

542,"This is a throwaway account and I've never done anything like this before so I apologize if I mess up (pls be kind). My bestfriend (F28) is incredible: she's sweet, intelligent and beautiful. She was in a relationship for 2 years with a man (33). She had never felt sexual chemistry like this before (was not attracted to a previous boyfriend of 6 years). From the get-go their relationship was tumultuous. He would become super absent or not want to talk to her for long stretches of time and I would be there to support her through the ups and downs through around 5 break-ups in the span of 8 months. After a year and a half together and through a lot of times catching him out, she found out he had another girlfriend the entire time he was dating her. He promised this other woman that he would move in with her and be with her forever etc. When he finally got caught my bestfriend told him to get lost (hell yeah). They continued sleeping together and talking about everything. He revealed that my bestfriend's body was not good enough because her boobs were small and that was a huge reason why he had another girlfriend. For the past few months, I have been supporting my friend through the unbelievable heartbreak and betrayal she has experienced and beginning to understand how horrible and manipulative he is. A week ago she contacted me and told me she is going to give up her job and move to a small town with this man to live with him in paradise and have children. I know I sound incredibly selfish when I say that I dont even know how to respond to her. I have been there time and time again to pick her up after he did horrific things to her. I guess the reason I am posting this is that my tether has worn so thin and I want to be the most supportive friend in the world but how do I continue to do that when she has decided to throw away her current life to be with someone like that.

So do you think I should buy everything I need for surviving and go in a shitty little cabin we have in village that my parents go once a year, they hate that place. So my thinking is to buy everything I need for survival, plants, tools and food and just live there for a while unless something changes, btw I'm 18 and if I go don't plan on telling anyone unless my good friend.

545,"So I am trying to help my mom and brother who I adore. Two years ago, my grandmother (who let me start by saying has lived on her own for 50 years and is very selfish) moved in to their house after not being able to afford living on her own anymore. Within a few months, my dad got sick with brain cancer and was in hospice at home for months. My grandmother (mom's mom) made his life a living hell while also upsetting everyone else in the house during the stressful time. My dad passed away and now it's just her, my mom and 21 year old brother in the house. 

She is making their lives miserable- she is mean, says horrible things to them, doesn't clean up after herself because she assumes they will do it for her, doesn't chip in for groceries, lies to my mom all the time, etc. Recently, she has been leaving the gas stove on and not closing the front door all the way so the cat runs outside and it stuck out there until someone comes home. My brother and I would like to put her in a nursing care facility but a) they are so expensive and my mom can't afford it, and b) she made a promise to my dad when they were first married that they would never put their parents in a nursing home so she feels really guilty even thinking about doing that. 

Please, I need some advice on what I can do to try and make their lives easier while living with her because they are at their wits end and my mom keeps saying ""there is nothing I can do"". I am hoping to get some ideas that are outside the box a bit!",09Oct2020,1

552,"So I’ve been in the same band for the past 7-8 years with a group of four friends. We had one person leave, and continued as just the three of us. We are just a regular local weezer-ish nerd band and really didn’t have many fans outside of our friend group.

I’m starting my career in digital marketing and after several months of putting things together, I netted us +2,000 subscribers on YouTube, 30 more monthly Spotify listeners, over 150 more followers, and got us booked a show which we got paid for and I also pay for all of the services we use.

Earlier this year I had talked with them about trying to expand our content on YouTube so that we can get more followers easier. They thought it was a good idea, and have been enthusiastic about starting a music commentary podcast and making other comedy-type videos to make us stand out more. We’ve been doing pretty much that, but like I said, I have been pretty much carrying the weight this entire time

I genuinely try to include them as much as possible, but sometimes I just think of something that I want to make and I just make it/want to share it. I also have group ideas in which I try to get them to do, in which my drummer eventually helps with, but my bassist does literally nothing. He doesn’t really respond to my texts or messages. It takes him weeks to even get around to doing something or being concerned about something. We have a little bit of an audience now, and I want to keep them entertained even though we’re not getting paid for it (yet?)

To be fair my bassist isn’t having the easiest time right now, his sister had to kick him out of her apartment, and he used to work at a grocery store, but recently quit because he had to move in with my drummer. He is now unemployed and sleeping on a couch in the same space we record in. I don’t know what he does with his time, but from what I understand all he does is smoke pot, watch YouTube videos, and play the Switch. He hasn’t really contributed anything creatively at all besides an edited photo here and there or a small acoustic idea.

I had created a silly less than a minute video montage of Trump’s coronavirus fiasco behind circus music as a joke. I am usually as transparent as possible with them and I sent them the google drive link to the video before I uploaded it and basically asked for their permission. I had said that I was just going to post it to our stories. They said they thought it was cool and my bassist recommended a title that I liked and even used his title. Also turns out you can’t make video stories without posting it also, so I just posted it. I also uploaded it to our YouTube.

It got pretty got analytics/stats in its first 24 hours, a record high in terms of engagements for new videos on our channel. It was funny and people liked it. I liked it. It didn’t take me super long, but I appreciate the creative process and sharing it with people who enjoy it.

The next day, he deleted it. It’s one thing to set it to private or something, but he straight up removed it forever. I went over to my drummer’s to go practice, not knowing this, and there he sat me down and told me he had woke up that morning (at 1pm), got mad, and deleted it, and that he was sorry. I asked him why it made him angry, and he said he fears our channel becoming too political and not enough about the music, and that I was not transparent enough with them about posting it. He only wanted it up for 24 hours and not forever, because we already have a remix up of Ben Shapiro’s WAP. My drummer had no problem with it whatsoever. I mean, we have plenty of other videos that are completely unrelated to politics.

I admit I tend to be political, but not entirely political, I’m just active in the world and keep up on things. Especially in 2020, pretty much everything is political, and it’s hard not to be. I understand what he means and where he’s coming from, but god it’s not like I’m asking anyone to listen to my opinion on abortion and GPD deficits, I’m making fun of a very hypocritical and hilarious course of events happening right now in regards to a global pandemic in the middle of an election season. It’s also not the only thing I make. Sometimes I make song mashups and other funny related things.

Funny, because the one and only time HE made a video and posted a mashup he made (after I encouraged him to do so multiple times) all I did was glorify it, tell him how good it was, and share it as much as possible. I never deleted anything he posted or tried to stop him from doing anything.

My idea for this is the entire time has been for all of us collectively to create, put ideas together, and share them, whether they be our own or individual. The channel would be a compilation of all of our creations. I don’t want to be limited to just music, or just politics, or anything specific. I just want to be a band that also makes vlogs/podcasts/funny videos on the side. The whole point is to be lighthearted and not care what anyone else thinks. My bassist seems to care only about what people think of our channel while also not really doing much at the same time. I know my bassist is having a hard time right now, because I’ve been exactly in his position before. I feel sorry for him, but I got really angry and frustrated with him after he deleted that stupid video. I would just let him self-destruct on his own because frankly this band is the only thing I have (and the only friends I have right now) and losing this part of my life feels really existential",09Oct2020,1
553,"Hello there!

Basically title but I'd like to elaborate a bit:

I'm not really interested in which one's better because that's like saying green apples or red apples - some prefers one while others, well, the other.

I'm more interested in which one's worth it money/game wise. Which one's more durable and needs less changing for games coming up. I mean, if a PS5 costs me 1000$ worth of money (I'm hungarian so we don't have dollars, no idea about the real cost!) and and the newest Xbox costs me 500$ but if I need to change xboxes every year or so while can use that PS for 10 years I'd rather pay more once than half the amount 5x in the same duration (+ games). I'm very careful what I pay for because I don't like spending money for something I will not be able to change constantly or I'd not be able to enjoy.

As for the games - I prefer basically everything besides sports or racing so I'd like to know which platform has more options for these. If Xbox is more for Fifa or racers, I'm not sure I want to buy an Xbox. I can check these but I have no experience with these kind of things so I'd be happier if someone who's knowledgable could tell me. :)",09Oct2020,1
554,"I'm 16F, they're hardly my roommates (twins 18F), but we share the second level in the house their dad has. My mom and their dad have been together for about 3 years now. We merged households (we came into their home) in late July of this year.

L and C have been causing problems since we first moved in. I get they feel we're intruding and all, but they honestly did this—us moving into themselves. They were asked multiple times if they were okay with us moving in, if x, y, and z changes were made, and they obviously know their dad would have called off our merging if they asked specifically because they run to him and complain about anything and everything and rely on him to fix it.

L, in particular, has been a real issue. She hasn't been working since we moved in, and that could be part of the reason she finds anything and everything to complain about (usually when it's about me). Anyway, they have been deliberately antagonizing me by complaining I walk too loudly up the stairs then stomping up them louder than they normally do (in all reality, they are the loudest on the stairs, but I grew up surrounded by boys who were always twice my weight, so I guess I'm used to it). They laugh when they get to the top and take pauses in between steps that clues me into the fact that they're making themselves loud on purpose.

That's only one of the things they've done, not including the constant complaining they do to their father. They are full of double standards, and I've had to change at least 5 things about my daily life since we moved in to please them.

What can I do to get back at them? Preferably something they wouldn't be able to pinpoint on me (we have a combined total of 5 cats, if that helps).",09Oct2020,1

They are toxic and he was as my brother says he was “sizing me up” he threatened me with “oh I’m in the military and I have been in special task forces that you need nsa clearance to even know about” trying to scare me into telling her to move out. I’m going to back my girlfriend on whatever she wants right? If she wants to go home I will back her and if she wants to stay here that’s also okay. I’m here to support her, not to harm her. And he sent police to my place last night to do a welfare check on her and was like “I’m gonna get my daughter “ she’s an adult but she’s also his daughter and I understand that. But the whole threatening thing shouldn’t be necessary especially when it feels like it’s directed at me. I get that she didn’t end on good terms and she wasn’t trying to burn bridges and I have been very compliant. I just have no idea what to do considering they’re trying to scare me into leaving her high and dry.",09Oct2020,1
557,"Because of all this covid situation, I lost my job and I started tutoring again. One of my students is a 15 year old girl. I've been teaching math and physics to her for 5 month and she is showing a lot of signs that she has a crush on me. She is trying to behave flirty, always smiling, making long eye contacts. She is putting more make up, wearing nice dresses, heels and even some jewelry to our classes, even though in beginning she was like any other regular street girl. She is randomly touching me and complimenting me a lot, starting with complimenting my face/eyes/fingers/hair and ending with things like I'm the best teacher she ever had, I'm the only teacher she enjoy studying physics with and etc. She is doing a good job randomly poking it in between conversation and not making it awkward. Sometime ago she added me facebook, and started sending me random messages. Nothing inappropriate really, but I stopped replying after like a week. I told her, it's inappropriate for us to chat on facebook. She used to send me messages by phone, to which I also stopped replying. She is bringing all sorts of cakes she cooks. I told her that we can't eat during our classes, so now she is saying that her mom cooked and sent it for me. If I take a bite and say I like it, she becomes visibly happy and proud, so again, I stopped even tasting. I just take it and say I will eat at home. She never allows me to finish classes earlier and almost everyday asks to study little more or solve one more problem.  

We study at a library, which is ten minutes walking distance from her house. One day it was raining and when she we was coming up stairs, she slipped, fell down and hurt her toe. It was quite bad, it was bleeding. But she absolutely refused to go home and insisted on having our class, where she looked as cheerful as always. One time I gave her my jacket, because it was cold in the library. She spend most of the class tucking her face in the collar, rubbing her face on it and sniffing it... Recently she said, she wants to study coding with me too. I remembered that actually we started just studying math, and after a month or so, she decided she wants to study physics too. This time, I told her I don't have time to teach coding. I'm teaching 2 hours, 5 times a week already. 

There are countless other examples. She is actually showing very high social intelligence and manages to not make it too awkward or obvious. She says things like this year she learned to dream, she matured up, she wishes she could push time... And just in general she is being very open, honest and sincere with me. 

When it comes to our studies she is killing it. When I was in university I used to tutor kids for universities and International Olympiads. She definitely has enough talent and drive to get into our national team in both math and physics. She was not very good in beginning, but now we are solving problems way beyond school level, I give tons of homework and she is putting a lot of effort to solve it all. Often I give her very tough problems, even by university standards, and she shows a lot of resilience in trying to solve them. In most cases she either solves it or manages to solve it with few hints. When I recommend something she does it as soon as humanly possible. She is one of the best students I ever had. 

I'm doing my best to behave perfectly civil through all of this. With that being said, I'm becoming uneasy with this whole situation. At one hand, she is learning a lot, I'm earning money and there is nothing inappropriate happened so far. But her sympathy is obvious too and I don't know if I should stop our classes. If I continue tutoring her, how should I behave? Or what are my other options?",09Oct2020,1
558,"Should I drop a course

In the beginning of the semester I enrolled in a computer science class to see if I would like it. Throughout the past 8 weeks I’ve hated it more and more. I do not understand the concept 70% of the time and it does not intrigue me whatsoever. Yesterday I spent about 3 hours with my TA (teaching assistant) doing a lab which I absolutely hate. The course had literally devoured my life. I hate it. I have a 97% in the class but that’s simply because I cheat on the quizzes and my friends or TAs help me through the Labs. This week they gave us a s**t ton of hw for the course and I’m contemplating dropping it because I literally do not understand it. I’ve been cheating the whole time so I was eventually going to face reality. I’m also a straight A student so I do even more work to make sure I understand at least some material. I want to clarify that I do all the hw and assignments, I simply just use chegg sometimes on the quizzes. Idk if I’m just simply overwhelmed this week because of the assignments and should power through or drop the course. One week I like the course and the next week it’s giving me depression. I knew I wouldn’t be able to sleep because my brains keeps thinking about how much work I have for the class. I hate this class so much and I’m scared that it’s only going to get harder and I won’t receive at least a portion of my money if I drop out. I’ve been able to ride my way for the past 8 weeks but idk if I’ll be able to do this for the last 7. Maybe I’m just stressed. What do y’all think???",09Oct2020,1

560,"I was telling my mom about my future plans for college. I mentioned that there are no classes I can take in the winter term. Either I've already taken them, they are closed to the major, a 400+ level class or, a graduate program class I don't qualify for.

She then interrupted me and told me I should get dual credit at a different college. I thought this was a bad idea as I --.... However, she wouldn't let me explain this. She cut me off again. She started to get upset and angry with me because I wouldn't take a dual credit class else were. So I let her talk a little more and then started questioning her ideas. After some time she stopped telling me what to do and said, ""If you think it's a bad idea to take a winter term class then, what do you think you should do?"" To which I replied, ""Well, I was going to say I'll just take 2 class in the spring term and everything should be fine.""

Then I followed it up by telling her if she hadn't cut me off--... She got really angry at this. She told me no one likes to be criticized. That I should just learn to work with her personality. That by telling her she cut me off I was being rude. I ***tried to tell*** her I was only saying something because she was putting me down for not wanting to take a winter class but, she cut me off. She told me, ""Don't do that! Don't treat me like a child!""

My mother has been like this for as long as I can remember. She hates being told she did anything wrong and will throw a fit if you bring up issues.

So was I wrong to say something or is she right to be upset?",09Oct2020,1
562,"I had been with him for going on 7 years. We both worked full time and got the same days off so we had 2 days to spend time together. For the past year and a half he has switched his days off so he could be a part of some band with his buddies and do gigs. I didnt like that we literally never saw eachother but he was happy with this arrangement and I honestly thought that he wouldnt stick with it, as he generally never sticks to anything.

Within the past 2 months I noticed him being really weird when he was home. He was always on his phone and never paid any attention to me. If I said anything to him, he would have me repeat myself several times because he wouldnt put his phone down for two seconds to actually hear me. There was no intimacy anymore. It was just plain and it was more like a live in roommate situation. 

So I brought it up to him last month and I thought things were going to go back to normal. He stopped with being on the phone 24/7. The intimacy started to return. He started helping me cook dinner everynight started telling me loved me again, etc. He then invited me to his gig 2 weekends ago. This is the first time he invited me. So, I went. 

Well, this is when I left him. I didnt make a scene but I did pull him aside and said ""Well, this proves to me that there is no hope for us so I will pack my belongings and move by next weekend."" I went home, he stayed. Now.. the reason I left him was because there was a girl there. His guitarists girlfriend. As soon as she saw my boyfriend she ran up and jumped into his arms, flinging her arms around his neck and her legs being around his hips. He caught her and was full on grabbing her ass to hold her up. She said ""I missed you at practice last week! Where were you?"" He set her down and put his arm around me and said ""Oh just with the missus."" She took one look at me, said ""Oh"", rolled her eyes and walked off.

I asked him what the fuck that was about and why they had more intimacy than I have received in well over a year. He said ""Shes just extremely affectionate. Shes like that with everyone. See?"" And then pointed at her, where she was doing the same thing with yet another guy in the band. He brushed it off like this was completely okay. Like him grabbing her ass and her straddling his cock was perfectly normal. So, I left. I didnt give him a chance to explain further because I already saw enough and knew I didnt want to be that girl who always has to wonder if there is more going on. 

But now I have been getting phone calls. People are telling me that he left the band. He hasnt gone to any of their practices and he is completely distraught over losing me when he had done ""nothing wrong"". I'm being told that I should have heard him out and that an over affectionate female is now reason to leave a long term relationship. But in my eyes, with this over affectionate woman constantly being present with the band, that means that he has disrespected me on many more occasions than the one that I had witnessed. 

Was I wrong?",09Oct2020,1
563,"Ok so I’ve been talking to this girl right, and it’s been a looooong time coming. She is very confusing, we’ve been talking for about 2 months now and I’ve admitted I liked her and she says she likes me too (well kind of said it, she’s embarrassed to say stuff like that so she beat around the bush but i know what she meant) but she is scared to make any further engagements. So this weekend the plan was for me to take her out, not a date but to hangout and get to know each other. Well her friend is coming down from college this weekend, so she canceled on me to go to his bonfire. Now this guy tried to kiss her a few weeks back and constantly flirts with her, over text and everything. So basically what I’m getting at is she canceled our plans to go over there, which I got an invite but still. She said she felt bad about it and all, but I think she knows I’m not going to go. Cause that dudes best friend is actually a guy who did me wrong a couple months back, so now we don’t talk. And she hangs with them all the time. Is this a red flag? Or is it normal for her to want to go see him? Idk man",09Oct2020,1
564,"Okay so, this is a quite long post to fully understand my situation.

10 months ago my girlfriend got asked by one of her friends to go with her at a party so she will not be alone there (smart move). They both got there, I knew about it and allowed it because I trusted her. They both drank and my girlfriend went to bed to sleep. 

A guy there tried to rape a girl, she was not so wasted, and she immediately left without telling anyone about the incident. My girlfriend was trying to sleep so the guy went to her and tried too (he did not succeed as she was a virgin months later when we first did it). She immediately pushed him off, and when the other boys came they beat the rapist really bad(I have evidence, I know it happened). The day after we met and she told me. However I am quite a toxic person and I didn't believe her at first, and I had problems with it for a very long time. She promised me she would never drink to that extend or even go in things like that ever again so I decided to forgive her because I really love this girl. 

Today she wanted to tell me something, she started crying and it took about 2 hours for her to write me a message. 

Apparently at the beginning of summer she went with her sister, a few relatives and 2 family friends at a game of monopoly at their place, and had a little bit of beer (I know this happened because she was talking to me at the moment on phone). One of the guy apparently got drunk, tried to kiss her but she pushed him away without kissing him, then she ran away from the place to her home in the middle of the night. She didn't tell me for 4 months because she was afraid I would leave her. Today she told me, and I got so bad that I literally pulled half of the hair on my scalp with my bare hands. I started crying and when I told her she did the same thing. I really love this girl and I am here to ask if I should forgive her (being a 2nd time) and appreciate that she is sincere (and believe me, no one would rip their hair off with bare hands if not so). The thing is, I am quite toxic and I know it very well. It will take a long time for me to trust her again, even with a small incident like this. I might be immature, so I came here.",09Oct2020,1
565,"So I’ve been in the same band for the past 7-8 years with a group of four friends. We had one person leave, and continued as just the three of us. We are just a regular local weezer-ish nerd band and really didn’t have many fans outside of our friend group.

I’m starting my career in digital marketing and after several months of putting things together, I netted us +2,000 subscribers on YouTube, 30 more monthly Spotify listeners, over 150 more followers, and got us booked a show which we got paid for and I also pay for all of the services we use.

Earlier this year I had talked with them about trying to expand our content on YouTube so that we can get more followers easier. They thought it was a good idea, and have been enthusiastic about starting a music commentary podcast and making other comedy-type videos to make us stand out more. We’ve been doing pretty much that, but like I said, I have been pretty much carrying the weight this entire time

I genuinely try to include them as much as possible, but sometimes I just think of something that I want to make and I just make it/want to share it. I also have group ideas in which I try to get them to do, in which my drummer eventually helps with, but my bassist does literally nothing. He doesn’t really respond to my texts or messages. It takes him weeks to even get around to doing something or being concerned about something. We have a little bit of an audience now, and I want to keep them entertained even though we’re not getting paid for it (yet?)

To be fair my bassist isn’t having the easiest time right now, his sister had to kick him out of her apartment, and he used to work at a grocery store, but recently quit because he had to move in with my drummer. He is now unemployed and sleeping on a couch in the same space we record in. I don’t know what he does with his time, but from what I understand all he does is smoke pot, watch YouTube videos, and play the Switch. He hasn’t really contributed anything creatively at all besides an edited photo here and there or a small acoustic idea.

I had created a silly less than a minute video montage of Trump’s coronavirus fiasco behind circus music as a joke. I am usually as transparent as possible with them and I sent them the google drive link to the video before I uploaded it and basically asked for their permission. I had said that I was just going to post it to our stories. They said they thought it was cool and my bassist recommended a title that I liked and even used his title. Also turns out you can’t make video stories without posting it also, so I just posted it. I also uploaded it to our YouTube.

It got pretty got analytics/stats in its first 24 hours, a record high in terms of engagements for new videos on our channel. It was funny and people liked it. I liked it. It didn’t take me super long, but I appreciate the creative process and sharing it with people who enjoy it.

The next day, he deleted it. It’s one thing to set it to private or something, but he straight up removed it forever. I went over to my drummer’s to go practice, not knowing this, and there he sat me down and told me he had woke up that morning (at 1pm), got mad, and deleted it, and that he was sorry. I asked him why it made him angry, and he said he fears our channel becoming too political and not enough about the music, and that I was not transparent enough with them about posting it. He only wanted it up for 24 hours and not forever, because we already have a remix up of Ben Shapiro’s WAP. My drummer had no problem with it whatsoever. I mean, we have plenty of other videos that are completely unrelated to politics.

I admit I tend to be political, but not entirely political, I’m just active in the world and keep up on things. Especially in 2020, pretty much everything is political, and it’s hard not to be. I understand what he means and where he’s coming from, but god it’s not like I’m asking anyone to listen to my opinion on abortion and GPD deficits, I’m making fun of a very hypocritical and hilarious course of events happening right now in regards to a global pandemic in the middle of an election season. It’s also not the only thing I make. Sometimes I make song mashups and other funny related things.

Funny, because the one and only time HE made a video and posted a mashup he made (after I encouraged him to do so multiple times) all I did was glorify it, tell him how good it was, and share it as much as possible. I never deleted anything he posted or tried to stop him from doing anything.

My idea for this is the entire time has been for all of us collectively to create, put ideas together, and share them, whether they be our own or individual. The channel would be a compilation of all of our creations. I don’t want to be limited to just music, or just politics, or anything specific. I just want to be a band that also makes vlogs/podcasts/funny videos on the side. The whole point is to be lighthearted and not care what anyone else thinks. My bassist seems to care only about what people think of our channel while also not really doing much at the same time. I know my bassist is having a hard time right now, because I’ve been exactly in his position before. I feel sorry for him, but I got really angry and frustrated with him after he deleted that stupid video. I would just let him self-destruct on his own because frankly this band is the only thing I have (and the only friends I have right now) and losing this part of my life feels really existential",09Oct2020,1

I'm 15 and doing my GCSEs in May, and will definitely do a-levels for the 2 years after that so will need a quiet space. I only have a few spaces I can do so though:

Dining room: Cold most of the time because my mum opens the back door to let steam and moisture out and get fresh air after cooking, plus the TV is usually on in there most of the time and while I can't see it because of where I sit, my little sisters are very noisy and never reduce the volume.

Living room: Usually fine but nowadays my dad always comes in and starts watching football in the evening (from around 6-10pm, I sleep at about 10) which is very distracting for me, because then I can't focus on my work. Dad won't watch football in dining room because I asked him about it and he said he prefers sitting in living room because it's usually warmer.

My room: Very small; my single bed and wardrobe take up over 70% of floor space.

All other rooms are off limits for me to study. All of my friends live at least 2.5 miles away and my parents wouldn't let me go to theirs to study anyway. Libraries are closed due to covid.

I never had anyone to really talk to about my problems because of my parents (Who are mentally abusive and occasionally physical) he was there. Okay? Okay.

But, you see, I wanna do something just out of the blue for him. I cannot just show up to his home, as my parents, along with being a major source of my anxiety, they are very over protective and very very strict. I can't even have my door close. Also...they don't know I have a boyfriend, and I know full well that's stupid too! And...this is a post I'm working on, but I wanna tell them so badly, I'm just scared I'll end up being more a prisoner than I already am. My boyfriend is aware that my parents don't know, and he knows what they'd do if they found out. So \*yay\*... but not the point of this post.

Quick things to consider- I won't sneak out, thought about it and realized it was stupid, I cannot text my bf as my parents don't even like him being my friend (Will explain more if someone asks), I don't have a job or money (Planning on selling some old clothes and other items to get some cause almost everything costs money now a days.)

Yesterday. I justified it by telling myself “I have the day off, I’m doing everything I’m supposed to be doing, why not have a few drinks and watch Thursday night football”. 

The thing is no one should ever drink 1200 ML of hard liquor. But my fiancé doesn’t really notice how much damage I’m doing to myself because like I said, I rarely drink and I hide how much I’m drinking. 

Idk, I woke up at about 6am and have vomited nonstop all day. I guess I just want advice as to how I should handle this. I don’t think I am like an alcoholic it’s just I don’t know when to stop. I’m thinking maybe I should not drink at all. Any advice or support would be great.",09Oct2020,1
583,"My reputation was ruined during my undergrad years. The rumor itself implicated me but i do not think I was ever fully confirmed to be the person in question.

But people did start to treat me differently. People I didn't know would follow me and record me. Entire friendships and connections I had were severed all in time for graduation. 
Those who did stalk me and record me seemed to get in trouble, at least I think they did. 
The person who began spreading these rumors began avoiding me near the end of my undergrad. I think they were also getting in to some kind of trouble. 

I'm aware of what the rumor is, i just have no idea of knowing if I was ever fully blamed or if I was vindicated (since people began to leave me alone).

I have no idea what to do and I'm genuinely scared this will follow my career well into the future. People for sure began to treat me differently and even rudely because of the rumor. I am traumatized from seeing my friends devolve into enemies in such a short span of time. I can't trust anyone nowadays and I'm too scared to start my career. 
People from different majors and years even harassed me so I can only assume the rumor was widespread at my university. 

So my question is, how likely is it that a ruined reputation from undergrad follow you into your professional life?",09Oct2020,1
584,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for nearly five months now and she’s been the absolute best. Before I met her, I was in a bad state of mind and she practically saved me. She tells me I did the same for her. We are very close and it feels like we’ve been together for a long time. Now the issues begin with her lying. My friend had told me that she was in an emotionally abusive relationship before me and that it was really bad. There were so many things he did to her which I hate him for. Anyways, my friend told me that he convinced her to have sex with him despite her not wanting to and only did it to satisfy him. She told me that she was a virgin when we first started dating. Another incident is that she cheated on that abusive boyfriend with another guy for a bit which I was completely surprised about because she would go on and on about how she hates cheaters and how they deserve the worst. I tried to subtly show her that hey, Is that really true but she always lies and creates whole stories to cover up the the truth. I don’t know what I’ve done to make her feel like I won’t comfort her and give her the best support but she won’t tell me and continues to lie a lot. It’s not the fact that she was with other guys before, but that she keeps lying to me. I wish she were more honest to me. I’ve only shown her that I’ll protect and love her no matter what. I feel as if I’ve developed trust issues with her because she is really good at lying and I don’t know what else she could telling me that isn’t true.",09Oct2020,1

My plan is it send a condolences gift to her house and see if there’s any kind of reaction from her parents or she’s going to cave in and tell me the truth if she’s lying. The only reason why I’m doing this is because she has lied to me many many times before in the past  and I’m pretty sure the same aunt had died twice now.

595,"I broke up with my ex a few months ago. We’ve stayed friends and I have a month to decide if I want to get back together and have a life with him. He wants to move out of the city and wants me to come with him. 

I’m going to explain pros and cons.

Pros: he is one of my best friends. He understands my mental illness, (which is pretty bad) and it is difficult for me to work. He’s willing to move wherever with me, financially support me, emotionally support me. He truly understand me, and our relationship is healthy. I enjoy my time with him. 

Cons: I am not attracted to him physically in the slightest. We have good sex, but tbh I try to avoid looking at him bc he’s so not my type to the extreme. I’m not proud of him, I realize I don’t want to introduce him to ppl bc of this and I feel terrible about it. He also has a very high pitched voice that at times irritates me so much at times. 

He’s the most amazing person ever, and a part of me thinks he deserves to be with someone who DOES find him attractive, and who doesn’t get annoyed by him like I do at times. He’s willing to do so much to be with me. He’s so kind, and I am good to him as well, honestly. He doesn’t know these cons I’ve listed. 

I don’t know if attraction should be a deal breaker? I don’t want to be a bad person and waste his time, or make a mistake. He’s told me I have until Nov to decide. 

Please give advise, thank you so much!",09Oct2020,1
597,"My friend is a pathological liar. I don’t mean “he’ll tell white lies every other day”, I mean it in the truest sense of the word. He tends to go off on long rambling stories that are clearly untrue, but with the expectation that they ought to be taken seriously. He’ll say that “I was walking home the other day and a group of homophobes pulled out a gun and shot at me in the middle of a busy street”, or that he’s had a million near-death experiences, each one more dramatic and less likely than the last. I’m a very believing and trusting person by nature, so while at first I believed him and humored him, as they became more and more ridiculous I stopped interacting with these stories. 

But the situation is more complicated. This friend has really low self-esteem. Like, dangerously low. He belittles himself without failure in every conversation. (It’s... sort of annoying at times. You’ll tell him you like his outfit, and he’ll say “No, my outfits are *terrible, your* outfits are amazing, and if I were you I wouldn’t even be seen in public with me.” He does this with everything.) In the little over a year that I’ve known him, I know that he’s had one suicide attempt. I really worry about his mental health and well being. He’s very clearly someone who thrives only from the attention other people give him (hence, I think at least, the constant lying and compliment seeking). 

As I said, I’m naturally a very trusting person. I tend to think the best in people, but not all of my friends are like that. I have one who believes that he’s some kind of manipulator, trying to make us feel too bad to call him out. (I doubt this is the case, but I understand where they’re coming from). The lies are too much to handle sometimes, though. The constant self-hatred is exhausting to be around. I understand having low confidence, I have my own vast history of bad mental health issues, but he can hardly go a conversation with me or anyone else without talking about how much better everyone else is when compared to him. It’s difficult to be around.

I want to talk to him about it.  Want to tell him that he can’t lie and that we can tell what he’s saying isn’t true. I worry, however, that this could have adverse effects on his mental health. He’s very clearly unwell, and while we’ve all suggest he go to the campus therapist, he hasn’t. At times, the things he does affect me negatively. There was a time where he asked everyone at dinner one by one whether or not we trust him not to hurt himself. I was going through my own really bad mental health issues at the time, and that interaction made me want to puke. I dwelled on it for weeks. He keeps doing stuff like this. I *want* to tell him that he can’t keep doing it. I’m not aggressive, but I wonder if a kind of “tough love’ approach, where I just tell him that he needs to fix this behavior if he wants to keep our friendship, will help. I worry, however, that it could drive him to do something we’ll both regret.

Basically: would I be in the right if I called him out? Or would I just be insensitive?",09Oct2020,1
598,"My boyfriend (26M) and I (26 F) have been dating for 6 months. He is kind, intelligent, and overall a good man. Recently, however, major issues have arisen.

These past few months my boyfriend has been struggling with the social isolation of the pandemic. Although he has me, I'm not around every day (we are in a long-distance relationship, he lives in Atlanta and I live in Nashville) and when I am not around and he is by himself he struggles with depression and anxiety. I've told him he should go to counseling but he refuses to go. He says that a psychiatrist is enough and that he does not need counseling.

This past week, his mental health has become much worse and I believe either on the verge of or currently suffering a mental breakdown. He has taken a sick day every day this week and has told me that he is considering leaving his job and taking an un-paid leave, possibly for as much as a year. He told me his symptoms are paranoia, anxiety, and depression, and that the psychiatrist recently put him on an anti-psychotic.

I love my boyfriend dearly, and I have done what I can to help him. Emotionally I have been present for him to both listen and help him come up with effective ways to handle his mental illness. I also have depression so I totally understand how difficult it can be. I take medication and go to counseling when needed. In no way do I judge him for having a mental illness as I think everyone has something (myself included) but I am frustrated that he is not seeking out enough forms of treatment such as therapy and that he is socially isolating instead of reaching out to those around him.

His behavior has been self-destructive and he has not sought help outside of medication. Around a month ago he went out to the bar with his friends and binged drank to the point of vomiting (probably had around 20-30 drinks); he takes medication daily so the combination of the alcohol and this medication could have killed him.

I don't know what to do. He refuses to go to counseling. Even though he has friends and could reach out more socially, he is not doing anything to solve his social isolation. I am there for him as much as I can be, but I am only one person.

My other concern is that he may be unfaithful. Sometimes he will text me and say ""How are those legs?"" (He loves my legs, it's obviously meant as a flirtatious comment). The other day he texted me ""How're those eyelashes?"" completely out of the blue. He has never before complemented my eyelashes and frankly, they are not one of my best features since they are short and blonde. My suspicion is that he meant to text that to another girl. ALSO, he typically sends good morning and good night texts every single day without fault, but for a week straight he has not sent a good morning or good night message. He has also been texting me less, been rude/more distant, and combined with his recent erratic behavior this has made me suspicious.

My question for you all is: What should I do? Should I give him an ultimatum and tell him that he has to go to a counselor? Should I ask him if he is talking to other girls? Are my concerns unfounded? Thank you for any help you can give.

TL DR: Boyfriend is having (or on the verge of) a mental breakdown, on the verge of leaving his job refuses to go to a counselor, and I am worried he is cheating on me due to his recent distancing from me, rude comments, flirtatious text that didn't seem intended for me, and has suddenly stopped texting me good morning and goodnight which he has done for 6 months straight since we started dating. Should I give him an ultimatum to see a counselor and to reach out for help? Should I ask him if he is cheating?",09Oct2020,1

602,"I am a student studying biology at a university. I joined a lab in the summer of 2019 and stayed in the lab throughout the academic year. Towards the end of the fall semester I felt overwhelmed by all the classes that I was taking plus the lab. I was also feeling this unfounded fear toward my lab professor and a lot of anxiety whenever I had a lab meeting or had to work with the people in my research group. I made the decision to leave 1 month before the semester ended. This semester (fall 2020) I was taking less credits so I decided to rejoin the lab, I was put on a project alone and I thought it would be fine but the feeling of anxiety and fear are back. And this Thursday I submitted an assignment to my lab professor and she sent an email saying she wanted to talk and she felt like I was not commiting the right amount of time to the lab as I should. And now I am freaking out and I just want to leave the lab again. I am constantly overthinking, and I'm always scarred that she's gonna realize am not as smart at the other people in the lab and she made a mistake taking me in and she'll kick me out. Its a huge weight on my mental health. However I don't t know if leaving might just be me running way from my problems? Am also a pre med student so I'm counting on a recommendation letter from her, but I can get a committee one instead.

He gets fat really easily, and he snores really loud at night. We've tried therapy, acupuncture, and medication on him, but nothing seems to work. He walks the house wearing the same stinky T-shirt every day, and it has holes on the back. His face looks scary, and he looks like a creepy idiot when he walks, mostly because his legs and belly jiggle uncontrollably. When he does anything, he bites his lips and makes gross sounds, and he also has his hands in fists for no reason. He always looks like he's going to punch someone. He farts and burps when he's around others, and his farts and burps smell really bad as well. He has really long, unshaved armpit hair, and I can't imagine how he doesn't itch because of this. He eats with his bare hands, and he touches papers after he eats, without even washing his hands. His underwear are all dirty, with brown and yellow stains, and his toothbrush smells stinky as well.

He is extremely rude. He constantly stalks people on Facebook and Instagram, and comments inappropriately on their posts. He also asks little kids at church what they want to be when they grow up, and he yells at people in public. When he's around other people, he always brags about his stupid career as a mechanical engineer. He makes less that $40,000 a year, and he seriously needs to make more money. My mom makes more than 3 times as much money as him each year, and she should divorce him. My dad spends most of his money on snacks and video games and beverages. He plays video games all day long during the weekends, and he burps and farts really loudly and abruptly. He is just plain ol' rude for no reason. He eats a ton of snacks, and he always has massive, explosive diarrhea. 

My mom has told my dad that he needs to exercise. He is 5'9 but weighs almost 300 pounds. When he does exercise after a two-hour fight with my mom, he just takes his snacks and drinks and phone on to the trampoline in the backyard. He jumps on there for like 5 seconds, and then he drinks some soda and eats some snacks, and watches some Youtube videos. He then hops around for another 5 seconds, and indulges in snacks again.

This girl is actually the sister of my sister's boyfriend, she's really pretty, she's quite introverted and has the most amazing personality. She's kind, she's sweet and she's so joyful all the time. However she is 4 years older than me, not that this would prevent us from being friends, but it will prevent us from being something more.

615,"I was contemplating posting this in the reddit for my branch, but I fear they might be assholes to me for expressing these thoughts. This is gonna be a long one.

There are very few females in my branch, and so I feel like I constantly have to hold myself to really high standards so that the males don’t think sexist things whenever I mess up or get emotional. And that’s been really, really difficult lately because I am 7 weeks pregnant. I feel like I complain a lot more than other people, but that’s because our chain of command doesn’t seem like they care about us at all. They hardly do anything to prevent us spreading the coronavirus amongst ourselves; half of my command doesn’t even believe it exists, despite 5 cases in our unit, all of which resulted in hospitalization.

At the beginning of this week, I get a text saying that I’d been picked for a drill that’s a week earlier than they told us last month, twice as long, and starting on a Thursday. This is really hard on me because I’m in college, I work a side job, I take care of a household, and I’ve been going to a ton of doctors appointments lately. I have to plan way far in advance every month. I asked what we were doing because I have medical limitations, and my sergeant said we’re going to the range. I told him I can’t go to the range (because of the risk of lead exposure, which is a risk factor for birth defects and miscarriage), but he didn’t switch me back to the normal drill, saying he’d keep me off the range. Well, we get to the installation we’re drilling at, and he has us set up our equipment literally right on the edge of the range. He said they wanted all of our stuff set up in one area, but I don’t think that’s true because the rest of the company spread out along nearby, inactive ranges. I’ve been sitting out of range of the gun smoke as best I can, off by myself, bored out of my mind, and looking extremely lazy having nothing safe to do. 

On top of that, yesterday they didn’t feed anybody all day. The bus stopped at a Burger King, but they made everybody buy their own food, even though they already dock our pay for the shitty meals (usually MREs; never anything actually healthy or nutritious) that they’re supposed to provide us. They didn’t plan anything or pass out food that evening for dinner, either. Upon arrival, I noticed that they hadn’t arranged for a potable water source to be on site; it took them a whole day to track down some water jugs and somewhere to fill them up, miles away. 

We were at the range until nightfall, and it got really, really cold. It kept seeming like we were gonna leave soon, so I didn’t want to upend my whole pack to find my warming layers and be scrambling to pack up when others were waiting on me, so I just didn’t put them on. I was told to put my things on a truck that was headed to a hotel (because they don’t have female barracks here, apparently), but the driver decided to take an officer back to the barracks first, and they said they would come back for me. Almost everybody left to go back to the barracks, except for people in my MOS, who had to wake up at 3:30 in the AM to make everybody breakfast. I figured I could wait 10 more minutes, NBD. Well, I waited 20 minutes, and then I started getting nervous. So I complained to my Sgt, who brushed me off, and then after 35 minutes have gone by since the truck left, I started having sort of a breakdown. I tried to hold back my tears, but it’s hard when you’re hormonal to control your emotions. I complained to a gunnery sergeant nearby until he finally called the truck driver to come get the ones he left behind, “at least the pregnant one.” (Once I finally got in, dealt with my overwheming nausea from not eating for most of the day, I tried to go to bed, but I slept poorly because I was then constipated and having stomach pains from not having water all day either.)

It was so embarrassing, and this isn’t the first time I seemed to complain and not handle things as well as the others. I’ve gotten emotional over things like people refusing not to smoke near me, or our COC keeping us up way later than necessary for stupid shit and then having to get up early to cook still. I honestly think that’s the one thing that’s holding me back from being promoted to a corporal (That, and my MOS has been closed for months now.) I keep thinking that this stress isn’t good for me or my fetus, and that maybe I’m not cut out for this. Nobody else seems to be outraged, they just take it. I could get a medical separation if I wanted, because of the pregnancy. 

On the other hand, there are lots of benefits to being in, like being able to get a job easily and getting cheap insurance and a couple hundred dollars for school each month. I also feel like I rarely finish anything in my life. I’ve changed schools and my major twice, decided I wanted kids and then changed my mind over and over, started a bizillion novels and art projects and never completed them, etc. I really don’t think being in is good for me, but I hate myself for thinking about quitting again, especially something I worked so hard to get into and have so much pride about.

619,"Long story short:

I told this assholes wife he's a cheater and had been stalking me for months (I sent lots and lots of proof, the guy was a disgusting creep and at the time I thought getting him to ""spill"" everything and then sending it his family would be beneficial to the wife so she could finally leave the jackass). Now I keep receiving anonymous death threats, or just general threats about ""having to pay"" once the pandemic is over. Due to this, I'm extremely nervous about returning to ""normal"" life after Covid is finally over. I have moved apartments, I've made my social media extremely private, etc. I'm not sure what else to do. I wrote a note saying that if I ever go missing, X person is definitely responsible. The police in this city are already aware of this man having stalked me before, he is banned from my work place and and his family has warned me about his ""anger issues"".

Am I being paranoid?

Does anybody else have any ideas as to how to avoid being either attacked or murdered by this crazy individual? Thanks",09Oct2020,1

621,"I'm a 26F who works as an independent contractor for a marketing company. My income is variable, somewhere between $1k-2k a month. This is hardly enough to make a living off of, especially since my current rent is $800, my car payment is $380, utilities are $100, and groceries are $200. 

I live with my longterm partner (27M) of six years who got laid off last spring and has been searching for work since then (17 months). He has a bachelor's degree and professional work experience, but despite living in the NYC Metro area, he has not been able to find anything. Grocery stores won't call him back. Gas stations won't. Professional companies won't. He applies to 10+ jobs a week and has documentation to prove it. 

Together our rent is $1600, but he's running out of his savings by the end of the year. While he had temporary help from unemployment benefits, he received a notice saying they are halting the payments. Honestly, DoorDash can only provide so much. I am barely keeping us afloat on my income. 

*The rent is too damn high.* Despite my going to a (free) psychic a few months ago who said I'd come into lots of money soon, I still don't make enough. Not that I really believed her, but it would've been nice. Soooo, I began looking at cheaper housing within the few-hour radius, but *everywhere* requires I make 2-3x the rent (which I don't). I live in Long Island, and nothing is below $750 within a couple hours (NY, NJ, CT, RI, MA), and I really don't want to move further and pay extra for movers and a truck. 

So I really need some information on low-income housing. There's almost no straightforward info on the internet, and every apartment has vague requirements. I call offices and property managers but they never call me back.

* Is there some type of master list of income housing I can look at? 
* How do I qualify? Is there a true qualification list for this?
* Do I apply and then send each apartment the application? 
* Are there wait lists? Who is prioritized? 

Anybody who's done this before, please shed some light. Thank you.",09Oct2020,1
622,"Hi, I used to have three (rescue) back garden hens all red hens. Two of which recently died due to cancer and bowel disruption. So that leaves only one. Now I got two baby chickens both 13 weeks old (already quarantined for 30 days) and tried to introduce them to the older hen today. So I put them all inside the run and the older hen started pecking the others. But I thought it was just the pecking order being put into place but then it was constant and violent until I feared for the babys safety so I put the older one in the coop for the night and put the babys in a crate and gave them food, water and  a blanket over the crate to take them inside for the night.

This really stirs things up as it really came unexpected and my plan was to move in with my girlfriend that lives an hour away. Seen as she's only finishing her degree end of next year she's bound to where she lives now. 

I'm really into the topic i'm dealing with right now and i was flattered and happy about the PhD offer. However this would mean I would not move in with my partner until she finishes her uni. Plus, seen as I would then already have my PhD position here, she would be forced to search for her PhD position / work where I am in order to live together which I'm not really a fan of.  
Additionally I'd prefer living where she lives (nicer, bigger city etc.).

Of course I can also look for work / a PhD position where she's living right now. However, I doubt that I will find a topic/work that I would enjoy as much as what I do now or will do for my PhD. Due to what I do is very specific I won't find it anywhere else and I would also have to go through the process of applying for PhD positions that I might not even get or that I'm not as interested in.

Now as of Sunday on 3 separate occasions (Sunday, Wednesday and today) I have lost so much bright red blood that it looked like I had my period in the toilet.. In between these days I have had slight blood on the toilet paper. Bowel movements have been normal and I had no cramping until right now. This morning I was extra tired even though I slept 8 hours. And maybe unrelated but Saturday, the day before it started, I had extremeeeee jointly paint and I was abnormally nauseous, however I believe it was caused from a cold which only lasted for two days..?

We moved into a new home and there were about ten half-empty paint cans in the basement that we want to dispose of because the colors are no longer relevant to the current paint on the walls. 
We heard that you can't dispose of paint unless it's dry, since it contaminates the groundwater. So we opened them all up and left them out to harden. 
Except that it rained...oops

We've been dating for a year, he's 20 years older than me.

I was raped by someone a few months ago, which affected me a lot.

I cheated.

About two weeks ago we found each other on a dating site. He says he downloaded it to check if I was on it, then he started chatting with people (he did not cheat) and he was watching when I get online for 3 weeks, which is when I saw him on there. We had a talk about it. We were completely honest and I talked about everything. 

I know that cheating makes me sound like an awful person, but I was hitting an all-time low. I was feeling worthless, and things were just not going too well between us. Anyways, after talking, he told me that he really wants to continue with this relationship.  He even said that he understands that my needs might be different since I'm younger and that he's willing to let me see other people as long as I have time for him too. I was baffled by this and told him that I want to stay in this relationship and to be better.  Mind you, this was all over a phone call since we've been under lockdown for the past month.

Anyways, about a week and a half after having that talk, we've been talking a lot more. We've been sexting sometimes even. But I still think it's not working.

644,"Growing up I had a bit of a weird but good childhood. I have an older sister and we both grew up on a farm with just about everything we wanted/needed. Our mother always made sure we grew up as kids and not have to worry about adult stuff like chores or working. Our mother was always loving and made sure we had everything we needed. There was a quirk though that we noticed about my mother. She needed everything around her to be perfect. I can recall literally falling down the stairs and her worrying more about the basement (non finished or even fancy) steps getting damaged while I sat there in pain. After she verified that the stairs were ok she asked if I was OK and acted like any other motherly parent. Another instance would be when my sister spilled wax on the carpet in the basement while playing. To my mother it was the end of the world. She was in so much trouble. Even when we were way little we never ate with our hands, we always used silverware and didn’t dare touch the walls. The house was always clean and she would slave away weed whacking and keeping up with the multiple barns we had. That was a ton of work to keep up with but everything was always perfect.

Through our teen years we all know she had OCD and thought that was the only issue she had. Even she would joke about it. My one teenage friend would always move something in the house a little bit to see how long she’d notice. She used to count the squares on the end table garlands to make sure the lamps were 100% in the middle. My friend would move the lamps one square over to see how long it would take and she would find it and say “Damn it Joe”. We would all kind of laugh. By this time she was certainly getting worse but we still didn’t process the severity of it. If someone would touch the walls she would notice the grease from our hands and paint the entire wall. Not just touch up because then she would see that too. Countless times she would be up until 4AM painting.

The past couple years have been way worse. Anytime something big happens in her life like moving she simply cannot handle it. She freaked out when my sister moved out. When she moved back in for a year, when I moved out, etc. The two recent ones were her moving to a smaller house since we no longer live with her. And her parents health is declining rapidly.

My dad is in the picture here but he doesn’t understand mental health issues at all. He was a high school dropout who worked on the family farm. I do not think he even noticed that some of the stuff my mom would do was not normal and how it could mess us up mentally. He seems to just be ignorant to it and lets her do whatever as long as she doesn’t bother him. He is part of the problem because he also enables her immensely. His health is also declining rapidly which is not good. He just had lung reduction surgery and still smokes cigarettes. He doesn’t seem to care enough about himself or to get her the help she needs.

The last two years my sister and I decided to kind of take charge and get her professional help the a psychologist for her OCD. The entire process has been not good. We have spent time and money sending her to different psychologists for help with her OCD. There have been a couple bumps in the road that we didn’t quite understand until last night.

The past couple years she has been further isolating herself. After she moved, she basically lived in the basement from sunrise to sundown. She would do her hair and makeup in the basement. She did this so she wouldn’t notice a mark on the walls or a stick in the yard. Because if she saw one it would mean painting and entire wall or going outside and having to clean up the stick. Anything out of line needed fixed right away otherwise it would drive her mad. She would make my father, who works out in the hot weather doing manual construction work 10 hours a day wake up at 2AM to go get a paint brush from Walmart. If she saw it, it needed to be fixed right away no matter what.

She has also started to grow hatred for my dad. They never really loved each other it always seemed more like they were just two partners raising my sister and I. They pretty much planned to get a divorce but my mom would never do when we were young because she didn’t want us blaming ourselves and end up having mental issues growing up….. Instead they would act like nothing was wrong and tried to hide their fighting from us. Most the time my sister and I would walk around the farm exploring and playing as kids.

The past two years have been difficult for everyone in the family. My mom has continued isolating herself from everyone. She since moved from the basement out to a new smaller metal shop/garage. She wakes up super early. Goes up to the shop. Plays puzzles and games (solitaire) and then goes back to the house late at night to sleep day after day. It is getting harder for my sister and I to see her or even get her to meet us for lunch or visit.

There have been a couple recent events that my sister and I finally put it all together after 30 years,

About 6 months ago my dad went in for his lung reduction surgery. At this time my mom freaked. She could not handle him being gone for a week or even changing her routine for when he came home and needed care. The night he came home from the hospital she went nuts and yelled at him, screamed at him, and blamed him for everything. It got so bad my dad tried to leave with his oxygen tanks and she kept pulling them off the truck. I had to set up my basement for care and he lived with me for a couple months until he recovered. My mother could not hold it together to help my dad after having major surgery. In fact that night immediately after my sister dropped them both off from the hospital they started fighting immediately.

Growing up I was always my moms favorite. Every time I came home she would praise “My son is home!!! Yay!!!” This is important to know for the next episode/event.

The night my dad came home from surgery I had to go over and get his medications, breathing tubes/devices, oxygen tanks, his clothes, wallet, etc. When I walked into the house I was already upset this situation even happened. Luckily I have always been super calm but I was not ready for what was about to happen. I walked in and my mother who has always shown the most upmost love towards me was not there. Instead she was yelling at me for doing this to her. She told me I was an awful person for taking her husband away from her. That I was killing her all while I was just trying to help my dad live and make sure he had the stuff he needed for care. She would ask me why I was doing this and try to get me to acknowledge that I was killing her by doing this. I got what I needed and left in a hurry.

The next 12 hours was not good. I finally got my dad situated on my couch with what he needed and went to bed. I woke up around 4AM to a phone call. It was my mother. Hesitantly I answered. My wife also woke up and was listening. My mother was manic. She talked in a super deep voice saying “I had to do it, it needed to be done.” “I did what I had to do to survive.” My took the phone from me, muted it and told me two hang up because she was playing games. I eventually hung up but whoever I was talking to was not my mother. She was referring to taking $600 out of their shared back account to ""survive"".

Then one night, while my dad was living with me recovering from surgery he was feeling better and took an opportunity to get away and go to camp for a weekend for some alone time. He did this behind my moms back as she has always been weirdly possessive of him and angry when he is happy. She called me to check in that weekend and asked how he was doing. I told her how he was feeling and she eventually asked me where he was. I am not one to lie or keep secrets in the family because I think that is toxic. And I previously warned everyone in the family that I am no longer keeping secrets from one another. So my mom asked where he was and I simply told her he was up at camp. She lost it.

At this point my mom couldn’t get ahold of my dad as service is bad up there and it was late at night. My mom kept calling my sister and was acting just extremely odd. Eventually we were all calling each other (my mom, sister, and myself). My mom threatened to kill herself so we called a mental health hotline and they recommended us calling 911. We called and went over there. The police and ambulance was already there. My mother was trying not to go to the hospital but eventually we all talked her in to my sister and I driving her there voulenteeringly so she wouldn’t have a 3 day hold.

She put on a face and basically said whatever she need to to get through the hospital doctors and make everyone think she was OK. The doctors agreed to let her be released and my sister and I reluctantly decided she wasn’t a danger to herself.

Last night my sister and I had a breakthrough. She had dinner with my dad and he told her my mom is now living in the shop/garage on their property from sunrise to sunset instead of the basement. She cooks up there, eats up there, and even if she forgets her cell phone in the morning she won’t go inside to get it. She plays puzzles and solitaire and probably gets lost in her mind. The last two times we visited she had us visit her in the shop. She pretended like everything was OK and didn’t even acknowledge it was freezing cold or not normal to hang out in there.

When my sister called me to tell me this my wife connected the dots. She has multiple different personalities. She plays who she needs to to get through any situation in life. Like when she called me at 4AM manic, she was not herself and even used a really deep and creepy voice. My sister and I were mind f#@&amp;ed (we still are). So much about our childhood makes sense now and we are even worried we may end up like her (terrified actually). We started discussing all her different personalities and the different person she pretends to be. They tend to come out when there is change in her life. At this point we don’t even know how long it’s been since our mother has truly been herself. Do we even know who she is? Under all the masks/personalities?

Once this realization hit my sister and I have just been processing the data and not taking action. Suddenly we understood why the OCD therapy and psychologist appointments for OCD was not working. We realized she is hiding something from herself. Probably from when she was young. I know my grandfather was not a great father figure and I wonder if he abused her.

If the realization hit my sister and I last night we can only imagine what unraveling all this might feel like for our mother. We need to know what resources we have available to help us. We need someone who is intrigued by this and is willing to navigate through all the layers of herself to get to whatever she is hiding deep down. She needs to stop running from it and acknowledge it and heal. Instead of going mad and into complete isolation. All the specialists we’ve talked to (OCD specialists, we didn’t realize the personality issue until last night) never made any progress. I think she puts on a different personality when talking to these people. Progress does not seem like it’s being made. We need a setup where we can all sit as a family and discuss things.

I don’t want to try to talk her through this at all because I am sure it’s very delicate and I know I’m not a professional. We need someone who will spend all the time necessary to diagnose and understand her. Someone who really is fascinated by this and wants to really help her.

What are our options? What resources are available to us? Please we are running out of ideas of how to help her.",09Oct2020,1

646,"Hello there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 15F student going to college next year. If I can pass my exams, that is. Right now, I'm in the middle of the mock exams, failing every one. I think I would have a lot more motivation to study and achieve higher grades if I could find a reason to, but I can't.

&amp;#x200B;

I got diagnosed with depression last month, and it explains a lot. I have no will to live. Life beyond school seems even more miserable than it is now. What's the point? Slave away working eight hours a day for a society that doesn't care for you, is that all there is?

&amp;#x200B;

Life isn't great now, either. I struggle to find a reason to get out of bed. I go to a prestigeous all-girls school only available to those who pass ruthless exams at a younger age, and I despise it here. Everyone here acts like a 'bimbo', I just don't understand them. Walking into school knowing I'll be bullied relentlessly for being the quiet 'school shooter' makes it worse. It's to be expected, my social skills are abysmal and I've accepted that after years of failure, I'll never be able to make any meaningful relationships, let alone just friends. Unironically, I think I'm starting to become a misogynist, and I wish I was joking. The way these girls flaunt themselves so shamelessly yet then have the audacity to preach about 'women's rights' disgusts me.  I was a top scoring student as a kid and now I'm the bottom of my classes. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the topic of being a kid, according to my parents, I was a nightmare as one. Loud, did what I wanted to, caused trouble for everyone... I really hate myself, both past and present. If I caused that much trouble why should I deserve a second shot? It's not like there's anything worth trying for, really. There's nothing I enjoy anymore. The only reason I'm still here is because the third season of my favorite anime starts airing on Monday. That anime is the only thing I'll miss. I really don't understand why I should keep on living. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's nobody out there for me. My mother will berate me for how I am, for always 'being so depressed' even though I can't help it. She'll call me the r-slur one minute then be nice to me the next. She always makes fun of my interests, she never stops shouting, makes sexual comments about me and tried to touch me once 'accidentally' while drunk. My body is disgusting. My interests are so disgusting that she has to go show all of her friends the one series I'm interested in just to get a kick out of it. Really, what is the point? What's the worse that could happen if this all ends? Eternal nothingness? Sounds great, shame I'm too much of a pussy to do anything. My family will act all nice to me, and I'll even start to have a tiny bit of hope, then once every two weeks or so they'll shout at me for around a half-hour about how hopeless I am and then we're back to how things were. The cycle never ends.

I know this may sound a bit excessive to ask a question like the one I'm gonna ask, as there are much bigger issues in the today's world, but if you could help me I would really appreciate it.

I'm a 16 year old boy, and I cannot move on from a friendship with a girl I really like. We were super good friends a couple of years ago and everything was great. But since last year our friendship is just not the same anymore. We rarely speak, and even if we speak it's just a couple of words (like what's up, how was your weekend and so on). Wes spoke about this a dozen of times that there's something wrong and we should do something about it but it never resolved the issues... She spends all her time with her best friend (I really hate her best friend, and she hates me as well) but when her best friend isn't in school, she hangs out with everyone, me included, and she speaks with me like nothing ever happened. When her best friend is around, she changes SO much. Each day, I'm sad that our relationship is not even close to the level that it used to be, and it's really hard seeing her in class every day. 

I'm stuck, I know that I should probably move on, but I just can't do it. What do you think I should do, or is there even anything to do?",09Oct2020,1
658,"

I've known my partner for 18 years and been with him for 12,. I know him very well and we have quite different personalities and opinions. 

He likes to micromanage and control those around him, makes snap judgements and sticks to them without exploring other possibilities first, he's not very accepting of people's opinions or preferenceshe's and thinks that his way is the only way, he's also believes what he wants to and repeats these beliefs as though they are fact. 
I'm making him sound awful but he has many good traits too and that's why I'm with him, it's just not relevant to this post.

My strengths are the polar opposite of his weaknesses, and we have clashed a lot because of this, so... it came as quite a surprise to me when suddenly, around a year ago, he began to say things about himself that are simply not true and more like something someone would say about me.

He now believes himself to be thorough (he's not, he's known to be a rushed, half a job type)

He now believes himself as someone who wouldn't repeat something without fact checking it first (again, he's not, that's more like me)

He now believes that he is fair and accepting  (he's... really not)

These are just a few examples  

The thing that's strangest of all about this is that his behaviours haven't changed at all! 
He just believes all of these things about himself now and acts as though they've always been true even though he acts the exact opposite, or, the exact way he always has.

and this is where it gets more worrying still

He repeats my opinions to me and others as though they're his own, he tells jokes that I made back to me, he's even told me stories of mine as though they're his, it's like that scene in the movie Upstream Colour.

 I've googled this in every way I can think of and I'm not getting a great deal of information, it's getting frustrating. Does anyone know what this might be? I would like to add that he's a heavy weed smoker and has been since he was 14, he'll be 37 soon.

It's as though being around me has accidentally programmed a large part of my personality into him but it went wrong somewhere so that he only believes things about himself with no actual follow through.",09Oct2020,1
659,"So I’m (20f) currently living in the UK with my sister, mum and stepfather. As you can probably already guess, my stepdad is not the nicest of people.

He doesn’t like me playing video games, so I now have to hide my screen whenever he’s around. He used demand to check my internet history to make sure I was job searching and called up our broadband and tried to block a game I really like (he’s dumb so he blocked the website you download the game from, not realising it’s actually a software). 

When I got a job he was pleased and then started demanding I get more hours. At the time he used to take me to work because it was on the way to his and then when he wanted me to work everyday, he said he would leave without me and make me late if I didn’t get more hours. This was a huge problem for me because of my anxiety and my fears of being late to work, I then refused to let him take me to work any longer and bought a bike. 

He has this obsession with the dishwasher in which the evening before I have to get up super early in the morning for work, he’ll purposely put the dishwasher on late (which takes about two hours roughly to finish) and then demand I unload it because I ‘don’t work that many hours’. One evening, I forgot he’d put it on and fell asleep (I had two shifts back-to-back so I was tired) so the next day he said if I didn’t do it when I was supposed to, he would barge into my room, wake me up and rip my covers off and then make me do it. 

The list goes on. 

Today, was especially hard at work. I work in a supermarket and because of covid etc, it’s ridiculously busy and just damn tiring sometimes. So naturally when I finish, I just want do something I like such as playing video games. 

He snuck upstairs and caught me claiming I was slowing the internet, although I was in a offline single world. Threatened to break my laptop if he caught me again. When I said he’d have to pay if he did, he said he wouldn’t and that he’d still throw the laptop and me out of the window if he caught me again. 

I feel like I’m just trapped in this nightmare. The house that was bought by my father before he passed and a place that I’ve been in since I was born just feels so unwelcoming now. I don’t know what to do. 

If he did break my laptop (which wasn’t exactly cheap) would there be a legal route I could take?

664,"The state of my dental health is horrid and it essentially acts as a metaphorical ball-and-chain that tightly binds me to my debilitating self-esteem. I can almost not chew anymore. There's just one part of my mouth I can effectively use in that sense. My ugly smile cost me a potential job and severe embarrassment at an interview.

I am one of five beneficiaries in a family trust, out of which I have yet to benefit, and my belief is that this is true irrespective of the fact that up until recently I have yet to request any aid from the trust fund.

That changed when I requested that the fund pay for a dental operation I have to undergo where all my teeth will be extracted and be replaced by dentures. The head trustee, who happens to be my father, declined, the reason being the claim that there are not enough funds in the trust account.

This after about three years since the trust donor/creator, my grandfather, passed away, marking the start of the trust. I was not surprised at this response because I expected it. Due to my reticent and diffident personality, I was too afraid to ask up to this point that the trust help me. But I also knew there was going to be an excuse of some sort.

I have a backup plan or two. I know for a fact that I won't be able to get help from the trust, and I can't make use of legal channels because I do not have any money. My bank account literally has about $8 in it at the time of writing.

The first backup plan is to see whether or not I can sell my kidney, and this is not a joke. I am that desperate. Selling your kidney is illegal in all countries but one, which is Iran. They have a dedicated, government-regulated model that's worked since 1993, for well over 1300 people. It works. There is a universal, set price for all kidneys. I've done my research. If foreigners can participate in this program, I'm going to at least give it a shot. But this is only if the second backup plan doesn't work or even just happens by my own volition and discretion, which is the actual reason I am typing this.

Backup plan 2 is to see whether or not I can rely on crowdsourced funding. I am very ashamed to have come to this point, so I was wondering if it would be *immoral to ask of people*, and not *expect* it of them, if they could help donate to a gofundme I'd set up. I do not feel entitled to others' money, whatsoever, and would have no problem if only one or two people for every thousand who sees the page would have donated, or if it did not reach the goal at all because of that, even if the price goal is fairly affordable to most South Africans. I am not even sure if it would work to begin with.

I can be expected to pay around US$850–1000 for the whole procedure. But if it is immoral, or even frowned upon, I am definitely cancelling backup plan 2 and will learn a lesson from my experience. I think there's an argument to be made that I should rather not go this route at all, considering that:

1) I have only myself to blame for having come to this point, as well as the fact that

2) there are so many more serious problems other people face out there, that they did not have any direct influence on whatsoever

3) And that I am part of a trust (and therefore I am very privileged, compared to most people) and should rather fight tooth (punintentional) and nail for what I want

I would love to hear the opinions of the people here. Advice would be deeply appreciated. Thank you for your time if you've read up to this point. Also, I am *not asking financial aid here*. I do not want to do that at all. I'm just asking for opinions.

I also pretended to be asleep once and I KNOW he took a video of my vagina but when I checked his phone the video wasn’t there. (But that’s when I saw some other stuff) 
Is there a way I could FIND the videos? A place he could be posted them too? He might not be but I’m like. 98% sure they’re going somewhere...

671,"I (18) recently chose to change my education. I’ve droppes out 2 times now, so I decided that I would go for some courses in business, accounting and entrepreneurship instead as that is what I feel I actually want to do. This made my mother furious, she attempts to tell me everyday how stupid my plans are, and how I’m going to fail etc. 
I kinda said fuck it, it’s my choice and I’m tired of failing at school. This made her decide to cut all help she was giving me, now she is pushing a rent on me that gets higher every month. It started at 200$ a month and literally next month she decided it had to be 300. She recently told me it was gonna begin being 400. I was starting my drivers license which she said she’d pay for. She has paid for half and now she decided I should pay for the rest myself. I have about 1.500$ left in savings and I’m not even allowed to access all the other money I have. She intentionally made it so I couldn’t access it, until I was 24. I had to quit smoking, and pick up an extra job to afford this crusade. Ironically, it’s getting difficult to afford and find time to study the things I set out to study. 

My dad can hardly afford living himself, and lives in an apartment with 3 other people. There isn’t even a spare room for me to live in if she kicks me out. I could in theory go live way out of town with an aunt or something, but that would make it impossible for me to go to my job or education and would require for me to basically start over. She is trying to spearhead every single opportunity I have, so I can take the education she wants me to take and I feel like I’m going to crack. What can I do?",09Oct2020,1
673,"Hello,
First off I’m glad I can ask this somewhere without feeling judged or awkward. 

I’ve recently started having memories of my mom sucking on my earlobes as a child... now this has come to my memory after I’ve cut her off for sexually abusing my 7 year old daughter on numerous occasions. (She was teaching her how to masturbate from what I was told by my daughter). I started going to therapy, as well as my daughter to cope with this abuse and she had asked me if I’d been sexually abused by her in my childhood... I hadn’t remembered anything unusual. She had been cheating on my dad with teenaged boys, but as far as I could remember nothing she did was to me directly...

Now all of a sudden I’m having memories of her sucking my earlobes and me enjoying it (which nauseates me now). 

Do you think there was sexual abuse from her and I just cannot remember? Is ear sucking as inappropriate is I feel it is? Has anyone else’s parent done this to them?

I would never do this to my own, and I find it disturbing so I really don’t know what to think and I really want to know if it’s as weird as I feel it is.


Thank you.",09Oct2020,1
674,"Wasnt sure which forum to best post this on so was hoping to find help or at least a link on here.

Got a 2 month old German shepherd on the Sunday just gone and its the first time I've had a dog as an adult and the first time we've had a dog in our home for 10+ years.

 He's adjusting well i think but I'm worried about his eating. He's been raw fed since being weaned off his mum so we've tried to follow up on that but mix in kibble too because I dont want us to land on harder times financially and not have him used to a cheaper option per se. We've moved from him eating 4 times a day to 3 times and tried to keep those times as regular as possible but because he sleeps very irregularly during the day it can be harder. He didn't eat as much first 2 days, then the next 2 he ate everything we gave him and now he's shifted back to that not eating as much. He still has plenty of energy to run around for zoomies but I just worry im doing something wrong because the breeder told us he was always hungry. Someone suggested it might be because he doesn't have to compete for the food now he's not among the litter but idk. 

He's very intelligent too so we were recommended to do obedience training straight off the bat which we did but he's less interested in doing it now than he was at the start of the week so I'm worrying why his attention span has dropped already.

 I know its only been 6 days but I just wanna do the best for him so any advice or encouragement is mega appreciated. Thanks guys!",09Oct2020,1
675,"hi I had my second driving lesson today and it was horrific :(, it’s really knocked my confidence.

My first lesson I drove up and down a straight road and learned how to start and break. He said I was really good and overall it was a chilled lesson. 

However today it was incredibly stressful. I got in the car and I was driving immediately onto the main road. I was sweaty and nervous and he made me change gears which I haven’t done before and I accidentally went to second instead of third a couple of times and he pulled me over and got on to me :(, it was so embarrassing and I felt like shit. Once we pulled off again I did it right and he was like good so I thought I’d be light hearted about it and say “thank god I got it that time!” And he was really snappy and said I’m doing it too fast. 

There was so much to remember that it made me start to stress and suddenly he told me we were going to the big roundabout in my city (it’s the busiest and has lots of lanes with traffic lights) my heart started racing. My steering isn’t good at all and he wasn’t happy with it so I really felt like I was going to crash into another car or something. Luckily I did it okay but I just feel so shit about how I did today. At the end we went over and he said it was fine but I’m really scared of him :(. 

He doesn’t let me use the indicator and he doesn’t let me move the mirror at the front so I can see out. I just feel so bad about today and I don’t want to go to my lesson next week.",09Oct2020,1
676,"ok, this is a bit weird. i’m 14 and i really really want to start buying clothes that match my aesthetic. thing is, my father relies on me to be his ‘second in command’ and be the role model for my brothers, but the thing is, i’m my own person and i want to do my own stuff. i know it’s a typical teen thing and i know it’s a phase, but i just want to be a teen for a bit instead of a role model. it’s pressuring.

for example, i want to dye my hair. i want to wear clothes, but not any sort of clothes, clothes that make me feel like ME. i want to laugh and hang around with my friends. 
occasionally, i have these sudden urges to just buy stuff that i think i’ll like, but i stop myself last second. it’s really uncomfortable, not being able to express myself through wearing stuff. it’s also really weird.

my father is a general conservative guy, and has the ‘a teenager should act like an adult’ sort of mindset. he also wants me to do well in school and he constantly asks me about my academics. i have many responsibilities, but i really don’t want to upset him by just being myself, and it’s beginning to tear me up. any advice?",09Oct2020,1
677,I made a post on this but I genuinely need guidance so any advice will help. I am 19 years old. Almost 20. So is she. She left home due to the fact that her mother being toxic and her stepfather being possessive. She moved a state over to come stay with me. We both have stable income we planned out for this but she didn’t end on good terms and left in the middle of the night because she knew her parents would say no. I told her that was a messed up thing to do and we moved on from that. I’m in school and have a pretty much full-time job at a hardware and building supply store. Plus I’m doing an emt program to make my income even more stable. I offered her a place and she took the offer and drove here. The problem I have with the situation is when I went to ask for advice from my brother. He said “he’s sizing me up” he basically said “I’ve been in the army for twenty five years and have been in special task forces that you need nsa clearance to even know about” so and so. Basically threatening me and the people who live with me.  And I don’t have a problem with him coming to see his daughter. At the end of the day I’m here for her and if she wanted to go back home. That’s cool if she wants to stay that’s also cool. I’m not here for her parents I’m here for her. And with that being said I’m still going to support her decision whatever it is that she does. But in my opinion that threat cannot fly. Especially being the fact that he called the police on her for a welfare check. Which is okay. No one is being held against their will. I haven’t had any problems with the law except some mental health issues when I was a kid but He has threatened to come to MY homestead and to “get his daughter back”. He doesn’t own her. She can do whatever she needs to do and she may have not ended on good terms but that was because she felt like she had no other choice. Please give me advice on this because I am genuinely scared.,09Oct2020,1

681,"I turned 18 six months ago, and it was a lot for me. I had a bad childhood which made me have to grow up early. I think I was around seven when I needed to start acting like a responsible 'adult'.

Note: There's around nearly two decades of information I'm making shorter here so, sorry if pieces are missing. If there are any questions, feel free to ask below. This is half venting and half advice.

I had to take care of my mother. After my father divorced her, she became a mess. She would drink constantly and really stopped caring for me. Mom would go to the store and buy microwavable pizzas in bulk, and so that's what I'd have for every meal for weeks at a time. Looking back, I was probably malnourished. She would complain about my father (in large drunken screaming fits either directed toward someone at the phone or at me) and eventually just stopped trying to take care of me. In the mornings, from the age of around 11, I would be the one waking her up to take me to school. I'd remind her to eat, and I'd watch myself. And then when her health got bad, everything just got significantly worse. Lots of standing over her in hospital rooms, watching her in pain. (Not to mention her boyfriends who would encourage her to drink more and would use her. And who put us in dangerous situations at times.) I had no consistency living with her because anything would set her off into hysterics- running around the house and sobbing, all while yelling at me. It's still impossible to talk to her to this day.

Then there was my dad. He quickly began a relationship with my (now) step-mom. She has three children who are loud and rambunctious. I've always been an introvert, and I've had quirky interests. They despised me for that, I think. Every small disagreement would be blown out of proportion. Every time my dad and step-mom fought it would lead to screaming matches, wine glasses thrown, and the police almost being called. Any sibling fight would lead to someone storming out of the house and threatening to never return. I was belittled for all of my interests and told I was 'acting differently just to get attention'. This caused me to second guess every thought I had. I didn't know if my interests/thoughts was my own or if I was really just me being difficult. My step-siblings would play games that involved physical violence- often where I was the one receiving it. Whenever I tried to ask them to stop, I was shamed for disliking them and not wanting to spend any time with 'my family'. My father never tried to stop any of this, because he hates confrontation. They were allowed to walk over me and treat me with however much malice they wanted.

Additionally, my stepmom hates me. She is constantly upset and turns any conversation into an argument. At any event that is about me (birthdays, graduation, extra-circulars) she would pout and turn the situation to focus on her and her anger. I never was able to have an event that was for me, because I'd always be overshadowed by her. I think in her mind, she can only be happy when I'm miserable because she only smiles when I'm sad. And when I'm happy, she feels like she needs to grieve over something. Not to mention multiple years of gaslighting- insisting I had an eating disorder when I didn't for example.

Long story short: This past week I was diagnosed with PTSD. That's adding to my depression and GAD. It made me look back at my life and wonder what the hell happened. I spent the entirety of my childhood depressed or nervous. I feel like so much of my life has been taken from me and I don't know how to come back from this. I can't enjoy things, and these events have made me feel excluded from my peers. So, where do I go from here? How do I start to move on? Any advice would be appreciated.

tl;dr: My childhood sucked. How do I move on and become happy?",09Oct2020,1
682,"This would be my 4th W, but it's my last semester. Basically what is happening is the TA is lazy and won't read the readings or assignments properly, and if you try to get your grades corrected, she gets aggressive and refuses to move. Im sure the prof is a nice guy, but he refuses to intervene and says that we should resolve the issues among ourselves. When I told him I wanted to contest my mark as per the university's policy that allows students to do so, he ignored my emails (I sent two). Given that these are covid times my classes are online and I can't confront him face to face. 

Based on her feedback comments, she is failing to read entire sections and to understand basic concepts in the readings. She keeps giving me C's, which I know is wrong because I compared my answers to my friend who has an A in the class, and we have the same answers, she is just super on the nose about it and I integrate the concepts so you have to look for it a bit more. 

Basically I want to apply for law school, but I already have 3 W's on my transcript and this is my last semester. Is one more W going to hurt me on law school applications? I've had about 1 W a year.

687,"Good morning/afternoon/evening to whoever is reading this. 
One of my children (15) has come to me today and said that they don’t feel comfortable in their own body right now. They are upset that boys are looking at them differently and they generally feel uncomfortable with the way their body is changing. From what I understand and from what they have told me, they don’t feel like they land on the male or female spectrum. They want to lay somewhere between. We have been using they/them pronouns for them for about a year and a half but I guess they want to take the next step and “become more androgynous” (their words not mine) 

So I gotta ask, where is the safest place for me to find my child a binder that will help them with their dysphoria? I have found so many sites that claim to “be the best.” But I want real advice here.

688,"So here I am, a 22-year-old female, who loves dressing up pretty, putting a little makeup on, being a bit flirty, and somehow, I'm stuck in sweatpants and sports bras for the past couple of months.

While I was going to high school and college, I always dressed however I wanted to. A little eyeliner, some comfortable but nice skirts, whatever I wanted. Now, I started my first full-time job, and as I'm working with kids, my job requires me to wear sweatpants and comfortable clothes every workday. I don't really go out with friends, so there isn't really too much place to dress up - and also, there is a pandemic going on, so I have to limit the times I'm going out even more, and the social events I used to go on, are all canceled. On top of it, I'm in a long-distance relationship, so I don't go on dates either.

I'm feeling less and less comfortable about myself lately. I work in sweatpants, I come home and switch into other sweatpants, oh, and I go to work by bicycle or by car (public transport is not an option) on which I'm also wearing more practical than nice clothes. 

It's been ruining my self-image and my confidence a lot lately. I feel like I can't be myself. I know that it's quite normal that you go through a bigger change when you start your first job, but now the almost 0 social events and a long-distance-relationship are making it quite hard for me, and I don't know what to do to feel more feminine again.

I work out twice a week, whether if it's a spinning class or going for a run, or just a small home-workout, but I don't have a problem with my body itself.

Bottom line, I'm normally a quite horny girl, but now that I'm not feeling good in my body and I don't feel as confident as I normally do, my libido is going downhill, so it affects my sexuality as well.

Anyone ever felt similar? Or is it just b\*tching about nothing? I feel like it has a big effect on my mental health, that's why I'm asking for your advice.",09Oct2020,1
689,"I have found out pretty early in my life exactly what I want to do. I want to continue on studying what I'm studying rn, immigrate and do it in a better country, make a decent amount of money, buy a farm (that's kind of the main reason why I want a good amount of cash), practice and get good at my hobbies, raise some nice animals and die.

That's my life plan. Has been for a very long time and probably won't change. Any extras are welcome but this is what I want to do with my life. I don't want anything else.

When I talk to others who have no idea what they want to dod all they do is waste their time on stupid stuff or they say immature things, it honestly bothers me. I reached the point where I felt like I was being narcissistic and like a horrible person, because I couldn't stand immaturity anymore. I got rid of most of my ""unserious"" ""friends"" and I'm more upfront about being annoyed by excessive jokes and anything that feels unproductive to me.

I'm naturally a serious person who hates to waste their time and loves to get things done. My idea of a good time is studying or talking about serious topics only. I just feel too old to still be talking about silly things. I'm only 20 but I live in a really rough country in east Africa and I need to work on myself and gtfo out of here. I have a ton of issues to deal with at only 20 and so do other people here. I thought that'd make it easier for them to be more mature and take responsibility at a young age. But it didn't. If anything, they're more immature than your average 20s year old person in other places, in my experience.

This is honestly causing me pain in my life. I'm tired. It feels like all the people who I get along with and are my true friends that are mature, hard working, empathetic and loving are people thousands of miles away from me. And it will take time till I can move to a place where I can be around my true friends. Around those with values aligned with mine. I feel sad that I'm in a place where I feel like I can't be myself. It feels like any time I open up, people open up to me and they turn out to be very lost, immature and overall just not at the same level I'm at in my life.

- i really dont know how others see me. I think im ugly but idk. Ive never been called pretty but i have been called cute but still idk if thats true.

691,"I hate the term mental health. It's become such a trendy topic as of late, and people just seem to gravitate towards using this term when it's anything but physical health issues...

Emotional health is never mentioned.

Whether it's anxiety, ptsd, stress, etc these absolutely can be due to emotional wounds.

This is a huge imbalance in using the term ''mental health' and I feel like people using this term often just use it because it's a popular term nowadays and they think they understand humans when they don't, this pseudo-progressive intellectual understanding of people and I hate it.

I also hate how mental health solutions are almost always associated with psychiatry and medication. Teens and adults are being deceived in many ways by thinking these are solutions when there's so much out there that's more beneficial that drugging someone up.

Emotional health needs to be discussed and considered as the root issue, not a mere 'mental issue' that can very well be a false diagnosis.

I believe that human beings are emotional and spiritual beings, and it seems that the heart and spirit of a person is being completely ignored!
This is a big deal, and I don't understand why so much focus is on the ""mental"" side of things... it reduces human beings to almost robotic beings, devoid of heart and spirit.

It's foolish to ignore the other crucial components of a human like the heart/emotions as well as the human spirit.

There is an unhealthy balance of essentially saying humans are just physical and mental.

The 'mental health' trend needs to go, for reasons I stated. Human beings need to be seen as a holistic individual, not a machine mind.",09Oct2020,1

693,"tldr; my brother (23M) and i (18F) think its time to move out. we cant deal with my moms toxicity, anger, or her tight grip on us anymore. i dont know how to budget for this or if its even a good idea. should i just go for it and move into my college dorms?

i (18F) think it's time for me to move out. i cant live at home like this anymore and neither can my brother (23M). now let me be clear, my brother and i arent perfect angels or anything,we have our shit too, but we honestly cant deal with my mom anymore. here's some background information:

let me tell you a bit about my brother and myself first. as i said im 18F and i just started at a university. technically though im a junior in college because i did a program in high school that helped me earn my Associate's Degree, so im ahead. i also work part time like 3-4 days a week in retail and just started in august. i have a scholarship that pays 75% of my fees plus grants and financial aid. my brother is 23M and works part time like 2 days a week in retail as well and does college part time. he doesn't have a degree but he started at 18. i dont think he has any aid or scholarships because he failed several classes

anyway, we live in a toxic environment. my mom is constantly breathing down our necks. shes always angry and stressed about everything and takes it out on us. my brother and i have become different: we talk back now. we never used to do that before because its disrespectful, but when we try to be calm and rational she doesnt listen. we've had several conversations about this and it gets better for a couple weeks then turns into a shitshow again

let me try to bring up some examples of what she gets mad about that actually start arguments:

\- today my brother told my mom i was up until 6am the previous night. she got pissed at the both of us (mainly me) and said im throwing my life away, that i wonder why im depressed when i stay up like that, that i should get a full time job and do school part time instead since im throwing my life away, and that im lazy and will lose my scholarships since i have 2 Cs and an A

\- she found me awake about an hour ago and my brother as well and yelled at us. she said that shes gonna take both of us off of her insurance, that she's going to turn the wifi off so we cant be up at night, that she doesnt wanna deal with us anymore, and then some of the other stuff again like that that we're throwing our lives away, and that we should work full time and do college part time so we dont have any free time to stay up. she told both of us to go to bed. why is she telling my brother to go to bed when hes 23 years old?

\- last week we lost power and my brothers gf got worried and he wanted to get in contact with her and go for a drive to mcdonalds (which is like 3 minutes from our house) to get reception. my mom said no (hes 23 years old why is she controlling him) and got **extremely** pissed off when i defended him saying that hes an adult. he left anyway but she yelled at me until the power came back on (about an hour) and him as well when he came back

\- she gets mad at us when my brother and i get along. when we have fun she tells us to stop which makes no sense

\- she got mad at me for even **considering** moving out (this was a couple months ago) then proceeded to guilt trip me

\- she gets mad if i ask to go out

\- when i use my headphones since theyre noise canceling

\- when i buy stuff online

\- when i express my feelings to her (if im sad or mad)

\- when my brother and i disagree with her on something and ""gang up"" on her. are we not allowed to have differing opinions?

\- she gets mad when i sleep in even if i dont have anything to do

\- if i have days where im extra tired or sad she gets mad that i dont feel like talking

\- when i have days where im very depressed and dont want to do anything, eat , talk, or leave my bed

thats not even everything. and when i say mad i mean like pissed off to the point where she starts yelling and cursing and arguing

on top of the anger she doesnt understand or listen to us as people or even to our feelings. she says she does but then she chooses not to listen to us. she'll get pissed off with us then later on say shes sorry and she understands but does the same shit over and over. i try to tell her my point of view and what i think but she doesnt listen so i dont say it nicely anymore, not that it works but im tired of being silenced and ignored. its difficult trying to get her to listen. im beginning to ice her out. its never been as bad as it has this year. my mom and i have been best friends my entire life since im the youngest but this year has been horrible with her. i dont know if part of it is corona since she works at home and i go to school at home so we're stuck together (my brother as well of course)

i honestly just cant do this anymore. like i said, even talking to her about it is a problem. she **refuses** to listen to my brother and i. i know we could be nicer but even before we started talking back she was already like this. i guess since we're older now we've gotten tired of standing down to her so the back talking made it worse. but in reality we shouldnt be treated like we're children. we dont act like it, or i dont at least since my brother is different

my brother and i also both struggle with our mental health. we both have depression and i have an anxiety disorder as well. ive been suicidal and almost self harmed before. its harder to deal with this when im already so mentally tired and depressed all the time. ive lost a bit of motivation and struggle to stay happy and relaxed

and we have 3 older siblings: 45F, 43M, 39F. the older 2 woul take my moms side honestly but 39F has already told me even before any of this that she thinks i should live in a dorm instead so at least she might support me and help me budget since shes super smart

but anyway now that you have the background information, im thinking i should move on campus. i was going back and forth about it before because on the one hand its more expensive, i dont have a car or drivers license, my mom has babied me my whole life so i dont know how id live alone, and i dont want to live with a stranger who could be snooping in my stuff. we also just started redecorating my room and got all new furniture but isnt there already furniture in dorms? on the other hand i can do student loans, i can depend on friends and uber for rides i guess?, everyone has to learn life skills at some point, and maybe ill get roomed with a nice person. i just cant continue to live this way. i really think it might be time for me to leave

i have no clue how to budget for this or if should start working full time if i move into a dorm. im doing research on the dorms so i can figure out what to do. i also dont know how to tell my mom without her blowing up at me. she already said when this semester is over she wants us to work full time and just go to college part time so maybe ill add onto that

i really just feel like this is too much for me. its hurting my mental health and my relationship with my mom. i dont want to ruin what we have and i cant deal with all of this. please any advice/guidance/ideas are welcomed. thank you if you read all of this",09Oct2020,1

696,"I find myself dealing with the constant meaninglessness of life. I've sparsely felt a real connection to anyone, in spite of my eastern world philosophic-type beliefs. I don't know what I really believe, and I feel like anytime I start to try and unravel some of these ideas I think I have, I end up overwhelmed by how much I don't know or what seem to be cognitive issues I have. Even though I constantly try to  expose myself to new information and I am interested in art and literature I feel dumb, unable to recall things in conversation and stumbling over words over ideas I feel like I know I understand. Everything feels slightly far away. I don't know how to express myself but keeping everything to myself, like I feel I have forced myself to do, is killing me. I am taking steps to better myself in the ways I can directly see, i.e. I bought a pull up bar and am trying to learn to do a pull up correctly. But most days I see no point in doing any of that, because there are other things that I have to deal with (my speech problem, other things I don't feel like divulging right here) and it just feels like I have to do so much to just be like a normal functioning person, and I'm sure I'll never get there. I'm kind, I crave adventure, I have some friends and I think I have a developing world view and character but I don't know if I'll ever be able to show what I think I really feel. I'm probably typing in circles but I don't know I don't talk to anyone about this stuff. I don't know how to. Like anyone else, I just want love. I doubt I will ever find it. I'm dealing with the fact that many people that deviate from normality live and die alone. 

I have no idea of what I want to do or what my passions are, I don't want to just work for others my whole life, I don't want to work for others right now, but I feel enabled from actually participating in the real world. It feels like weight on my chest somedays

697,"I’m 18 years old and in my senior year of high school, doing school from home due to COVID, and I currently have F’s in all but one class, and it’s because I have a serious problem with staying focused, and I end up not paying attention during lectures, and I don’t do the work. I know I have ADHD, and I used to take medication for it, but right now I don’t. 

It’s really strange how I got here, I used to make honor role from 4th grade to 7th grade, then in 8th grade, that’s when my grades in school started getting worse, it was the first time I had an F on my report card, in Algebra I Honors, and from there, my grades have been getting worse and worse, and I’ve come close to having to repeat classes. 

I’ve tried so many things to get better grades and stay focused, like deleting social media, unplugging game consoles, medication, but nothing seems to work, I just can’t do it, and I’m freaking out, my mom is freaking out and saying she’s going to get in trouble because she was supposed to make sure I was staying focused (while she’s working at the same time, she works from home), and now I’m just about to lose it.

I have depression, and I’ve had this depression for a little over a year now, and I used to be suicidal, and I’ve been admitted into a psychiatric hospital last year. My depression was mostly gone during the summer, but when school started back up, and I started failing all my classes, it just got worse. 

I’ve attempted cut off communication from most of my friends lately so I can try to focus on school, but I have no self control, I end up still getting distracted by going on Discord and Twitter to check up on everyone, when I should be doing my school work because my grades suck. 

I feel like I’m just born a failure, I feel like I can’t do anything right, and I’ve been considering dropping out of high school, but my mom REALLY doesn’t want that, because she wants to see me do senior pictures, and do cap and gown. School is just not my thing, and I really feel like just dropping out of high school and getting a GED instead, but I don’t want to make my mom anymore upset than she already is, so I need to stay in high school and finish this year.

699,"Me and Danielle dated for a couple months. I moved back home from college after my first year. I turned into a bad boyfriend while we were doing king distance. I didn’t talk to her as much, I started to resent how clingy she was, and I became depressed. I got sick of living with my parents. I moved back to college and we were still dating regardless of how shitty I was treating her.

We fought all the time once I was back, it was stressful. So we both decided it would be better if we just went our separate ways. We decided that maybe it was just the age difference (I’m 19 shes 21 and a grad student) I wanted to live my college life and she wanted me to spend more time with her.

Now I started seeing another girl. It doesn’t feel the same. I had a huge crush on this girl before Danielle. Now I can’t stop thinking about Danielle. The times we laughed, cried, and just talked together. I’m not sure what to do anymore. I don’t feel like I’m worthy of asking for a second chance, but I’m madly in love with her.

It came to a peak yesterday. I saw Danielle for the first time since I started thinking about her and I broke down. I wanted to eat lunch but she was in line ahead of me. I saw her and I had to leave the line. I sat down and I just cried until my friend showed up.

Is there anything I can do? Am I allowed to ask her for a second chance? Should I just try to get over it?",09Oct2020,1

702,"Ok so originally I didn’t plan on getting my CPA. I work at a small/med accounting firm and I’m overall okay with it. I’m currently in my last semester for my bachelors. I had 2 semesters that weren’t that great due to a family member suddenly passing, which really made it hard for me to stay focused for a good year. This contributed to dropping my GPA just under the 2.8/4.3 in Quebec. At the time I didn’t really let it bother me due to the fact that I didn’t plan on getting my CPA. Note: I’m also a woman in my 30’s with a mortgage and bills so I didn’t think more school would be the right time anyways. I also planned on starting a family within the next 2-3 years with my fiancé. 

So here’s where my issue comes in. A friend referred me to a big company and they looooved me. They want to hire me but the only condition is that I get my CPA designation.  They’re willing to pay for half of my fees and they also provide me with a high starting salary (60k) before I even get my designation, and that’s not including bonuses and other contributions. They really want to move me within the company eventually and they don’t mind if I start my CPA courses within a year.

How would I be able to get my GPA to a 2.8 if I’m basically done my undergrad? Is there a course I can take after I graduate to replace my weaker grades? Or should I hold off from graduating and try to retake some courses in the winter? I don’t even know if that’s allowed tbh

Doctors have said there's nothing wrong, but the problem is that it takes so much effort to produce clean speech. It's like my voice is always so dry or something, and other people sound so much more crisp and smooth. On top of that, the lowness of my voice makes it so monotone. Are there any fluids, vocal exercises, or things I should be doing to help this? I haven't been told to go to a speech therapist because maybe it's part of the growing process.

704,"Hi, so I have a slight dilemma. I am a junior in high school, and there was a girl I dated in my sophomore year. We are still very close friends and have a ton of fun. She is amazing, and we got along really well. I was going through some really bad stuff, so we broke up a few times. It sucked. I feel horrible for the way I treated her. She deserves the world. I feel bad that I love her still. I just recently broke through a layer of my depression and I'm across the country because of family complications. But I plan to get back to her area as soon as possible (not really for her, but because I have a family who wants to take me in and help me.)

Like I said before, I still really have feelings for her, and I feel them 10 times more now that I feel alive again. She clearly has feelings for me too, but she says she's not ready. I don't wanna push her, but I want to show her I am ready, and that I can be a wonderful person (and girlfriend). I know high school dating isn't that serious, but I really care about this girl. I'm a flirty person, and I feel horrible when I make her uncomfortable with that, even if she does flirt back. It bums me out to be called out for it, but I totally understand and I hold nothing against her. It's just me being selfish.

I'm essentially scared that we're all going to die, or that this will never end. For a pretty good stretch of time I started delving into a lot of grandiose conspiracy theories on Covid, and it was literally driving me to the point of Insanity. It's just very hard for me to see the light at the end of this tunnel. Especially considering how our ""leaders"" (I live in the United States btw) are handling this.

711,"hi! 
i am a senior in hs. for social distancing, my school is going hybrid, meaning that students are divided into an A group and B group, with each group going in-person 2x/ weeks and virtual 3x/ week; the days are 8-12. there is also an option to learn completely virtually, which i am currently doing. 

we have just been given the option to switch into hybrid learning/virtual learning, and i am struggling to decide whether i should stay fully virtual or go back to school. here's the factors swaying into my decision:

-i REALLY miss human interaction and going to school

-it's my senior year :(

-i would probably have a way easier time w my classes if i were in-person

-i am currently involved in an extracurricular that require me to be in a group on school grounds anyway. (although the activity is outside, which makes it safer)

-my parents are both back to work; my mom is a teacher (high-risk job) and my dad does business (low-risk, has his own office). it's just the 3 of us at home. 

-my grandparents occasionally come to our house bc we have to take care of them (but they've been coming way less ever since my parents went back to work)

-my dad has an autoimmune disorder (but he still chose to go back to work??? idk dont ask me)

-for the 2 months it's been open, my school has had a couple scares, but no actual covid cases. from what i've heard, social distancing measures are going very smoothly (6 ft markers in halls, desks 6 ft apart, reduced class sizes, A/B groups, half days, daily temperature checks, mandated masks) 

-my state (northeast) is doing pretty well w/ COVID, and i think our case #s are either stagnant or decreasing

i'm trying to make this decision in the least emotional, most fact-based way possible (hence me listing out the cut and dry facts) but it's tough. i really really REALLY miss school, but i don't want to let my emotions cloud my reasoning. i just want to gather some insight and see if you guys think i can go back to school or if it is too risky.",09Oct2020,1

I dont think I'm normal. I remember stuff people said to me since before I was 10. I'm fat, I shouldn't go gym, I'm gonna turn my tits into watermelons.. yes someone said that to me when I was 13. 

I've been very quiet because of that. I work a dead end job because I didnt know what school was about. I didnt know as stupid as I sound for a 24 yo that's born and bred in britain that school is about working in the future. I never gave myself any chance in passing because I wouldn't revise.

717,"I hate the term 'mental health'. It's like the new trendy topic to address, and I feel that it's extremely overused and overfocused...

It feels like everyone brings up the phrase  ''mental health' and it sounds so blatantly pseudo-progressive and like they're just feeling obligated to conform and like they really understand how humans function or just say this to fit in and I hate it.

to me, mental health has such negative connotations and is often directly tied to things I don't support like medication and psychiatry. It feels like it reduces humans to a robotic mechanism or something.

What about emotional health? When you're feeling sad, had an abusive relationship, feeling stressed out, anxious etc, I'd just prefer to call these emotional health issues...

I hate how any issues that aren't physical ailments, are automatically conjured up to being ""mental health issues"", like it's something you're born with and you can't control it...

when in reality, it's probably a cause and effect, something your heart endured.

719,"Just a bit of background information:

I am living at home with my parents and taking prerequisite classes to get in to physician assistant school. I have always worked but have not had a job since summer. I was taking way too many units and it was impossible for me to keep up with school and my job, so I quit. After summer classes ended, I visited family in the Bay Area (California) and decided after the trip that I wanted to move back there—I lived there for a couple of years, and I missed it so much. I talked to my aunt about it, and she said I can move in with her sometime this month. I would not have to pay rent until I get a job. I have been applying to jobs up there for the past couple of weeks but have not heard back from anyone yet. 

Anyways fast forward to now. Today I got a call from a medical group in my home city asking if I am still interested in their (paid) scribe internship. The lady said if I was still interested, I could give her a call back to set up an interview. I applied to this place back in March and from what I have learned, it is a pretty competitive internship and is great for people applying to grad schools in the medical field. The doctor that oversees this program is my primary care physician.

I grew up in the city that I am currently in and I just feel stuck here. I don't feel as happy here as I do in the Bay Area. That is why I had my heart set on moving, but now I am not so sure what to do. Should I schedule an interview or should I just continue applying to places in the Bay Area? Or both?

I have family members who let me stay with them rent-free, paying for my medical expenses and meds. While I am so incredibly grateful for everything, I also feel very suffocated because I have no privacy (they come into my bedroom anytime), I am constantly forced to participate in religious activities, adopt their values, keep to their schedule, and not allowed to leave the house unless we're all together going somewhere. I'm not even allowed to go out the backyard after sundown, in case there are intruders (we're in a good neighborhood). When I do things they disapprove of, they mention everything they've done for me: ""you need us more than we need you"", ""you're not helping with the rent, so you're not really entitled to privacy"".

I mean no one is good looking or ugly to me, people have different features, but I don't find anything attractive. I thought everyone is like this but apparently not, now I realised that besides platonically and maybe as friends I'm not attracted to anyone. I mean when I saw porn it disgusted me, the guy and the girl and I only saw a glimpse, I haven't had a crush ever and while I did think 'That person is good looking' there was nothing else.

There were multiple times when someone I knew died (like my grandpa) or a friend left me and I just felt nothing, not only people I also don't get attached to hobbies either, I played basketball for 7 years and It was a big part of my childhood, but quitting it didn't even upset me in the slightest bit.

738,"Since the COVID lockdowns happened, I’ve spent about 100 hours gaming on Warzone. 


I lost my job and spent most of my days applying for work or playing games. Prior to lockdown, I was mostly focused on dancing and working out at Golds gym. I was far more motivated to learn new skills too (data science, programming, etc.). 


Since the downturn happened, I found myself digging myself deeper into the rabbit hole of gaming. While unemployed, my girlfriend would go to work for 8-10 hours a day, and I spent 6-7 playing Call of Duty. 


I’d break to eat and of course clean up the house when needed, but that’s it. Outside of doing anything else other than gaming is extremely difficult to do. I feel time running out on me because I’m extremely unhappy with my current position. 

I accepted a job for $65k but I’m unhappy and want to do something else. I thought about programming, software development, and even took a few course in data science. But again, video gaming for 8-10 hours a day seems damn near impossible. 


I want to turn this thing around, but I also don’t know how to break my addiction. I work from home, I do zoom meetings on mute and play the game while I’m supposed to be “learning.” 


Guys, I need help and I need it now. At 30 years old, I do not want to continue working as a data entry manager. It’s tedious, mundane, and nothing about the work I do sparks my interest or makes me feel good about waking up and getting the shit done. 


I think ideally, I’d like to join a community of new programmers or developers to motivate and hold me accountable for the foreseeable future. As a newcomer, I’d certainly like someone to hold me accountable moving forward. 


Thanks! Any tips are welcomed!

739,"There is this guy in my class, who I have known for more than three years now, and he makes my life so much more difficult than it needs to be. Oh, so you have a feel for how mature we are (or should be) - about 18.

I have seen this guy do such disgusting things, and he is probably the most unlikable person I have ever met. He is just a bad person, really.

* Socially inept, rude, always looking for attention but viewing it as a bad thing when other people do it.
* Never writes down homework, but instead copies it from and uses us so he can go hiking and partying instead of doing schoolwork. Gets upset when people say he is wrong, can’t take criticism.
* Has a bad temper, and when he’s angry, oh, does he get loud. He is loud either way, laughing so loudly, basically screaming when excited, people in his proximity (or maybe just me) wince.
* He is kind of slimy. Licks the teacher's boots and is overly polite when they are there, but spouts vicious insults about them (with little reason, it's like ""they are teachers - therefore bad"", and a lot of the time he just insults their appearance) when they're gone.
* He lies a lot, also to avoid doing work or to get out of mildly difficult situations. 
* He raises his hand in class often and asks dumb questions, ones that derail the class for 5 min or just things the teacher almost certainly don't know off the top of their head, or just ""do you know x person""? Or something weirdly specific like ""what's the boiling point of x"", which he could easily look up himself. (One time, someone wanted to show a picture from their phone (took at most like 1,5 min) to the teacher and he said ""can't you do it in the break"", so that's pretty hypocritical.

So, he is a bad person, but a pretty harmless one. The examples I put don't sound that bad, but all these small things pile up, so many of them, that he just becomes unbearable.

I’m ridiculously scared of conflict - just the thought has made my hands shake - so I have never really said anything, instead fueling all my anger into telling everyone about the newest thing he has done, all the time. It has gotten to the point of people walking away from me when I bring him up.  
In fact, I am weak. Whenever he is actually there, I just roll over. You want a page of paper I'll never get back? Go ahead. You want my pencil sharpener for the one-hundredth time that I will have to remind you to return? And glue? Sure. You want to know what homework was, again, like always? Okay. You want to ...borrow my jacket? ... Alright.  
And whenever he is gone it's like the spell is broken and I ask myself what the hell just happened.

Many people in our class dislike him, and the ones that have the most classes with him (like me) have been bonding over our hatred towards him. And as cathartic as it is, I feel kind of bad for talking so horribly behind his back?

It’s mostly about actions he has taken, things he did that are really obnoxious, but my brother has suggested that we are kind of bullying him… and what if that’s true? (oh my god, a quick search told me that yes, this counts as social bullying, since we are spreading rumors. Great.)

Yes, we have a gossiping ring about him, yes, we almost complain about him every day, yes, we have started a “manifesto”  where we write down all the bad things he has done, trying to remember as many instances as possible. Yes, we wish for his lies to bite him in the ass.

What should I do? I don’t really want to be so two-faced, but I can’t not get angry, and talking about it is the way I have been coping. Additionally, he is a person you can’t argue with, and I’d rather not rile him up to the point of him screaming at me. Should I try confronting him anyways?",09Oct2020,1

When it stopped, I tried to get a photo or video while yelling to let her go and that I’ve called the police. The only photo I got was a blurry image of the ground. The car started to take off, so I pounded on the windows and it hit me, knocking me to the ground before speeding off. I made it back to my friends and called the police. I didn’t see the license and never saw the people. I couldn’t even describe the car beyond it being a light colored sedan with dark tinted windows. After the police left, I completely fell apart, crying and hyperventilating, wishing there was more that I could have done.

If he died today I would get over it in 2 minutes, and probably not care. It’s really hard for me to say that because even thinking like that is probably a sin. 

I have some friends who care about me, but I don’t care about them. I just like or dislike them.

I really want to have a wife and children one day, but I know that I should not do that, because I would just give up on them at the first sign of difficulty because I can’t love anyone, and if you don’t love anyone it’s really hard to do things for them and sacrifice things.

I am getting really upset at the little things. He doesn't put the toilet seat down. He doesn't clean up after himself. He has taken over my living room, during the day he sprawls himself across the couch while doing work, and at night he makes it into an ESPN/Fortnite arena.

749," 

I'm from an upper middle class family, and currently a senior in high school. Last year, during the middle of my junior year, I was trying my very best to the point that I was willing to sacrifice my social life but for some reason I was getting all B's for term 2. I swear to god, I was trying my best, I just didn't know what was going wrong. My parents yelled at me and told me that I was slacking, but I was insisting that I was trying my best. I felt very frustrated and angry with them, and I just wanted to run away. I felt underappreciated, and I felt like a loser because they also compared me to their friends' kids who were apparently doing much better than me and yet still have a social life.

However, I'm also from a financially stable family, so I always feel that I shouldn't be feeling this way because if I do feel this way towards my parents then I'm probably spoiled.

However, at the same time I love my parents for who they are, even if they do drive me nuts sometimes, and I dread the day where I would lose them. And I know that they love me too. Sometimes I don't tell them everything that is happening with my life, because I'd rather that they don't need to know everything about my life. I know this because they show concern for me, and they care about me. They get on my back about grades because they want me to b successful, not to make me feel like shit. They show concern for me and care about me like any parent should. Basically, sometimes they drive me nuts and make me depressed/sad/angry, but other times I have happy times with them and I enjoy being around them.

I always feel that there are only 2 types of parents, those who you seriously hate because they're abusive, and those you love because they raise you the best they can and work hard to give you a good life.

Is it normal for a teen not to tell everything to their parents? Is it normal for teens to keep secrets from parents?

751,"Hi everyone! I hope this post finds everyone well. :)

So, here's some context for why I'm asking this advice (warning for a long story ahead):
My mother and my older half brother (he's 12 years older than me) have an estranged relationship. He's always intimidated my mom for most of her life and it wasn't until a few years ago she finally started to stand up for herself against him.

My older brother grew up with surface level people that don't believe in emotions, talking about things, etc and that believe their way is the right way and that everything should be on their terms. As such he is extremely hard to talk to because no matter what you try to say to him he gets pissed off and says ""thanks for making me feel like a piece of shit"" and other deflective remarks but never wants to discuss anything civilly. He always runs away and blames the other person. He hates that my mom stands up to him now.

Anywho, he had met this woman last year and he got engaged to her last winter. But the relationship isn't healthy because she had admitted to us she lets him be rude and crude because she don't want to lose him. But that's a whole other story. Anywho, my older brother kept saying, and so did his fiancee, that she wanted family (since she had none according to both of them) and while me, my mother and my other brother weren't comfortable with their relationship we thought ""well...we'll see where this goes. We can't do anything about it.""

Anywho, a huge fight broke out around March because my brother was scared since his fiancee's daughter had gotten into trouble at school for supposedly doing inappropriate things and then told us she was cutting herself and wanted me and my mom to help him and take care of the girl (who's a preteen) because he's ""not good with this emotional stuff"". We tried talking to him about what was going on, and then my brother told his fiancee to come talk to us and by the sounds of it...She had no clue he had came to us for help. But of course the fiancee never told us this directly and when we tried talking to them about what they've tried to do to help the girl they then proceeded to tell us we were ""making too big of a deal out of this"" and when we tried telling them we were just asking questions they hung up and didn't call us again.

So, I eventually messaged both of them trying to get them to talk; I was polite, respectful, explained what we were doing, that we were just trying to help, etc. I even apologized if I had the wrong words or tone or so (my mother was fed up so she did not message or call them herself; I was testing the waters.)
But my brother never acknowledged the message and the fiancee had some half assed response that went similar to ""well we were just thinking you would ge a positive influence on (little girl's name)"" but did nothing to actually try to address the situation or further talk about it.

(By the way there's a lot more details to this story but I'm just summing up the jist of it because we'll be here all day if I don't, so don't take this as the entire story.)

Anyway, we then found out not too long later than my mom, I and my other brother were blocked on FB. I didn't really give a shit but my mom did because my half brother, no matter how furious he was with her, never did that to her and it hurt deeply. She said she was done. 
But then my older brother called out of nowhere in the summer and asked if mom would like to cut his hair. Mom asked why we were blocked on Facebook, brother proceeds to say we aren't blocked, Mom tries telling him he did and to go look and he hangs up and doesn't speak to us again.

Fast forward to Sunday this last week and my mom had to go to the hospital because she had a major heart attack and had to get a triple bypass done. And I had to message my older brother and let him know about it and then it opened Pandora's box. My mom told me just a little bit ago that my older brother talked to her and told her they ""had to stop doing this "" and then rambled on about his future plans and such...
But my Mom is still hurt. My older brother has hurt her so much throughout her life and she is just done. But I don't know if she'll be able to tell him that in her condition; the last thing she needs is all this crap while she's recovering-especially because I think stress was one of the biggest reasons this heart attack happened (and even if it isn't I still don't want my mom worrying about stress while she's trying to recover).

So...As the title says, should I message or call my brother and just tell him that even though he thinks we can all just bury the hatchet and pretend nothing happened, that's not possible and Mom is hurt and isn't ready to have him in her life? Or do I just sit back and wait to see how it unfolds?

752,"We weren't perfect but he was my best friend. We moved too quickly, living together after three months. Things were amazing at first but I come from a predatory childhood and I have a lot of insecurities. I think I had been in so many toxic relationships that with time, I became the toxic one. I loved him the best I could but I couldn't trust him and as I began to question our relationship he stopped loving me.

The end was me asking him who a certain girl was, by then he had already told all of his friends and family our problems so it was easy for them to say, ""leave her."" He always had asked that if I had doubts to bring them up but for some reason, he didn't mean that.

I struggle with PTSD and anxiety. He was the first man I could trust to be alone with after my assault, even if it had been a year before. He was not only my boyfriend but my best friend. So it absolutely broke my heart when he kicked me out. We couldn't live together, he didn't trust me. Then he stopped calling and before I knew it, he took it all back. Any sweet comment or promise, he accused me of lying about my assault, he turned completely against me bad mouthing me to all he knew. Then he would go back, he'd call and say he missed me and he wanted to see me. To be met with the same coldness the next day. I noticed that every conversation consisted of "" my dad, sister, friend.. so on"" His mom asked me to be patient, he would come around but he never did.

I begged him. I sought therapy and trauma specialty counsel. I even signed up for psychology classes on close relationships but he grew colder. I started going to the gym and I took off my social media. Eventually the only things that came out of his mouth were lowball insults about my childhood, rape and trauma. He left me a voicemail to break up, called me while I was working.

I know I wasn't perfect. I never meant to hurt him. I know that a relationship meant for me won't be fragile. It's been over a month, I've lost a bunch of weight, and I have focused in school. My assault investigation is in full proceedings and so I haven't had the energy to go out and clear my head. I wanted to so badly work things out; I was so insecure that someone so great could love me that I ruined things for myself. I feel like I have blame for him losing my trust but I can't accept the treatment that came after.I haven't reactivated my social media, I don't think I plan to. I wake up nearly everyday hoping he is thinking of me too. It took me so long to trust someone again for him to abandon me so coldly, I can't shake off the hurt.",09Oct2020,1

756,"i’m a 19 year old college student majoring in psychology. from what i’ve learned so far in school, i believe my mom is a narcissist. i didn’t understand why she was the way she was as a child, but i feel like now i do. 

my mom is an elementary PE teacher. she makes way less money than what my dad made, and yet she still refuses to make any of the necessary lifestyle changes. she still gets cosmetic procedures, still pays $400+ to get her hair done, etc. she doesn’t have money to blow like that. 

we made an agreement that i would get a job and pay for my living expenses, and my rent would come out of my college money that my dad had saved up for me. since my dad is no longer in my life, my mom took control over the account. but to be honest, i don’t trust her to be in charge of it. is there a way for me to get it put in an account under my name? 

i see this as the first step to removing my mon from my life. we have an incredibly toxic relationship and i’m on my last nerve with her. she gave me a traumatic childhood, is the reason i have an eating disorder, and so many other issues. i’ve just never been fully independent, so i’m nervous. but i think i’m ready.",09Oct2020,1
757,"Hi all! I've been getting increasingly worried about my sister (late 20s) and where she'll end up in life, I'm trying to motivate her but I don't know how to help.

A bit of background, she has good qualities but doesn't really have drive to do anything. She likes to drink and play video games for fun, has tried a few things but doesn't really put a lot of effort into her goals. She's been addicted to drugs for a bit, and every time she's about to quit, its like there's nothing waiting for her so she relapses. Because she lives at home rent free, she works when she wants to and spends most of the day in her bed. 

I've tried getting her interviews and she's looked into free therapy, but doesn't really follow through. I am also a full time student and in an apprenticeship so I don't have a lot of time and money.

763,"I feel like I have shitty feelings towards a friend, but I can't help overcome these feelings enough to sound sensible around them

I'm a digital artist who has hardly ever done commissions, it's something I feel very self conscious about. My best friend who we'll call Jordan has been very encouraging over the years of me becoming an artist. Over the years I've heard stuff like ""I'll be the first person you get a commission from :)"" and ""ha ha, I love your art, you're my favorite artist"" and whatnot, having long committed conversations about doing art. It feels good to have a friend who comes off as genuine about their interest encouragement. For years I've been told they would commission me ASAP, which is a nice idea to have in mind.

I opened up commissions in beginning of 2020. Surprisingly I've gotten a few commissioners, but never from Jordan. They're not a well-off person, but there's a bit of some weird elaborations about how they pay their rent I will not go into. I've always felt like confronting them about if they really meant it when they said they would commission me, but I've put it off many times because it feels like I'm hurting the friendship by forcing them to feel bad and pity me, which I never want to happen with anyone in general. In this context, I feel like I would just be robbing myself from the good feeling of getting a commission from a good friend.

It wasn't until last week I found out they've commissioned others a week ago, three in particular totaling to about a 100 bucks, and quite frankly I feel very betrayed as a result. Years of Jordan's pep talk feels lost to me now, both of which involving my personal confidence in doing art and our friendship in general, as if I've been just fed false encouragement for the sake friendship that now feels superficial. I've been open to commissions the whole year, putting up reminders and everything, hell, talking about my commissions with them. Suddenly seeing them spend big cash on someone else feels heartbreaking to the point I've been unable to focus on anything since.

I've been on and off about confronting Jordan finally, but I'm worried this is just going to end up being a case of being pitied upon, which feels like a ""win""-lose situation as mentioned earlier. Stressing me out even worse is the possibility we'll just stop talking again for a very long time, knowing specific situations in the past. I don't want that to happen, but I've been really feeling like telling them what's been on my mind.

Am I overworking myself on these feelings? Should I \*not\* tell them about it? Why or why not? What else should I consider if I do in fact confront them? That is what I would like advice from today, thank you for time reading this",09Oct2020,1

My mom had taken in a French Bulldog a few Years back (Don't remember what Year it was.),as in his owners pretty much dropped him off at our House with nothing but a leash and no warning. (My mom was already thinking about taking him in since his owners mentioned he wasn't getting along with his Dad,which they also had.) Originally that visit was just supposed to Test if he and our Cat would get along. My mom was the one that bonded the Most with him. I never really bonded with him. He's 10 Years old now,and 2 days ago started breathing really audibly and heavily. My mom took him to the Vet,and it turns out he has a Tumor in his Throat that is making it difficult to breathe,eat and pretty much everything for him. Now she has to face if she wants to Put him down,or try to have it operated. An operation isn't even guaranteed to succeed. He's 10 Years old,blind and has had a History of Medical issues. (Nothing unusual for French Bulldogs.) So there is a good chance an operation wouldn't be possible,or that he wouldn't survive it. She was in Tears telling me about this. I struggle with expressing and dealing with certain emotions,so i don't know how to help her cope with that. (Since i was raised with the good old ""suck it up"" from her husband. So i have issues helping other People deal with their emotions.Also possibly undiagnosed mental stuff,but that's not the Point.) I hate seeing her like this.

It seems as though they agree on everything, they have absolutely everything in common. Their communication is great, they write literal letters back and forth to one another constantly. They have video-called with one another and talked on the phone many times. It’s only been maybe a little over 2 weeks, and they have already talked about marriage and plans for the future.

He hasn’t done anything wrong per say... He doesn’t really show any sign of red flags to me.

775,"My SO and I bought our first apartment in April, we love living here, the mortgage is cheap and for the most part most of our neighbors are nice and friendly. Except one.

We live on the top floor of a 4 story building, and surprisingly the people who share a wall with us have been driving us nuts for the last six months. I first noticed that they were arguing constantly while small children screamed in the background. This went on about every other day for about two months. 

I suffer from migraines, about a week ago i was very fed up as I was in massive pain while their kids were screaming while running back and forth in their apartment so I knocked firmly on their wall to let them know I could hear them very clearly. (I couldn’t knock on their door even if I wanted to, we don’t share a hallway or stairwell with them and I don’t have access to theirs) to which they just banged back on the wall.

Just to be clear, I completely understand that children make noise. Every apartment we’ve lived in thus far has had small children that we had no issues with. There are tons of kids that live in the complex, and they are sometimes noisy outside on the play structure- which is fine, because it’s not on the other side of my wall. It seemed like between their arguing, screaming and stomping that the noise was a little excessive.

Afterwards, the wife stood knocking and ringing our doorbell for over 40 mins! I don’t answer the door to people I don’t know because the neighborhood we live in is a little sketchy and I’m 5’2”, 105lbs and was not up for confrontation without my SO being home. Not to mention, standing outside our apartment knocking for 40 mins seemed very aggressive, especially after banging back on the wall.

My SO got home later that evening and was able to go over and talk to them (by figuring out after a while which buzzer was theirs) and ended up talking to the husband. He said the conversation was civil and they exchanged numbers so we could send them a text if they were being too noisy! Great! Also, their kids are 2,5 and 5 years old. 

A week later and I have still been hearing non-stop noise. Early hours of the morning that I’m woken up from, Sunday’s, you name it. There isn’t a second of quiet from these people between their arguing, stomping and screaming. 

Today we had some guests over, and after we heard their children running back and forth in their apartment for an hour or so with shoes on by the sounds of it. We decided it was reasonable to send them a polite text to let them know it was a little loud. (Also, there is an awesome play structure outside that I never see them using, and I’m not sure about anyone else but I wasn’t allowed to run around in my parents house on a secluded one acre property when I was kid, running and jumping are outdoor activities!)

The husband said he wasn’t home, but he’d let his wife know and was polite back. We got a super passive-aggressive text message from his wife’s number about 15 minutes later about how “children are going to play!” And “that’s what happens when you live in an apartment building” and complained about us being noisy because they could hear our two guests talking and made it seem like we have parties every other weekend. Last time we had guests was June, and everyone left by 10pm.

We don’t listen to loud music inside, we’re both very light on our feet, we don’t party very often at all and have never had a noise complaint in our history of renting / owning. It’s frustrating that they have little compassion for the fact that we have to listen to them constantly. We can’t just move out because we can’t afford to live anywhere else and we have to own it for at least a year before we can sell again. (Law in my country) 

Talking to them obviously doesn’t seem to be working.  I don’t feel like conversing with them either when they’re so passive aggressive towards us. Is it unreasonable to ask that their kids not run in the house and that they not scream at each other all day? What more can we do about it? 

TLDR; my neighbors with two kids scream, argue and stomp all day excessively. We tried talking to them politely and were met with aggression that has pretty much closed the dialogue. Are we being unreasonable for asking them to quiet down when it’s worsening my migraines, interfering with our sleep and my husbands work schedule? What can we do about it?",09Oct2020,1

This occurred in the first 2 weeks. I ate 1 meal for the day and every activity I enjoyed doing I wasn’t, that being swimming, gymming and video games. I was still handling my assignments and quizzes and actually performing very well, but became too overwhelmed with the stuff I was reading online and begun believing I set myself up to be a failure (especially after reading something about chemistry after Covid and how screwed it will be). My anxiety that I had from when I was 12 (after daddy passed away) seemed to come back up and, In a haste decision I dropped out of the university before the tuition applied so that my scholarship wouldn’t be compromised. I am currently in the process of deferring the scholarship to study in 2021, thereafter, I will be able to start back chemistry at Waterloo in 2021 or change the program of study. I originally thought to try for faculty of maths, but being in the caribbean means I cannot do the euclid, and even though my math grade for high school over the last 2 years are 97-99% (our scheme is weird, I got a distinction which means 93-100% but based on my merit placement in the caribbean I assume it’s around the place I put it)., I still don’t think I can compete and also I shut off that choice because while I enjoy programming, I don’t enjoy doing all of that maths, especially having to keep up my grade so high to maintain the scholarship. So seeing compsci as a maths based program, I pushed it aside.

The last thing I considered was to start medicine in my hometown university in 2021 though where usually people go specialize in the UK after graduating from MBBS. I’m not even sure how that process works. However, in my mind I’m wondering if I’m losing out on this experience of studying away that I might never get again, but then COVID pops up making me wonder when the hell I’ll even get to go abroad and study and then wtf would I even do because I’m so turned off by chemistry’s prospects even if it is my passion. Then if I stay in trinidad, I’m going to be 3 years behind all my friends who started studying as soon as high school finished and have been succeeding.

783,"I'm 24M, and have a job paying about $100k. Just started 2 weeks ago and just graduated this July. I have the option of getting a house or moving to an apartment. Technically I can stay home too but I wanted to go see what this ""being independent"" thing is all about. And frankly, I can afford to and figure that a couple years down the line I'll, hopefully, be married and would need to move out anyways. This way, however, I get some experience taking care of my self without relying on my parents and just get to work on me for a bit.

Anyways, my parents are an above middle class family. Not super rich but still more so than the average middle class family. Due to some circumstances of my mom remarrying I have a fairly large inheritance from my biological father. My point is that I have some money that my mom is saying I can use for down payment on a house. There aren't any nice house I'd like to buy in town but there is a new neighborhood building around my $500k budget since that's the amount of loan I pre-qualified for. I'll be able to put a big down payment on that, $200k or even more potentially. Which would reduce my payments to probably less than or equal to the $1400/month apartment I'm considering. 

I'm single and don't really need a whole house, maybe for a couple years. I plan to state here until an external force like getting married potentially makes me move. But it's a good area and I shouldn't have too much trouble selling the place in a couple years if I decide to move. The house will clearly end up costing a bit more due to all the maintenance and other things you end up paying for when getting a house. 

I'm not sure what I should do. I'm getting some gear of missing out on the house. Like I said it's a nice spot in town and I'm afraid if I don't grab it now I won't get a chance for a spot again. I just like the neighborhood area with sidewalks and such instead of the more open areas. I feel those neighborhood areas are running out and if I miss this one then I might not get a chance. Not sure what I should do. Thank for any help and let me know if I can provide more info in case I missed something relevant.",09Oct2020,1

So I have a cousin who drops off their kid at my house a lot and Unannounced and all.my parents make me babysit him and he came over one day when I was playing with my friends so he joined in. when he went home he said my friends are mean they complained to my mom and they said I couldn’t play with my friends when he’s over what should I do?",09Oct2020,1
785,"
So for a bit of backstory. I've known this friend for 2 years now and we're good friends. She came out as bi last month and broke up with her gf a few days ago.

I've never had a boyfriend or girlfriend in my entire life and I've never liked someone, so this is all new for me. I don't really know if I like her as in love interest or as someone I like to be around. I considerd myself heterosexual up untill 2 weeks ago. I then started to notice I was growing feelings for her and now I don't know what my sexual orientation is.

I asked my other friend who has had a boyfriend for advice. She really wanted to know who it was, but I couldn't say it because they're also close friends (and I dont want anyone to know that I'm interested in her).

I was hanging out with her and my other friend toaday. My other friend brought the subject up again and now she I knows I have a 'crush' on someone. I revealed I was interested in a girl and they were all really supportive.

But now I don't know what to do. I don't know if I like her or if I want a relationship with her. I don't even know what my sexual orientation is. And i'm almost 100% sure she isn't interested in me. And if I say I'm interested in her, things could get akward, I don't want to risk that. What do I do?",09Oct2020,1
786,"So about a couple of months ago a guy asked for my number in college and I saw him around campus a couple of times. He was cute but I was in a bad relationship and although I really wanted to give it, I didn’t. 

A while later I left my relationship because I was not happy and now I’ve been reminded of that guy and can’t stop thinking about him and what could have been. I only met him 3 times. 

I found his friend’s social media but not his. I spoke to his friend once or twice too. I’m not sure if I should message his friend and ask for the guys number. I feel like I’ll sound like a stalker and crazy. Should I message him? I always be scared of making decisions and I feel like this is a decision I should make. But I don’t want to come across crazy.

789,"As a kid, I was jolly and playful who used to enjoy things. Now I am always sad, I rarely laugh in real life neither do I cry ever. I used to be a cinephile but I haven't seen a film in months now, I can't bring myself to see one. I find interest in nothing except workout and ufc. I am mostly cold, distant, and emotionless with everyone in my life. People take this as being ""rude"" and ""arrogant"" but I am not. I have just become that way, intentionally or unintentionally. I don't get angry as one would say but I'm pissed off most of the time. I am the definition of always being in a bad mood, I swear on this fact. Nothing or no one excites me, I can't even remember when was the last time I was excited about something.

Adding to all this, I am also a 20yrs old straight aromantic male, I am not asexual. I have never ever been in a romantic relationship with anyone. I think, why to waste someone's time when you know that you can't give them love, affection, and all the things normal functioning people have. 
Also, I don't really understand what LOVE is? 

My parents and family members are worried about me now, seeing how pathetic my social skills are and they worry about what will I do in the ""society"" if I continue to behave like this.
I have come to terms with the fact that I should not marry and have kids.
I'll be destroying the lives of a woman and 2-3 kids if I were to get married.
I see how I am cold, distant, zero socially, and aromantic, I should not destroy the life of an innocent woman.

I don't make so many friends, to begin with, and the ones that I had are now also distant. I never and I mean never been the first one to reach out to someone. I'll do it for the starting phases of conversations and skip contacting people totally after some time.
It's the same with my 11 years old friends and first cousins.
It's always them reaching out to me.
I don't understand this arrogance and nature of mine.

I'm not a bad person, at least I don't think so. I live by the motto of ""Live and Let Live"". I wish well, happiness, and peace for all mankind but also with a request to stay away from me.
I love sitting, living, and working in dark rooms. I don't like light even if I am writing something, I'll use a minimum amount of light. My mother gets so worried and annoyed by this. I thought that the University will change me but it didn't happen. 

I never hug, kiss, and greet my parents and siblings and they are the world to me.
Talk of other family members is a far cry.

Even if something good happens, it is not able to make me feel happy for a long period of time.
It's like my brain is now engineered to stay sad, stay cold, and be distant.
I rarely talk, did I mention that?
My family members count the words I speak during a day as a joke.

I love loneliness and I am alone even in the group. I like sitting in my room for most periods of time when I'm home. I almost never connect with people and they very soon begin to creep me out and I'm sure that I'm doing the same to them. There is never anything common between me and people.

I also have many ""Whys"" with this universe, world, culture, and society. I dislike most things about them. I don't get most things about them. 

It feels so odd and sad when I see other youngsters going out, smiling, laughing, and having a good time like most youngsters do and should do. My uncle says that I straight away became a bitter old man from a kid. He calls it ""sublimation"". 

It's like a mental battle to be very honest. My heart tells me to be social, talkative, be happy and live, for you are only 20yrs old young man with almost everything that you could want or need but my brain is winning and have been winning for some time now.
Sometimes, it feels like a curse, it feels like bad luck.
I wish if there was a cure but seems difficult.

Maybe, this is because I am not doing in life which I really wanted to do. Maybe, this is because I didn't do so many things that I should have done by now.",09Oct2020,1
790,"Ok so I (16m) am dating this girl (17f) since January this year, and it has been great. I love her very much and we are really close. I don't think I keep any secrets from her, at least nothing that is relevant for our relationship. We have already dated in the past but it didn't work out really well so we broke up. But 'm glad we did because it made me grow as a person and I feel in a much, much healthier relationship. But there is this one thing that I am not sure if I should worry about; I was scrolling through my Instagram dms when I found a chat I had with a girl I don't really know a long time ago, when me and my current gf were beggining to date for the first time. The chat only contains a message which is me answering the girl's Story with a red X. Now I know it was probably one of those Instagram games where the person answers some questions without revealing the actual questions and if you want to see the questions you have to answer the story with a specific emoji (in that case being the red X). Well I am worried it wasn't one of this games, what if it was one of those stories where the person says ""answer this story if you'd make out with me"". I know this sounds really stupid since I have never considered cheating on my girlfirend, I remember being constantly worried that she would cheat on me and would always make it very clear that I didn't have interest in any other girls (which is absolutely true). There is absolutely nothing that would make me think I was actually hitting on that girl except for the fear of having been unfaithful. I know I could explain it to my gf and she probably wouldn't be mad because she knows me, she knows I would never cheat on her. But at the same time I feel so stupid for asking for forgiveness over something I would never do and don't remember doing. I hate the fact that I can't see what Story it was, I feel like it would help to know what actually happened. Part of me wants to just forget it but the other is too worried that I might have been a terrible boyfriend. This is not the first time I get worried over something that could very unlikely have happened. That's why I am asking for advice. What should I do?",09Oct2020,1
791,"My mum smokes way too much than the average person. She has been a chain smoker for almost 20 years and her smoking continues to worsen with time. She smokes more than just a packet of cigarettes a day and doesn’t realise the negative affect it has on her health. Although she has spent a lot of money on using alternatives such as vape, somehow she always results to smoking cigarettes instead. I’m not even being exaggerative but if someone calls her, she’ll smoke non-stop until the end of the phone call and her phone calls usually last between 30 minutes to an hour. When we go out to places like a cafe, she always decides to sit outside no matter the weather just so she can smoke about 3 cigarettes one after the other and it breaks my heart because she doesn’t realise the harm she is causing for herself. She has a continuous cough that she has had for many years which I know is due to her chain smoking but she claims it’s because of something else and that it’s nothing to worry about. Tonight, as she laid down in bed she was coughing a lot until she threw up. This is not the first time and I tried to tell her that it’s because she smokes too much and that she needs to stop but she got really mad at me and said that I don’t care about her when I just want the best for her. No matter what me or anyone tells her, she just won’t listen and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to overthink or be overdramatic but I constantly have the worry of her dying soon because she just smokes way too much. I’m almost 16 and I’m afraid my mum won’t be here later in the future when she is everything to me. I love her so much and I hate seeing her ruin herself she just doesn’t understand and won’t stop smoking. I know it might be hard to give me advice for this but I really just needed to vent.

792,"I live in apartment complex. My dog can bark a lot when theres a lot going on, but that's only really an issue during busy parts of the day when lots of kids are playing. 

Probably about a month ago around 3pm, she was barking at a kid on a bike as I was taking her potty, and the neighbor in the building across from me (his building is a couple hundred feet from mine, it's not a cramped complex) came out to yell at me about it. The conversation went basically like

Him: Shut that dog the hell up!
Me: Uh... I have to take her potty.
Him: Make her shut up.
Me: Well shes a dog, being a dog. (At this point she's barking at him because, shocker, she wasnt a fan of a man yelling at us from far away)
Him: she's disturbing the peace! 
Me: So are you be screaming at us from all the way over there. You're really just making things worse, leave us alone. 

And at that point he just stood there and watched us until I was able to get my dog to go potty and head back inside. 

Now if he hears my dog bark once or happens to be outside/see us outside he'll come stand and watch us. He just stood and watched us for about 10 minutes while my dog quietly sat next to me while I was talking to my downstairs neighbors. He wasnt outside beforehand and he very blatantly was watching me and my dog, nasty look on his face with his arms crossed.

The noise policy in the complex is to ""keep all your noise within your apartment"" such as music, barking, tv, sports nights etc. However theres always going to be noise, its unrealistic to think there will genuinely be no noise existing outside in the complex. Theres kids playing and yelling, other dogs barking (I also wonder if hes under the impression that every time he hears a dog bark it's my dog or something?), car noises, the walls are thin, if I don't have the tv on I can hear people talking when they're out front of the building. Basically if that rule was genuinely enforced no one would be aloud outside their apartment.

That being said, I'd like to make a complaint but theres also technically no policy he cant stare at me from his front porch, either. I dont want this to turn into me getting a complaint every time he hears a dog bark. I just am really uncomfortable being watched all the time. I'm hoping someone else has dealt with a similar situation 

Tldr my dog annoyed this guy that also lives in my apartment complex and now he watches us all the time and I dont know what I can do about it",09Oct2020,1
793,"A couple hours ago I was on the phone with my dad, we usually phone each other once a fortnight on a Friday and just talk about how our 2 weeks have been and when we run out of things to talk about, I play songs on Spotify that we’ve recommended to each other. Anyway, we had started listening to different songs and he asks me to play ABBA’s song As Good As New. The song had finished and I can’t remember what he said, just admiring it saying how great it was, then there was silence for a couple seconds and he sighed a bit so I ask if he’s alright. He just lets out this absolutely agonised cry. I’ve never heard anything like it, just pure pain in his voice and I’m trying to ask him what’s wrong but he couldn’t stop crying. Swear down probably the most frightening thing I’ve ever heard, I can’t even put into words how sick it made me feel hearing my Dad in so much emotional pain. He eventually calms down and I ask him what happened and he starts explaining how some songs bring back memories to him and he thought he would be fine listening to this song but he thought wrong. I feel horrible because I think he thought he scared me. I’d be lying if I said it didn’t but I didn’t want him to think that. He just asks to move away from the subject and pretend it never happened and we carry on listening to music. I have a feeling it might be to do with my parents divorce that happened a few years ago, my mum is a fan of ABBA so I imagine that might be what set him off. The divorce happened about 8 years ago and I always knew that he wasn’t completely over it but I didn’t think it was that bad. He never directly said why he started crying but I’m pretty sure it might be because of that. Is there anything I can do? He lives in Jersey (Channel Islands) while I live in England so I can’t exactly pay him a quick visit. I’m worried about his mental health because he usually bottles these things up and I suggested maybe going to see someone about it but he thinks that no one should have to listen to his problems. If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do I’d be incredibly grateful, I don’t want my Dad going through this anymore, it’s heartbreaking",09Oct2020,1

795,"As someone who’s socially awkward and alone, not wanting to be touched isnt a factor of that. 

Because I’m someone who is alone a lot, I tend to yearn for a hug from someone. I don’t hate being touched, but throughout my life, if someone were to hug me or grab my shoulder, hand, etc... I would flinch a bit and it would have to be someone I trust in order to feel somewhat comfortable with it. My close friends have noticed this as I got older, but the reason why I don’t hug them when it’s summer and I’m back from college is because I have my own paranoia that I might make them uncomfortable since I recently came out as a lesbian even though they’re 100% supportive. My friends just view it as a regular “oh she doesn’t like hugs, that’s why she isn’t hugging us.”

I think I don’t like to be touched because I’m self conscious but it’s also a mixture of people being close to me. As stated before, I secretly yearn to be hugged but when it comes to actually hugging someone, I get anxious and wonder if I smell bad or some other negative factor. But because of me being paranoid and self conscious, my decision to not hug someone or physically give contact to someone is viewed as “oh she just doesn’t like to be touched” by my few friends. 

I guess typing this little rant/story out made me figure out that it’s me being self conscious and paranoid and anxious that leads to why presently, I don’t like to be touched, but I’m still wondering if there’s any advice on how I can ease my way into opening up to physical contact and not flinching a bit when someone grabs me or taps me or hugs me, etc...",09Oct2020,1

806,"I’ll start by saying that my best friend and I have been best friends for about a year and a half and like we tell each other mostly everything. At that time I was so excited so I told her about anime and my favorite anime. And from that point onwards like everything I watched she had to know, and like even if I blurt out a characters name from an anime, she had to know which one. Like at the beginning it was okay, but as time went on I felt forced to tell her everything, and eventually after some time I found my new addiction; manhwa’s and at the beginning I actually tried to keep it a secret for a few months, then came a day where we had to write a school play, and I suggested a name of one of the characters, and another until she noticed that I got a lot of nobly names, so after she noticed that I needed up telling her about Manhwa’s. Then came her new favorite thing; Manhwa’s...  
So she’d tell me to recommend her some, and I’d often lie and say that I don’t have any Manhwa’s to recommend, then when she’d find a manhwa and tells me about it; it is either I’ve read it or heard about it. But because she recommended a manhwa for me it felt like I was forced to return the favor, and then I’d recommend her a manhwa that i like and honestly after I recommend Manhwa’s to her, I’d lose the connection I had to it, and I’d feel forced to fangirl with her. And I’ve been like not allowing myself to be me in class for example i want to put my profile pic as a character but I’m sure that she’ll question me about what this manhwa is and what’s it about. 

Is it me just being selfish??

Or am I protecting the things that help/motivate me??

 
So basically once I’ve shared the things I like to do with her, I slowly but surely lose the connection I had with it.  And since the quarantine we talk considerably less, and it feels like we’re slowly distancing from each other. 

Like what should I do, since I’ve been sharing the things I like to do with her I’ve lost my connection to the said thing, and although I always tell myself to not tell her, I just can’t help it, and then I feel guilty in the end. 

And I don’t know if it’s just blocking her from reading Manhwa’s...

810,"19 year old here. The past few years have been interesting to say the least. There have been many situations I know I could have dealt with better, I have made my peace with that. But my parents and (some) friends/peers do not feel the same way.  I am not going to go into detail because there is no need, but now the people close to me believe I am a sociopath. I am not asking for a diagnosis because I know that I am not one. My mother revealed to me that I was supposed to see someone about personality disorder when I was younger, but she says I refused to go (must've been a long time ago, because I do not remember). And now the idea has been floating around (visibly anyway) again  in the past year or two. And before you say anything, this isn't a post about me 'misunderstanding' my parents or whatever. They have sat down with me and expressed their concerns, and said the words to my face. 

Like I said earlier, I am not going to go into details about why my friends think I am one because it involves many stories, and I would end up telling an entire life story.

I honestly don't care if my friends think I am one, or even if I am one. But I am not comfortable with my parents thinking it because I do not want it to affect our relationship, or to 'drift apart'. I am already not that close with my family, my sisters are much closer. Which I am fine with. But something just doesn't sit easily with me that my mental health is being questioned by them. Like most people, I cannot stand having health or emotional talks with my family. So I'd much prefer it if the idea just simply vanished. 

I understand this isn't a very big deal, there are worse things that can happen. But like I said earlier, I am not comfortable with my mental health being questioned, I cannot put my finger on why. Maybe its because it's something you can't see, unlike a broken bone. So it is harder to deny, or explain. This isn't something that is massively affecting my life, everything else is fine. But for reasons I am finding hard to explain, I am not comfortable with my family questioning my mental health.

I was getting really frustrated with them but I know that’s just the way they are so I held my tongue. I would vent to my mom though when I would go out to get lunch by myself or something. It all came to a head last night. Yesterday was my 21st birthday and we were having a great time, got out covid results back and just overall having a good day. The first initial thing that made me mad was I was doing a self tape for class and they were correcting my notes for a song I was playing on my ukulele. I’m really insecure about my music abilities because it doesn’t come naturally and I’ve had to work hard for them, so that made me mad but again I didn’t say anything because I hate getting into useless arguments or speaking up about things that aren’t a big deal. When we went out for my 21st birthday they bought my dinner, my drink, and a literal whole cake. We were having an awesome time but like as the night was ending and the alcohol was starting to hit them they started laying all of their problems with me out on the floor, including that they feel like I judge them so they sensor themselves around me, that they feel like I don’t listen to them, and that they always listen to me. I had no idea where any of this was coming from but obviously it was the truth evacuate after they apologized and said that they just get in their feelings when they’re drunk, but still continued to push the issue of me not listening and tried to say that whenever they talk about people they’re interested in I don’t pay attention and just say oh and stuff like that but they always listen to me. Here’s where I fucked up. I told them it was hard to keep track because they talk about a lot of different people. Also, I’ve noticed when we talk and I try to respond with some sort of response other than oh or something a little less intrusive than advice or questions, they argue with it. Like everything I say to them they have a but for. They also said like they wished they had more friends. The last thing I said to them was the keeping track comment and then when I asked them what was wrong they just shut down and went to bed and haven’t talked to me all day and won’t even look me in the face. Like, I’m not sure if I should approach them, if that’s gonna piss them off more, if I should just leave early. It’s like they don’t even think that I care about them at all and that really hurts. Like obviously I fucked up by not listening to them, but how was I even supposed to know something was wrong? And then when I tried to solve the problem they shut me out again.",09Oct2020,1
815,"Throwaway account to protect myself and these kids. Also, obligatory notice that I'm on mobile.

So I (18m) have been apart of a certain online group since December 2017. During my time there I've developed an older sibling/parental relationship with a group of kids ages 14-17, most from broken homes or with unstable relationships with their real parents. I do my best to provide support for these kids when they need me, and I try to encourage them and their interests because no one else in their life will.

Out of these, I have the closest relationship with two kids in specific. For privacy, I'm gonna call them T and S. They're both 14 (almost 15) and they're in a relationship with each other.

I met T when I was around 16 or 17 and they introduced me to S a few months ago. We all grew up in the same state, tho several hours apart. I currently live overseas, but I'm planning on moving back to the US as soon as possible. We all have difficult family lives full of abuse and neglect. T has divorced parents; a mom who tells them they don't want them, and a distant father. S doesn't have a dad and their mom is a racist narcissist (S is mixed), an alcoholic and a chronic liar. Neither of them have support systems irl or anyone who takes their treatment at home seriously other than myself.

Over time these kids have begun to feel like my own. I honestly love them to pieces. S cried the first time I said they were my kid and I was there for them because they'd never heard that before, which was heart-wrenching because they're a great kid. Earlier today I was told I was like the dad they never had. I cried.

When I move back to the US sometime in the next year - severing ties with my own parents - I want to take these kids with me. I'm happy to provide shelter, food, education, medical and leisure items for them, as well as emotional support and a lot of love. I will be moving to a different state than the one we grew up in. They're on board with it. Sometimes I think its the only motivation S has to keep surviving. I honestly don't think their parents would care if they were to runaway but I don't want to have to keep them in their current homes.

In case this comes up as a concern or the info is needed, there is nothing inappropriate going on between me and these kids. I keep a firm boundary and neither me nor these kids will cross that line and I am known to be incredibly harsh with predators due to my own past experiences. Just mentioning in case anyone feels this will effect what advice is given.

So does anyone have advice for how to plan to get these kids away from those homes without making their lives worse? Or any advice on how to make sure these kids are taken care of/how I can adequately provide for them in this situation? I'm no stranger to parenting (I grew up taking care of my younger siblings when my mom was unavailable) but I appreciate literally any help you guys can give.",09Oct2020,1
816,"Alright so I met this guy from tinder he’s 23 and I’m 20. We talked for a whole month over text because he was visiting family and I felt like I got to know what he’s like day to day. He got back and we had a few dates. They were amazing and so was the sex. About every topic I could possibly think of we agree on and had some really deep conversations. He was saying he wants a future with me and I’ve just never had a guy make me feel so confident.
Four weeks ago he told me his brothers 7 year anniversary of his death was on a specific day and he would probably be distant for a weekish. I’ve never lost anyone before and I assured him I was here for him and I would give him space. For the next two weeks after that he hardly texted me at all which is understandable except he started hanging out with friends every day and even went to a couple parties which I see from his snap stories. It feels like he has time for everyone but me lmao. So then he goes to another party and posted a few videos on his story hanging out with this really pretty girl super close to her. I’m not really a jealous type at all, but this didn’t sit right. I was kinda like whatever I just need to tone down what I want out of this relationship and my expectations. He finally makes plans with me and cancels. Twice. 
I have other things going on in my life and during a mental breakdown (not over him) I delete him from snapchat. I know he’s been shitty to me, but I feel like I’ve never found someone who clicks so well. I also feel like he makes me feel like I’m crazy. I deleted him yesterday and he just added me back. From an outsider perspective should I add him back? If I do what would I even say?

Tl;DR A guy I was talking too kept flaking on me and I deleted him.",09Oct2020,1
817,"I'm afraid the title about covers it. So here's the context.
My Bestfriend has had a lot of health problems over the years, but lately he's been diagnosed with a progressively worse heart problem. At first they tried chemical intervention, but it didn't take. Now the only real solution is heart surgery. Of course there's an ongoing pandemic and this is unable to happen for the moment.

Earlier today he messaged me with rather morbid news that he had finalised his will, leaving his assets to me and his mother. It really hit me there was a chance my oldest friend may die. I haven't been without him since I was 11 and even the idea of losing him is terrifying. But I know that this is something I will need to confront one way or another. So I thought maybe reaching out could help.

Any advice regarding what I can do to make this whole situation as easy for him as possible would be very appreciated, additionally and I feel selfish for even asking, any advice on how I can cope / prepare mentally for this. I've been blessed in life to experience little true loss until the recent death of my grandfather and that honestly broke me for a moment. A third thing, those who've been in this situation, is there anything you wish you'd done differently? 

I'm trying to remain positive, but I kmow the world isn't always so, I thought the above was best to ask.

He's big and muscular and all the fat cumulates around his belly so all he gotta do to is to lose some weight.

819,"So I'm gonna try to make this short

I bought a TV and it seems defective the LCD shows no picture

I contacted the manufacturer sent them a picture and they immediately dismissed it as physical damage

I bought the same model of TV from Wal-Mart as it was a good deal

Since the manufacturer is being crappy and it was no fault of my own

I thought about returning the broken one to Wal-Mart to get a refund and keeping the one that works

The serial number is only on a sticker I could peel off and just switch

If the manufacturer actually upheld there warranty and stood behind there product I would never think of doing this

But since there is a big line gong down the front of the TV and it is unwatchable I was forced to buy a new one

Now ik I should not have bought one of the same brand because of there customer service but the price was way to good to pass up and it seemed to just be a factory defect",09Oct2020,1
820,"Background-

I've been with this company for 2.5 years- with the first year being through a temp agency. Before even getting hired, I told my boss that I was in school and looking to get my nursing degree. I was told that they'd work with me and my schedule and I was hired. For the first 2 years, everything was fine and I went to my classes after work or online. If a lab (I work in a lab) was running late on a school day, my coworker and boss would stay the rest of the day and finish up (no more than a couple hours longer usually.) 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. Since March, we have been ""working from home."" I put the quotes because we're a lab and if there are no labs, there is no work. We just recently started accepting labs again like last month. Because of covid, only me or my coworker is allowed to work with my boss instead of both of us. My department had scheduled some virtual webinar thing and at first, my boss's boss wanted me to present, even though it wasn't his event or his call. So, he set up a meeting with me for me to talk to someone and him about me possibly presenting. I had mistaken the meeting time for 10:30 when it was instead 10- so around 10:25, as I'm about to login to the meeting, I get an email from him asking why I didn't join the email. I let him know that I had mistaken the time and asked if we could reschedule for another time that day- or at all. He told me he'd be busy and there's no option to reschedule. My boss ended up talking to the person behind the event and they said that his boss had no say-so about who was to present in the first place so the meeting he wanted to have with me was irrelevant anyway.

Fast forward to a few days ago. They had this said webinar over the course of a few days- doing pilates, and online karaoke event and some presentations. I was not sure if attendance was mandatory, since these seemed like company recreational events that may have been optional. I get a million webex invites a day to optional virtual events like these and I didn't know my attendance was mandatory. \[Plus all the recordings from the meetings were uploaded online so people could review them.\] Strike 2. My boss's boss emailed me asking why I didn't attend the webinars and I told him I didn't know they were mandatory but that I have been reviewing the recordings. Usually my boss, coworker and I are on the same page when it comes to meetings and we'll talk about them before attending or remind each other but I heard nothing about these. So I really thought it was optional. I messaged my coworker and boss before the presentation day of the webinar and asked what it was and if it was mandatory. No response. My coworker writes me back after the meeting is over and my boss didn't attend any of the webinars either.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, my boss's boss is pissed. He told my boss that it's best if I resign. I have been with this company for 2.5 years and have otherwise done no wrong and had no disciplinary action taken against me. I just haven't caught the hang of this ""working from home"" thing. When we were actually in the lab, there were no issues. He also said that he doesn't feel like my boss will be able to accommodate my school schedule anymore, as I have clinicals Wed-Thurs and would have to leave an hour early those days. Our schedule is sporadic and often we don't have labs for weeks. He said his boss is concerned that in the event that we have to do a late lab, and I'm the tech that's on, I can't stay those days because of clinical. We don't often have late labs. I told them to compromise, I would open my Mon and Tue completely (I have class after work) and just miss class and catch up on the powerpoints afterward. They also have my Friday completely open. No. Not good enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now they want me to resign. And I don't know what to do. They want me to find another job by the beginning of next year and resign. Please let me know what my options are! I'm only in my early 20's and I live alone. I really need this job right now.",09Oct2020,1

826,"Okay so I honestly have no idea what I'm doing fashion wise, I seem to be doing some stuff right and some stuff wrong. I just wear plain shirts and jeans and stuff most of the time and that's probably not right but also I think I went right by growing my hair out into an afro. I still have a few questions though, here they are:

1. Do you guys have any good ideas for shirts/hoodies that I could get? I'm kinda tired of wearing plain shirts and I have a feeling that it doesn't give the best impression. I know this is a kinda broad question, especially since its so heavily influenced by the personality of the wearer, so if you need more info leave a comment and I'll give the info.
2. I sometimes get women complimenting my eyebrows saying they wish they had my eyebrows, so is that a good thing or does that mean I'm too girly?
3. What is the optimal afro length? I'm at about 2 inches of floof now about and I don't want to grow it out too much but I also don't want it to be too short (I've noticed that people really seem to enjoy the longer hair, especially my best friend who loves to feel my hair). 
4. Is a light or dark color scheme better? I commonly wear darker clothes because I enjoy the look of them, but I guess I've never really considered wearing lighter clothes, and the results thereof.
5. What (not super expensive) shoes would give you a good impression about somebody? I'm going for a chill vibe, so idk if [these](https://www.amazon.com/Timberland-Groveton-Fashion-Sneaker-Steeple/dp/B01HSPQ580/) are good or not.

I'm pretty much trying to overhaul my entire look over the next few months because I want to feel confident about myself.

I would have posted this on r/teenagers but over the past few years it seems like its less about actual teenager stuff and more just shitposting, so hopefully r/advice is the right sub.

As the title suggests I would really like to change my last name to something that isn't exactly the same as my first name. Yep, my first and last name are exactly the same. I absolutely hate it. I just get weird looks at the bank or any other place where people ask for my full name. Some even laugh if they don't need to be as professional. 

The reason why my name is like that is because my dad wanted to have a common last name for everyone in the family. This is rather rare in our culture because my last name would be my grandfathers first name and my middle name would be my dad's. Basically just a list of my paternal lineage. My dad then made all my siblings' and my last name tye same as my dad's last name, which is my great-grandfathers forst name. Confusing but bear with me.

So my parents wanted me to be named after either my grandfather on mom's side, which would make my life a lot easier, or my great-grandfater, which you know all about. It ended up being my great-grandfather's name and there ya have it. My name is Thomas James Thomas (example btw, not my name).

Here's the deal I was talking with my mom the other day and brought it up. Asked her if they ever though anything about my name being what it is. She said she liked it but understood how I felt and told me to just remove my great-grandfather's name as my last name and make it my grandfather's name. I thought about it and while it was a good idea, I didn't want to 1. no longer bear my family name and 2. sorta ruin my dad's dream of having a common family name.

I spoke to my siblings and the younger ones find it weird that their last name is my first name and the older ones have just accepted it. I asked my brother, which I am the closest to and he suggested we both change our last names to our great-great-great-great-grandfathers name (which is a really interesting and meaningful name) and I loved the idea. However my brother was really hesitant and kind of backed away. 

So my issue here is what should I do? Should I just deal with it and live my mife while bearing my family's name? Should I shave it down a great-grandfather and stick to the cultural norm or should I remove everything that follows my forst name and put my great*4-greandfather's name as my last name.

But... some of those apps only work with smartphone-based operating systems, which is not OK in my opinion. Does Reddit have any suggestions for an appropriate smartphone for the poor &amp; paranoid millenial pseudohacker that never came to own a smartphone by 2020 or maybe a software program that fakes an Android operating system?",09Oct2020,1
841,"I'm starting university so it's the first time I've been away from my parents for a significant portion of time. I have my own room to myself, shower, kitchen included etc. I never had the chance to get into relationships or experiment with others because I was either too focused on studies or wasn't interested - So I am a virgin still... Though, now I'm progressing in life, it's been on my mind a lot and I finally want to find out who I am sexuality wise. But I dunno where to start.

 I've looked at apps like Grindr but apparently they're not really safe - and I want someone who you know... can show me the ropes gently and not just yknow....  Anyway - I also looked at tinder but eh, apparently that has the same problem. 

Any/all advice is greatly appreciated. Sorry for the sensitive topic.",09Oct2020,1

843,"Background: We broke up a year after the incident but stayed in touch for a couple of years and eventually drifted apart. As of the last time we spoke, she had never told a single person, not her sister or BFFL, so I just want to let her know that I'm happy for her and I never forgot. Not sure she would even care to hear from me but maybe? 

Assuming it's relevant, I'm happily married with a kid and she is married. I literally just want to send her a single message saying ""Congrats"" so she knows I never forgot what we went through but I'm not sure if that would actually just bring up worse memories.

844,"I'll copy and past what I said to them here, ""I've emotionally and psychologically manipulated and lied to my boyfriend many, many times. I've made him attempt suicide, I've made him cut himself, and I made him trust no one. I've traumatized him and caused him multiple panick attacks over the past two years.
I've lied to my parents, as well. Many times. I've made them cry.
I used to want to seriously harm my classmates. I was somewhat fond of Columbine. I'm not like that anymore.
I have anger issues and I sometimes hit my siblings and I make my sister cry with my words sometimes. She wishes me dead for the things I say to her.I have affected the entire family with my actions. My 6 year old brother says things like ""I wish i was dead"" and such.
I cant stop myself from hurting myself all the time. I just- start hitting my head violently and I cant stop myself because I need to punish myself.I've seriously upset some of my friends, partially the reason I dont want friends anymore. Because I will hurt them, guaranteed.I cut myself even though I know it upsets my mother.I am disgusting.And I deserve to kill myself.""",09Oct2020,1

And I feel like I'm the one who says good morning/ goodnight first, or starts a conversation. I know that he's busy, but I feel like if he did care about me, he'd do things like text me first or let me know when he's free so we can facetime. It kinda frustrates me that I'm always the one texting him, and it seems like he only just responds. I've brought this up, and he apologizes and says he'll try to do better, but doesn't.

854,"Imagine asking reddit for advice, well that's where I am at now. 

I dont believe that hard work actually f's you over, but it definitely did in my case. The value I produced didnt get me anything at this job, but trapped. I believe 100% that I didnt do something, or didnt do it the right way, and it resulted in me getting stuck at a low value position for 2 years despite incredible hard work. Please assume everything I say is the truth, and give advice based on what is said. I know it is true and I understand it is impossible to prove it through this medium. Remember I am here for advice. Thank you.

2 years ago I found a great opportunity with great pay, doing something that would truly add value and gain me a start to a decent career. However, I was offered the position, however, ""it had just been filled and in 1 month another position would be available (cause they were expanding)"". I took it and the lower pay being offered to get my foot in the door and prove that I could add value to the business. 

Within my first couple weeks off training, I simply became the ""best at my position"". This sounds arrogant, but these are not my words. It took me months to realise what the shift supervisors really meant, as I had no one to compare to cause evidently I was doing the entire position providing more than could be handled by the bottleneck downline.

This flood of parts naturally created more demand for workers at the downline postions. These jobs offered better work experience and increased pay, which again I was offered, but somehow wasn't able to go to these positions, instead my work helped get others into better positions.

Months passed and I stayed at this entry position that offered little to no real work experience and base pay, all the while keeping tabs when the initial job I desired would open.

I was forcing myself to be a little pushy, and was never negative. I was still in high spirits as I didnt hate my position, but it was obvious that there was no future for me if I remained. So, during the days where I completed all my work and had done a good portion of the next week's work, I would explain to the main supervisors where I was in my work and that it was a good opportunity to get a little bit of training in the position I wanted. Often, I was told some form of ""yes"" and that they will go find someone to help train me and they'll ""be right back"", not to be seen till the next day.

I continued to do my work, I learned more, I got better, I started experimenting with random ideas, which allowed me to produce way more than I even anticipated. I was running 2 positions, which lowered my production on any single position, but since the downline positions were bottlenecks, I could strategically lower my production rate on 1 machine and it allowed me to produce on 2 machines, which I maintained for a long time. 

It was over a year when I started doing this and eventually I had to because I made the positions as efficient as I could and even running 2 machines, I was getting bored. I got so bored I could no longer listen to audiobooks, but instead pulled out my phone and would watch Seinfeld etc during th downtime. 

2 years of exceeding production, finding ways to save literally thousands a month on material cost, having almost no scrap (after the first month I went a full year before having another scrap part), implementing my ideas that helped improved quality and efficiency, offering better solutions to management were I could train someone and they'll be able to keep up within a week etc and I couldn't move anywhere from that position.

Im 30 now, I quit this job 2 months ago and took all my knowledge of these positions with me, sure some of the workers picked up on some things, those few instances they were asked to go back to these positions to help when people whose job it was to underatand production, and didn't/don't, thought it would be necessary.

 Yes, during a plague I quit my job. I saved up over those 2 years, 3 years worth ofcash I would need if I had no source of income and it allowed me the freedom not to waste more of my life.

I am very salty about this job. I took a break from college for the initial opportunity, but I also wanted to earn and see if I was able to produce value. 

My last 2 months at this position I found the previous 15 years production logs and it became very clear what my initial shift supervisor meant (he retired 1 year after I started), I found no one in there who produced more.
For example, on these 2 machines I produced:

Machine1: 2-3 times the amount of others.

Machine2: 4-5 times the amoint of others, except for 1 person who did half my production regularly. 



Note: please in your response assume what I say is true. I know what Ive said here is the absolute truth, whether I come off arrogant, prideful, or whatever, I have only said facts.",09Oct2020,1
855,"I am the co-organizer of a large club, and my fellow co-organizer does almost no work - which leaves me to do almost everything on my own. I’m extremely frustrated with her lack of effort. I’ve tried texting/emailing her about some of her responsibilities that she neglected. She completely ignores my attempts to reach out. When I see her in person or call her, I ask her about the tasks that are being neglected. She switches to “victim mode”, telling me that my questions are “hostile”. So I never get any answers as to why the tasks are being ignored, and she continues to do nothing. I really wish she would just step down so that I could get a REAL co-organizer to work with instead. It would be so nice to have some help, and to work with someone else who actually cares. I think I’m going to need to have a tough conversation with her about these things. The problem is that she is ... kind of clueless. Incredibly enough, she actually believes herself to be doing a wonderful job! She doesn’t have much education or work experience, and doesn’t understand the amount of effort it takes to make things happen. For me, being co-organizer of a club means: “the buck stops here, with me”. For her, it means: “I’ll do a few of the simple tasks. Unless I get busy/distracted and then I’ll bail...” I’ve noticed that she never feels any regret/shame about not doing her assigned tasks, so I don’t know if it’s even possible to get through to her. I feel like a mother talking to an irresponsible teenager when I interact with her. Any advice on how to get her to start making an effort - or to step down?",09Oct2020,1
